      "bodyText": "The acclaimed Russian ballet dancer Vladimir Shklyarov has died aged 39. Shklyarov died after falling from the fifth floor of a building on Saturday, a spokesperson for the Mariinsky Theatre told the news outlet Fontanka at the weekend. The spokesperson, Anna Kasatkina, told Russian media that Shklyarov had been taking painkillers for a back injury and had been scheduled to undergo spinal surgery on Monday. While a federal investigation has been launched to investigate the dancer\u2019s death, \u201cthe preliminary cause\u201d has been ruled an accident, the Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. Born in St Petersburg in 1985, Shklyarov joined Mariinsky Theatre in 2003 and became its principal dancer \u2013 the highest-ranking position in a ballet company \u2013 in 2011. The company called Shklyarov\u2019s death \u201ca huge loss\u201d. \u201cOur condolences to the artist\u2019s family, loved ones, friends and all the numerous admirers of his work and talent \u2026 he forever inscribed his name in the history of world ballet,\u201d it said. Throughout his 20-year career, Shklyarov starred in productions of Swan Lake, Romeo and Juliet, The Sleeping Beauty, Don Quixote and Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s Alice in Wonderland. He performed all over the world, including with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and the Royal Opera House in London. In 2013 he married a fellow Mariinsky Theatre dancer, Maria Shirinkina, with whom he had two children. Shklyarov condemned Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a now-deleted Instagram post from March 2022, declaring his opposition to \u201call kinds of military actions.\u201d \u201cIt is impossible to watch everything that is happening today without tears,\u201d Shklyarov wrote. In contrast to Olga Smirnova, a star ballerina of the Bolshoi Ballet who fled Russia and moved to Europe, Shklyarov continued performing in Russia and refrained from further commenting on the war. Russian dancers paid tribute to Shklyarov after the news of his death broke, with Irina Baranovskaya calling his death \u201ca stupid, unbearable accident\u201d on Telegram. Baranovskaya said Shklyarov \u201cwent out onto the balcony to get some air and smoke\u201d and \u201clost his balance\u201d on the \u201cvery narrow balcony\u201d. A Mariinsky dancer, Diana Vishneva, wrote: \u201cThis tragedy brings only tears and sadnesss \u2026 This is the tragedy for our theatre, our common grief, feeling of emptiness.\u201d \u201cYou were the favourite partner \u2026 My beautiful Romeo, my brave Prince in Cinderella.\u201d American Ballet Theater, where Shklyarov was a guest performer in 2014 and 2015, remembered him on Instagram as \u201can extraordinary artist whose grace and passion inspired audiences worldwide\u201d. \u201cRest in peace, Vladimir.

Richard III was king of England from 1483 until his death in 1485, at the age of 32.

Speaking about the recreation, Langley told Sky News: \u201cWe\u2019ve got leading experts in their fields who have been working on this for 10 years and so everything has been meticulously researched, meticulously evidenced, so you are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, a voice teacher and vocal coach, got involved in the voice project more than 10 years ago to provide after-dinner entertainment comparing Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III with what is known of the real man. \u201cIt fell to me to provide the entertainment,\u201d Morley-Chisholm told BBC News. \u201cAnd I thought, well: \u2018We\u2019re in Leicester, better do something \u2013 haven\u2019t they found that chap under a car park?\u2019 and it started there. \u201cI got two actors along that night.

A team at Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University created an avatar based on a reconstruction of Richard III\u2019s head, led by the craniofacial identification expert professor Caroline Wilkinson. Experts from various fields helped put the pieces of the puzzle together, including speech and language therapy, dentistry, forensic psychology and archaeology. The result of the recreation is that Richard III\u2019s accent sounds more distinctly from Yorkshire than the English spoken by the likes of Ian McKellen and Laurence Olivier when portraying the monarch in the Shakespeare play. Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485. He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty.

Hopkinson has been with the team since 2019, while Dawson joined shortly before the 2022 T20 World Cup. \u201cThey\u2019ve had absolutely huge contributions,\u201d Buttler said of the pair. \u201cI know I speak on behalf of all the players, to say how grateful we are for all the hard work that they\u2019ve put in.\u201d McCullum, whose Test side travelled to New Zealand over the weekend, is due to start his overarching role as England\u2019s all-format head coach on the white-ball tour of India in January. Former England batter Marcus Trescothick has been serving as the men\u2019s white-ball interim head coach during the West Indies tour.",

Nothing though will take 2024 from him, or the decade that took him there, P\u00e9rez\u2019s long journey home. And at least he did get home, if only for a little while. That November day, P\u00e9rez met the challenge, raising a cup and saucer in celebration. The next week, in the derby, he did it again. Then again and again. Seven more times last season and 10 this, in just nine games. He did it the first time he played for Spain and the last time as well, in Copenhagen on Friday, success measured in tea: a symbol of a journey which brought him back to where it all began, in front of his people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/15/england-and-spain-draw-as-respect-shines-through-on-path-to-progress\">England and Spain draw as respect shines through on path to progress</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Sunday night, P\u00e9rez trained with the national team at an open session at the Heliodoro in Santa Cruz, ready for Monday\u2019s meeting there against Switzerland. Home of CD Tenerife and his too, it was the first time he had set foot on <em>his</em> pitch since a second division match against C\u00f3rdoba in the second division in May 2014. There will not be another chance, not now. Virtually the first time he kicked the ball, he felt something in his right hamstring, ruling him out of a game that, he said, talking in the final hours before travelling to the Canaries, \u201cmeans a lot to me \u2026 a moment I dreamed of as a kid.\u201d</p> <p>Football can be cruel, but it has been good to him too. His had been a long way home. P\u00e9rez had not been in Tenerife since he set off for England a decade ago, a journey into the unknown that, he believes, made him the player and person he is.</p> <p>It was 2014 when he left. Some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs were interested but as he said, \u201cI was a kid and had [only] played in <em>segunda</em>\u201d. Liverpool coach Brendan Rodgers, who later signed him for Leicester, hesitated. Newcastle scout Graham Carr convinced his club to pay the clause, getting in ahead of Porto. P\u00e9rez was 20, an islander heading 2,000 miles north and a world away.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s intimidating. I remember the nerves, travelling to England with my brother and agent. I\u2019d never even left Spain before. I had no idea what was out there, what I was going to find. But when you\u2019re a kid, you take on whatever they put in front of you. I was excited, signing for a big club. I watched a lot of Premier League football,\u201d he said, and so he embraced it.</p> <p>He lived in Jesmond then Gosforth, where visitors found the heating always on full-blast and him hanging around the house just in shorts as if back in the Canaries, every Tenerife game put on the telly. His brother Samuel played for Blyth Spartans. Still young, Newcastle were cautious; one day they made P\u00e9rez play for the U21s against Carlisle. He was taken off at half-time, having scored four, Peter Beardsley, the coach, telling Alan Pardew: don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s ready. By the season\u2019s end he had scored against Spurs, Liverpool and Arsenal.</p> <p>\u201cI can still see the flight there, the first few days \u2026 all of it. It was an unforgettable experience,\u201d P\u00e9rez recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, eh.\u201d Nine years he was in England, forged there. There were five seasons at Newcastle, four at Leicester. A relegation and a promotion, a title win in the Championship. Over 300 games. Sixty-three goals. A \u00a333m transfer. An FA Cup winner\u2019s medal. Even a <a href=\"https://x.com/AyozePG/status/1348725459085893644\">comedy series about him</a>. International football though remained out of reach; the list of players ahead of him made some reading, after all. In 2015, he played twice for the U21s, and that was it.</p> <p>Then last spring, in his second season at Betis having returned to Spain, something happened. A <em>corazonada</em>, he calls it; something stirring in his heart. He was playing the best football of his career and across March and April got five goals in as many games, ending the season on nine in La Liga, 11 overall. Maybe being back helped get him noticed, but he was the only one who really saw it and when Betis drew at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u a few days before the Euro 2024 squad was announced, he dared say the quiet part out loud: \u201cI said: \u2018I don\u2019t know, I just have this feeling\u2026\u2019.\u201d</p>    <p>There had been no whispers, no hints? \u201cNo, no, nothing. Zero, zero. Sometimes something appears inside you. And, look, it happened,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cNo one tells you. There\u2019s a pre-list but that\u2019s 60 names. I found out the way everyone did: I saw my name on the list. There were a few seconds shock, then immense happiness.\u201d</p> <p>At 30, he was an international for the first time. Actually going to Germany was a different matter, though. Luis de la Fuente had named a preliminary 29-man squad; three would be left out, P\u00e9rez surely among them.</p> <p>Even after he scored on his debut, a friendly against Andorra, a poll in Marca rated him the most likely to be left at home. \u201cI heard that a lot: it was a given that I would be cut. But the coach said: \u2018You\u2019re here because you\u2019re talented; feel free, liberated, play.\u2019 It was a chance to be at the Euros, and out of nowhere.\u201d</p> <p>And so it was. There was a smile the size of Santa Cruz, that look in his eyes, at the thought of it, the difficulty describing it. \u201cThe <em>hostia</em>,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. The <em>hostia</em> is the consecrated bread, the communion wafer. The absolute business, in other words.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re included in the final squad, the happiness is on the inside, because there are [three] teammates you respect who have to leave. It\u2019s hard for them, missing out at the last moment. There\u2019s a bit of sadness, some pity, but course internally I was so happy. Ten days earlier I\u2019d never been called up in my life; now I was going to the Euros.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/14/spain-england-euro-2024-final-european-championship-football\">Mikel Oyarzabal\u2019s late winner for Spain crushes England\u2019s Euro 2024 dream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not just going, P\u00e9rez laughing at how pretty absurd it all was really. A month later, he was a champion, leaving Berlin with only the third winners\u2019 medal of his life around his neck and two international games under his belt. While an injury limited him to one appearance against Italy, another kept him out last month, and now he has been denied a full homecoming, the gratitude remains and he will return. \u201cI enjoyed every minute,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first call-up and it\u2019s there. I could barely contain my happiness, living it all from the inside.\u201d</p> <p>The <em>selecci\u00f3n</em> is his place now, earned the long way. More of a No 9 than over the past decade, a return to his roots, he has developed a habit for decisive late winners. It helps to be supplied by \u00c1lex Baena \u2013 \u201cwhat an amazing ability he has to find players\u201d, P\u00e9rez said \u2013 and to have joined Villarreal, a team he calls \u201cnice to watch, attacking, that creates lots of chances\u201d. But he has as many goals as his clubmates combined, no one has more per minute in La Liga and no Spaniard anywhere has as many. On Friday, in his fourth Spain game, he scored the opener against Denmark.</p> <p>\u201cMy career has had very good moments, not such good moments, and all that contributes,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in England for years. That has an impact on you, how you see football, the way you play. You develop differently, have a different footballing and personal culture, which can help [the national team]. Now it\u2019s nice to be back in Spain after the time there, which was incredible. Everything happens for a reason; I\u2019m a big believer in that. It\u2019s a process that brings you here. It all comes together, makes you who you are. You\u2019re always learning. You\u2019re shaped by your experiences, and my experience is the Premier League.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been an important, very special year for me. I had a good second half of the season with Betis and a very good start with Villarreal. I got my first call up at 30, straight into the Euros. After so many years, I didn\u2019t know if the chance would ever come. When it does you don\u2019t let go. I had wished for it for so long. And now I\u2019m here again with Spain. After all that, you value it more, appreciate it. It\u2019s just wonderful to be here.\u201d</p> <p>Even if it hurts now, precisely because of where he is. \u201cMany things to make this even more emotional,\u201d P\u00e9rez had said. \u201cThe pride of being European champions, being at the Heliodoro, where my story starts. I\u2019ve been away a long time and haven\u2019t set foot on the pitch there since I left. To go and with the national team \u2026 imagine what that means to me. That was the beginning of a special journey. It\u2019s going to be a unique moment to be in the ground where I grew up, with some of those who were part of it.\u201d</p> <p>Spain haven\u2019t played in Tenerife for 28 years and no Canarian has ever scored for them in the islands, another challenge laid before him as he returned a decade on. Instead, injury hit just as it seemed it was time to pop the kettle on again, but P\u00e9rez will be back.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Time to call it a night. It\u2019s been a soggy end to a sparky series, an unfitting send-off for three coaches \u2013 the interim boss Marcus Trescothick, who, like Lee Carsley, will now hand over to a more lasting successor, plus the fielding coach Carl Hopkinson and the spin-bowling coach Richard Dawson. But they can all get on the plane tomorrow knowing that they have turned things round after a disappointing ODI series. England\u2019s T20 team are back in business. Next up, in just ten days, the Test team begin a series in New Zealand. Thanks for your company, correspondence and helpful corrections when I got my own Blue Sky handle wrong (eye-roll emoji). Hoping to see you over there, and back here before long. And here\u2019s another softly-spoken captain \u2013 the winning one. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted,\u201d says Jos Buttler. \u201cI thought we played some brilliant cricket early on, started all the games well. Saqib Mahmood set the tone in all those games and [we had] lots of different guys chipping in\u2026 In all the formats, there\u2019s a real nice stock of fast bowlers.\u201d Asked about captaining from the outfield, he says: \u201cI really enjoyed it, running around.\u201d Here\u2019s Rovman Powell, the losing captain. For such a powerful man, he has a very soft voice, although he doesn\u2019t pull his punches. \u201cThe bowling group,\u201d he says, \u201cneed to sharpen up on a few areas\u2026 A lot of credit to Jos and his team \u2013 they\u2019re really coming to the Caribbean and learning fast.\u201d Eight of Saqib\u2019s nine wickets came in the Powerplay. \u201cReally happy about it,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a group we spoke beforehand \u2013 to have that mindset looking to take wickets the whole time\u2026 One thing I noticed coming here before was the cross-winds.\u201d Which meant he had to work on his away-swing (to the right-hander), as Jofra Archer and Reece Topley were coming in from the other end with their inswing. Favourite moment of the series? \u201cWinning it.\u201d That\u2019s a team player\u2019s answer, as he wasn\u2019t on the field at the time. Time for the presentations. Indoors, for obvious reasons. Tye player of the series is \u2026 Saqib Mahmood. What a comeback. Until tonight, it\u2019s been an entertaining series and a satisfying one for England. They pulled off an upset with a line-up that had, as Micky Stewart once said in these parts, \u201ca lot of inexperience\u201d. Jos Buttler returned as captain after a long lay-off and did very well, winning one match with the bat and showing more ingenuity with his field placings from his new vantage point at mid-on, slip, long-on or wherever his excellent fielding was needed. Jacob Bethell confirmed the suspicion that he\u2019s a rising star. Sam Curran and Liam Livingstone showed their class. Jamie Overton and Rehan Ahmed chipped in with big wickets. Saqib Mahmood joined Jofra Archer in the best new-ball pairing since we last saw Chris Woakes in this format. England have the leading wicket-taker in the series, Saqib Mahmood (nine for 95, a triumphant return) and the leading run-scorer, Phil Salt (162). They also have the best economy rate (6.24 from Jamie Overton, sealed by his five-run over tonight) and the highest batting average (127 by Jacob Bethell, who seems to have the priceless ability to rattle along without giving his wicket away). But West Indies have the highest strike rate by a top-six batter (Shai Hope with 200 \u2013 he made 72 off only 36 balls), and the most sixes by an individual (Rovman Powell with 11, one more than Salt). The whole thing has indeed been called off. So England win the series 3-1. And this becomes the first of the five games in which winning the toss, as England did, has not meant winning the game. There are now lakes on the outfield. Let\u2019s call the whole thing off. One day, rain delays will be like reviews and we\u2019ll all be able to eavesdrop on the deliberations of the umpires. For now, we can only gasp in awe at the unsinkable optimism of Leslie Reifer and Gregory Brathwaite. When TNT goes back to the ground, it looks worse than ever. Grey, bleak and above all wet. At the risk of being unduly gloomy, I\u2019ll be surprised if another ball is bowled. In other news, Great Britain have beaten Canada to reach the semis of the Billie Jean King Cup. In the immortal words of Edith Sitwell (and Bryan Ferry), still falls the rain. As TNT gives us a glimpse of the ground, the floodlights are glowing out of a pewter sky. I wish I had better news. \u201cStadiums and stands,\u201d says Tim Sanders. \u201cNever mind Daren Sammy and his stadium. Sam Northeast came on loan to Yorkshire, and there was already a stand named after him.\u201d Ha. As the rain continues to fall on Gros Islet, the third umpire has announced the cut-off time. It will be 7.48pm over there, which is 11.48pm in the UK. A fair old time to wait for five overs. Another skeet! Blue Sky is clearly taking off \u2013 not content with picking up a million new accounts on Friday, and another million on Saturday, it has now played its part in two posts on the OBO. \u201cHi Tim,\u201d says Sam Dolan. \u201cWhat do you think of the recent trend where England\u2019s footballers now sound like elite teams of lawyers (Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Morgan Gibbs-White), but England\u2019s openers (Phil Salt, Will Jacks) sound like the kind of solid blokes who could get your nan\u2019s Fiat Uno through one last MOT.\u201d I think that\u2019s a great line. It\u2019s still raining, sad to say. It\u2019s possible that West Indies\u2019 innings is already over. If so, according to our friends at Cricinfo, England\u2019s target \u2013 assuming the palyers get back out again \u2013 will be 69. Off 30 balls\u2026 even Phil Salt might be daunted by that. A fish-eye lens shows us the state of the Daren Sammy Stadium. Stadiums are like policemen \u2013 they\u2019re getting younger. Sammy is still only 40 and he\u2019s already been a stadium for eight years. More importantly, there\u2019s a tinge of blue now in the sky above the ground. Time for some cheese. It\u2019s a hard rain, too \u2013 white stripes of water on the screen. On TNT they go back to the studio for a bit of chat. \u201cAnother belting wicket,\u201d says Jason Roy. \u201cI think England will be pretty happy with that.\u201d My far less expert view is that I\u2019m not quite so sure. Yes, there\u2019s been less carnage than last night, when it was 56-0 at this stage \u2013 but T20s are often governed by wickets taken in the Powerplay and after five overs, for all their moral victories, England haven\u2019t got one. 5th over: West Indies 44-0 (Lewis 29, Hope 14) Well, I did say there were records to be broken. What I didn\u2019t foresee was that West Indies would be gunning for the record for the most mistimed pulls played with impunity in a T20 international Powerplay. As Turner changes ends, Lewis fluffs yet another pull and gets a single as the ball drops harmlessly in the wilderness outside the ring. After that, West Indies start playing properly. Hope swings over midwicket for four, then Lewis, at last, nails that pull and gets six for it. Suddenly remembering the record they\u2019re after, he goes back to mistiming and picks up another four. Turner, who may be mildly incensed, bowls another short ball which raps Lewis on the helmet. Happily, he seems to be OK. That\u2019s 16 off the over \u2026 and now it\u2019s raining. 4th over: West Indies 28-0 (Lewis 18, Hope 9) Seeing all these lifters trouble the openers, Buttler takes Turner off and summons Jamie Overton, who is more of a bang-it-in merchant. Again Lewis is unconvincing, and again he gets off scot-free as a mistimed pull goes for four over mid-on. Yet another pull, a better one, nearly goes for four but ends up being just a single as Sam Curran scampers around the boundary and flicks it to Jacob Bethell. A good start from JOverton. 3rd over: West Indies 23-0 (Lewis 13, Hope 9) Much better from Lewis, who muscles Archer\u2019s first ball from a good length over the rope at long-on for the first six of the day. Still good from Archer, who draws yet another false shot with his bumper, from Hope this time. It\u2019s a swirling top edge that sails away for four because fine leg is up in the circle. Archer responds with a rueful smile. Eleven off the over, so that\u2019s the first skyscraper in West Indies\u2019 Manhattan. It won\u2019t be the last. 2nd over: West Indies 12-0 (Lewis 6, Hope 5) At the other end it\u2019s John Turner. Buttler and Marcus Trescothick have shown some faith in him and it will be intriguing to see if he can repay it. He\u2019s got the pace and when he finds some movement too he beats Lewis outside off. But then he gets blasted for four, on the up, past mid-off, by Shai Hope, who was in fearsome form last night. 1st over: West Indies 6-0 (Lewis 5, Hope 0) Evin Lewis nearly perishes second ball! He opts to pull a lifter that\u2019s too far outside off and thick-edges it over first slip, where not even Jamie Overton can reach it. He gets four for that, followed by a single for another false shot, also a pull \u2013 a leading edge that squirts into the covers. And then he gets away with a third edge as a failed swish sends the ball into the ground before it goes through to Phil Salt. Archer, as so often lately, is looking good without getting his just deserts. The players are out there, under grey skies. Jofra Archer has the new ball. A skeet! \u201c@timdelisle.bsky.social,\u201d says Smylers. \u201cHello. Nice to find you on here! That involved ignoring both the first dot and the \u2018lue\u2019 from the handle you posted on the OBO \u2014 you might wanna tweak to make it easier for others?\u201d Oh God, sorry. Take Smylers\u2019 word for it, not mine. And yes I will tweak it, thanks. An email! \u201cDisappointing team selection for England,\u201d scoffs Tom Stock. \u201dIf ever there was a time for Salt and Pepper this was it\u2026\u201d Looking at those teams, you wonder how on earth England have won this series. As well as home advantage, West Indies have more experience and greater firepower. One answer is that England won the first three tosses, opting to chase every time. Another is that their runs have been distributed very efficiently. Phil Salt won the first game with a rip-roaring hundred; Jos Buttler won the second by shaking off the rust with a beautifully judged 83. When those two big guns went silent in the the third game, Sam Curran and Liam Livingstone rose to the occasion and did just enough to secure the series. Jacob Bethell has been good too, and the quicks have bowled very well, but it\u2019s the senior batters and allrounders who have bossed the chase. West Indies 1 Evin Lewis, 2 Shai Hope, 3 Nicholas Pooran (wkt), 4 Rovman Powell (capt), 5 Shimron Hetmyer, 6 Roston Chase, 7 Sherfane Rutherford, 8 Romario Shepherd, 9 Akeal Hosein, 10 Gudakesh Motie, 11 Alzarri Joseph. England 1 Phil Salt (wkt), 2 Will Jacks, 3 Jos Buttler (capt), 4 Jacob Bethell, 5 Sam Curran, 6 Liam Livingstone, 7 Jamie Overton, 8 Rehan Ahmed, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 John Turner. After turning the tide last night, West Indies stick with ten of their XI. The only change is Romario Shepherd coming in for Obed McCoy, which shortens the tail. England show they mean business by bringing back their two senior bowlers, Adil Rashid and Jofra Archer. They replace Dan Mousley and Saqib Mahmood, so we won\u2019t see Mahmood and Archer sharing the new ball. But we will see Rashid and Rehan Ahmed bowling leg-breaks and googlies \u2013 the sorcerer and his apprentice. Jos Buttler calls right \u2013 and goes with the flow of this series. Every game has been won by the side batting second. Evening everyone and welcome to the fifth act of another sporting drama. Some might say it was a dead rubber, but they would be missing the point. In a sport that loves its records the way cricket does, rubbers never die. Any of the 22 players could post a career-best tonight, score a hundred, grab a four-for or do something that hasn\u2019t been done before in nearly 20 years of T20 internationals. And, as we saw last night, the competitive juices will still flow. England could go home glowing with satisfaction after a resounding 4-1 win, or lose again and leave West Indies on a roll. It\u2019s not all to play for, but there\u2019s still enough: pride, a place in the team, and of course entertainment \u2013 the chance to fire up new fans or put a smile on the faces of the older ones. It\u2019s the last game in charge for Marcus Trescothick, cricket\u2019s answer to Lee Carsley, though he will stay on as an assistant coach when Brendon McCullum becomes the overall supremo. It\u2019s also the final fling with the white-ball squad for two lower-profile England coaches, Carl Hopkinson (fielding) and Richard Dawson (spin bowling). Both were there in Australia when England won the T20 World Cup two years ago, and Hopkinson had also been part of the group that lifted the 50-over World Cup on home soil in 2019 \u2013 when some smart fielding, by Jason Roy and Jos Buttler, played rather a vital role in the d\u00e9nouement. Dawson and Hopkinson are already guaranteed to go out with a series win, but you suspect Buttler will be itching to give them one last victory to go with their leaving cards. Play starts at 8pm GMT, and I\u2019ll be back soon after 7.30 with news of the toss and the teams. If you\u2019re on Blue Sky, as the Guardian is now, do send me a skeet! @tim.delisle.bsky.social",

Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been pursuing a thawing of relations with the world\u2019s second-largest economy on pragmatic grounds, suggesting that the UK cannot achieve its growth ambitions without better terms with China. But the move to deepen ties is likely to be controversial among human rights groups and backbenchers, and with several high-profile Conservative MPs who have had sanctions imposed on them by China. Tom Tugendhat and Alicia Kearns, both prominent Tory critics of China, called on Starmer to use the meeting to raise with Xi the plight of UK nationals including Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy media owner detained and tried in Hong Kong. Starmer will meet the Chinese president on Monday in Rio de Janeiro at the G20 summit, a meeting of world leaders that is likely to be marked by divisions over the climate crisis and Ukraine. No British prime minister has met Xi since Theresa May visited Beijing in 2018 in the midst of a trade push during Brexit negotiations, though Boris Johnson spoke to the Chinese president during the pandemic. Since then, relations have significantly cooled because of cyber threats, a human rights crackdown in Hong Kong and the sanctions against British MPs. Rishi Sunak attempted to renew relations at the G20 summit in 2022 where a bilateral was planned but cancelled due to Ukraine developments. But Conservative leaders have toyed with designating China a threat to British security \u2013 stronger language than the US had used. Those to have had Chinese sanctions imposed upon them include Tugendhat, the former security minister; Nusrat Ghani, the Commons deputy speaker; and Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader. Tugendhat said: \u201cJimmy Lai \u2013 a British citizen \u2013 is being put on a show trial in Hong Kong.

Amid a battle between the government and the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) over what proportion of farms could be affected by the change, announced in last month\u2019s budget, Starmer said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that the overwhelming majority of farmers would be exempt. But the prime minister, speaking to reporters on his way to the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, suggested this message may not be getting through, adding it was \u201cimportant for us to keep communicating how that works\u201d. Ministers have argued that the change will prevent some investors from avoiding inheritance tax by investing in farmland, much of which is often then barely used to produce anything. A Labour analysis has shown a big recent growth in wealthy individuals and institutions buying up farmland across England, with a parallel drop in the amount of agricultural land actively used for farming. While in 2010, such non-farmers were responsible for less than a third of farmland purchases, by last year this had risen to 56%, according to data collected by the property consultants Strutt &amp; Parker. According to official statistics for agricultural land use, in the last year alone, 400,000 hectares (988,422 acres) was taken out of use for farming. The analysis is linking this to financial advice that recommends the potential tax breaks of investing in farmland. A Labour source said the party was \u201casking rich estates and farms with the highest values to pay their fair share\u201d, with the money used to pay for public services that rural communities relied on.

It has taken the unusual step of releasing a partial transcript of the conversation it said one of its officers had, taken from body-worn video footage. According to this police transcript, one of the officers said: \u201cIt\u2019s gone down as an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online.

Tino Livramento made his debut at right-back and Lewis Hall was handed his first start at left-back.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe spoke about not only gaining promotion from the Nations League but to potentially increase the pool of players Thomas has got to choose from,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cThe challenge now for the players that have been involved for the last three camps is to be in and around the March squad. A lot of them have done themselves a lot of good. Gaining a cap is no mean feat.\u201d</p> \n<p>Carsley will conduct a handover with Tuchel before returning to his primary role as manager of the under-21s. \u201cI\u2019m trying to put together, with the rest of the staff, a debrief on all three camps,\u201d he said. \u201cI will put together a document, then hopefully meet him and present what we think and what we\u2019ve found. The job for us as an under-21 staff is to support the senior manager as much as we can, find out what he needs and how we can help. I\u2019m really comfortable with that role. I\u2019m looking forward to meeting him now in the next few weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the most pleasing things is the way that the senior players have reacted to a new coach, even though it was from a short-term point of view. We\u2019ve tried to change the style. There\u2019s been no resistance to that.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important that myself and the staff now spend a good couple of days thinking about the three camps and what we could have done better.

It\u2019s definitely a lonely place in that dugout when you\u2019re not winning at Wembley.\u201d</p> \n<p>Carsley was asked if he would be interested in the senior role again. \u201cI think the positive thing is that we\u2019ve shown as a staff that we can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a positive thing when you have coaches in the building that are capable.

The 50-year-old has used the Nations League campaign to blood a host of youngsters and the growing talent pool was clear as England, who could begin 2026 World Cup qualifying in March, clinched top spot in Group B2 by demolishing 10-man Ireland. \u201cIt\u2019s a job that deserves an elite coach with a track record of winning and Thomas has got that,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cThe bonus would be we\u2019ve increased the pool of players. The next squad will be a real challenge to pick, I\u2019m sure. Exciting times ahead.\u201d The win ensures Tuchel will not have a Nations League playoff in March, although the schedule depends on how next month\u2019s World Cup qualifying draw plays out. Harry Kane opened the scoring from the spot after returning to the starting lineup and there were first international goals for Anthony Gordon, Jarrod Bowen, Taylor Harwood-Bellis and Conor Gallagher. Tino Livramento made his debut at right-back and Lewis Hall was handed his first start at left-back. \u201cWe spoke about not only gaining promotion from the Nations League but to potentially increase the pool of players Thomas has got to choose from,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cThe challenge now for the players that have been involved for the last three camps is to be in and around the March squad. A lot of them have done themselves a lot of good. Gaining a cap is no mean feat.\u201d Carsley will conduct a handover with Tuchel before returning to his primary role as manager of the under-21s. \u201cI\u2019m trying to put together, with the rest of the staff, a debrief on all three camps,\u201d he said. \u201cI will put together a document, then hopefully meet him and present what we think and what we\u2019ve found. The job for us as an under-21 staff is to support the senior manager as much as we can, find out what he needs and how we can help. I\u2019m really comfortable with that role. I\u2019m looking forward to meeting him now in the next few weeks. \u201cOne of the most pleasing things is the way that the senior players have reacted to a new coach, even though it was from a short-term point of view. We\u2019ve tried to change the style. There\u2019s been no resistance to that. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that myself and the staff now spend a good couple of days thinking about the three camps and what we could have done better. I\u2019m still gutted about the Greece game at home. Even though we\u2019ve won five of the six, I straight away go to the game that I think we should have won at Wembley. It\u2019s definitely a lonely place in that dugout when you\u2019re not winning at Wembley.\u201d Carsley was asked if he would be interested in the senior role again. \u201cI think the positive thing is that we\u2019ve shown as a staff that we can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a positive thing when you have coaches in the building that are capable. The relief of getting promotion is a big thing, so maybe in a couple of days I\u2019ll look back at it and think it\u2019s been quite enjoyable.\u201d",

It is the first time Biden has given Kyiv permission to use long-range weapons inside Russia but their use will be limited to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia in the summer. Kyiv announced nationwide energy rationing from Monday after Moscow\u2019s biggest drone and missile attack in months on Ukraine\u2019s energy grid on Sunday. US officials briefed that the weapons would be used against Russian and North Korean troops deployed against Ukrainian forces in Russia\u2019s Kursk region \u2013 and was intended to send a message to North Korea \u2013 though Biden may authorise their use elsewhere during his remaining two months in the White House.

Last month, North Korea sent an estimated 10,000 troops to Russia to participate in the Ukraine war, the first time Pyongyang has been prepared to use ground forces since the end of the Korean war in 1953. They have since been positioned in Kursk and preparing to join with Russian troops in a counterattack against in joint force whose strength is estimated at 50,000. Other reports, based on Ukrainian intelligence briefings, have suggested that North Korea could be willing to send as many as 100,000 troops if the alliance between the two countries strengthens, at a time when Kyiv is struggling to mobilise more people to join the war. Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said about 120 missiles and 90 drones were fired into Ukraine that morning in a nationwide attack he described as the work of \u201cRussian terrorists\u201d. The attack was the largest missile and drone assault on Ukraine since August and the first big Russian assault since the US election, showing the Kremlin in little mood to compromise after Trump\u2019s victory.

If that means me [leaving] I\u2019m comfortable with that.\u201d Gatland returned nearly two years ago after Wayne Pivac\u2019s dismissal and offered to resign in March after Wales lost to Italy in the Six Nations. He previously stepped down after the 2019 Rugby World Cup, when Wales were narrowly beaten by South Africa in the semi-finals, and has been hampered since by multiple retirements, unavailable players and injuries. Asked if he has the \u201cstomach\u201d to continue, Gatland said: \u201cAbsolutely. I do it because I love being involved in the game. I\u2019ve got so many good memories of my time with Wales. I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve achieved in the past. \u201cIt is challenging at the moment. I\u2019m only human. I did ask myself a few times if I\u2019m doing the right thing. But I definitely still want to be a part of it \u2026 You\u2019ve got to dig in, don\u2019t you? You\u2019ve got to show to some mental resilience and toughness and dig in.\u201d The Wallabies head coach, Joe Schmidt, expressed sympathy for his compatriot. \u201cWe were talking before the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shrugged our shoulders at the end of it and said: \u2018Who\u2019d want to be a coach?\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s tough for the Welsh players. I could see how hard they were working. The way they built their way back into the game at 19-13 - that\u2019s admirable stuff. They probably just needed a couple of breaks.\u201d With next summer\u2019s British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia looming, Schmidt said: \u201cIt\u2019s about galvanising the nation \u2026 Obviously I\u2019d be pretty good friends with Faz [Lions head coach Andy Farrell]. We worked together for a while and I know him well. That will be challenging because he\u2019s a very good coach. Outside of a World Cup you can\u2019t get bigger than the Lions.\u201d",

Wynne, the most entertaining dancer left in the competition, leaves. Pete, who had a terrible dance, remains in the competition. That, sadly, is the nature of the competition. Chris is surely going to win the final, as, even though he isn\u2019t the best dancer, won\u2019t ever be voted out, and will win the public vote in the final.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sueserafin</strong>a says: \u201cWell, if he was forced screaming into a pair of louche, pink, PVC trews, Pete has had the last laugh.\u201d</p> <p><strong>BorisHawHaw</strong> says: \u201cPete still in thanks to \u2018the public vote\u2019. I recall that John Sergeant, realising that people were voting for him and that meant better dancers were being voted off, decided to quit. Too much to hope that the reality star, craving publicity, will do the same despite constantly saying \u2018I don\u2019t deserve to be here\u2019.

She made her name in her debut series nine years ago by making a cult hero out of <strong>Ed \u201cGlitter\u201d Balls</strong>. Since then, she\u2019s carved out a reputation as the troupe\u2019s most creative choreographer, working magic with all abilities and body types - from dad-dancers like <strong>Tony Adams </strong>to glitterball winner <strong>Joe McFadden</strong>. Frustratingly, last year\u2019s partner<strong> Nigel Harman</strong> was forced to drop out with injury when he looked a potential finalist.</p> <p>She worked wonders again with <strong>Wynne Evans</strong>. Katya choreographed numbers to exploit his innate musicality, desire to entertain and ability to sell a dance. She gave him intense, challenging routines, packed with daring lifts and tricks, but drilled him hard and he handled them well. Having exited mid-series again, the ever-competitive Katya might persuade producers that she\u2019s due a good \u2019un next time.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-17T20:29:44.850Z\">at 8.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-673a4c388f08462ddd0c6e49\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-17T20:05:43.864Z\">8.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wynne never quite recovered from \u201chandgate\u201d</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As a 52-year-old with a self-described \u201cdad bod\u201d, nobody had terribly high hopes for <strong>Wynne Evans </strong>coming into the contest. The opera singer and BBC Radio Wales presenter proved one of this year\u2019s surprise packages. His natural musicality, tight timing, charismatic performances and quick feet made him a fixture towards the top of the leaderboard, at times recalling 2020 glitterball winner <strong>Bill Bailey</strong>.</p> <p>A month into the contest, however, came the hand incident, aka \u201dGrope Compare\u201d. Wynne\u2019s dance partner <strong>Katya Jones </strong>brushed his hand away as he put it around her waist in the Clauditorium, before snubbing his attempted high-five. The couple later insisted it was an in-joke but not before BBC-bashers pounced, linking it to Strictly\u2019s summer of scandal and claiming the franchise was permanently tarnished.</p> <p>Understandably affected by the negative headlines, Wynne suddenly became self-conscious, reining in his rapid-fire wit. His confidence dipped and scores flatlined. The judges haven\u2019t scored him below 30 points since way back in week one but over the past month, he only notched a single nine. Consigned to consecutive dance-offs, Wynne saw off <strong>Shayne Ward</strong> but was deservedly defeated by <strong>Montell Douglas</strong>.</p> <p>His best bits were that Mrs Doubtfire cha cha, his money-themed tango, Mr Blue Sky quickstep (complete with bird poo) and that surprise singing crescendo to his Shirley Bassey rumba. Not a bad highlight reel but Wynne - and certainly Katya - might believe he could have lasted a week or two more. Ah well. Back to the Go.Compare ads it is.

TOWIE alumnus <strong>Pete Wicks</strong> is still yet to appear in the dance-off. He can once again thank public support (and pink slack enthusiasts) for making it to Blackpool, let alone beyond. His fanbase means he was in the top half popularity-wise, according to online polls, despite being bottom of the scoreboard.</p> <p>He was poorly served by last night\u2019s routine. The male stripper theme and camp day-glo mood was more hen party than ballroom. He was upstaged by those eye-wateringly tight pink PVC trousers, which the panel, <strong>Shirley Ballas</strong> in particular, obsessed over. Pete clearly wasn\u2019t happy being the novelty act and it felt a bit like a production stitch-up. His attire attracted more judgely comments than his dancing but Pete\u2019s performance was pretty poor. He barely danced a step, instead striking poses while pro partner <strong>Jowita Przystal </strong>and the backing dancers cha-cha-ed around him.</p> <p>A score of 27 points, four fewer than second-from-bottom Wynne, was actually generous. Did that dance deserve eights from Shirley and Anton? Of course not. Craig giving him a four was more like it. With his deadpan humour and have-a-go pluck, Pete is highly likeable but if he sees off many more superior hoofers, it will start to feel unfair.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-17T20:38:40.101Z\">at 8.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-673a4b5f8f08916386e23f7c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-17T20:01:31.166Z\">8.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wynne and Katya\u2019s last dance</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The eliminated couple take a final twirl around the Tower Ballroom floor to Waiting For A Star To Fall by Boys Meets Girl (banger).</p> <p>The credits roll as their castmates crowd around for backslaps.

Jamie relishing (pardon the sauce pun) chance to be a showman, really selling it. Kicks, flicks and side-by-side sections are super-sharp and tasty. Keen as mustard. Dollops of fun and terrific dancing too. Condiments come no higher.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>The Ketchup Song by Las Ketchup.

His pro partner Lauren Oakley has competed here since childhood, winning titles along the way, but this is her first time with a celebrity partner on Strictly. An energetic routine that\u2019s as much fun as the song and perfectly suited to the sprung floor.

All week he\u2019s been grumbling about this striptease routine, insisting he\u2019s \u201cless Magic Mike, more Tragic Pete\u201d. He\u2019s playing a Blackpool tram conductor, arriving on a party bus with passengers in hot pink PVC. Well, Strictly is never knowingly under-camp. Takes forever to start dancing but those trousers try to compensate. The contest\u2019s lowest scoring dance on average, the cha-cha-cha is technically tricky. He needs straight legs, to keep it compact and contained, transferring his body weight while maintaining timing. He\u2019s striking poses and lacking fluidity. Flat-footed and off-the beat but game for a laugh and decent partnering skills. A hen do of a dance.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>I\u2019m Too Sexy by Right Said Fred.

Wynne Evans has admitted that, as an 18-stone chap, training has been tough on his knees but the bouncy Tower Ballroom floor will help. It\u2019s more of a dramatic Charleston than a kooky one, putting a dance twist on the opera Carmen. Risky lifts and plenty of tricks. Fan-ography and a hobby horse (as opposed to a hobby Blackpool donkey). Razzle-dazzle choreography by the ever-creative Katya Jones. Craig will have his eyes trained on that all-important swivel, of course, and it\u2019s a bit heavy-footed but bags of characterisation and excellent entertainment value.

Well, the spiritual home of ballroom dancing dates back to 1894 and positively oozes with hoofing history. As the home of Strictly\u2019s mothership show, Come Dancing, and host to international competitions, it means a lot to the professionals and judges.</p> <p>The room itself is full of baroque Victorian splendour. Crystal chandeliers hang from a high ceiling, with tiered balconies and carved panelling. With a full crowd, the atmosphere in there is electric. The famous sprung dancefloor is several times bigger than the familiar Elstree Studios ballroom, hence the use of backing dancers, props and production tricks to fill the cavernous space.</p> <p>In <strong>Strictly\u2019s 20th year</strong>, tonight marks the show\u2019s <strong>15th visit to Blackpool</strong>. It\u2019s a landmark weekend which always adds extra sparkle. Who will rise to the big occasion in these storied surroundings? We\u2019ll get our first clues in <strong>25 minutes</strong>\u2026</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6738d7668f08462ddd0c649c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-16T18:15:45.264Z\">6.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Who will illuminate the Blackpool dancefloor?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Tower Ballroom demands a towering performance. We\u2019re set for a rollercoaster night of dancing - but nobody wants a big dip in their scores. </p> <p>Good evening and welcome to week nine of <strong>Strictly Come Dancing 2024</strong>. I\u2019m Michael, your Pleasure Beach buddy for tonight\u2019s special live show. I\u2019d love you to watch along with me as eight surviving couples take the trip 200 miles north to the fabled home of ballroom.</p> <p>Last weekend saw just a seven-point margin between the top and bottom of the scoreboard, followed by only the second split judges\u2019 decision of the seres. Yes, the hoofing contest is getting as tight as <strong>Vito Coppola</strong>\u2019s trousers as it enters its home stretch. It proved third dance-off unlucky for <strong>Shayne Ward </strong>and <strong>Nancy Xu</strong>, who were narrowly eliminated.</p> <p>Our eight remaining pro-celebrity pairings now make the annual pilgrimage to Strictly\u2019s spiritual home. As always, tonight\u2019s scores will be combined with the public vote. The bottom two duos will perform again for survival on Sunday night. <strong>Wynne Evans</strong> and <strong>Pete Wicks</strong> look most at risk but it\u2019s all to dance for. </p> <p>With the venue\u2019s famed sprung floor and backing dancers to help fill out the bigger space, we can expect routines with extra razzle-dazzle. It\u2019s <strong>showtime at 6.45pm on BBC One</strong>. I\u2019ll be <strong>liveblogging from 6.15pm</strong>, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis and reaction, plus plenty of salt and vinegar. So grab yourself a chippy tea (well, it is Blackpool weekend) and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa.</p> <p>As always, I\u2019d love to <strong>hear from you</strong> too. You can <strong>tweet me</strong> @michaelhogan, <strong>email me</strong> michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and <strong>the comments section </strong>below is open for Blackpool business. I\u2019ll ride my donkey down there from time to time to see what you\u2019re all saying and report on your reactions.</p> <p>The Blackpool special is one of the biggest nights in Strictly calendar. But who will be a bright light in Lancs Vegas and who\u2019ll be a seaside washout? It\u2019s nearly time to staaaart seaside dancing!</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for watching along with me, Tower Ballroom buddies. Our magnificent seven now progress to the 10th live show, back in the familiar surroundings of Elstree Studios. The dancefloor might be smaller and not sprung but as well as their usual routines, they\u2019ll all be tackling the Samba-thon in a bid to make it through to Musicals Week. It airs next Saturday at the slightly later time of 7.05pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to see who\u2019s suffering a Blackpool hangover. In the meantime, as is always the case: keeeeep dancing! Have a lovely week and see you back in the usual ballroom. Goodnight, everyone. Finally, SecretPuddleJumper says: \u201cI really hope this doesn\u2019t knock Montell\u2019s confidence. She really does deserve to be there and people, I\u2019m assuming, voting en masse not to see Pete\u2019s awful dance again is not a reflection on her. Personally I\u2019m baffled she\u2019s in the bottom 2. She got all my votes and that should count for something, dammit. This must be how a Democrat female feels in America.\u201d ReclinedPotato says: \u201cWynne has been a super contestant, it\u2019s nice to see an older larger man do so well in the competition, I\u2019m sure Wynne\u2019s Wonderful Wales (TM) is in the TV works as we admire his lovely calves.\u201d emilyscatnaps adds: \u201cThat\u2019s some way to go out, though\u2026 Knackered.\u201d NonIronLady says: \u201cWynne is pleased to be out, having heard that he\u2019d be wearing the pink pleather for a high-kicking tango/can-can mash-up next week.\u201d MartGray says: \u201cIs this the first year the physios have been pretty much at the top of the credits?\u201d YodaKnowsAll says: \u201cIt\u2019s probably fair for Wynne to go. Pete not being in the DO is a travesty imho.\u201d GreenAppleRedApple says: \u201cHand-gate reference in the last dance? Oh that\u2019s me definitely convinced it was all a hilarious joke\u2026\u201d whistledownthewind adds: \u201cThe right couple are through I feel. That said, well done Wynne for being an entertaining and enthusiastic celeb this season. One last time \u2018Go Compaaaare!\u2019\u201d Strictlylounging says: \u201cLooking at how they\u2019re messing about on the floor, it\u2019s clear they get on, despite all the \u2018handgate\u2019 rumblings.\u201d Saltaire1703 says: \u201cCraig\u2019s analysis of Pete\u2019s inability to dance was spot-on. He shouldn\u2019t be in this stage of a dance competition.\u201d TeeDubyaBee adds: \u201cTess asked Wynne if he minded if she left early and he replied \u2018go, comp\u00e8re\u2019.\u201d Gardener_Maidhc says: \u201cAnother week down and I think the right decision was made with Wynne going. Did like him but the dancing hadn\u2019t improved for a few weeks. Next week we have a samba-thon. Putting in an early plea for single fixed camera angle during the dance so we can see all the couples at once rather than chopping and changing leaving us dizzy and with half the dancing missed off screen.\u201d shazza2704 says: \u201cWell , unless The Cure turn up next week with Robert Smith wearing full-on Chanel Rouge around his chops , Pet Shop Boys have to be the best opener / filler ever in SCD history.\u201d DGPHOK adds: \u201cDa iawn Wynne. You\u2019ll be missed.\u201d A swift vox pop of your Blackpool thoughts. FlowerOfScotland1966 says: \u201cVery frustrating. Wynne, the most entertaining dancer left in the competition, leaves. Pete, who had a terrible dance, remains in the competition. That, sadly, is the nature of the competition. Chris is surely going to win the final, as, even though he isn\u2019t the best dancer, won\u2019t ever be voted out, and will win the public vote in the final.\u201d Sueserafina says: \u201cWell, if he was forced screaming into a pair of louche, pink, PVC trews, Pete has had the last laugh.\u201d BorisHawHaw says: \u201cPete still in thanks to \u2018the public vote\u2019. I recall that John Sergeant, realising that people were voting for him and that meant better dancers were being voted off, decided to quit. Too much to hope that the reality star, craving publicity, will do the same despite constantly saying \u2018I don\u2019t deserve to be here\u2019. Kind of makes a mockery of it really being a dance show.\u201d MikeMoonlight adds: \u201cTess Daly: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, let\u2019s all give Wynne &amp; Katya a warm hand on their exit!\u2019 BBC producer shouting from the gallery: \u2018For crying out loud, let\u2019s not open up THAT can of worms again...\u2019.\u201d TV viewers can now flip to ITV1 for The Girls Aloud Show: Live at the O2. At 9pm, it\u2019s the I\u2019m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! launch show on ITV1, with Strictly\u2019s own Oti Mabuse among those entering the jungle, Wolf Hall: The Mirror &amp; The Light on BBC1 or Tsunami 2004: The Day the Wave Hit on Channel 4. If you\u2019re in the mood for a film, tonight\u2019s picks are Four Weddings &amp; A Funeral (9pm on BBC3), Ordeal By Innocence (9pm on Sky Arts) or Martin Scorsese\u2019s Made in England: The Films of Powell &amp; Pressburger (10pm on BBC2). Is it raining? I hadn\u2019t noticed. Wynne Evans\u2019 exit makes it two consecutive eliminated males, after Shayne Ward departed the dancefloor last week. Our final seven now comprises three celebrity females and four men. If Pete Wicks was to depart next week - just to pick a random example - we\u2019d have a neat three-all gender split for the quarter-final. Just saying. This should have been an all-male dance-off. Pete Wicks, Jamie Borthwick or even JB Gill should have faced Wynne in the dance-off. However, they all got more public votes than the unlucky Montell Douglas. A fortnight ago, she comfortably saw off Sam Quek in the dance-off. Wynne Evans posed a sterner challenge but she still earned a unanimous judges\u2019 decision. Both times, she\u2019s scored 35 points but fallen from mid-table into the bottom two. After two dance-offs in three weeks, it doesn\u2019t look like Montell will last much longer. A shame, since on scores alone, she\u2019d be a worthy finalist. Averaging 33 points per dance, she\u2019s behind only Tasha Ghouri and Sarah Hadland. All Montell lacks is viewer votes. As an athlete-turned-Gladiator, let\u2019s hope her fighting spirit kicks in and she bounces back strongly again. St Petersburg-born Katya Jones proved her value once more this series. She made her name in her debut series nine years ago by making a cult hero out of Ed \u201cGlitter\u201d Balls. Since then, she\u2019s carved out a reputation as the troupe\u2019s most creative choreographer, working magic with all abilities and body types - from dad-dancers like Tony Adams to glitterball winner Joe McFadden. Frustratingly, last year\u2019s partner Nigel Harman was forced to drop out with injury when he looked a potential finalist. She worked wonders again with Wynne Evans. Katya choreographed numbers to exploit his innate musicality, desire to entertain and ability to sell a dance. She gave him intense, challenging routines, packed with daring lifts and tricks, but drilled him hard and he handled them well. Having exited mid-series again, the ever-competitive Katya might persuade producers that she\u2019s due a good \u2019un next time. As a 52-year-old with a self-described \u201cdad bod\u201d, nobody had terribly high hopes for Wynne Evans coming into the contest. The opera singer and BBC Radio Wales presenter proved one of this year\u2019s surprise packages. His natural musicality, tight timing, charismatic performances and quick feet made him a fixture towards the top of the leaderboard, at times recalling 2020 glitterball winner Bill Bailey. A month into the contest, however, came the hand incident, aka \u201dGrope Compare\u201d. Wynne\u2019s dance partner Katya Jones brushed his hand away as he put it around her waist in the Clauditorium, before snubbing his attempted high-five. The couple later insisted it was an in-joke but not before BBC-bashers pounced, linking it to Strictly\u2019s summer of scandal and claiming the franchise was permanently tarnished. Understandably affected by the negative headlines, Wynne suddenly became self-conscious, reining in his rapid-fire wit. His confidence dipped and scores flatlined. The judges haven\u2019t scored him below 30 points since way back in week one but over the past month, he only notched a single nine. Consigned to consecutive dance-offs, Wynne saw off Shayne Ward but was deservedly defeated by Montell Douglas. His best bits were that Mrs Doubtfire cha cha, his money-themed tango, Mr Blue Sky quickstep (complete with bird poo) and that surprise singing crescendo to his Shirley Bassey rumba. Not a bad highlight reel but Wynne - and certainly Katya - might believe he could have lasted a week or two more. Ah well. Back to the Go.Compare ads it is. Pass the comedy moustache. He\u2019s still the lowest-scoring celebrity left in the contest by some margin, averaging fewer points than Shayne Ward, Wynne Evans and even Sam Quek, all of whom he\u2019s miraculously outlasted. TOWIE alumnus Pete Wicks is still yet to appear in the dance-off. He can once again thank public support (and pink slack enthusiasts) for making it to Blackpool, let alone beyond. His fanbase means he was in the top half popularity-wise, according to online polls, despite being bottom of the scoreboard. He was poorly served by last night\u2019s routine. The male stripper theme and camp day-glo mood was more hen party than ballroom. He was upstaged by those eye-wateringly tight pink PVC trousers, which the panel, Shirley Ballas in particular, obsessed over. Pete clearly wasn\u2019t happy being the novelty act and it felt a bit like a production stitch-up. His attire attracted more judgely comments than his dancing but Pete\u2019s performance was pretty poor. He barely danced a step, instead striking poses while pro partner Jowita Przystal and the backing dancers cha-cha-ed around him. A score of 27 points, four fewer than second-from-bottom Wynne, was actually generous. Did that dance deserve eights from Shirley and Anton? Of course not. Craig giving him a four was more like it. With his deadpan humour and have-a-go pluck, Pete is highly likeable but if he sees off many more superior hoofers, it will start to feel unfair. The eliminated couple take a final twirl around the Tower Ballroom floor to Waiting For A Star To Fall by Boys Meets Girl (banger). The credits roll as their castmates crowd around for backslaps. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. His pro partner Katya Jones, a bit croaky with emotion, says: \u201cThe smile hasn\u2019t left my face since the first day of training. Wynne, you\u2019ve made this experience so joyous and so full of laughter. I\u2019m sure everybody was jealous because you\u2019re the kind of guy that everybody wants in their life. You bring light, you bring laughter, you bring charisma, you fill up every room you walk into with those qualities.\u201d Lovely words. In his farewell speech, Wynne Evans tells Tess: \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful, I\u2019ve got to say. I feel like it\u2019s what Strictly is all about. If I can last until week nine, then anybody can get out there and dance and have a brilliant time. Strictly is such a precious family that I want everybody here in this room and at home to look after it for the generations to come because it\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful thing. \u201cTo have been partnered with Katya has been amazing and coming every Saturday night to hang out with all these guys, that\u2019s been wonderful. But to spend every weekday dancing has been just fantastic. I\u2019ve grown so much and I\u2019m so thankful to have met Katya.\u201d Well said. It was a split decision between Wynne and Shayne Ward last week but this time, it\u2019s unanimous. There we have it. Wynne Evans and Katya Jones become the eighth couple to depart the Strictly 2024 dancefloor. Montell and Jojo, saying \u201cwell fought, both danced better but I must send home the couple who swung each other around by the ankles\u201d. Montell and Jojo, saying \u201cboth improved but my decision goes with them\u201d. Montell and Jojo, saying \u201cboth put up a good fight but Montell is the best dancer\u201d. For me, the quality gap was pretty apparent. Let\u2019s see what the crucial quartet thinks. Each judge scored Montell one point more last night. Wynne Evans and his dance partner Katya Jones reprise their Charleston to Les Tor\u00e9adors by Georges Bizet. The judges said last night that he sold it hard but was flat-footed and lacked technique. It scored 31 points, four fewer than Montell\u2019s salsa, so he needs to improve and hope she makes mistakes. Both couples are in their second dance-off but it\u2019s their first in these surroundings. First up, Montell Douglas and Johannes Radebe have another go at their salsa to Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way by Thelma Houston. The judges said last night that sassy, rhythmic and full of spicy flavour but she needs to work on her seamless transitions, engage her torso and be freer in hold. It scored 35 points, four more than Wynne, so she needs no slip-ups to maintain that gap. \u201cThe Pets\u201d originally performed their version for Radio 2, backed by BBC Concert Orchestra, earlier this year. They\u2019re now releasing it as a double A-side with their own song, New London Boy. With over 100m records sold worldwide, the dream duo of Neil \u201cnot Jones\u201d Tennant and Chris \u201cNo relation to Natalie\u201d Lowe remain one of the most successful acts in UK pop history. We love them, even though they don\u2019t pay our rent. Choreographic accompaniment comes from Gorka Marquez, Luba Mushtuk, Nikita Kuzmin and Nadiya Bychkova. Hey dudes, carry the news. As Claudia says, it would be a sin not to have them back. After opening the live show with a space-age medley, Pet Shop Boys are back in the Tower Ballroom to perform their latest single, All The Young Dudes - a cover of the David Bowie-penned glam rock anthem originally released by Mott The Hoople in 1972. Bowie produced the single, which he gave to the band after they rejected Suffragette City, and later recorded it himself. The EastEnders actor does a decent impression of Tony Beak, the king of ballroom. More chit-chat with the duos returning to the Elstree ballroom next week. Pete Wicks is baffled by the public love, saying: \u201cEven I don\u2019t want to see me dance again.\u201d Which means JB and Lauren Oakley deservedly samba and quickstep through to next Saturday. I guess that\u2019s no surprise. Wynne Evans and his pro partner Katya Jones are consigned to the dance-off for the second week running. He finished second from bottom on the leaderboard but didn\u2019t get enough viewer votes to lift him clear. Wow. Even he looks surprised. He was rock bottom of the scoreboard but the pink-trouser TOWIE alumnus has been saved by the public vote. Which means we could be in for a dance-off surprise. He might not like ketchup on his chips but his saucy jive did just enough. Despite being third from bottom on the scoreboard, EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick stays. The dreaded red lightbulb is back. Let\u2019s find out who will face Montell in the dance-off. Claudia cheekily reminds the judges of the disorganised hilarity last time they tried to mark a dance-athon. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019ve got to grips with an iPad in the intervening years. Seven couples on the floor at once next Saturday. Buckle up. Craig hasn\u2019t given a 4 in Blackpool for eight years, apparently, and justifies why he dished one out to Pete. \u201cI was judging his technique, not his outfit.\u201d Rightly so. He cheekily gives Claudia a four for her fluffed dance moves, too. She takes it well. Motsi Mabuse admires Wynne Evans \u201cgoing all in\u201d. Anton du Beke coos over Chris McCausland and JB Gill\u2019s ballroom numbers. The paddle-raising panel pop their esteemed posteriors on Claudia\u2019s Blackpool banquette for a breakdown of last night\u2019s dances. Some booty-twerking form \u201cCraigy\u201d on the way in. Shirley flogs the word \u201ciconic\u201d to within an inch of its life. Talking of Australian families, the world\u2019s favourite Blue Heeler pup joins the Strictly pros for some canine choreography now. It\u2019s a rerun of the endearing Children In Need sketch from Friday night. Bandit will be terribly proud. Please give generously if you can. Recalling his first ever visit to Blackpool, Aljaz Skorjanec says: \u201cI was six and exactly the same height as I am now.\u201d Honey, I blew up the kid. In the Clauditorium - well, behind the a glittery draped curtain in the corner of the Tower Ballroom - the relieved couples chat to La Winkle. Chris McCausland reminds Dianne Buswell that they didn\u2019t just get a 10, they got two. Dianne\u2019s parents are on their way over from Australia for next week\u2019s show. Airmiles ahoy. Sarah Hadland forgets the old maxim that other people\u2019s dreams are never interesting. We\u2019ll forgive her. Montell Douglas and Johannes Radebe must hoof again for survival, as they did two weeks ago. They were in mid-table, joint fourth on the scoreboard, but have tumbled down into the bottom two. Harsh. That\u2019s both joint leaderboard-toppers through. Hooray. After last night\u2019s Hollywood-worthy American smooth, Chris McCausland and Dianne Buswell will deservedly return to the Elstree Studios ballroom next week. Rightly so. They\u2019ve carefully wrapped up the usual red Fireglow lightbulb in a hankie and shipped it 230 miles north. Scarlet spotlight time. Time to find out who\u2019s illuminated Blackpool and whose Strictly switch might be flicked off\u2026 Our eight edgy couples line up on the famed sprung floor and wait to hear their fates. Those pink PVC trousers don\u2019t look any better 24 hours later. The paddle-raising judging panel take their ringside seats. Let\u2019s hope Shirley\u2019s had a cold shower and calmed down. A reminder of Saturday night\u2019s seaside action on-screen now. Tasha Ghouri\u2019s classical paso! Chris McCausland\u2019s tail-coated American smooth! JB Gill\u2019s \u201cRickstep\u201d! Sarah Hadland being \u201ctoo perfect\u201d for picky old Craig! Extra dancers! Hobby horses! Props galore! Here\u2019s our hostly duo, so let\u2019s do our dressing down. Tess Daly is in a silvery sparkly halterneck. Claudia Winkleman is in animal print. Claud wins, making it one-all this weekend. Fair. An electrifying performance, styled with vintage glamour and sizzling with passion. One worthy of the historic surroundings. Powerful and expressive with each couple\u2019s bodies in complete close contact. Changes of gear and a gorgeous classy feel. Intricate flicks, kicks and pivots. We open with a group dance from the professionals. Choreographed by Matt Flint, Leandro Palou and Maria Tsiatsiani, it\u2019s an Argentine Tango set in a glamorous 1940s hotel. The regular Strictly troupe are joined by supporting extra dancers for this stunning number, set to the sultry sounds of Tango Jalousie, written by Danish composer Jacob Gade in 1925. Who\u2019s about to become the eighth couple to board the sequin-spangled tram home? Inflate your armbands and shove a Flake in your drink. We\u2019re about to be beamed back to the Blackpool Tower Ballroom\u2026 Any last dance-off predictions? By rights it should be Pete Wicks vs Wynne Evans but the public vote means anything could happen. Blackpool fingernails are being bitten. Just five minutes to wait now\u2026 The professional troupe\u2019s group performance at the prestigious Tower Ballroom is always something special. Tonight we can look forward to an Argentine tango in a period setting. Gauchos and ganchos incoming. It\u2019s a mere 10 minutes until the clock strikes sequins\u2026 Polar bears hanging out in an abandoned Soviet weather station = sheer animal magic. The third episode of Sir David Attenborough-narrated wildlife epic Asia just wrapping up on BBC1. Tonight we\u2019re in the continent\u2019s frozen north, with stunning footage of Himalayan wolves, Amur tigers and the world\u2019s largest owls. Twit-twoo indeed. Thank goodness those starving bears survived. However, one pair of hoofing humans soon won\u2019t be so lucky. It\u2019s 15 minutes until choreographic kick-off\u2026 Last night\u2019s brilliantly balletic paso doble saw Tasha Ghouri top the leaderboard for an impressive sixth time in nine weeks - and score 39 points for the third time. With Jamie Borthwick, JB Gill, Montell Douglas and Sarah Hadland also notching 39s this series, we\u2019ve been one point away from a maximum seven times \u2013 compared to four times at the equivalent stage last year. How long before somebody goes one better? It\u2019s 20 minutes until we\u2019re back in the Tower Ballroom\u2026 Another email just in from Strictly fan and eager liveblog follower, Iain Crofts in Montreal: If I weren\u2019t frozen out from voting on Strictly by being in Canada, I would usually be voting for Sarah and Vito this season. However, last night I might have voted to save Pete from the dance-off, just to ensure that his pink PVC performance could remain forever unrepeated. No wonder there were reports of him not being very happy in rehearsals. When you wrote in yesterday\u2019s liveblog about the spread in his scores, it seemed like a question of Craig being objectionable with his low-ball score of four. Now that I\u2019ve seen the dance clip, Craig\u2019s score seems objective, while the other judges\u2019 over-scoring looks like, in the words of an eighties French-Canadian pop hit, \u2018Une Question de Feeling\u2019. When it comes to dance-off danger, I suspect that Pete\u2019s active fan-base might be massing on the beach to keep him afloat at Blackpool. Could the red light be flashing for Wynne and Jamie? In all fairness to Pete, if he is to be voted off soon, it would be better to bow out having given his all in a routine that he could look back on fondly. They opened the show in spectacular synth-pop style last night with a medley of their hits, accompanied by silvery sci-fi dancers. Tonight the Pet Shop Boys will make a weekend of it by returning to the Tower Ballroom to perform their brand new single. It\u2019s 25 minutes until our hearts start skipping a beat and we\u2019re strictly domino dancing\u2026 After a cha-cha played for laughs, particularly in the trouser department, Pete Wicks was cut adrift at the foot of the Saturday night scoreboard by four points - and even that was generously marked. But will viewer votes save his skin-tight slacks? If so, are we about to see a seaside shocker? Half an hour until we get our first clues\u2026 Somebody\u2019s seaside weekender is about to turn sour. Good evening and welcome to the latest elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your beside-the-seaside dance partner for tonight\u2019s results show. Please watch along with me as one couple bows out in the Tower Ballroom. Of our eight surviving pro-celebrity pairs, only seven will return to Elstree Studios next Saturday. The judges\u2019 scores have been combined with the public vote and tonight the bottom two will do battle in the dreaded dance-off. So whose hoofing holiday is about to be cut cruelly short? Last night\u2019s super-sized live show saw Bob Fosse-dancing Sarah Hadland and bull-fighting Tasha Ghouri tied at the top of the standings with a near-perfect 39 points apiece. Way down the bottom was pink-trousered Pete Wicks after \u201cthat\u201d I\u2019m Too Sexy cha-cha, with Wynne Evans second from bottom. Will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Jamie Borthwick, Montell Douglas or JB Gill could be at risk. It\u2019s results showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and spun sugar asides. So slip on your Victorian bathing costume (with a Dryrobe on top, it\u2019s November) and see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for Blackpool badinage. I\u2019ll Charleston-swivel down there intermittently to see what you\u2019re all saying and report your comments up top. Kiss me quick and squeeze me slow, it\u2019s nearly time to staaaaart breaking Blackpool hearts! That completes Saturday\u2019s Blackpool livebloggery but meet you right back here for the results show, which airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1. I\u2019ll reboot the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so please rejoin me then. In the meantime, I\u2019m @michaelhogan on Twitter, so feel free to pop down to the end of the pier and say hi. Thanks for watching along with me, sparkly seasiders. See you tomorrow but in the meantime, it\u2019s ye olde Tower Ballroom mantra: keeeeeep dancing! Na-night. Just time for an email from Iain in Montreal, who writes: Gorka\u2019s six-pack seems to be much vaunted but it looks more like a one-pack to me. Maybe I need a higher-definition TV. Six-pack aficionados might like to check out American footballer Danny Amendola\u2019s \u2018500th Episode Instant Jive\u2019 on Dancing with the Stars, which can be seen on YouTube. It opens with the classic distraction technique of his partner ripping his shirt open. His pack-count seems to be six or higher. Who cares about the footwork? Finally, on Jamie Borthwick\u2019s show-closing ketchup jive, KLPS63 says: \u201cJings cravens help ma boab, what was with those costumes on Jamie\u2019s dancers? I love the jive but was gurning at them too much to truly enjoy it. That\u2019s Blackpool for ye.\u201d Leavethelighton says: \u201cJamie\u2019s mum\u2019s eye-roll was fantastic. What a joyful piece. I love him and Michelle.\u201d Jockette61 says: \u201cDidn\u2019t enjoy Jamie tonight, although nice to see him having fun. Flat-footed, not enough bounce, sickled toes. Not a great dance style for him.\u201d miranda07 says: \u201cYet again, it feels like the comments that Jamie receives are way harsher than other people who didn\u2019t dance quite so well this week.\u201d VirgilHilts concludes: \u201cThat reminded me of the sort of thing you\u2019d see if you happened to put your TV on while holidaying in France in the 80s.\u201d On Tasha Ghouri\u2019s joint scoreboard-topping paso doble, whistledownthewind says: \u201cTasha is a wonderful dancer. She delivers every week but I wonder how many people are emotionally invested in her? I think she may well reach the final but someone (like Chris) who isn\u2019t as accomplished dance-wise will win because of this.\u201d MartGray says: \u201cOh, the drama. That was fantastic, well done Tasha, Aljaz and pals. As we always say around here, traditional music doesn\u2019t half help. And I did like Tasha\u2019s wee mouthed snarl as she came right up to the camera. Grrr.\u201d Pancake01 says: \u201cI wish they\u2019d turn the lights up a smidgen. I think that would have been brilliant if I could have seen it properly. I loved the music and styling, but she needed more aggression, a bit too nice.\u201d TeeDubyaBee adds: \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know, playing \u2018guess which dancer is the pro\u2019 with Tasha would be impossible. Effortless.\u201d On Wynne Evans\u2019 Charleston, VirgilHilts says: \u201cGod knows I love Katya but that wasn\u2019t great. It was too mechanical, no flow, stop-start. I\u2019m not sure what Wynne is built for but it isn\u2019t that.\u201d girlpanic adds: \u201cStrange choice of music for a Charleston! Poor Wynne was not great with technique but he definitely knows how to perform. And that lift at the end \u2013 I thought Katya was going to go flying!\u201d Pete Wicks\u2019 pink-trousered cha cha certainly caused a stir. jonbob47 says: \u201cNot amused by how Pete has been objectified there. Frankly, he looked humiliated. Play it back and look at how he was holding his coat over his crotch. And how his anatomy was talked about by the judges. Wouldn\u2019t see that if he was a female contestant would we? Misandry that needs to be called out, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Clarissaharlowe1 says: \u201cDo Shirley and Anton not see that scoring Pete an eight makes an absolute mockery of the entire scoring system? Shirley needs to remember she\u2019s not supposed to be scoring highly just because she likes it! Does Pete have some hold over them?\u201d Hopefulducky says: \u201cWhat Craig said. Noooo, Pete. Very brave to wear the pink but it\u2019s a no from me, especially because of Shirley\u2019s tasteless reaction.\u201d MaineC says: \u201cPete and Jowita were stitched up. Not their fault.\u201d Bigted1980 adds: \u201cJesus wept. Just catching up, has Jowita got a holiday booked next week she needs to be free for?\u201d On JB Gill\u2019s Rickrolling quickstep, MikeMoonlight says: \u201cGood grief, I\u2019ve heard better covers on those Top Of the Pops albums that sold for 49p in Woolworths in the 70\u2019s than that version of Rick Astley.\u201d Whistledownthewind says: \u201cIf ever there was a case for getting rid of backing dancers, it\u2019s during the quickstep, surely? Footwork is so important and anything that distracts attention from that is just in the way.\u201d YodaknowsAll adds: \u201cThat quickstep from JB was seriously good. Not even the strange musical arrangement could detract from it.\u201d On Sarah Hadland\u2019s joint leaderboard-topping Couple\u2019s Choice, EnglishAthene says: \u201cNo. Sorry. Sarah and Vito not good use of the floor! The judges will disagree!\u201d Heartticker says: \u201cNow THAT is what I call a Couple\u2019s Choice. An extra point because we didn\u2019t get a sob story.\u201d acanthe adds: That was Fosse-mazing - loved it!\u201d As for Montell Douglas\u2019 salsa, Whistledownthewind says: \u201cI really enjoyed that from Montell and JoJo. So much energy and enthusiasm! Really hope she\u2019s not in danger this week because that was lots of fun.\u201d MarkRoche says: \u201cMontell is usually such a star performer, but something felt a bit flat from her there.\u201d SnailyWhaley adds: \u201cThat was an example of backing dancers being way too distracting and me struggling to see the main couple. They were great in Chris and Dianne\u2019s routine, maybe because they had to stay out of his way.\u201d On Chris McCausland\u2019s American smooth, Pancake01 says: \u201cThat was such a brilliant dance. I am actually sobbing here because I loved it so much. Proper music, costumes, style and a gawjus dance from Chris. No idea how he did it, as ever.\u201d Phoebe says: \u201cI loved that. Dianne looks stunning and so does Chris, dancing a proper dance to proper music. Amazing silky dancing. If that doesn\u2019t raise a few 10s I\u2019ll be devastated.\u201d irreverentnurse adds: \u201cSmooth as butter off a hot knife. Bravo!\u201d A swift seaside vox pop of your comments. On that Pet Shop Boys opening number, Canterbury1 says: \u201cFinally, a proper (and bloody brilliant) opening. And I want Claudia\u2019s outfit for lounging about the house!!!\u201d GreenAppleRedApple adds: \u201cDid not appreciate the Pet Shop Noys at the time but in middle age, I\u2019ve realised how absolutely amazing they are.\u201d An entertaining enough seaside special but not a vintage year for me. Backing dancers, big-scale production, crowd-pleasing performances and ambitious choreography added up to some spectacular routines, befitting of the Tower Ballroom surroundings. A little flat and lacking magic in places, though \u2013 not helped by the harsh reception for Jamie Borthwick\u2019s jive. Clearly intended to be a big finish but harsh judging meant we ended with a whimper. Some of the scoring was all over the shop, too \u2013 especially from Shirley and Anton. TV viewers can now flip to BBC Two for Boybands Night or Channel 4 for Lenny Henry\u2019s Legends of Comedy. For a spot of clever cosy crime, the mighty Lesley Manville stars in Moonflower Murders at 9.15pm on BBC One, the sequel to Magpie Murders. If you\u2019re in the mood for a film, there\u2019s Gladiator (9.15pm on Sky Showcase), 28 Weeks Later (10pm on MTV), Inglourious Basterds (10.20pm on Channel 4) or brilliant Iranian drama No Bears (10.35pm on BBC Four). Are you not entertained? They\u2019ve got prestige written all the way through, like a stick of Blackpool rock. Here are this week\u2019s seaside gong-getters\u2026 Best dance: Sarah Hadland\u2019s Fosse-inspired Couple\u2019s Choice for me, even if it divided you below the line. Worst dance: Pete Wicks by some stretch. All trousers and no cha-cha. Best music choice: The big band version of Van Halen\u2019s Jump was a swinging, jazzy treat. Chosen by Chris McCausland himself, too. Worst music choice: Right Said Fred and Rick Astley both creaked at the seams. Best outfit: A tie between Lauren\u2019s colour-blocked quickstep frock and Montell\u2019s sparkly salsa number, although it was let down by the flat trainers. Worst outfit: Pete Wicks came dressed for a hen do. A disappointing one, too. Taxi! Best judges\u2019 comment: Craig\u2019s bingo-calling: \u201cShirley\u2019s tiny shoes\u2026 32. I\u2019m feeling naughty\u2026 40. Dave Arch is divine\u2026 59.\u201d House! Worst VT: Aljaz pretending to be sick on the rollercoaster. Best Claudia quip: Admitting that her son thought her frock looked like a carpet \u2013 and promptly posting a pic of Demis Roussos on Instagram. The meanest - or some might say, most objective - judge, Craig Revel Horwood, gives out an average 4.5 perfect 10s per series, compared to his colleague Anton du Beke\u2019s whopping 28 per series. At more than two per week, he\u2019s statistically the most generous judge. Craig is still yet to raise his maximum this series. Someone needs to make him put his pen down and marvel. In Musicals Week, maybe? Sarah Hadland and Tasha Ghouri jointly top the seaside standings, with Chris McCausland in third spot. Pete Wicks is way down the bottom, with Wynne Evans just above. Those two clearly deserve to be in the dance-off but as always, the public vote helps decide who\u2019ll be consigned to the Tower Ballroom eliminator. Jamie Borthwick, JB Gill and Montell Douglas might also be in for an anxious wait. Hey, at least they\u2019d get to dance on that famous floor again. Tess and Claud tell us to \u201cKeeeeeep dancing!\u201d with one eye already on the green room bar and the traditional Blackpool night out. As everyone packs away their buckets, spades and sandy towels, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. We now recap the night\u2019s eight dances on-screen. Enough sequins to spangle a Big Dipper with some to spare. The red ribbon is cut on the voting lines and the usual mayhem kicks off - with a fancy-dressed Blackpool twist, naturally. Novelty specs akimbo. Which seaside smashers are you voting for? Which dancing donkeys are you definitely not? Judges\u2019 scores for Jamie and Michelle: 8, 8, 8, 9 for a total of 33 points. Third from bottom. Dance-off danger? Doesn\u2019t deserve it but possibly so. Judges\u2019 comments for Jamie and Michelle: Motsi gets the giggles and says \u201cpushed the energy, standing leg lacked a little vibration, otherwise fantastic\u201d. Shirley says \u201cexciting and entertaining but tried too hard and needed weight further forward\u201d. Anton says \u201cadd chips to more of your dances, full of beans, work the knees more, find the love in each dance\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cbrought your own unique style so I forgive the sickled feet and straight legs, loved the jubilation\u201d. Bit harsh, I thought. Eights and nines? Last dance now. EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick and his pro partner Michelle Tsiakkas have suffered a slump in form in recent weeks. They haven\u2019t quite hit heights of their week five paso doble and last week, finished joint bottom of the leaderboard for the first time. Can they recapture the magic with a high-energy, chip-fixated jive? A bequiffed Jamie flies in on a giant sparkly ketchup bottle. Clearly Heinz-branded but other brands are available. This is the BBC, after all. Fast steps and fun flourishes in a comical routine. Both in sparkly ketchup red. Keeping it light, airy and bouncy. Upbeat mood. Jamie relishing (pardon the sauce pun) chance to be a showman, really selling it. Kicks, flicks and side-by-side sections are super-sharp and tasty. Keen as mustard. Dollops of fun and terrific dancing too. Condiments come no higher. Song: The Ketchup Song by Las Ketchup. The 2002 Spanglish novelty hit topped charts (and chips) in 20 countries, selling 7m copies worldwide. Online conspiracies spread, especially around Latin America, that the gibberish lyrics included hidden demonic references and Satanic messages. Down with that sort of thing. Careful, now. Judges\u2019 scores for Tasha and Alja\u017e: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Joint top with Sarah Hadland. Still no perfect 40 this series. Judges\u2019 comments for Tasha and Alja\u017e: Craig says \u201ctoo balletic for me, needed to be more into the ground, but a-may-zing\u201d. Motsi says \u201cbeautiful storytelling and shaping, dance of the night\u201d. Shirley says \u201cclassic, took me back to my own career (modest), beautiful\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cloved the lyrical interpretation without losing intensity, top drawer\u201d. Another 39-pointer? Could we be about to see the first 40 of the year? No. Classic Craig innit. Tasha Ghouri, who wears a cochlear implant, has had to adjust to the new, more echoey acoustics of Tower Ballroom. However, she\u2019ll feel the music\u2019s vibrations more in her body. Smiley Slovenian pro Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec hadn\u2019t been to Blackpool for five years, so he\u2019s particularly excited for this paso. Classy music and a dramatic routine, packed with content. Game Of Thrones-themed with Tasha in a corseted black and burgundy dress. Balance and control in her weight transference. She\u2019s the powerful, domineering character in this matadorial ballroom battle. Leggy, fleet-footed, almost Argentine tango-like at times. Changes of gear, glorious lifts, cool and controlled, strong finish. Great choreography. Ol\u00e9! Song: Torn by Nathan Lanier. A passionate orchestral composition which featured in the film Hugh Strung and on US contest So You Think You Can Dance?. Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Lauren: 8, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points. Mid-table. Judges\u2019 comments for JB and Lauren: Anton says \u201cswept across the floor with great control and lovely technique, a slight problem with your head position, otherwise super\u201d. Craig says \u201cslightly fighting each other but loved you flying all around this humungous floor with ease\u201d. Motsi says \u201ceffortless, full of content, no playing around but balance issues at times\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cso much to like, timing on-point, get your posture in place and sky\u2019s the limit\u201d. Eights and nines? JB Gill has been tied at the top of the scoreboard with Tasha Ghouri for two weeks in a row. After last week\u2019s firecracker samba, the ballroom boy is back in hold for a fairground-set \u201cRickstep\u201d. Flying around the bigger Blackpool space will take some stamina. His pro partner Lauren Oakley has competed here since childhood, winning titles along the way, but this is her first time with a celebrity partner on Strictly. An energetic routine that\u2019s as much fun as the song and perfectly suited to the sprung floor. Hurrying to keep up in places, perhaps, but a pacy and stylish number with tight timing and lovely group promenades. Running around, sure, but it won\u2019t let you down, hurt you or desert you. Song: Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. The 1987 chart-topper had a resurgence in popularity 20 years later, thanks to the bait-and-switch \u201cRickroll\u201d online meme, reviving the Lancastrian crooner\u2019s career in the process. Written and produced by the Hit Factory team of Stock Aitken Waterman, it was heavily inspired by Colonel Abrams\u2019 hit Trapped. Judges\u2019 scores for Pete and Jowita: 4, 7, 8, 8 for a total of 27 points. A bonkers four-point spread but bottom place as it stands. Latin is \u201clike looking for your keys all the time\u201d, says Pete. Judges\u2019 comments for Pete and Jowita: Shirley is lost for words and says \u201cgood isolation, clean neckline, Cuban breaks, I\u2019ll never forget this evening\u201d. Anton says \u201cwe just saw your butt cheeks emerging from behind the scenery and Shirley hasn\u2019t been the same since, the cha-cha was lacking but the dance was brilliant\u201d. Craig says \u201ctrousers are quite shocking, darling, you fought the dance, uncoordinated, behind the beat, bent legs but huge fun\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cI loved it for all the wrong reasons, what was happening here? You went all in.\u201d Anyone\u2019s guess. Sixes and sevens, maybe? After last week\u2019s barefoot contempo-waft Couple\u2019s Choice, Pete Wicks goes from poignant to playful. All week he\u2019s been grumbling about this striptease routine, insisting he\u2019s \u201cless Magic Mike, more Tragic Pete\u201d. He\u2019s playing a Blackpool tram conductor, arriving on a party bus with passengers in hot pink PVC. Well, Strictly is never knowingly under-camp. Takes forever to start dancing but those trousers try to compensate. The contest\u2019s lowest scoring dance on average, the cha-cha-cha is technically tricky. He needs straight legs, to keep it compact and contained, transferring his body weight while maintaining timing. He\u2019s striking poses and lacking fluidity. Flat-footed and off-the beat but game for a laugh and decent partnering skills. A hen do of a dance. Song: I\u2019m Too Sexy by Right Said Fred. The 1991 hit equalled the record for the most weeks at number two on the UK singles chart. It was stuck there for six weeks in a row, held back by (Everything I Do) I Do It for You by Bryan Adams. It\u2019s seen a revival in recent years, thanks to being inserted into songs by Taylor Swift, Drake and Beyonc\u00e9. Not a bad trio royalty-wise. Gratuitous Gorka six-pack gag there. We\u2019ve all got one, Gorks, we just don\u2019t go on about it. Judges\u2019 scores for Wynne and Katya: 7, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 31 points. Bottom as it stands. Dance-off danger, I fear. Judges\u2019 comments for Wynne and Katya: Anton makes a Widdy reference (drink!) and says \u201cmagnificent, you gave it everything, you looked exhausted two-thirds of the way through, so form flagged towards the end but you sold it\u201d. Craig says \u201cI disagree, he kept the energy going, ambitious but flat-footed, left foot lacked swivel, what it missed in technique it made up for in entertainment\u201d. Motsi says \u201ccommitment with joy on your face\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201ca Katya special, enjoyed it\u201d. Eights? Last week\u2019s dance-off survivors are now bookies\u2019 favourites to go home. Can he defy the odds? We\u2019ve not had a Charleston for five weeks and only three in the series overall, which seems like an oversight, so this is welcome. Wynne Evans has admitted that, as an 18-stone chap, training has been tough on his knees but the bouncy Tower Ballroom floor will help. It\u2019s more of a dramatic Charleston than a kooky one, putting a dance twist on the opera Carmen. Risky lifts and plenty of tricks. Fan-ography and a hobby horse (as opposed to a hobby Blackpool donkey). Razzle-dazzle choreography by the ever-creative Katya Jones. Craig will have his eyes trained on that all-important swivel, of course, and it\u2019s a bit heavy-footed but bags of characterisation and excellent entertainment value. Big head-banger spinning lift to finish. Oof. Song: Carmen Suite No. 1: 5. Les Tor\u00e9adors by Georges Bizet. One of the most popular operatic arias of all-time has become a Strictly paso favourite. Susanna Reid and Kevin Clifton scored 39 points for it in 2013, right here in Blackpool. Two years ago, Ellie Taylor and Johannes Radebe scored a much more modest 23. Claudia says of her sparkly garb: \u201cI\u2019m dressed like a carpet, according to my son.\u201d Vito does some trademark wibbling about the solar system. Judges\u2019 scores for Sarah and Vito: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Top of the pops. So far. Judges\u2019 comments for Sarah and Vito: Craig says \u201cwith that minimalism and economy, it was a bit too perfect, which sounds weird I know, lacked attitude in the still moments but spec-tac-ular\u201d. Motsi says \u201cToo perfect? I\u2019ve heard it all now, that was iconic, you just smashed Blackpool\u201d. Shirley says \u201ctiny details were sensual but classy, full of fun, you represent all women, your best dance so far\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cextraordinary, perfectly timed, huge confidence, your best my miles\u201d. A 39-pointer? The seventh Couple\u2019s Choice of the series now and Sarah Hadland\u2019s should be among the best. Could she and pro partner Vito Coppola even beat their top score of 38 points? Moody opening, then into a a Bob Fosse-esque jazz number with modern notes and quirky Charleston-alike details. Monochrome outfits with white gloves. Classy and sassy, fast and stylised. Side-by-side sections and Craig-friendly conceptual Cabaret styling. Lots of lifts, drops, tricks and high-kicks. Wednesday Addams-ish at times. Tight and on-point timing-wise. Loved that. Song: Padam Padam by Kylie Minogue. Her 2023 Grammy-winning viral synth-pop banger, mashed up into a medley with 2001 hit Can\u2019t Get You Out Of My Head. The song was almost given to Rita Ora and thank goodness it wasn\u2019t. Kylie fell in love with the track when she was sent it and immediately recorded her vocals herself in a London hotel, hence her being credited as the \u201cvocal engineer\u201d. Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: 8, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points. Highest-scoring salsa of the series but a tad generous for me. Judges\u2019 comments for Montell and Jojo: Motsi says \u201cI kept saying wow, you\u2019ve gone from athlete to showgirl, sass and flavour, swapped partners and looked at ease, fantastic\u201d. Shirley says \u201cnatural born performer, you looked like one of the pros but work on transitions\u201d. Anton says \u201cenergy is your weapon but be freer in hold\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cengage your torso and be more seamless, sticky moments but you have incredible rhythm and sell it 100 per cent\u201d. Eights ahoy, do we reckon? Montell Douglas notched her highest Latin score with last week\u2019s power-packed paso. Can she maintain that form? Eyes down for a routine is set in a bingo hall, with the Gladiator and pro partner Johanne Radebe going for gold. Well, the floating glitterball trophy. Montell in a fabulous frock but why trainers, not dance shoes? Boogieing along to a disco anthem with big smiles and bags of bounce. Changes of rhythm handled well. Fast and flirty with a sense of fun and freedom, feeding off the energy of the extra dancers. Spicy hip action and plenty of rotation. She looks a bit off the beat at times but heaps of fun. Song: Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way by Kylie Minogue. Her cover of the disco anthem first recorded by Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes in 1975, which later became a chart-topper for the Communards and the UK\u2019s best-selling single of 1986. You might still be having nightmares of Bruno Tonioli\u2019s crooning cover version in the ballroom four years ago. No Elstree-style balcony this week but Dame Winkle has a natty little VIP area for her Clauditorium. She welcomes this week\u2019s guests to read out the voting smallprint: Blackpool\u2019s Funny Girls, DJ Zoe and CeCe D\u2019Vine. Local heroines but were all the famous people washing their hair? Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: 8, 9, 10 (never too early), 10 for a total of 37 points. His highest score. Dianne weeping. Judges\u2019 comments for Chris and Dianne: Big cheer and celebration from Chris at the end of that routine. Tess tells them they\u2019re Strictly\u2019s 100th couple to perform in the Tower Ballroom. Shirley says \u201cbest feet I\u2019ve seen in a long time, floated across the floor, didn\u2019t miss a beat, phenomenal\u201d. Anton says \u201cI wish I\u2019d danced that number (drink!), style and exemplary seamless movement\u201d. Craig says \u201cslightly ahead of the beat and arm extensions need finesse, lacked swing or sway, but your frame has improved beyond compare, brilliant\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201ca beautiful statement to open the show\u201d. Nines incoming? Blind comedian Chris McCausland won the nation\u2019s hearts yet again last week with his Couple\u2019s Choice, complete with impactful \u201cblackout\u201d moment. Now he opens the show with a more traditional number, fittingly for the Tower Ballroom setting. However, Chris now has extra dancers and a new space to think about. He sometimes struggles with smooth transitions because he can\u2019t see the transitional point. Here there are new angles to contend with. However, he loves his ballroom and feels safe in partner Dianne Buswell\u2019s arms. Dapper in a tailcoat and nice lift to begin. He\u2019s been working hard to improve his posture. Decent frame and lovely foxtrot footwork with plenty of glide. Jazzy solo section is extra impressive. Chemistry, class and a dollop of old Hollywood glamour. Bravo. Anton will love that. Song: Jump by Paul Anka. A mellow, swinging big-band cover of the 80s Van Halen anthem. Long-jumper Greg Rutherford and Natalie \u201cLegs\u201d Lowe performed a tango to this during the 2016 series. Our eight pro-celebrity pairs emerge for a wave and a wide-eyed look around the Tower Ballroom. Pete Wicks has come dressed for On The Buses. Tasha Ghouri looking fiercely flamenco. Wynne Evans in a cape and pedal-pushers. Me too, mate. The paddle-raising panel make their big entrance. Motsi Mabuse stealing the show in a pink floral princess dress. Craig Revel Horwood in a mustard tux. Here come our Tower Ballroom hosts, so time for a seaside sartorial smackdown. Tess Daly is in slinky red sequins. Claudia Winkleman is in a kaftan-cum-slanket. Tess wins. Well, that was a pretty fab-ew-lous way to kick off. Our eight celebrities join the Bacofoil fun on a packed Tower Ballroom floor. I\u2019ve got the brains, you\u2019ve got the looks, let\u2019s make lots of Strictly. What have we done to deserve this dance delight? We begin proceedings with a suitably starry group dance. Synth-pop veterans the Pet Shop Boys - aka Neil \u201cnot Jones\u201d Tennant and Chris \u201cNo relation to Natalie\u201d Lowe - perform a medley of their hits. It\u2019s a\u2026 it\u2019s a\u2026 it\u2019s a shiny one. Lauren Oakley and Carlos Gu lead the hoofing accompaniment from the professional troupe, clad in silver 80s-style outfits for space age glamour. The choreography takes in elements of Viennese waltz, samba, contemporary and jazz. It\u2019s futuristic, arty and abstract. Half these couples have now departed and didn\u2019t get to make the trip up the M6. Sob. Still, we\u2019ll see them again in a month\u2019s time for the traditional \u201cClass of 2024\u201d group number in the final. Cue Blackpool-themed montage as the celebrities all tell us how much it means to make it here. Knot a hankie on your head and roll up your trousers for a paddle. We\u2019re about to go over live to the (squeal!) Blackpool Tower ballroom\u2026 Alan Carr\u2019s Numberwang just wrapping up on BBC1. If you see it, say it. Say what you see. It\u2019s good but it\u2019s not right. Say goodbye, Mr Chips. He\u2019s waving! Sorry, Roy Walker possessed me for a moment there. A mere five minutes to wait now\u2026 There are not one but two Kylie Minogue numbers on tonight\u2019s playlist, with both Montell Douglas and Sarah Hadland\u2019s dances soundtracked by the pocket-sized Antipodean pop princess. We\u2019re also being treated to some Rick Astley, Right Said Fred and, ahem, Las Ketchup. A Blackpool pop bonanza. Ten minutes until showtime\u2026 For the first time this series, we\u2019re not doubling up on any hoofing styles tonight. All eight couples will perform a different dance. We\u2019ll see an American smooth, a salsa, a quickstep, a cha-cha, a jive, a paso, a Charleston and a Couple\u2019s Choice. Lots of bouncy numbers to take full advantage of that famed sprung floor. Not long until that ba-ba-da theme tune\u2026 Colour me excited because tonight\u2019s musical guests in the Tower Ballroom are one of my all-time favourite bands, the perennially brilliant Pet Shop Boys. Would I book them for Strictly myself? Left to my own devices, I probably would. Fifteen minutes to wait\u2026 Cross them off as they happen! Take a drink for each! End up wearing a feather boa in a dodgy seafront \u201cnitespot\u201d with Ginger Neil! Here\u2019s your 10-point seaside spotter\u2019s guide for tonight: Tess and Claudia make knowing jokes about the cast and crew hitting the town post-show Judges join in the group dance, including a run of spins from Shirley or Craig A bouncy quickstep, jive or Charleston is said to \u201ctake full advantage of the sprung floor\u201d VT includes a couple screaming on a rollercoaster/playing in seafront amusement arcades Visual gag involving a rubber seagull, kiss-me-quick hat or a windbreak Anton makes misty-eyed reference to Blackpool dances of yore with clod-hopping partners (probably Widdy) Celebrity makes misty-eyed reference to coming to Blackpool on childhood holidays A carb-averse pro or celeb is shown unconvincingly scoffing chips on the beach Cute/creepy snap of a professional dancing at Blackpool as a child dance prodigy After a lengthy pause to prolong the drama, Craig raises his 10 paddle and everyone goes bonkers After his narrow dance-off escape last week, Wynne Evans is bookies\u2019 odds-on favourite for the Blackpool boot. Pete Wicks is their second top tip, followed by Montell Douglas and Jamie Borthwick. With the pressure on, will things go according to the form book? We\u2019ll see when the glittery curtain comes up\u2026 Over the years, the judges have awarded 107 perfect 10s in Blackpool. The quickstep is the dance style with most 10s (good news for JB Gill, who dances one tonight), followed by the American smooth, with the Charleston in third place. Twenty minutes until our Blackpool minibreak\u2026 A quirk of the seaside stats: Strictly history tells us that whoever tops the Blackpool scoring usually doesn\u2019t go on to lift the glitterball. Kelvin Fletcher and Ellie Leach both finished joint top and went on to win but they\u2019re the only ones in the last 11 years. With the scoreboard beginning to bunch up and a split judges\u2019 decision last week, the contest is starting to get serious. We\u2019re into the climactic four weeks of the series after this, so the end is in sight and stakes are high. Not long until the clock strikes Strictly\u2026 You\u2019ll hear the B-word a helluva lot tonight, so what exactly makes the Tower Ballroom so special? Well, the spiritual home of ballroom dancing dates back to 1894 and positively oozes with hoofing history. As the home of Strictly\u2019s mothership show, Come Dancing, and host to international competitions, it means a lot to the professionals and judges. The room itself is full of baroque Victorian splendour. Crystal chandeliers hang from a high ceiling, with tiered balconies and carved panelling. With a full crowd, the atmosphere in there is electric. The famous sprung dancefloor is several times bigger than the familiar Elstree Studios ballroom, hence the use of backing dancers, props and production tricks to fill the cavernous space. In Strictly\u2019s 20th year, tonight marks the show\u2019s 15th visit to Blackpool. It\u2019s a landmark weekend which always adds extra sparkle. Who will rise to the big occasion in these storied surroundings? We\u2019ll get our first clues in 25 minutes\u2026 The Tower Ballroom demands a towering performance. We\u2019re set for a rollercoaster night of dancing - but nobody wants a big dip in their scores. Good evening and welcome to week nine of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your Pleasure Beach buddy for tonight\u2019s special live show. I\u2019d love you to watch along with me as eight surviving couples take the trip 200 miles north to the fabled home of ballroom. Last weekend saw just a seven-point margin between the top and bottom of the scoreboard, followed by only the second split judges\u2019 decision of the seres. Yes, the hoofing contest is getting as tight as Vito Coppola\u2019s trousers as it enters its home stretch. It proved third dance-off unlucky for Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu, who were narrowly eliminated. Our eight remaining pro-celebrity pairings now make the annual pilgrimage to Strictly\u2019s spiritual home. As always, tonight\u2019s scores will be combined with the public vote. The bottom two duos will perform again for survival on Sunday night. Wynne Evans and Pete Wicks look most at risk but it\u2019s all to dance for. With the venue\u2019s famed sprung floor and backing dancers to help fill out the bigger space, we can expect routines with extra razzle-dazzle. It\u2019s showtime at 6.45pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.15pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis and reaction, plus plenty of salt and vinegar. So grab yourself a chippy tea (well, it is Blackpool weekend) and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for Blackpool business. I\u2019ll ride my donkey down there from time to time to see what you\u2019re all saying and report on your reactions. The Blackpool special is one of the biggest nights in Strictly calendar. But who will be a bright light in Lancs Vegas and who\u2019ll be a seaside washout? It\u2019s nearly time to staaaart seaside dancing!",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I keep making pieces that I think maybe no one outside of Ireland will like,\u201d says Michael Keegan-Dolan. \u201cAnd so far, I\u2019ve been wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed: his work comes from a particular place, but Keegan-Dolan\u2019s company <a href=\"https://teacdamsa.com/\">Tea\u010b Da\u1e41sa</a> plays successfully all over the world. The choreographer and director is speaking to me not far from where he was born, in north Dublin, where his new piece Nobodaddy has been playing to sold-out houses at the <a href=\"https://dublintheatrefestival.ie/\">Dublin theatre festival</a>. He asks if it mattered that I, a Londoner, hadn\u2019t got all the Irish references in it. Well, my experience was certainly enriched by a local friend pointing out a characteristically Irish way of saying \u201cyeah, yeah, yeah\u201d on an inbreath (technically, it is the \u201cpulmonic ingressive\u201d), for example, or giving me some backstory to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_showband\">Irish showbands</a>. In the end I say: what I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know, the piece just needs to work enough without me needing to know. He laughs and nods (he laughs a lot, often at himself), and I reckon we\u2019ve arrived at one answer why his work crosses borders: there\u2019s Irishness in it, but it\u2019s not an entry requirement.</p> <p>Perhaps a better portal into his world is his sense that all art is, in a fundamental sense, \u201cfolk\u201d art. There is a mix of musical styles in Nobodaddy \u2013 sacred and profane, pop, contemporary, classical, folk \u2013 but he cuts in to say: \u201cit\u2019s all folk though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He means that it all comes from particular people, places and histories, something he insists on particularly when it comes to highbrow and classical art. When we first met last year, he said: \u201cThe Irish, we\u2019re in this constant pushing and pulling with the British empire. That happens a lot with postcolonial cultures because the simple dynamics of victory expresses the idea that what they\u2019re bringing is better: their language, their stories, their culture. The classical form is mixed in with this, that sense of: we are a great people, and we will make great buildings and great symphonies and have a great ballet company.\u201d</p>    <p>Keegan-Dolan has form with classical ballet. A winger in the school rugby team, he fell for the art form at 17 and soon gained a place at London\u2019s Central School of Ballet. \u201cPostcolonial syndrome,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was trying to be a classicist, trying to believe that classical art was the fundamental truth and nature of all art.\u201d Though he didn\u2019t fit into the school (more than once he was expelled, then taken back), he recognises it as a formative moment: \u201cI started making work.\u201d</p> <p>A student solo featuring two dead mackerel was an early sign that his path was leading towards more experimental dance theatre. In 1997 he founded Fabulous Beast Dance Theatre, often digging into the dark, even brutal aspects of our lives, then in 2003 upped sticks from London to a field in Longford in the Irish midlands, where his ancestors were from. Several of his major works are set in the region, including root-and-branch reimaginings of the ballets Giselle and Swan Lake \u2013 the latter marking the company\u2019s phoenix-like reincarnation as Tea\u010b Da\u1e41sa in 2016, Keegan-Dolan having dramatically incinerated his Fabulous Beast memorabilia in a bonfire, left his home in Longford, and moved with his family to Kerry, in the far southwest.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/28/swan-lakeloch-na-heala-five-star-review-sadlers-wells\">Swan Lake/Loch na hEala</a>, the first work made in Kerry and the last set in Longford, was a tale of the past weighing oppressively on the present that ended with visions of transcendence and release, and it\u2019s hard not to find echoes in Keegan-Dolan\u2019s own transfiguration: a new place for himself and his family, a new name in a new language for his company. \u201cI have no bones in Kerry,\u201d he says, \u201cno ancestors buried there. I used to be so caught up with where I\u2019m from.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I keep making pieces that I think maybe no one outside of Ireland will like,\u201d says Michael Keegan-Dolan. \u201cAnd so far, I\u2019ve been wrong.\u201d Indeed: his work comes from a particular place, but Keegan-Dolan\u2019s company Tea\u010b Da\u1e41sa plays successfully all over the world. The choreographer and director is speaking to me not far from where he was born, in north Dublin, where his new piece Nobodaddy has been playing to sold-out houses at the Dublin theatre festival. He asks if it mattered that I, a Londoner, hadn\u2019t got all the Irish references in it. Well, my experience was certainly enriched by a local friend pointing out a characteristically Irish way of saying \u201cyeah, yeah, yeah\u201d on an inbreath (technically, it is the \u201cpulmonic ingressive\u201d), for example, or giving me some backstory to Irish showbands. In the end I say: what I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know, the piece just needs to work enough without me needing to know. He laughs and nods (he laughs a lot, often at himself), and I reckon we\u2019ve arrived at one answer why his work crosses borders: there\u2019s Irishness in it, but it\u2019s not an entry requirement. Perhaps a better portal into his world is his sense that all art is, in a fundamental sense, \u201cfolk\u201d art. There is a mix of musical styles in Nobodaddy \u2013 sacred and profane, pop, contemporary, classical, folk \u2013 but he cuts in to say: \u201cit\u2019s all folk though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He means that it all comes from particular people, places and histories, something he insists on particularly when it comes to highbrow and classical art. When we first met last year, he said: \u201cThe Irish, we\u2019re in this constant pushing and pulling with the British empire. That happens a lot with postcolonial cultures because the simple dynamics of victory expresses the idea that what they\u2019re bringing is better: their language, their stories, their culture. The classical form is mixed in with this, that sense of: we are a great people, and we will make great buildings and great symphonies and have a great ballet company.\u201d Keegan-Dolan has form with classical ballet. A winger in the school rugby team, he fell for the art form at 17 and soon gained a place at London\u2019s Central School of Ballet. \u201cPostcolonial syndrome,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was trying to be a classicist, trying to believe that classical art was the fundamental truth and nature of all art.\u201d Though he didn\u2019t fit into the school (more than once he was expelled, then taken back), he recognises it as a formative moment: \u201cI started making work.\u201d A student solo featuring two dead mackerel was an early sign that his path was leading towards more experimental dance theatre. In 1997 he founded Fabulous Beast Dance Theatre, often digging into the dark, even brutal aspects of our lives, then in 2003 upped sticks from London to a field in Longford in the Irish midlands, where his ancestors were from. Several of his major works are set in the region, including root-and-branch reimaginings of the ballets Giselle and Swan Lake \u2013 the latter marking the company\u2019s phoenix-like reincarnation as Tea\u010b Da\u1e41sa in 2016, Keegan-Dolan having dramatically incinerated his Fabulous Beast memorabilia in a bonfire, left his home in Longford, and moved with his family to Kerry, in the far southwest. Swan Lake/Loch na hEala, the first work made in Kerry and the last set in Longford, was a tale of the past weighing oppressively on the present that ended with visions of transcendence and release, and it\u2019s hard not to find echoes in Keegan-Dolan\u2019s own transfiguration: a new place for himself and his family, a new name in a new language for his company. \u201cI have no bones in Kerry,\u201d he says, \u201cno ancestors buried there. I used to be so caught up with where I\u2019m from. Not any more \u2013 and it feels fantastic.\u201d Partly, he\u2019s distancing himself from the kind of nativist ethnonationalism (\u201call bollocks!\u201d) that surfaced for example in the Dublin riots of 2023, but there\u2019s also something more personal: a reckoning with his own history, and finding a way of living that is informed but not haunted by the past. A reckoning: last year, Keegan-Dolan made an autobiographical piece, How to Be a Dancer, in 72,000 Easy Lessons. There were many troubling moments, but he was also laughing at himself \u2013 affectionately, and frequently. Ways of living: the other two Tea\u010b Da\u1e41sa works to date, M\u00e1m and Nobodaddy, are notably less knotted to narrative than previously, animated more by music: M\u00e1m was a partnership with Irish concertina virtuoso Cormac Begley, Nobodaddy with almost uncategorisable American folk musician Sam Amidon. Neither avoids the dark side but both are often also upbeat and convivial; Nobodaddy in particular is a remarkably profuse tumble of scenes and styles, stories and songs, framed by intimations of death yet alive with spirit and variety. The work\u2019s subtitle is \u201cTr\u00edd an bpoll gan bun\u201d (\u201cthrough the bottomless pit\u201d). Keegan-Dolan laughs again. \u201cThrough, you know? Through! You don\u2019t want to get stuck there.\u201d Has Tea\u010b Da\u1e41sa \u2013 which moved into its own premises earlier this year \u2013 helped him come unstuck? \u201cTea\u010b Da\u1e41sa means house of dance,\u201d he says. \u201cThat also connects to Irish identity, because so many had our homes taken from us.

Here in Cardiff, his team paid evidence to their coach\u2019s words. They bossed the point of contact with Rob Valetini and Seru Uru rampaging in the loose. The heft of Will Skelton secured the maul both on defence and attack. Samu Kerevi \u2013 before he was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle \u2013 punched holes in midfield. Pulling the strings was White who, at 34, might lack the spark of Tate McDermott, but as a scrum-half who can keep phases ticking with the efficiency of a metronome, he\u2019s the most accomplished man available.</p> <p>Often it was simple and pragmatic, two words that Schmidt has used to describe himself and his philosophy. The one-eyed romantics might not like it, but there\u2019s nothing fans find more entertaining than following a winning team. Thanks to a shift in identity, the Wallabies\u2019 ambitionsof a clean sweep on their autumn tour remain intact after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/17/wales-australia-autumn-nations-series-match-report\">a 52-20 triumph</a>.</p> <p>That is not to say they\u2019re the finished product just yet. Far from it. Having raced to a 19-0 lead, with Tom Wright scoring his first of three stunners, Matt Faessler driving over his first of three from rolling mauls, and Nick Frost hauling his huge frame across a third of the pitch to dot down under the poles, they inexplicably lost their shape. Wales scored 13 unanswered points and some of that recurring brittleness appeared in the golden ranks. Ball carriers found themselves isolated. Tacklers slipped off their men. And the worst Welsh side for 22 years made the Wallabies look ordinary.</p> <p>Maybe some harsh words were spoken in the shed at half-time. Not likely. Schmidt doesn\u2019t seem the sort to bring out the hairdryer. A stern lecture from the 59-year-old Kiwi probably involves a power point presentation. Whatever the cause, they went back to basics. Strong, straight carries. Short passes to narrow runners. Even when Kerevi was shown a yellow card that turned into red, they kept it simple. Two quick tries courtesy of grunting mauls provided the torque for Faessler to complete his hat-trick \u2013 the first Australian hooker to do so \u2013 before the hour mark.</p>    <p>These are not the swashbucklers of 1984 that included Mark Ella, David Campese and Nick Farr-Jones. They\u2019re not the world-beaters of 1999 that were blessed to have Stephen Larkham, George Gregan and John Eales. Honesty and humility have been in short supply at Rugby Australia. Neutral observers have known for some time what the Wallabies had become. Schmidt knows it and his sensible approach has given them an identity that allows them to be competitive.</p> <p>Does this mean they\u2019ll have the beating of better teams? They lost twice to the All Blacks and twice to the Springboks. And after pinching a victory in the rain in La Plata, Argentina then stuffed them 67-27 a week later.</p> <p>However, fluctuations in form feel better than being consistently abject, and who could argue against the recent evidence? In just two weeks they\u2019ve broken their record points tallies in London and Cardiff. They\u2019ve scored 13 tries and welcomed back long-lost fans from the cold with some breathtaking moves.</p> <p>But they\u2019ve done so on a bedrock of principles that don\u2019t make the highlights reels. Between the counterattacks and offloads, they cleared rucks at pace, held firm in the set piece and challenged at the breakdown. Schmidt is instilling a sense of belief that the dark days are well and truly in the rearview. This still feels like the start of a journey, but it\u2019s going well so far.</p>",

They bossed the point of contact with Rob Valetini and Seru Uru rampaging in the loose. The heft of Will Skelton secured the maul both on defence and attack. Samu Kerevi \u2013 before he was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle \u2013 punched holes in midfield. Pulling the strings was White who, at 34, might lack the spark of Tate McDermott, but as a scrum-half who can keep phases ticking with the efficiency of a metronome, he\u2019s the most accomplished man available. Often it was simple and pragmatic, two words that Schmidt has used to describe himself and his philosophy. The one-eyed romantics might not like it, but there\u2019s nothing fans find more entertaining than following a winning team. Thanks to a shift in identity, the Wallabies\u2019 ambitionsof a clean sweep on their autumn tour remain intact after a 52-20 triumph. That is not to say they\u2019re the finished product just yet. Far from it. Having raced to a 19-0 lead, with Tom Wright scoring his first of three stunners, Matt Faessler driving over his first of three from rolling mauls, and Nick Frost hauling his huge frame across a third of the pitch to dot down under the poles, they inexplicably lost their shape. Wales scored 13 unanswered points and some of that recurring brittleness appeared in the golden ranks. Ball carriers found themselves isolated. Tacklers slipped off their men. And the worst Welsh side for 22 years made the Wallabies look ordinary. Maybe some harsh words were spoken in the shed at half-time. Not likely. Schmidt doesn\u2019t seem the sort to bring out the hairdryer. A stern lecture from the 59-year-old Kiwi probably involves a power point presentation. Whatever the cause, they went back to basics. Strong, straight carries. Short passes to narrow runners. Even when Kerevi was shown a yellow card that turned into red, they kept it simple. Two quick tries courtesy of grunting mauls provided the torque for Faessler to complete his hat-trick \u2013 the first Australian hooker to do so \u2013 before the hour mark. These are not the swashbucklers of 1984 that included Mark Ella, David Campese and Nick Farr-Jones. They\u2019re not the world-beaters of 1999 that were blessed to have Stephen Larkham, George Gregan and John Eales. Honesty and humility have been in short supply at Rugby Australia. Neutral observers have known for some time what the Wallabies had become. Schmidt knows it and his sensible approach has given them an identity that allows them to be competitive. Does this mean they\u2019ll have the beating of better teams? They lost twice to the All Blacks and twice to the Springboks. And after pinching a victory in the rain in La Plata, Argentina then stuffed them 67-27 a week later. However, fluctuations in form feel better than being consistently abject, and who could argue against the recent evidence? In just two weeks they\u2019ve broken their record points tallies in London and Cardiff. They\u2019ve scored 13 tries and welcomed back long-lost fans from the cold with some breathtaking moves. But they\u2019ve done so on a bedrock of principles that don\u2019t make the highlights reels. Between the counterattacks and offloads, they cleared rucks at pace, held firm in the set piece and challenged at the breakdown. Schmidt is instilling a sense of belief that the dark days are well and truly in the rearview. This still feels like the start of a journey, but it\u2019s going well so far.",

Whatever Fritz can do on serve, Sinner seems determined to show he can do better. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-673a248d8f08462ddd0c6cad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-17T17:19:04.698Z\">5.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: Sinner* 0-1 Fritz (*denotes next server)</strong></p> <p>So it\u2019s Fritz who steps up to serve first. The American quickly shows that he\u2019s got one of the best serves in the business with an ace on the opening point. He backs that up with a backhand cross-court winner, a shot that worked so well against Zverev in the semi-finals yesterday. Sinner then comes up with a backhand winner of his own, this one down the line. 30-15. 30-all. 40-30, as Fritz takes matters into his own hands by coming into the net and putting away the volley. Fritz gets his name on the board when Sinner smacks a backhand into the net. A strong start from Fritz; he knows he can\u2019t allow Sinner, of all players, a head start. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-673a23ed8f08462ddd0c6ca6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-17T17:14:51.134Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>So does Fritz need to do anything different to his group-stage defeat by Sinner?</strong> I don\u2019t think so \u2013 he performed well on Tuesday, backing up his serve with controlled aggression from the baseline, and standing up to Sinner\u2019s clean, consistent and clinical ball striking. There wasn\u2019t much in it \u2013 Fritz just played a few bad points on serve in the final game of each set. The American will approach this match with the same gameplan \u2013 as will Sinner.

Just five days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/nov/12/jannik-sinner-taylor-fritz-atp-finals-group-stage-tennis-live\">Sinner\u2019s 6-4, 6-4 victory over the American</a> in the group stage, the pair go at it again, this time with the title on the line.</p> <p>Sinner\u2019s appearance in this final is, of course, no surprise; the Italian\u2019s been the man of the week, with a perfect record of four straight-sets wins, and indeed the man of 2024, securing two grand slams, five other titles and the year-end world No 1 ranking despite the cloud of his ongoing drug case hanging over him. Adding the season-ending title in front of an adoring home crowd in Turin, 12 months after he lost in the final to Novak Djokovic, has almost felt preordained.</p> <p>But the big-serving Fritz, emboldened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/16/taylor-fritz-alexander-casper-ruud-jannik-sinner-atp-finals-tennis\">his inspired performance against the in-form Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals</a>, will be focused on rewriting the script. The way he stayed calm in the clutch moments yesterday, including the final-set tie-break, was hugely impressive and if the world No 5 does the same today we could have an absorbing final \u2013 especially as the only real difference between him and Sinner on Tuesday was that the top seed dealt with the pressure points better. Fritz for sure was stronger than in September\u2019s US Open final against Sinner, and that will give him hope.</p> <p>Is it the hope that kills you or, in the words of Ted Lasso, the lack of hope that kills you? I\u2019m siding with Ted here \u2013 Fritz said after his win over Zverev that he now believes he can mix it with the best in the game and I think that gives him a chance today, even though Sinner, the purist of ball strikers with a penchant for the biggest occasions, is very much the favourite.</p> <p><strong>Sinner will get the Italian party started/Fritz will attempt to spoil it:</strong> from 6pm local time/5pm GMT.</p> <p><strong>To get you in the mood:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjO_yrqxIx8\">here are the highlight\u2019s from Tuesday\u2019s encounter</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjO_yrqxIx8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TjO_yrqxIx8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s notable that Sinner said he couldn\u2019t have played much better. He\u2019s set the bar for next season, that\u2019s for sure. He served supremely tonight and was so aggressive on the return, and once he got ahead he barely gave Fritz a glimmer. There isn\u2019t a better frontrunner in the game. So that\u2019s a wrap on the ATP Tour season \u2013 but we\u2019ve still got the Davis Cup Finals and Rafa Nadal\u2019s farewell to come from Tuesday. It\u2019s going to be emotional. Thanks for your company. Arrivederci! Sinner is speaking again, this time to Sky\u2019s Tim Henman. It was a very special event. I played some very good tennis throughout this whole week, at times I couldn\u2019t play any better actually. Very happy with how I handled every situation, sharing this moment with so many Italian fans, it\u2019s amazing. I know how much work I put in, how many sacrifices I make. I haven\u2019t decided how I\u2019ll celebrate tonight. We have Davis Cup after, so I have to be in shape for that. At the Billie Jean King Cup Finals, Britain are close to ending Canada\u2019s title defence. Katie Boulter leads Leylah Fernandez, the 2021 US Open runner-up, 6-2, 3-0 with the double break, and victory would mean Britain advance to the semi-finals 2-0 after Emma Raducanu\u2019s win earlier. Another ridiculous stat: Sinner has won a set in every match he\u2019s played in 2024. \u201cDjokovic a few years ago is the last time we saw a season like this,\u201d says Laura Robson on Sky Sports. The only elephant in the room, as Sinner sprays champagne on court, is Wada\u2019s ongoing case against the world No 1 for his two failed drug tests. But the way he has been able to maintain his focus, while still having the threat of a ban hanging over him, has been remarkable. Sinner then switches to Italian. I understand the \u201cgrazies\u201d but not much else. Sinner lifts the season-ending trophy for the first time in front of his adoring home crowd. Cue the tickertape and pyrotechnics and another ear-piercing round of \u201cOLE OLE OLE OLE SINNER, SINNER! OLE OLE OLE OLE SINNER, SINNER!\u201d It couldn\u2019t have been scripted any better. He\u2019s been the perfect leading man in the first ATP Finals in 23 years not to feature Federer, Nadal or Djokovic. Taylor, first of all, congrats to you for an amazing week again. You\u2019ve been so consistent throughout the season. You\u2019ve been working so hard to be in this position, keep going, you\u2019re on the right track. Just a quick word to Carlos, 40 years of umpiring, amazing career, you might still be in Davis Cup, but me and Taylor feel very privileged to be part of your last ATP journey. Fritz then trudges up to collect his runner-up trophy. A classy gesture from the Italian crowd, as they give the American a long standing ovation. He looks really moved and thanks them. I want to stay congrats to Jannik and his team. An insane year for you, it\u2019s really impressive. Thank you for my team for putting up with me. It\u2019s been a long year, I couldn\u2019t do it without you. It\u2019s a great tournament, it\u2019s amazing to end the year here, it\u2019s been a great week and thank you to the fans. Being an American in Italy, even playing Jannik twice this week, I still felt the crowd was amazing. Thank you for that. Speeches and trophy time. And there\u2019s a huge cheer as it\u2019s announced the ATP Finals will stay in Italy until 2030. It\u2019s not clear if that means Turin; there has been talk the tournament could move to Milan. \u201cViva Italia!\u201d the president of the Italian Tennis Federation exclaims. And now recognition for Carlos Bernardes, the Brazilian umpire who officiated this match and is now retiring after a 40-year career. Fritz is slumped in his chair. A consolation for him: he\u2019ll rise to career-high ranking of world No 4. At the age of 27, reaching this final and the final of the US Open, this has been the best year of his career too. Sinner has lost only one match since the second week of August. He finishes with 70 ATP Tour match wins for the season and only six defeats (three of those coming against Carlos Alcaraz). And he\u2019s the first Italian winner of this tournament. Sinner is up in the stands celebrating with his team and then, still sweating, he speaks: It\u2019s amazing. Amazing week. My first title in Italy, it means so much to me. Very special. It was a very high-level tournament from my side. At times I couldn\u2019t play better so I\u2019m very happy. So Sinner steps up to serve for the championship. He dices with danger on the first point, going for his inside-out forehand just a little more than he probably needs to, but it grazes the baseline. 15-0. A nervy miss and it\u2019s 15-all. So the world No 1 is human sometimes too. But then Sinner is the superhero again, as he delivers the sweetest of drop shots to finish off a draining duel. 30-15. 40-15, secured with a fizzing forehand, and it\u2019s two championship points. Fritz flings his forehand wide and Sinner gets his Italian job done! He secures his first ATP Finals title and his eighth title of the year, adding to his Australian Open and US Open victories. His breakout season must now feel complete. It\u2019s been near perfection in Turin; he\u2019s the first player since Ivan Lendl to win the season-ending tournament without dropping a set. Second set: Sinner* 6-4, 5-4 Fritz (*denotes next server) There\u2019s another round of \u201cOLE OLE OLE OLE SINNER, SINNER! OLE OLE OLE OLE SINNER, SINNER!\u201d Fritz blocks out the noise and holds to love. Much credit to the American, but he\u2019s probably just delaying the inevitable. Second set: Sinner 6-4, 5-3 Fritz* (*denotes next server) A rare loss of concentration for Sinner turns 15-0 into 15-all. But he atones for his sins with a crushing cross-court forehand that the lanky Italian leaps into the air to hit. Ooooff, take that. 30-15, 30-all, 40-30, as Sinner batters the lines again with his serve. That\u2019s ace NO 13. But another brief lapse and it\u2019s deuce. Sinner\u2019s 210kph serve sets up the next point. And a stinging and snarling ace down the T secures the game. The home hero is a game away. Second set: Sinner* 6-4, 4-3 Fritz (*denotes next server) 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game Fritz. The way this is going, it could be the same scoreline as their group match, when Sinner won 6-4, 6-4, with one break in each set. Sinner hasn\u2019t dropped more than four games in any set this week, such has been the world No 1\u2019s dominance. Second set: Sinner 6-4, 4-2 Fritz* (*denotes next server) The staggering thing about Sinner is that he hits with such power, but has so much margin for error too; with his top-spin he gets so much height over the net with his shots. Fritz cancels out Sinner\u2019s power with a cute drop shot for 30-all. But Sinner is fist-pumping and shaking his racket in celebration with a backhand drive down the line. There have been so many of those today. 40-30. Game. Fritz groans. Sinner skips to his chair having consolidated the break. Sinner breaks: Sinner* 6-4, 3-2 Fritz (*denotes next server) Risky, risky play from Fritz at 30-all and it doesn\u2019t pay off. 30-40. Fritz cannot afford to be broken here. He saves the break point, but Sinner is back at him again straight away, turning defence into attack with a bullet of a backhand that a flailing Fritz can\u2019t get back into play. Advantage Sinner. Break Sinner, as Fritz hoiks a forehand long. Fritz just can\u2019t breathe out there. He\u2019s very much in the danger zone now, while Sinner is sensing victory. Oh the japes. Second set: Sinner 6-4, 2-2 Fritz* (*denotes next server) At 30-0, a collective groan as Sinner hits long. He blows on his sweaty hands, bounces the ball (which always sounds just that bit louder indoors), and then a squeaky-shoed rally ends with Fritz running forward \u2026 and planting his forehand volley into the net. The American smiles wryly and plays the shot again with his racket, between points, just to reset. Not that it helps. Sinner holds. Second set: Sinner* 6-4, 1-2 Fritz (*denotes next server) What can Fritz do differently here? I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much, especially when Sinner is in this serving form. Again, as on Tuesday in their group match, Fritz is playing well, it\u2019s just that Sinner is playing slightly better. That\u2019s why Sinner is the best player in the world right now. Perhaps Fritz needs to channel his inner Djokovic and imagine the crowd are shouting \u201cFritz, Fritz, Fritz.\u201d The tables have certainly turned from the US Open final, when Fritz had best part of 23,000 spectators on his side, and it still wasn\u2019t enough. Fritz, though, does hold here to 15. Second set: Sinner 6-4, 1-1 Fritz* (*denotes next server) Fritz finds his feet at the start of the second set to hold to 30. But he can\u2019t make any inroads on Sinner\u2019s serve. A 12th ace takes the Italian to 40-0. And a wild forehand from Fritz ends the game. It\u2019s all going on. Over in Malaga at the Billie Jean King Cup, Emma Raducanu has put Britain 1-0 up in their quarter-final against the defending champions Canada, fending off seven break points in the second set to defeat Rebecca Marino 6-0, 7-5. It\u2019s now over to Katie Boulter to try to finish the tie off against Leylah Fernandez, the player Raducanu beat in the 2021 US Open final. Fritz pierces Sinner\u2019s defences on the first point. An eighth ace from Sinner restores parity at 15-all. Sinner then jams Fritz with a body serve; Fritz absorbs the blow and gets it back but Sinner swats away the winner. 30-15, 30-all, 40-30, set point, courtesy of Sinner\u2019s ninth ace. Virginia Bocelli chews on her fingernails. She\u2019s nervous. And so is Sinner, or perhaps he\u2019s a little over-excited, as he goes for too much on his forehand. Deuce. Advantage Fritz, as a shaky forehand from Sinner sits up invitingly for the American, who drills a winner down the line. Deuce. Advantage Sinner. And he seals it, very appropriately given his serving performance, with another ace. Sinner\u2019s perfect record continues; that\u2019s the ninth consecutive set he\u2019s won at this tournament and he\u2019s a set away from his first ATP Finals title. First set: Sinner* 5-4 Fritz (*denotes next server) 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. There\u2019s nothing giving here, as Fritz does at least force Sinner to serve this set out. First set: Sinner 5-3 Fritz* (*denotes next server) \u201cOLE OLE OLE OLE SINNER, SINNER! OLE OLE OLE OLE SINNER, SINNER!\u201d chant the crowd at the changeover. I\u2019ve never seen so many screaming humans dressed as carrots. Once they settle, Sinner smoothly moves to 30-0. And soon 40-0. He still hasn\u2019t dropped a point behind his first serve. And that\u2019s the game as he backs up the break. He\u2019s out-serving one of the best servers in the game here. Sinner breaks: Sinner* 4-3 Fritz (*denotes next server) How much of a factor will the 12,000-strong pro-Sinner crowd be tonight? I think you can argue it both ways. Yes, Fritz is not only having to play the world No 1 but also the crowd \u2013 but you could also argue it takes the pressure off in some ways because he\u2019s very much the underdog. The cheers of the crowd must be ringing in his ears, though, as he hits long to gift Sinner two break points at 15-40, the first break points of the match. A big serve out wide \u2026 Sinner scoops it back \u2026 and Fritz goes back behind a stumbling Sinner for the winner! Smart. And an ace out wide drags Fritz to deuce. Advantage Fritz, after Sinner shanks his shot. Deuce. Advantage Sinner, a third break point. The best point of the match so far, as the pair go backwards and forwards and left and right and Fritz hits successive half volleys \u2026 and Fritz finally emerges victorious! Deuce. Advantage Fritz. Deuce. Advantage Sinner, a fourth break point. And this time Sinner takes it as he whips the crowd into an Italian frenzy with the shrewdest of drop shots! First set: Sinner 3-3 Fritz* (*denotes next server) Fritz makes an early dent on Sinner\u2019s serve for 0-15. Sinner swiftly responds for 30-15. The Italian\u2019s up to four aces now; his serving has been exceptional so far, and he\u2019s still 100% for first-serve points won. A 16-shot rally and Sinner prevails in that too. Fritz attempts to pass Sinner at the net but drags his backhand wide. Sinner holds to 15. First set: *Sinner 2-3 Fritz (*denotes next server) Sinner ends the run of points for the server by showing off his superb defence for 0-15. And he\u2019s got a chance on a second serve on the second point. Sinner makes Fritz pay for the short ball by stepping in and ramming away the forehand winner for 0-30. But Fritz fends off the attack with two serve bombs. 30-all. And from there the world No 5 holds. And the good news is he doesn\u2019t seem at all intimated by the big occasion. This is a more assured start than he made in the US Open final against Sinner. First set: Sinner 2-2 Fritz* (*denotes next server) The first-serve stats here from both players are hugely impressive. Sinner has landed 71% of his first serves, winning 100% of those points. And Fritz has made 90% of his first serves, claiming 78% of those points. This game sticks to the same script, with Sinner securing his second consecutive hold to love. First set: *Sinner 1-2 Fritz (*denotes next server) But here\u2019s an effortless service game from Fritz, as he too holds to love with a short, sharp response. This is turning into an early serving shootout. First set: Sinner 1-1 Fritz* (*denotes next server) 15-0. Cheer. 30-0. An even bigger cheer. 40-0. The stadium erupts. Game Sinner, as the applauding fans wearing neon orange in tribute to their hero are illuminated by the stadium\u2019s UV lights. Two aces from Sinner already and Fritz didn\u2019t get a look-in in that game. Whatever Fritz can do on serve, Sinner seems determined to show he can do better. First set: Sinner* 0-1 Fritz (*denotes next server) So it\u2019s Fritz who steps up to serve first. The American quickly shows that he\u2019s got one of the best serves in the business with an ace on the opening point. He backs that up with a backhand cross-court winner, a shot that worked so well against Zverev in the semi-finals yesterday. Sinner then comes up with a backhand winner of his own, this one down the line. 30-15. 30-all. 40-30, as Fritz takes matters into his own hands by coming into the net and putting away the volley. Fritz gets his name on the board when Sinner smacks a backhand into the net. A strong start from Fritz; he knows he can\u2019t allow Sinner, of all players, a head start. So does Fritz need to do anything different to his group-stage defeat by Sinner? I don\u2019t think so \u2013 he performed well on Tuesday, backing up his serve with controlled aggression from the baseline, and standing up to Sinner\u2019s clean, consistent and clinical ball striking. There wasn\u2019t much in it \u2013 Fritz just played a few bad points on serve in the final game of each set. The American will approach this match with the same gameplan \u2013 as will Sinner. I\u2019m backing Sinner to make it a double over Fritz, but if we\u2019re lucky we may get three sets this evening. A lanky Sinner strides to the net, does a few groin stretches for good measure and the pair pose for the pre-match photos. I\u2019m not sure who won the coin toss there; I couldn\u2019t pick it up from the on-court microphones. It\u2019s hard to hear much over this crowd. The fans have been loud this week \u2013 but Sinner\u2019s entrance, a couple of minutes after Fritz, is another level as 12,000 spectators rise to their feet to salute their numero uno, with the stands teeming with orange wigs, Italian flags and of course the die-hard carrots. There isn\u2019t a spare seat in the house. Darkness has descended in the Inalpi Arena and Virginia Bocelli returns to sing the Italian national anthem. And for the last time this week we\u2019ve got the giant screens showing a tennis ball bouncing to the sound of a heartbeat. Sinner and Fritz\u2019s hearts must be beating pretty loudly too right now. They\u2019re waiting in the wings as montages of both players are played to the crowd. Raducanu\u2019s got the first set on the board in Malaga, 6-0 over Rebecca Marino in just 28 minutes. Marino leads 2-1 on serve in the second. The players haven\u2019t arrived on court yet but there\u2019s already been a spine-tingling moment with Virginia Bocelli, the 12-year-old daughter of the Italian great Andrea Boccelli, signing a rousing version of You Raise Me Up. Sinner and Fritz should be out in a few minutes. Fritz says: I trust my game and I trust my level. I don\u2019t feel anywhere near as uncomfortable in these situations any more because I\u2019ve been putting myself in these situations against the top guys at big events a lot lately. I\u2019m really confident in my game. The US Open final felt like I was kind of just trying to keep myself in with my serve, stay alive, win points by hitting big shots or playing off of his errors. Kind of just like not repeatable, consistent ways to win points. The match we played here, I felt much more comfortable from the baseline. I had my chances in that match. I had chances to break him in both sets. He had an equal amount of chances, and he took his. He played the big points better than I did in the group stage match. Sinner says: Very similar circumstances and moments because we played already in the round robin and now the final but I just try to play the best I can [today]. Everything can happen. I\u2019m just happy to be back here [in the final]. From last year now, I feel like I have more experience, I\u2019ve grown as a player and hopefully [today] is going to be a good day. If not, again, a very positive week. This year has been a very positive year so I\u2019m very happy. Road to the final. Sinner, with his 100% record, will be feeling the fresher of the two, especially after dropping only three games yesterday in his total destruction of Casper Ruud. \u201cJannik hits a faster ball than Novak. He doesn\u2019t let you breathe. Every kind of groundstroke feels like rockets,\u201d was Ruud\u2019s reaction. Sinner Group stage Won v Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-4 Won v Fritz 6-4, 6-4 Won v Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 6-4 Semi-final Won v Ruud 6-1, 6-2 Fritz Group stage Won v Medvedev 6-4, 6-3 Lost v Sinner 6-4, 6-4 Won v De Minaur 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 Semi-final Won v Alexander Zverev 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (3) Back to Turin, and Fritz is the first American to reach the season-ending final since 2006, when James Blake lost to Roger Federer, while Pete Sampras was the last player from the US to win the title in 1999 when he beat his compatriot Andre Agassi in Hanover. There\u2019s a signature Sampras slam duck or two and a peak Agassi backhand winner or two or three in these highlights. Australia are out though: Meanwhile over in Malaga, Britain, who have never won the Billie Jean King Cup, are facing defending champions Canada in the last eight. The first match between Emma Raducanu and Rebecca Marino is under way and Raducanu\u2019s raced into a 4-0 lead in the opening set. Katie Boulter v Leylah Fernandez will follow, with a potential doubles between Olivia Nicholls/Heather Watson and Fernandez/Gaby Dabrowski if needed to decide the tie. Our tennis correspondent Tumaini Carayol is there: The doubles champions have already been crowned in Turin, with the eighth seeds Kevin Krawietz and Tim P\u00fctz shocking the world No 1 pairing of Croatia\u2019s Mate Pavic and El Salvador\u2019s Marcelo Ar\u00e9valo, who knocked out Britain\u2019s Wimbledon champion Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara yesterday. Krawietz and P\u00fctz won 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6) to become the first Germans to claim the season-ending title. Buonasera! And welcome to our coverage of Sinner v Fritz part due. Just five days after Sinner\u2019s 6-4, 6-4 victory over the American in the group stage, the pair go at it again, this time with the title on the line. Sinner\u2019s appearance in this final is, of course, no surprise; the Italian\u2019s been the man of the week, with a perfect record of four straight-sets wins, and indeed the man of 2024, securing two grand slams, five other titles and the year-end world No 1 ranking despite the cloud of his ongoing drug case hanging over him. Adding the season-ending title in front of an adoring home crowd in Turin, 12 months after he lost in the final to Novak Djokovic, has almost felt preordained. But the big-serving Fritz, emboldened by his inspired performance against the in-form Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals, will be focused on rewriting the script. The way he stayed calm in the clutch moments yesterday, including the final-set tie-break, was hugely impressive and if the world No 5 does the same today we could have an absorbing final \u2013 especially as the only real difference between him and Sinner on Tuesday was that the top seed dealt with the pressure points better. Fritz for sure was stronger than in September\u2019s US Open final against Sinner, and that will give him hope. Is it the hope that kills you or, in the words of Ted Lasso, the lack of hope that kills you? I\u2019m siding with Ted here \u2013 Fritz said after his win over Zverev that he now believes he can mix it with the best in the game and I think that gives him a chance today, even though Sinner, the purist of ball strikers with a penchant for the biggest occasions, is very much the favourite. Sinner will get the Italian party started/Fritz will attempt to spoil it: from 6pm local time/5pm GMT. To get you in the mood: here are the highlight\u2019s from Tuesday\u2019s encounter.",

They\u2019ve got a history of winning, especially the under-21 players, and they expect to win when they turn up to play for England.</p> <p>[What has this stint given you as a coach?] I think it\u2019s given the staff and myself the confidence that we can do the job. That was a big thing \u2013 you always doubt yourself and whether you can do it or not. </p> <p>We often speak about how there\u2019s a lot of England manager sat in their house picking the team and squad.

But disappointingly he was replaced by someone called Jack Charlton.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tim Woods </strong>\u201c<strong>Portsmouth 1-2 Sheffield Wednesday</strong> in 1987. I don\u2019t remember much of the game except that Mark Chamberlain scored a goal. My abiding memory is the atmosphere\u2026 Fratton Park was quite the experience as a wide-eyed 10-year-old.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bogdan Kotarlic \u201cYugoslavia 5-0 Cyprus</strong>, November 1979, European Championship qualification. I was seven years old, Yugoslavia won 5-0 and I felt awesome. I loved that country and I am still sad that Yugoslavia does\u2019t exist anymore. Still, there are some great footballing memories regarding that country although we were always underachievers.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Richard Hirst </strong>\u201c<strong>Fulham 3-3 Millwall</strong> in the FA Cup in 1965. Fulham, in the old Division 1, were leading Millwall (Division 4) 3-1 with not long to go. Needless to say we lost the replay. Perfect preparation for a life supporting Fulham.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Nigel </strong>\u201cMy first match was watching <strong>Walton and Hersham</strong> at Stompond Lane in what was then the Athenian league. I don\u2019t remember the opponent or the score but I followed them for years until they went to the amateur FA cup at Wembley where they won, 2-1 I think. I think my dad was as thrilled as I was.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bruce Crawford </strong>\u201cOld Trafford, 5 <strong>December 1964</strong>. So coming up to 60 years ago! My mum and dad took me aged 5 to see United for the first time and I just have a memory of fog. The game was very nearly abandoned, and in fact was temporarily suspended at which point I remember being taken back to the car by my mum. Dad arrived later when it finally finished and Leeds had won 1-0. I was hooked for life, and got to see those who became my heroes Best, Law &amp; Charlton, but it shows how the memory plays tricks because for years I had an image in my head of Billy Bremner looming out of the fog, only to find out more recently he hadn\u2019t even signed for Leeds at that point!\u201d</p> <p><em>[He was at Leeds but you might be thinking of <a href=\"https://unitedwriting.substack.com/p/united-leeds-rivalry-1965-george-best-matt-busby\">the FA Cup semi-final later that season</a>.]</em></p> <p><strong>Nigel Moore</strong> \u201cI remember my dad taking my brother and me to see <strong>Sunderland play Man City</strong> at Maine Road 1953-54 when I was six. The only memory of the game I have is all the legs of the spectators but afterwards trying to play like Len Shackleton who was the big star then.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Dave Radmore</strong> \u201cI\u2019m the anecdotal proof that hosting a summer tournament creates new fans. After the joy and ultimate disappointment of the Euro 96 summer, I was invited to go along to the opening match of the season at <strong>Cambridge United</strong> by a friend. They won 1-0, couldn\u2019t tell you who they played <em>[Barnet \u2013 ed]</em>, and I was immediately hooked for 30 years of pretty much abject misery with the occasional bright spot, and wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Darren </strong>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to that many matches (five) so I can remember every one. My first was as a glory-hunting <strong>Liverpool</strong> fan in London. My mum asked if I wanted to see them play her team Arsenal at Highbury. I was ten, and this sounded like a great idea. We were in the East Stand, near to the North, and I couldn\u2019t see a thing. Just as well, my beloved \u2018Pool got tonked 3-1, and I only knew about the late consolation goal thanks to commentary from my mother.\u201d</p> <p><em>[I think that was September 1984]</em></p> <p><strong>John Parry </strong>\u201c18 September 18 1971.

Maybe two of them? </p> <p>\u201cHe also seems to understand the idea of \u2018rotation\u2019, not overburdening your best players, picking on merit and form, not reputation.

      "bodyText": "David Hytner was at Wembley for us today. I\u2019ll leave you with his report of a game of two distinct 45-minute segments. Lee Carsley verdict It was a good performance. We played with real intent and it was frustrating to come off 0-0 at half-time. I believed we\u2019d score goals if we kept doing what we spoke about and it was great that we got out rewards in the end. It was a great pass [for the first goal] and a great evening for a lot of the players [who scored their first goals for England]. The main thing was to get promotion and it\u2019s pleasing in that respect. When [Jarrod Bowen] went on I said to him, \u2018Just shoot every time you get the ball!\u2019 He\u2019s got great quality and sometimes he can be a bit unselfish. He\u2019s got to make sure he gets the goals and assists that he deserves. [What\u2019s the overriding emotion after this campaign?] I suppose it\u2019s relief. I wanted the England team to be exciting to watch, to be attacking, to show what I see day-in day-out on the training ground. [On picking so many debutants] I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a gamble \u2013 these are excellent players with a mentality that stands out. They\u2019ve got a history of winning, especially the under-21 players, and they expect to win when they turn up to play for England. [What has this stint given you as a coach?] I think it\u2019s given the staff and myself the confidence that we can do the job. That was a big thing \u2013 you always doubt yourself and whether you can do it or not. We often speak about how there\u2019s a lot of England manager sat in their house picking the team and squad. So to have the responsibility to do that \u2013 and the trust from my bosses \u2013 has given me a massive boost of confidence. \u201cSo,\u201d begins K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cmy son watched his team get comfortably beat by a mid-ranking European side on a cold November evening, with Finland offering little of quality beyond the halftime hot dog and cocoa. He can\u2019t wait to go again.\u201d The ITV pundits, Roy Keane and Ian Wright, are going through the goals and have just got to the fifth by Taylor Harwood-Bellis Marc Pougatch (presenter) Not everyone knows, that is your future son-in-law. Roy Keane (deadpan) It\u2019s not done and dusted yet. Listen, things can change very quickly in the Keane household. Harry Kane\u2019s reaction It\u2019s been a really good camp \u2013 we got the job done. It was a tough first half but we came out for the second half with a lot more energy and we finished it off. [Is that as good a pass as you\u2019ve hit?] I think so. Yeah it\u2019s probably one of the best. I expected Jude to score but it probably worked out best with them getting a man sent off and us getting a penalty. [On four players getting their first goal for England] Amazing. We spoke in the week about there being opportunities for new lads and other players who have been in the squad without getting the minutes. There were a couple of great finishes. It was nice for Jarrod to come on and score straight away. Thomas has got a lot of players to choose from \u2013 a lot of young players who have come in and done really well and some experienced boys who are injured, who we want to come back and fight for their place. We\u2019ve got a good balance. [On Lee Carsley] He\u2019s been top-drawer, him and all the staff as well. It\u2019s never easy to go again straight after a major tournament; sometimes the motivation isn\u2019t as great. But the coaching team showed great energy, brought through some young lads and I\u2019m really glad we won today to finish off happy. There are no extravagant gestures from Carsley at the final whistle, not that we expected any. He really should have charged onto the field, one finger raised, like Jose at the Nou Camp in 2010. Carsley\u2019s would have even more iconic given he\u2019s wearing a puffer jacket rather than a sharp suit. Fifty-eight years of hurt have finally come to an end: England have won Group B2 of the Nations League. They overwhelmed ten-man Ireland in the second half, scoring five times in 27 increasingly euphoric minutes. It was all sparked by a stunning pass from Harry Kane, which led to a penalty and a red card for Ireland\u2019s Liam Scales. 90+3 min I got something wrong: Jarrod Bowen\u2019s goal was also his first for England, which means there have been four new goalscorers in this game. According to Opta, that hasn\u2019t happened in an England game since 1930. 90+1 min Three minutes of added time. 90 min Barring any more goals, Lee Carsley\u2019s record as England manager will be P6 W5 D0 L1 F16 A3 Pts 15. 89 min Another save from Kelleher, this time to flap away Bowen\u2019s mishit shot. Ireland break and Gomes is booked for a tactical foul. 88 min Kelleher makes a pretty good save, adjusting his feet to kick away a crisp low shot from Kane. 86 min: Ireland substitution Sammie Szmodics is replaced by Kasey McAteer. 86 min Bellingham\u2019s shot from the edge of the area is blocked, possibly by Kane. There were about 15 players in the penalty area. 85 min A weary O\u2019Shea fouls Rogers and is booked. 84 min This is cruel on Ireland, though there are genuine positives to take in the quality of their performance for the first 50 minutes. One truly magnificent pass from Harry Kane changed everything. 82 min Bald fraud or bald genius? I think we know the answer. 81 min Just before that goal, Angel Gomes came on for Curtis Jones in midfield. Lee Carsley\u2019s farewell has turned into a feelgood romp. Harwood-Bellis stayed up for a corner and met Bellingham\u2019s fine driven cross with an excellent header back across Kelleher. He\u2019s the third player to score their first England goal in the last 25 minutes. Taylor Harwood-Bellis scores on his debut! 79 min Collins makes a desperate lunging tackle to stop Solanke, six yards out, putting Bowen\u2019s low cross into the net. For 50 minutes Ireland had their bodies in the oven and their brains in the fridge. Since then the whole lot has been in the oven. It was a fine free-kick, straight from the training ground. Bellingham took it short, near the corner flag on the left, got it back and slid a crisp low pass towards the penalty spot. Bowen ran round the ball and whipped a first-time shot past the unsighted Kelleher. Excellent goal. Jarrod Bowen scores with his first touch! 76 min \u201cMy first game: New York Cosmos 6-2 Valur (Icelandic champions) in a friendly in Reykjavik in 1981,\u201d writes Alex Moffett. \u201cA hattrick from Giorgio Chinaglia. Me and my dad, wind chill of ten degrees, metal bleachers. Paradise lost.\u201d No phones either I\u2019ll wager. 75 min: Triple substitution for England Dominic Solanke, Morgan Rogers and Jarrod Bowen replace Anthony Gordon, Conor Gallagher and Noni Madueke. 72 min Kane slips his man in the area and is about to score his second when Cullen makes a stealthy interception from the side. Terrific midfield play that. 72 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d begins Peter Oh. \u201cThat pass from Kane to Bellingham really tipped the Scales.\u201d Way-hay! 71 min Kane almost gives Madueke a shooting chance with an imaginative scooped pass. It bounces slightly awkwardly and Madueke\u2019s heavy touch puts it behind for a goalkick. 70 min \u201cThe Ireland non-penalty highlights the essential (but by no means only) problem with VAR,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cIf the on field ref doesn\u2019t give it then we bemoan our bad luck and move on. However, if the accuracy bots don\u2019t give it then we get to cry foul/conspiracy. So on behalf of my nation: FOULSPIRACY!\u201d I\u2019d like to see you put that to Roy Keane. 68 min Madueke immediately tests Manning with a slippery run into the area. He\u2019s about to shoot when Manning makes a good recovery challenge. Ireland deserve better than to be bammered here. Even the penalty wasn\u2019t really Scales\u2019 fault; he had to make that challenge. The first yellow card, for some off-the-ball posturing with Gallagher (I think) is the one that cost him. 66 min: Triple substitution for Ireland Ryan Manning, Finn Azaz and Troy Parrott replace Festy Ebosele, Evan Ferguson and Callum O\u2019Dowda. 64 min Conor Gallagher tries a rabona from the edge of the area which loops over the bar. I can\u2019t spake. 63 min The geometry of Kane\u2019s pass for the penalty was not dissimilar to this Xavi masterpiece in 2009-10. Kane was much further out, on the left wing, and had to hammer the ball, but Xavi had more moving parts and a much smaller eye in the middle. Both were truly great passes. 62 min: England substitution Southampton\u2019s Taylor Harwood-Bellis comes on for his England debut in place of Kyle Walker. 60 min Greece are now 2-0 up in Finland, a blow to K\u00e1ri Tulinius\u2019s son but probably not to England. It\u2019ll be a helluva story if Ireland get a result from here. 59 min There was a VAR check for offside but the goal stands. England have scored three in less than six minutes. For 50 minutes Ireland were almost note perfect; now they\u2019re in danger of being thrashed. Madueke\u2019s corner from the right was headed on at the near post by Guehi and poked it from two yards by Gallagher. It\u2019s his first England goal as well! That was beautifully taken. Livramento scarpered down the right and clipped a cross towards the near post. An attempted clearance deflected towards Gordon, who reacted very smartly to twist his body and crack a volley into the bottom corner from about 10 yards. The Newcastle fans will have loved that. Anthony Gordon scores his first goal for England! 54 min England needed that goal because Anastasios Bakasetas had just put Greece ahead in Finland. The pass from Kane was just stunning. Kane sends Kelleher the wrong way to give England the lead. He usually goes left, and that\u2019s where Kelleher dived, but this time he sidefooted it to the right. GOAL! Finland 0-1 Greece 51 min Kane, 40 yards from goal on the left wing, drives an unbelievable through pass to Bellingham, who chops back inside Scales and is tripped. A clear penalty \u2013 and a second yellow card for Scales, who picked up a needless booking in the first half. 47 min \u201cStonewall penalty in the 22nd minute,\u201d says Michael Kiernan. \u201cCheck it again. Guehi pulls, and holds onto Ferguson\u2019s shirt, pulling him to the ground. At no stage did Ferguson pull Guehi\u2019s shirt. Where was VAR?\u201d Yes I meant to say, having seen a replay at half time, that I got that one wrong. I guess shirt-pulling goes unpunished all the time but Guehi could have had no complaints had it been given. It feels like the VAR threshold is particularly high in Uefa competitions. Are they even using VAR today? I should probably know that. 46 min Peep peep! England begin the second half with no changes on either side. \u201cThe ref not taking any of Jude Bellingham\u2019s guff, and giving him a yellow card instead, was very satisfying,\u201d writes Matthew Lysaught. Bellingham\u2019s been different in the last year or so, hasn\u2019t he? At the Euros I thought he was a red card waiting to happen. To borrow a phrase from England\u2019s past, have a word with him. Do you remember the first time? Tim Jones \u201cMy first game was Swansea v Leeds in about 1962. My uncle took me because John Charles was supposed to play for Leeds. But disappointingly he was replaced by someone called Jack Charlton.\u201d Tim Woods \u201cPortsmouth 1-2 Sheffield Wednesday in 1987. I don\u2019t remember much of the game except that Mark Chamberlain scored a goal. My abiding memory is the atmosphere\u2026 Fratton Park was quite the experience as a wide-eyed 10-year-old.\u201d Bogdan Kotarlic \u201cYugoslavia 5-0 Cyprus, November 1979, European Championship qualification. I was seven years old, Yugoslavia won 5-0 and I felt awesome. I loved that country and I am still sad that Yugoslavia does\u2019t exist anymore. Still, there are some great footballing memories regarding that country although we were always underachievers.\u201d Richard Hirst \u201cFulham 3-3 Millwall in the FA Cup in 1965. Fulham, in the old Division 1, were leading Millwall (Division 4) 3-1 with not long to go. Needless to say we lost the replay. Perfect preparation for a life supporting Fulham.\u201d Nigel \u201cMy first match was watching Walton and Hersham at Stompond Lane in what was then the Athenian league. I don\u2019t remember the opponent or the score but I followed them for years until they went to the amateur FA cup at Wembley where they won, 2-1 I think. I think my dad was as thrilled as I was.\u201d Bruce Crawford \u201cOld Trafford, 5 December 1964. So coming up to 60 years ago! My mum and dad took me aged 5 to see United for the first time and I just have a memory of fog. The game was very nearly abandoned, and in fact was temporarily suspended at which point I remember being taken back to the car by my mum. Dad arrived later when it finally finished and Leeds had won 1-0. I was hooked for life, and got to see those who became my heroes Best, Law &amp; Charlton, but it shows how the memory plays tricks because for years I had an image in my head of Billy Bremner looming out of the fog, only to find out more recently he hadn\u2019t even signed for Leeds at that point!\u201d [He was at Leeds but you might be thinking of the FA Cup semi-final later that season.] Nigel Moore \u201cI remember my dad taking my brother and me to see Sunderland play Man City at Maine Road 1953-54 when I was six. The only memory of the game I have is all the legs of the spectators but afterwards trying to play like Len Shackleton who was the big star then.\u201d Dave Radmore \u201cI\u2019m the anecdotal proof that hosting a summer tournament creates new fans. After the joy and ultimate disappointment of the Euro 96 summer, I was invited to go along to the opening match of the season at Cambridge United by a friend. They won 1-0, couldn\u2019t tell you who they played [Barnet \u2013 ed], and I was immediately hooked for 30 years of pretty much abject misery with the occasional bright spot, and wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d Darren \u201cI haven\u2019t been to that many matches (five) so I can remember every one. My first was as a glory-hunting Liverpool fan in London. My mum asked if I wanted to see them play her team Arsenal at Highbury. I was ten, and this sounded like a great idea. We were in the East Stand, near to the North, and I couldn\u2019t see a thing. Just as well, my beloved \u2018Pool got tonked 3-1, and I only knew about the late consolation goal thanks to commentary from my mother.\u201d [I think that was September 1984] John Parry \u201c18 September 18 1971. George Best hat trick! United 4-2 West Ham. One of the many things I have to thank my dear departed dad for. The ITV cameras were there...\u201d Thanks for sending in your memories of your first live game. I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t have time to go through them all, mainly because it looked like England were going to get a red card as half-time approached. Well that wasn\u2019t great. England were frustrated by a superbly organised, occasionally niggly Ireland side and didn\u2019t manage a single shot on target. The half-time whistle comes at a good time for England, who were starting to lose their rag. As things stand England are still going to win Group B2, but that\u2019s only because Greece are also drawing in Finland. 45+3 min: It\u2019s kicking off! Molumby tries to block Kane, who throws him to the canvas, at which point some players on both sides get involved. Both players are booked. 45 min Three minutes of added time. There still hasn\u2019t ben a shot on target. 43 min And now Scales has been booked for some off-the-ball nonsense. 42 min That frustration I was talking about: Bellingham has also been booked, presumably for dissent. 41 min O\u2019Dowda turns the tables on Madueke, who brings him down and is booked. England are getting increasingly frustrated. 39 min Kane overruns the ball slightly, allowing Scales to make an empathic and entirely fair man-and-ball challenge. The Ireland fans enjoyed that. 38 min Hall\u2019s chipped cross is diverted to Madueke, whose off-balance shot is blocked. Hall has arguably been England\u2019s best player in the first half. 36 min Szmodics, back on the field, wants a penalty after going down in the England area. For a split-second it looked like he would be through on goal after a long pass by O\u2019Shea (I think), but Walker stooped to get a crucial headed touch back to Pickford. 36 min Bellingham slashes a half-volley well wide with his left foot. Ireland have done a really good job on England so far. 35 min I\u2019m happy to say it looks like that was a false alarm \u2013 he\u2019s ready to come back on the field. The way he fell looked horrible, slightly reminiscent of Simon Jones\u2019 awful injury in the 2002-03 Ashes. 33 min Sammie Szmodics is down with what looks like a nasty injury. His foot got stuck in the turf, with nobody else near him, and he immediately started punching the ground in pain. This looks serious I\u2019m afraid; it could be ligament damage. 30 min England take a short corner to Bellingham, who plays an imaginative give-and-go with Madueke and then drags a cross on the turn well wide. The angle was far too tight by the time he got to the ball, but it was a nice idea. 29 min Madueke appeals unsuccessfully for a penalty when his close-range shot is blocked by Scales. 27 min Lewis Hall makes a good run behind the defence on the left and drives a dangerous low cross that is booted away at the near post by Collins. 25 min Not much is happening. You\u2019d expect England to break Ireland down eventually but they haven\u2019t managed a shot on target so far. The one save Kelleher made was from a Madueke cross in the fifth minute. 22 min Guehi and Ferguson grab one another\u2019s shirts in the penalty area, a tactic that is more risky for Guehi. Again the referee isn\u2019t interested, but the Irish fans are loudly affronted when it comes up on the big screen. 22 min Thanks for sending in your memories of your first football match. I\u2019ll collate as many as I can and publish them at half-time. 21 min Ebosele goes on a winding run from right to left before going over just outside the area. He thought he was fouled by Livramento, the referee did not. 19 min England continue to probe, though it\u2019s not easy to find an eye in the needle \u2013 as I type Ireland have all 10 outfield players within 25 yards of their own goal. 16 min England are on top but it hasn\u2019t been one-way traffic, and overall I suspect qualified dentist Heimir Hallgrimsson will be happy with how Ireland have started. 13 min Walker is playing the role at centre-back at both ends. He is first to another Madueke corner, but this time he gets ahead of the ball and can only head it whence it came. 11 min Bellingham rakes a shot from 20 yards is that blocked by Cullen. England have started well, particularly through Madueke on the right. 10 min \u201cMy first game was, I think, Spurs 6-0 Slovan Bratislava (6-2 on aggregate) in the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in 1963,\u201d writes Jon Scott. \u201cMy second game, though it\u2019s possible I have mixed the order, was Spurs 6-2 Man United. Those were the good old days. That 6-2 scoreline in both helps me remember.\u201d I\u2019d have to double check but from memory I think it was Man Utd first, on 24 October 1962, with the Slovan Bratislava game on 14 March 1963. 7 min Ebosele barrels thrillingly down the right, away from Jones, but Guehi steps across to make a well-judged interception. 6 min \u201cRather fitting that Lee Carsley signs out on his pretty successful England tenure with a match against Ireland, the team he played for,\u201d says Colum Fordham. \u201cHe\u2019s been understated, imaginative, at times to the point of recklessness, but has not put too many steps wrong. Say \u2018aah\u2019!\u201d 5 min: Chance for England! Madueke slaloms thrillingly past two players in the area and drives a low cross from the byline that is kicked away by Kelleher. Jones runs onto the loose ball, 20 yards out, and hits a stinging shot that deflects behind for a corner. The resulting corner leads to a good chance for Walker, who gets the run on Molumny at the near post but heads Madueke\u2019s inswinger over the bar. 3 min \u201cI\u2019m at Finland v Greece with my nine year old son,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cIt\u2019s his first match, outside a couple of second tier games in the Icelandic league, and he\u2019s very excited. I\u2019ve prepared him for the possibility of a loss for the Eagle Owls, but he believes. Let\u2019s hope the home team pulls one out of the bag.\u201d That\u2019s so sweet. I was going to say you never forget your first game but I\u2019ve just realised I can\u2019t remember mine. All I know that it was somewhere in London in the late 1970s. I started drinking at a very young age. 2 min Ireland are actually playing with Nathan Collins in midfield in what looks like a 4-1-4-1 formation. Ferguson is up front with Szmodics playing from the left. 1 min Peep peep! Ireland kick off from left to right as we watch. A reminder of the teams England (4-2-3-1) Pickford; Livramento, Walker, Guehi, Hall; Gallagher, Jones; Madueke, Bellingham, Gordon; Kane. Substitutes: Henderson, Trafford, Lewis, Gibbs-White, Gomes, Quansah, Harwood-Bellis, Watkins, Rogers, Bowen, Solanke. Republic of Ireland (possible 5-4-1) Kelleher; O\u2019Shea, McGuinness, Collins, Scales, O\u2019Dowda; Ebosele, Cullen, Molumby, Szmodics; Ferguson. Substitutes: O\u2019Leary, Travers, Doherty, Parrott, Johnston, O\u2019Brien, Moran, Azaz, Manning, Coventry, McAteer, Cannon. Referee Erik Lambrechts (Belgium). It\u2019s pouring down at Wembley, and both anthems have just been roundly booed. Tremendous. \u201cAs a trepidatious Ireland fan I am hoping that we avoid a shellacking,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cThat will likely depend on the catlike reflexes of Caoimh\u00edn \u2018Caoimh\u2019 Kelleher. As a proud Three Lioner yourself would you swap him for Pickford?\u201d That\u2019s a good question, apart from the fact I\u2019m neither proud nor a Three Lioner. As a neutral I\u2019d probably keep Pickford at this stage, for his experience as much as anything, but there isn\u2019t much in it. Kelleher is ceaselessly impressive. I remember MBMing a Liverpool game during Covid, possibly at home to Wolves, when he made his Premier League debut. He kept a clean sheet but what really stood out, even in the first 10-15 minutes, was how calm and authoritative he was. Even when young keepers make great saves, you expect them to be like a cat on a hot tin roof. Good Luck Mr Gorsky Carsley \u201cThanks for clarifying the Ireland manager is a qualified dentist,\u201d says DFGTR EDTRTT (sic). \u201cSo many unqualified dentists out there.\u201d You\u2019re most welcome; information should be shared. I can lend you a couple of vowels as well if you like. \u201cGuess what?\u201d says Jeremy Boyce. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder if the FA weren\u2019t a little hasty in picking up the phone to Thomas Tuchel. Carsley has made a more than decent fist of his interim term. The Greece embarrassment at Wembley aside, results have been okay, and should be again tonight. \u201cThe no-shows have obliged him to turn to others, and he\u2019s turned to the yoof. Quite right. They are the future, and if you\u2019re good enough you\u2019re old enough. Wasn\u2019t there a famous northern team manager who thought similarly? Maybe two of them? \u201cHe also seems to understand the idea of \u2018rotation\u2019, not overburdening your best players, picking on merit and form, not reputation. TT may have done him a favour, he\u2019ll have good credentials when the inevitable managerial merry-go-round spins next time.\u201d In my opinion, if Carsley was the permanent manager he\u2019d been overwhelmed by the off-field nonsense. He\u2019s an outstanding youth coach, one the FA should cherish. That\u2019s the impression I get, anyway, and I can\u2019t be locked up for it. At least not yet. Curtis Jones, who in the last couple of months has taken a shortcut from good to really, really good in the last couple of months, also gets another start tonight. Lee Carsley speaks to ITV [What impressed you most against Greece?] The mentality that we played with, the ability and intensity. We spoke about matching their enthusiasm. We did that and we\u2019ll have to do the same today. [On having the same five players behind the striker] With the time we\u2019ve had on the training ground, I felt it was important to have more consistency of selection. [On Tino Livramento] He\u2019s a player I\u2019ve coached for a number of years. He\u2019s very talented, he\u2019s playing well for Newcastle, so I\u2019m looking forward to watching him. GARY NAYLOR, THIS IS FOR YOU \u201cThe football will have to go some to get anywhere near the Anderson - Littler semi-final in the darts,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cDid you see it? It doesn\u2019t get any better. Sorry if you\u2019re not watching, no spoilers.\u201d Are you suggesting that, because the blog hasn\u2019t been updated for about half an hour, I must have been spellbound by one of the greatest semi-finals of all time? You\u2019ve got nothing on me! Noni Madueke starts again tonight, having been one of the success stories of the Carsley Months. Lee Carsley continues to experiment, giving a debut to Tino Livramento and a full debut to his fellow Newcastle full-back Lewis Hall. Harry Kane also returns in the only other change from Thursday\u2019s win in Greece. Ezri Konsa (injury), Rico Lewis and Ollie Watkins drop out. The Republic of Ireland also make three changes from their win over Finland. Luton\u2019s Mark McGuinness makes his debut in defence, with Dara O\u2019Shea and Jayson Molumby also coming into the side. Matt Doherty, Jason Knight and Mikey Johnston drop out, which probably means a switch to a back five. England (4-2-3-1) Pickford; Livramento, Walker, Guehi, Hall; Gallagher, Jones; Madueke, Bellingham, Gordon; Kane. Substitutes: Henderson, Trafford, Lewis, Gibbs-White, Gomes, Quansah, Harwood-Bellis, Watkins, Rogers, Bowen, Solanke. Republic of Ireland (possible 5-4-1) Kelleher; O\u2019Shea, McGuinness, Collins, Scales, O\u2019Dowda; Ebosele, Cullen, Molumby, Szmodics; Ferguson. Substitutes: O\u2019Leary, Travers, Doherty, Parrott, Johnston, O\u2019Brien, Moran, Azaz, Manning, Coventry, McAteer, Cannon. Referee Erik Lambrechts (Belgium). Hello and welcome to live, minute-by-minute coverage of England v Republic of Ireland at Wembley. The Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrimsson may be a qualified dentist, but Lee Carsley\u2019s spell as interim England manager has been more like a trip to the dentist. Okay, it\u2019s had enough in common for a half-arsed analogy. We spent much of the time wincing, whining and worrying, only to belatedly realise it was far less painful than we feared and we\u2019re in a healthier state than we were beforehand. If England beat the Republic of Ireland at Wembley this evening, they will win Group B2 and return to \u2013 ludicrous phrase alert \u2013 the Nations League top table. In fact all they need to do is match Greece\u2019s result in Finland, so victory may not be essential. History will probably be kind to Carsley, who put his big bald head in the firing line for the greater good. He balanced the present and future almost perfectly, getting the results needed while conducting various fact-finding missions that will make Thomas Tuchel\u2019s life easier when he takes over in the new year. All of the above will be hastily deleted if England make a Horlicks of this afternoon\u2019s game. But let\u2019s not go back to the dentist\u2019s waiting room just yet. Kick off 5pm.",

      "body": "<p>It was an England salvo of devastating power, three goals in five minutes early in the second half and it did more than reframe an occasion that had been flat and forgettable up until then. It gave Lee Carsley the win that he wanted on his sixth and final game as the interim manager; one to seal England\u2019s promotion back into the Nations League\u2019s A section. With five wins and just that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/10/england-greece-nations-league-match-report\">one off-night against Greece</a> at Wembley, it added up to job well done.</p> \n<p>Carsley will hand over to Thomas Tuchel with the team in good health, a new generation also pushed. Carsley had previously given first caps to Angel Gomes, Morgan Gibbs-White, Noni Madueke, Curtis Jones, Lewis Hall and Morgan Rogers. Here, there were two more debuts \u2013 for Tino Livramento from the outset and Taylor Harwood-Bellis as a substitute.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/17/lee-carsley-hails-englands-new-generation-as-he-passes-reins-to-tuchel\">Lee Carsley hails England\u2019s new generation as he passes reins to Tuchel</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What a night it would be for both, especially Harwood-Bellis, who scored with a thumping header with one of his first touches from a Jude Bellingham cross. That made it 5-0. Ireland were long since broken, Harry Kane \u2013 who else? \u2013 precipitating an alarming crash.</p> \n<p>Kane was back in the starting XI after his high-profile omission from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/15/noni-madueke-greece-audition-latest-act-england-coming-of-age-story\">Thursday\u2019s 3-0 win over Greece</a> in Athens and, after he laboured dreadfully in the first half, it was his sumptuous pass that got Bellingham in to win a penalty off Liam Scales, the Republic of Ireland defender\u2019s woe compounded when the foul was deemed to be a second yellow card offence.</p> \n<p>Kane scored from the spot, his 69th England goal in 103 caps. But this was a night for the next wave because it was not just Harwood-Bellis who found the net for the first time at this level.

      "bodyText": "It was an England salvo of devastating power, three goals in five minutes early in the second half and it did more than reframe an occasion that had been flat and forgettable up until then. It gave Lee Carsley the win that he wanted on his sixth and final game as the interim manager; one to seal England\u2019s promotion back into the Nations League\u2019s A section. With five wins and just that one off-night against Greece at Wembley, it added up to job well done. Carsley will hand over to Thomas Tuchel with the team in good health, a new generation also pushed. Carsley had previously given first caps to Angel Gomes, Morgan Gibbs-White, Noni Madueke, Curtis Jones, Lewis Hall and Morgan Rogers. Here, there were two more debuts \u2013 for Tino Livramento from the outset and Taylor Harwood-Bellis as a substitute. What a night it would be for both, especially Harwood-Bellis, who scored with a thumping header with one of his first touches from a Jude Bellingham cross. That made it 5-0. Ireland were long since broken, Harry Kane \u2013 who else? \u2013 precipitating an alarming crash. Kane was back in the starting XI after his high-profile omission from Thursday\u2019s 3-0 win over Greece in Athens and, after he laboured dreadfully in the first half, it was his sumptuous pass that got Bellingham in to win a penalty off Liam Scales, the Republic of Ireland defender\u2019s woe compounded when the foul was deemed to be a second yellow card offence. Kane scored from the spot, his 69th England goal in 103 caps. But this was a night for the next wave because it was not just Harwood-Bellis who found the net for the first time at this level. Anthony Gordon, Conor Gallagher and Jarrod Bowen did likewise, Ireland\u2019s 10 men swept aside. Newcastle\u2019s Livramento provided the cross for his clubmate Gordon to hook home a volley while Gallagher touched home after Marc Gu\u00e9hi had flicked on a Madueke corner. That completed the flurry for England but they were in no mood to stop, the remorseless Bellingham teeing up Bowen after a well-worked free-kick routine. Bowen had only just come on as a substitute. The game had been framed in part by the first meeting between the nations in this group in September, when Ireland were disappointing in the 2-0 loss in Dublin. Few England fans expected anything other than victory here and not only because Ireland were depleted by injuries, missing a handful of likely starters. England would have to wait, the first half a virtual write-off from their point of view. Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson set Ireland up in a 4-5-1 formation, the captain Nathan Collins \u2013 a centre-half by trade \u2013 sitting in front of the defence. The idea was to be compact, committed, hard to break down. Madueke, fresh from his barnstorming performance in the win over Greece, had one early run past two green shirts. His pull-back found its way to Curtis Jones, whose shot was deflected over. Kyle Walker headed off target from the corner and the first half descended into stodgy fare. England were slow to move it in possession, the patterns predictable. With 11 men banked behind the ball, Ireland kept Carsley\u2019s team in front of them with ease. Kane\u2019s toils in the first half were pronounced. It was unfortunate that Bellingham chose to put him in a foot-race with Collins midway through the period, which he was never going to win. Still, it was a bad look. Moments earlier, Kane had failed to control a clipped ball into the area from Hall; it was all so tight. There was a heavy touch from Kane that led to Scales slamming into him to win a showy tackle and the frustrations seemed to bubble over in first-half stoppage time, Kane throwing Jayson Molumby to the ground to incur a yellow card. Madueke had been booked earlier for a foul on Callum O\u2019Dowda, with Bellingham\u2019s complaints about the decision earning him a yellow card. He was also booked for dissent in Athens and he will be suspended for England\u2019s next game.

      "bodyText": "Thank you for joining me today for this historic match. Wales are on a losing streak they will want to break next week but their opposition is extremely tough in world champions South Africa. Australia were incredible when down to 14, their performance not perfect but one encouraging with a new head coach Joe Schmidt now embedding his plans. To recap all the action have a read of the report below. We will be back next weekend with live coverage of the next round of Autumn Nations Series, until then have a good week. Wales head coach Warren Gatland told TNT Sports: \u201cIt hurts. We got ourselves back into the game but when we\u2019re a man up and concede 21 points, that\u2019s disappointing.\u201d A lot of fans on social media calling for change in the Wales coaching ranks. What do you think? You can email me your thoughts. Wales\u2019 Dewi Lake told TNT Sports: \u201cWe know people at home are disappointed, we feel the same. We don\u2019t come out to lose games. We are giving everything. We want to win as a group.\u201d Just to note, every red is not automatically a 20 minute red card during this trial of the law in the Autumn Nations Series. Referees are still able to reduce teams to 14 for the entire match. It comes down to a case-by-case basis. Samu Kerevi will still face a possible ban also. Dan Biggar says on TNT Sports that a change in coach won\u2019t suddenly turn around results for Wales. Sam Warburton adds it\u2019s more a problem of a lack of quality players available. The last team to put 52 points on Wales at the Principality was South Africa last August, they are Wales next opposition and it seems like an impossible task for Gatland\u2019s men to overcome the world champions. Player of the match Tom Wright told TNT Sports: \u201cThat was an awesome 80 minute performance\u2026 They are games you want to be a part of, so much ball in play. Putting back-to-back performances is huge to us, something we have struggled with in recent times.\u201d Also a word for how well Australia handled their 20 minute red card. They scored three tries in that period and they absolutely demolished Wales\u2019 momentum they had garnered from the first half. I thought the red card might see Wales complete the comeback but not to be. Fans boo the team as the full time whistle goes. The most amount of points Australia have put on Wales in Cardiff. The Gatland dynasty is crumbling around him. 11 games without a win. Wales\u2019 longest losing streak in history. They have one more game in 2024 and it comes against world champions South Africa. Wales have not lost every game in a calendar year since 1937. Bleak times for Welsh rugby and this result will only add to questions over Warren Gatland\u2019s future. It\u2019s a slick move from the full-back, he is on fire right now. Warren Gatland looks dumbfounded. Wright has a hat-trick too. Player of the match. 79 min: Wales are on the hunt for a consolation score here. 76 min: I don\u2019t think I have ever see the green of seats in the bottom tier of the Principality before. But supporters are making their feelings of this performance known. Wales were right in the mix until Australia killed them off when weathering the 20 minute red. Intially thought he had missed that but it\u2019s over. Fans are pouring out of the stadium. Hundreds heading for the exit. Some great carries in the build-up to that score, Ikitau finishing off perfectly. Wales look exhausted. Australia have never scored this many points in Cardiff before. 74 min: An Australian scrum is clean and Kellaway kicks upfield by Winnett is there to call the mark. It doesn\u2019t go into touch though and Australia are immediately on the attack again. 73 min: Australia\u2019s lineout is stolen and Wales kick clear. The Wallabies pick it up and Llewellyn almost intercepts to score but he knocks on. That would have been quite the try. 72 min: Here comes Australia with a lovely chip by Wright and he almost gets on the end of it but Murray comes to mop up the ball. 71 min: Is there enough time for Wales to fight back here? Rugby has seen stranger things happen. If they are the next to score and do it quickly it\u2019ll be a slightly different story. 56,188 fans in the stadium today, surprisingly less than last week. It\u2019s over. A tap and go from the latest penalty sees one or two passes and Thomas is over. A great powerful line from Thomas. 68 min: We come back for the earlier advantage and surely the referee is going to be warning Australia soon. There is it, it\u2019s like he read my mind. 68 min: Another good lineout for Wales and they are a few metres closer. They earn an advantage and go through the phases. 67 min: Another lineout for Elias, this time it is good. They form a maul and Australia cough up a penalty. Wales go to the corner again. 66 min: Possession exchanges hands but Wales are the next to get some attacking phases. Williams puts boot to ball but we come back for an advantage, Wales kick to the corner. 64 min: The lineout isn\u2019t good and Australia steal it, an awful few minutes for replacement hooker Elias at the set piece. 63 min: What a kick from Williams, who secures a 50:22. A lovely bit of skill. Suaalii is on for the Wallabies as Kerevi\u2019s replacement as the 20 minute red card time is up. 62 min: The tackle is right on the line but it is on the right side of safe. The replay showed as much, Wales heading for their worst losing run ever. Huge kick. I think they did review a tackle from Valetini as it looked like head contact but it has been cleared so the try stands. Wright nabs the ball from the Wales attacking line and he runs 50 plus metres to score. Oh my. 60 min: Australia steal the lineout and they clear, a huge moment. 59 min: Can Wales maul over here? Well we wait with baited breath as Australia make changes with Gleeson and Paenga-Amos on. 59 min: Wales win a scrum penalty and they kick to the corner. Pressure is ramping up here. 59 min: Australia have the scrum and it\u2019s clean but McDermott\u2019s pass doesn\u2019t go to hand and so Wales now have a scrum in a good position. A scrappy old game. Williams is also on for Bevan. Ah it was a forward pass. There was a wild throw but Botham seemed to pick it up with one hand without knocking on. But it has been ruled out. They are checking this but if he has scored that it is insane. 57 min: Thomas has a great run as Wales are on the hunt once again. 55 min: Rogers is off, why Gatland is taking him off I don\u2019t know, for James and Costelow is also on for Anscombe. 55 min: The lineout is not good from Wales but Morgan manages to rescue the loose ball. The men in red go on the hunt for a try, and boy do they need one. But it won\u2019t come just yet as Anscombe is wrestled into touch. 55 min: Australia have scored two tries since being down to 14 men, what incredible rugby from the visitors. The referee\u2019s whistle blows but it is Australia who are pinged this time. Wales now install a completely new front row. It\u2019s over. That maul is deadly from Australia. They make a good few metres and then Faessler breaks away to power over. Amazing game management from the Wallabies. He has a hat-trick. 52 min: Wales give away yet another penalty, we play on for a few phases but we come back to it. The Wallabies kick to the corner. 51 min: We saw last week, where Fiji had a 20 minute red with Semi Radradra, that it doesn\u2019t mean a team will lose with Fiji coming away with the win. Australia are doing really well to weather the storm of only having 14 on the pitch right now. They are now into Wales\u2019 22. 50 min: So a 20 minute red card means Kerevi is not allowed to re-enter the game. But 20 minutes after he first left the pitch, Australia will be able to replace him with another player. Back to play Wales gives away another penalty and Australia kick upfield. So many penalties from the hosts. It has been upgraded to a red card. I think this will be a 20 minute red though. I\u2019ll explain that shortly. What a kick! A perfectly executed maul by Australia, a lovely move. Lineout. Maul. Try. 47 min: Bevan comes charging in at a ruck and there is shoulder on head contact with White. The referee judges it to be a penalty only as there\u2019s a lot degree of danger. A contentious one. White is now off for a HIA with McDermott on. 47 min: Wales are really starting to wrack up the penalties now as they give another one away and we come back to it. There\u2019s a break in play as there is potential foul play on White. 47 min: Australia kick to the corner but they don\u2019t gain much advantage. The lineout is good and they opt for a maul once again. They make good metres before shifting to phases. 45 min: Australia kick upfield and they have a clean lineout as a result. They charge on in a maul but eventually White runs it through the hands but Wales win it back and the Principality erupts as they make good metres but then they give away a breakdown pen. 43 min: Wales look to capitalise on being a player up but it is Australia who win a breakdown penalty. 43 min: The bunker review for those who don\u2019t know is another TMO reviewing an incident for the sin bin time to see if a card needs to be upgraded to a red. So it is an anxious wait for Australia. Usually tackles look worse in slow motion but that is horrific at usual speed. My word that looks horrible. It\u2019s sin bin and a bunker review. 42 min: Wales have a lineout on halfway, which is clean and they whip it out. A huge hit from Kerevi comes in on Morgan, they will have a look at this for foul play. So can Wales complete the comeback and end their losing streak? Or will Australia get their win over the line? All to come. Australia have made a change with Slipper on for Bell. Some reaction to yesterday\u2019s results: A special mention for Tom Rogers on the Welsh wing. He hasn\u2019t been perfect but he has probably been Wales\u2019 best player so far. Wales need him in on more of the action in the second 40. It\u2019s poised at half-time to be another electric finish in this Autumn Nations Series. The games yesterday were edge-of-your-seat finishes, especially France\u2019s win over New Zealand, and neutrals will most definitely want that again today. The Aussie attack ends with Wales winning a breakdown penalty as White dives in. Australia raced out of the blocks to a 19-0 lead but Wales have slowly chipped away to get themselves back into this contest. A huge second half to come. 40 min: Australia have a clean linout and they go on the march. They don\u2019t get far and so White sends them on their way. They are asking questions of Wales right now. 39 min: Wales cough up a penalty at the breakdown and Australia kick upfield. 38 min: Wales come away with it from the scrum and a grubber kick is put in but Wright mops it up to clear the danger. 36 min: The referee and TMO discuss the incident and it\u2019s judged to be absolutely fine. We come back for a Wales scrum. 36 min: Botham has a great carry, trucking up a fair few metres to take them into Australia\u2019s half. Anscombe puts the ball to boot and it find Rogers but the referee blows up and he wants to see if there is a dangerous clearout by prop Thomas. 35 min: Excellent response from Wales. After 20 minutes it looked bleak for the hosts but they have really clawed their way back into this contest. Anscombe\u2019s boot is good once more. 33 min: Wales knock on but we come back for an advantage as Frost was offside. Anscombe points to the sticks once again. 32 min: Wales in the ascendency at the moment and they look to compound their momentum with an attack. Wales chip away at the scoreboard again. 30 min: Wales\u2019 attack ends with the referee going back to an advantage from a no arms tackle from Bell. Will Wales go to corner or posts? Anscombe points to the sticks. 29 min: Wales win another scrum penalty and this is really starting to paint a picture for the referee. The set piece not great from the Wallabies so far. 28 min: A chip over the top almost goes to hand for Ikitau but he knocks on, Wales scrum. The scoreboard looking much better for the hosts now. Wales\u2019 attack there looked good, they just kept hitting the Aussie wall and Wainwright found a way through. The hosts needed that. 25 min: Wales win the scrum penalty and they play on with advantage as they smell the try line. 25 min: Wright knocks on from the restart which gives Wales a good platform with a scrum. It\u2019s good. The lineout was lovely, the maul was stunning and Faessler is easily over the line. Gatland looks slightly shocked. Sucker punch for Wales. 21 min: It\u2019s a good lineout but Wales do well to stop the resulting maul. Australia are playing with an advantage with Bevan offside and we come back to it a few phases later. The Wallabies opt for the corner again. 20 min: Australia win a breakdown penalty and they opt to kick to the corner. They did have the option to kick at posts but they are backing themselves. 19 min: This must be slightly crushing for Wales, they haven\u2019t done much wrong but they find themselves on the back foot. They must be the next to score to find some momentum int his Test. The kick is good. Wales were patiently knocking on the door and run through the phases in search of their first points. But Rogers tries to offload and Frost nabs it, runs over half the pitch and scores. Wow. What a phenomenal solo try. 15 min: Lolesio missed the conversion and so Australia have to settle for the five points. Wright weaves in and out of Wales traffic and is over. A really deadly threat for Australia. They find a hole. 13 min: Australia are continually hitting Wales\u2019 red wall but it is holding strong for now. And for those wondering how Italy Georgia panned out this afternoon, Italy won 20-17. 12 min: The referee stops play as Botham was hit in the head, he is concerned for the flanker and he has raised the alarm to the medics. The official wanted Botham to go for a HIA but the doctors say he is okay. We restart with Australia ball, really great intervention from the referee as player welfare must always come first. 11 min: Donaldson makes an incredible run and he lays it off to Kerevi and it looks like a sure try until Rogers gets in his way and holds him up. An absolutely beautiful try-saving tackle. 10 min: Australia\u2019s lineout is clean but a final pass isn\u2019t caught and so it is out for a Wales lineout. The men in red won every single lineout last weekend in one of their positives from their performance. Anscombe looked in some trouble but he is staying on pitch, it looked like a hand injury. It\u2019s a good lineout again but then Australia collapse the maul legally and they win the penalty to clear their lines. 8 min: A crossfield kick comes in to find Rogers on the wing as Wales become the latest to attack but he can\u2019t catch. Australia opt for a line-out instead of a scrum, the first of the match. Before that can be played Beard needs some treatment and it looks like he is coming off. He is, Tshiunza is on. 8 min: Some slick hands from Kerevi keeps Australia\u2019s attack going but they knock on again with Wales playing the advantage as they to attack. The kicking game comes into play so the Wallabies are on the charge again. Possession flipping between teams so frequently. 6 min: Rogers makes a blistering run to make the crowd come to life but then Wales knock on and so we scrum again. This time Aus have the put in and its clean the first time of asking. They kick across field to try and find Kellaway but Wales recover it well. 4 min: Wales\u2019 defence has largely been good and it pays off as Australia knock on, a scrum to come. The first scrum is always interesting as it starts to set precedent for the rest of the match so teams like to make a good impression to the referee early on. The scrum is straight down and in need of an reset for the first two attempts, referee James Doleman has a word with both front rows and then they get a clean set piece. Wales come away with it to set their first attack. 2 min: It\u2019s not a clean start from Wales and so Australia have the first attacking set. Phase-by-phase the visitors edge up the pitch. Here we go then. Will Australia inflict more misery on Wales? Or can the hosts break their losing streak? All to come. The atmosphere is crackling as always at the Principality. Emotional and loud anthems, a light show and some ACDC. Kick-off imminent. The anthems will come shortly. The roof is closed once again at the Principality so we expect them to be loud. Then we have kick-off shortly after. Grab a cup of tea and the biscuits. If you have read one of my blogs before you will know I love a bit of snack chat so do get in touch and let me know what you\u2019re tucking into for this one. I\u2019d also like to hear from you if you think Gatland should remain in charge. You can send me an email to let me know your thoughts. Another match, another inquest into the state of Welsh rugby. This time, the hand-wringing is particularly fervent, for Wales stand on the brink of an unwanted threshold. Should they lose to Australia in Cardiff on Sunday they will surpass their longest run of Test defeats. Losing to Fiji last Sunday was upsetting on any number of levels, but the sharpest pain was the fact it was a 10th defeat in a row, equalling the run under Steve Hansen that stretched from 2002 to 2003, the last time they collected the wooden spoon in the Six Nations. Until this year, of course, when they picked up another after a couple of decades of unrivalled success. Now the Wallabies stride into town, suddenly feeling a bit better about themselves after their own recent travails were eased by a dramatic win against England at Twickenham. Fiji, Australia, feeling better about themselves \u2013 these are all achingly familiar terms to Wales, whose recent travails extend back a few years, but were temporarily eased by their World Cup, or at least their pool campaign. Wales negotiated that without mishap, riding their luck against Fiji in the opener in one of the games of the tournament, before fairly dismantling Australia. See? Easy. Read the full piece: Australia head coach Joe Schmidt said on Wales\u2019 bad run: \u201cI\u2019m sure Warren is feeling some pressure, just like any international coach. He was obviously highly successful in his previous tenure with Wales. \u201cHe was successful with Wasps. I think anyone can have a lean spell, when teams are transitioning. I look at some of the players he had when I first started competing with Ireland against Wales. \u201cThere are some good players there now like Adam Beard, Jac Morgan, Tommy Reffell, Aaron Wainwright and Dewi Lake to name but a few. There is a period of time that it takes for them to adjust to Test rugby. That\u2019s part of that transition Gats is trying to accelerate at the moment.\u201d Some have been questioning whether Warren Gatland should remain in charge with the current run of results. The head coach was asked about his job speculation: \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to point out from the outset we need to go through some pain. I didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be this much pain. \u201cThere have been games where we haven\u2019t been able to get over the finishing line and some close fixtures. If a decision is made in terms of what you\u2019re talking about [Gatland\u2019s future], I\u2019m more than comfortable with that. I\u2019ve been around the game for long enough. \u201cI\u2019ll probably go back to the beach, have a glass of wine and enjoy myself away from some of the pressure!\u201d Some painful stats for Wales fans. Wales have not won a game since they beat Georgia at the 2023 Rugby World Cup pool stage. The team are at their lowest world ranking at 11th and they will hit their worst ever losing run if they fall to defeat today. Since Warren Gatland re-joined the side in December 2022 he has won just six of 22 games. More here on Suaalii being dropped to the bench: The team news is here. Wales make four changes from their defeat last week. Ellis Bevan starts in place of the injured Tomos Williams and Tom Rogers is in for Mason Grady. Warren Gatland has also replaced both flankers with Jac Morgan and James Botham coming in. Wales: Winnett; Rogers, Llewellyn, B Thomas, Murray; Anscombe, Bevan; G Thomas, Lake (capt), Griffin, Rowlands, Beard, Botham, Morgan, Wainwright. Subs: Elias, N Smith, Assiratti, Tshiunza, Reffell, R Williams, Costelow, James. Australia, meanwhile, make six changes from last weekend with the big news being Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii dropping to the bench. Samu Kerevi starts ahead of him with the other new faces being Nic White, Seru Uru, Will Skelton, Max Jorgenson and Allan Alaalatoa. Rob Valetini and Kerevi will win their 50th caps. Australia: Wright; Kellaway, Ikitau, Kerevi, Jorgensen; Lolesio, White; Bell, Faessler, Alaalatoa, Frost, Skelton, Uru, McReight, Valetini Subs: Paenga-Amosa, Slipper, Nonggorr, Salakaia-Loto, Gleeson, McDermott, Donaldson, Suaalii Hello and welcome to Wales v Australia which could put the hosts in the record books for a reason they want to avoid. Wales have lost 10 Test in a row and if they lose to the Wallabies today it will be their longest-ever run without a win. Last weekend they lost Fiji, a game where Fiji won for the first time in Cardiff. This weekend they face a buoyant Australia team who come into the match after beating England last time out. The hosts today have also been hit with a few injuries. Mason Grady went off injured last weekend and his ankle issue means he cannot play this afternoon. Tomos Williams has also been ruled out. There is a surprise benching in the Australia camp which we will dive into next as the team news is already available. We\u2019ll also take a look at what has been said in the build-up to the game before kick-off at 4.10pm GMT.",

Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, spoke to Vladimir Putin for an hour on Friday. The Kremlin afterwards suggested nothing had changed in its negotiating position, and that its full-scale invasion of 2022 was the \u201cdirect result\u201d of a Nato policy that aimed at \u201ccreating a staging ground against Russia on Ukrainian soil\u201d.</p> <p>The Kremlin statement also insisted that the west should recognise \u201cthe new territorial realities\u201d an unsubtle reference to Russia\u2019s occupation of nearly a fifth of Ukraine \u2013 and then referred back to a <a href=\"https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1957107/\">Putin speech made in June</a> at Russian\u2019s foreign ministry, which spelled its demands in fuller form.</p> <p>In that address, Putin demanded, again, the \u201cdemilitarisation and denazification\u201d of Ukraine. Russia had previously demanded, in negotiations in 2022, that Ukraine\u2019s army be reduced to just 50,000 and has said it wants four eastern and southern Ukrainian regions, Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia of which only the fourth, Luhansk, is fully occupied.</p> <p>Not surprisingly Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a different view in a radio interview with Suspilne, the country\u2019s public broadcaster. Victory, he said, would amount to \u201ca strong Ukraine\u201d emerging either on the battlefield or through diplomacy, though he was prudent not to be too specific about what that meant.</p> <p>While there may be signs, expressed behind the scenes, that Ukraine is willing to accept the loss of some occupied territory for a peace, Russia\u2019s demands appear to go far beyond that, and may leave Ukraine with little choice but to try and fight on, even if the US walks away from supplying military aid.</p> <p>How successful it could be is uncertain. Ukraine did shoot down or neutralise 85% of the missiles and 94% of the drones, but it proved disturbingly easy for Russia to knock out entire power stations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/13/ukraine-air-defences-overwhelmed-as-russia-pounds-power-stations\">in the spring </a>with a barrages of missiles at a time when air defences were stretched.</p> <p>Despite Trump\u2019s election and talk of peace, such is the scale of Russian aggression \u2013 as demonstrated on Sunday morning \u2013 that an end to the war still appears a long way off.</p>",

The Kremlin afterwards suggested nothing had changed in its negotiating position, and that its full-scale invasion of 2022 was the \u201cdirect result\u201d of a Nato policy that aimed at \u201ccreating a staging ground against Russia on Ukrainian soil\u201d. The Kremlin statement also insisted that the west should recognise \u201cthe new territorial realities\u201d an unsubtle reference to Russia\u2019s occupation of nearly a fifth of Ukraine \u2013 and then referred back to a Putin speech made in June at Russian\u2019s foreign ministry, which spelled its demands in fuller form. In that address, Putin demanded, again, the \u201cdemilitarisation and denazification\u201d of Ukraine. Russia had previously demanded, in negotiations in 2022, that Ukraine\u2019s army be reduced to just 50,000 and has said it wants four eastern and southern Ukrainian regions, Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia of which only the fourth, Luhansk, is fully occupied. Not surprisingly Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a different view in a radio interview with Suspilne, the country\u2019s public broadcaster. Victory, he said, would amount to \u201ca strong Ukraine\u201d emerging either on the battlefield or through diplomacy, though he was prudent not to be too specific about what that meant. While there may be signs, expressed behind the scenes, that Ukraine is willing to accept the loss of some occupied territory for a peace, Russia\u2019s demands appear to go far beyond that, and may leave Ukraine with little choice but to try and fight on, even if the US walks away from supplying military aid. How successful it could be is uncertain. Ukraine did shoot down or neutralise 85% of the missiles and 94% of the drones, but it proved disturbingly easy for Russia to knock out entire power stations in the spring with a barrages of missiles at a time when air defences were stretched. Despite Trump\u2019s election and talk of peace, such is the scale of Russian aggression \u2013 as demonstrated on Sunday morning \u2013 that an end to the war still appears a long way off.",

A spokesperson for the British Horseracing Authority said in a statement on Sunday evening the deaths of the three horses were \u201ca tragedy for all connections\u201d, adding: \u201cThe thoughts of all of us at the BHA are with them. All three were provided with outstanding care and attention throughout their lives by those who cared for them, and nobody will be more heartbroken tonight than those individuals.\u201d The statement concluded: \u201cAs with all fatalities, we will seek to understand the circumstances behind each incident as we strive to continue to reduce avoidable risk in our sport. All factual data relating to fatal injury rates in British racing can be found at www.horsepwr.co.uk and the overall fatal injury rate in jump racing is 0.42% of runners.\u201d Liam Kearns, part of the extensive team of vets on duty at Cheltenham on Sunday, told Racing TV after the Holland Cooper Handicap Chase that it was \u201ca huge coincidence\u201d to have two instances of cardiovascular collapse in the same race. \u201cIn both cases, we call it cardiovascular collapse, because you can\u2019t say at this stage whether it\u2019s a true heart attack or whether it\u2019s a major blood vessel that has ruptured,\u201d Kearns said. \u201cVets are deployed all around the racecourse so both horses were attended within seconds. It\u2019s a high-intensity, racing situation \u2013 we have similar every time a marathon or a long-distance race is run. \u201cThere\u2019s always a concern that athletes at a high level of exertion can, without having any previous symptoms, present this situation and it\u2019s a huge coincidence that it happened twice in the same race.\u201d The loss of three runners on the day largely overshadowed the action on the track, but Burdett Road, the top weight, was a half-length winner of the Greatwood Handicap Hurdle and may now have the Champion Hurdle in March as a long-term target. \u201cHe\u2019s a lovely horse and it\u2019s a great performance from a four-year-old in a strong race,\u201d James Owen, Burdett Road\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a long way to go [to the festival meeting next year] but obviously, on his Flat form, he\u2019s more than capable of getting there and we\u2019ll aim that way.\u201d In France, meanwhile, there was a surprise in the Prix la Haye Jousselin as Il Est Francais, one of last season\u2019s best novice chasers and the 3-1 favourite for the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day on Sunday morning, was pulled up after setting off as the favourite for the Grade One event. Noel George and Amanda Zetterholm\u2019s six-year-old put in an awkward jump at the water and was pulled up after jumping two more obstacles. Il Est Francais was a spectacular front-running winner of the Grade One novice chase on last season\u2019s King George card, and had been among the market leaders for this year\u2019s King George ever since. Several bookmakers have now removed him from their ante-post lists, however, while he is available to back at around 10-1 with the remainder. \u201cJames [Reveley, Il Est Francais\u2019s jockey] just said he cut out and that\u2019s why he pulled him up,\u201d George told Sky Sports Racing. \u201cThere\u2019s no certain reason for it. We\u2019ll do every test we can possibly do and then we\u2019ll make a decision on what the plan is. He\u2019s not lame, so we\u2019ll find a solution.\u201d George admitted that there is now a question mark over his chaser\u2019s chance of lining up at Kempton on Boxing Day. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not going to be 100% that we\u2019re going to be coming,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make a plan and we\u2019re not going to jump to any conclusions at all.\u201d",

Since the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, on 28 September, Afif became one of the group\u2019s most prominent officials, holding several press conferences in Beirut.</p> <p>Analysts said Afif was the first official with such a role to be killed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>, as all previous targets had military or senior leadership posts. Until Sunday, there had been no Israeli airstrikes on central Beirut since mid-October.</p> <p>Witnesses saw four bodies at the scene of the strike, which came a day before Lebanon was expected to deliver its response to a US-delivered ceasefire proposal.

      "bodyText": "Hezbollah\u2019s chief spokesperson has been killed by an Israeli airstrike on Beirut, as Israel intensifies its air offensive in Lebanon despite ongoing indirect negotiations for a ceasefire. Mohammed Afif, who has been the public face of Hezbollah for months, was killed in a strike on offices of the Ba\u2019ath party in Ras al-Nabaa, central Beirut. The attack in the busy residential area came without warning, and appeared to damage to neighbouring buildings. The son of a prominent Shia cleric, Afif managed the Hezbollah-run TV network Al Manar before taking over as head of the militant Islamist group\u2019s media relations. Since the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, on 28 September, Afif became one of the group\u2019s most prominent officials, holding several press conferences in Beirut. Analysts said Afif was the first official with such a role to be killed by Israel, as all previous targets had military or senior leadership posts. Until Sunday, there had been no Israeli airstrikes on central Beirut since mid-October. Witnesses saw four bodies at the scene of the strike, which came a day before Lebanon was expected to deliver its response to a US-delivered ceasefire proposal. There was no official word on the exact death toll. That concludes the Middle East crisis liveblog for today. Thanks for following along. Israeli attacks killed 29 people and wounded 122 on Saturday, bringing the tolls since October last year to 3,481 fatalities and 14,786 injuries, the Lebanese health ministry reported on Sunday. Pope Francis has suggested the global community should study whether Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people, in some of his most explicit criticism yet of Israel\u2019s conduct in its year-long war. In excerpts published on Sunday from a forthcoming book, the pontiff said some international experts say that \u201cwhat is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide\u201d. \u201cWe should investigate carefully to assess whether this fits into the technical definition (of genocide) formulated by international jurists and organisations,\u201d the pope said in the excerpts, published by Italian daily La Stampa. Last December South Africa filed a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice for allegedly violating the Genocide Convention. In January the judges at the court ordered Israel to ensure its troops commit no genocidal acts. The court has not yet ruled on the core of the case \u2013 whether genocide has occurred in Gaza. The Israeli military said on Sunday that an officer and a soldier from the Nachshon Regiment (90), Kfir Brigade, had been killed during combat in northern Gaza yesterday. The army identified them as Captain Yogev Pazy, aged 22 from Giv\u2019ot Bar, a platoon commander, and Staff Sergeant Noam Eitan, aged 21, from Hadera, Reuters reported. Another soldier was severely wounded in the same battle, the army added. As the time approaches 6pm in Jerusalem, here is the news from the conflict in the Middle East. The main spokesperson for Hezbollah, Mohammed Afif has been killed in the first Israeli airstrike on central Beirut for more than a month. The headquarters of the Syrian Social Nationalist party was hit by an attack, which was confirmed as killing Afif by Ali Hijazi, secretary-general of the Lebanese branch of the Ba\u2019ath party. Afif had been the public face of Hezbollah, appearing for the party at a press conference after the killing of leader Hassan Nasrallah in September. Three people were also injured in the airstrike. Meanwhile the Israeli army said it had attacked militant targets near Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, where 30 people have been killed. Two Lebanese soldiers have been killed after the Israeli army reportedly attacked an outpost in the south of the country. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said on Sunday that a peacekeeping patrol was shot at \u201cabout 40 times\u201d a day earlier, with the culprit \u201clikely from non-state actor members\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s international security correspondent Jason Burke has written this guide to the Hezbollah and Hamas leaders killed by Israel since the 7 October attack last year. It includes Hassan Nasrallah, Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah founding member Faud Shukr, but was written before Mohammed Afif and Hashem Safieddine\u2019s deaths. A second Lebanese soldier has been killed after Israel allegedly targeted their position in southern Lebanon. Earlier the Lebanese Army announced that one soldier had been killed, with three injured \u2013 including one critically (see 14:29). \u201cThe Israeli enemy directly targeted an army centre\u201d in Mari in the Hasbaya area, causing \u201cthe death of one of the soldiers and the wounding of three others, one of whom is in critical condition\u201d, the army said in a statement. A separate statement shortly afterwards said \u201ca second soldier\u201d had died of his wounds. Israeli fire has killed more than a dozen Lebanese soldiers since all-out war between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group erupted in September, according to an AFP tally of official announcements. Dutch police said it is investigating 45 people for violent crimes after unrest associated with a European football fixture in Amsterdam last week. Police said nine of them have been identified and arrested, according to AFP. \u201cBecause of the seriousness of the crimes, but also because of the social impact, we immediately scaled up to a special investigation team,\u201d Dutch police chief Janny Knol said in a statement. Police are \u201clooking at all crimes committed in the run-up to the game and in its aftermath\u201d, Knol said after violence in the Dutch capital on 7 November shook the country, resulting in several protests and a near-government collapse. The number of suspects is expected to increase \u201cbased in part on the analysis of a large amount of footage\u201d, police added. Tensions were high before last week\u2019s football match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local Ajax team after Israeli fans chanted anti-Arab slogans, vandalised a taxi and burnt a Palestinian flag in Amsterdam\u2019s main square, according to police reports. Following the match, Israeli fans were targeted in \u201chit-and-run\u201d attacks by men on scooters. Police said the attackers were spurred by calls on social media to attack Jews. The Israeli army said it had attacked militant targets near Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, where 30 people have been killed. \u201cThere have been ongoing terrorist activities in the area of Beit Lahia... Overnight, several strikes were conducted\u201d on militant targets in the area, the Israeli military said in a statement to AFP. Gaza\u2019s civil defence confirmed 30 deaths from a previous figure of 26 for the strike that it said hit a residential building early Sunday. A Lebanese soldier has been killed, with three wounded after Israel attacked an army post in a Lebanese town. The Lebanese Army posted on X that one of those injured was in a critical condition after the attack on Sunday. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon says a patrol was fired upon earlier on Sunday. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said on Sunday that a peacekeeping patrol was shot at \u201cabout 40 times\u201d a day earlier, with the culprit \u201clikely from non-state actor members\u201d. \u201cA group of individuals\u201d, at least one armed, sought to prevent the patrol from passing in south Lebanon on Saturday, but it continued and was later \u201cfired upon about 40 times from behind, likely from non-state actor members\u201d, UNIFIL said in a statement, adding that no peacekeepers were injured though \u201csome patrol vehicles had bullet impacts\u201d. AFP reports that Afif had been prominent within Hezbollah for almost 20 years: Afif joined Hezbollah at a young age and first came to prominence as information director for Hezbollah\u2019s television channel Al-Manar when the group and Israel went to war in 2006. After Nasrallah\u2019s assassination, Afif had held several press conferences in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, including one last month in which he announced Hezbollah had launched a drone targeting the residence of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That press conference was cut short when the Israeli army warned it would strike a building nearby. \u201cBombardments have not scared us, so how would threats?\u201d Afif said defiantly as journalists hurriedly collected their microphones from the table. Hezbollah officials killed in previous Israeli strikes include not only Nasrallah but also Hashem Safieddine, tipped as the former chief\u2019s successor. The airstrikes in Gaza on Sunday came amid Israeli offensives in Beit Lahiya and the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya. The tight siege of the three towns and a series of evacuation orders has raised widespread concerns that Israel intends to force civilian populations to leave the northernmost parts of Gaza and will not permit their return. \u201cOver the last weeks, conversations in Gaza have been intense about the so-called \u2018Generals\u2019 Plan\u2019 \u2026 within the Israeli forces \u2026 which consists of wiping Palestinians off the northern part of Gaza by either killing them, forcing them out, or starving to death those who stay,\u201d M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said on Friday. \u201cThe way the ongoing offensive in the north is being waged \u2026 reinforces the idea that we are witnessing the execution of this plan,\u201d the NGO added. Israel denies any such intention and says the offensives, launched last month, are an effort to prevent Hamas from regrouping in areas that have been cleared in previous multiple rounds of combat. Here are some images from the scene in Beirut, where an Israeli strike is believed to have killed Hezbollah spokesperson Mohammed Afif: Sunday\u2019s strike by Israel killed one person \u2013 reported to be Hezbollah spokesperson Mohammed Afif \u2013 and injured three, according to the Lebanon health ministry. AFP cited the official National News Agency as reporting that the strike by \u201cenemy aircraft\u201d caused \u201cgreat destruction\u201d, with an unspecified number of people \u201ctrapped under the rubble\u201d in Ras al-Nabaa. The NNA said \u201cone of the residents of a neighbouring building had received a warning call urging evacuation but it was not taken seriously\u201d. Ali Hijazi, secretary-general of the Lebanese branch of the Ba\u2019ath party, has \u201cconfirmed the death of Hezbollah media official\u201d Mohammed Afif, reports AFP, citing the official National News Agency. Israel has yet to comment on the reported death of Afif. Afif had been the public face of Hezbollah in several press conferences after Israel\u2019s assassination of leader Hassan Nasrallah in September this year. He is pictured here at a press conference in Beirut earlier this week: Dozens of Palestinians have been killed or injured by an Israeli strike on a multistorey residential building in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, local medics and officials in the territory have said. The government media office in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, put the number of those killed at 72. It said the strike on Sunday morning hit a residential building that housed six families. There was no independent confirmation of the reports or the reported death toll, which followed intensive Israeli bombardment of targets across Gaza in recent days. Israeli officials have previously accused authorities in Gaza of systematically exaggerating reports of casualties from strikes in the territory. William Christou reports for the Guardian from Beirut on the strike by Israeli forces on a building in Ras al-Nabaa, central Beirut, on Sunday afternoon, the first strike on central Beirut in over a month: The attack on the busy residential neighbourhood came without warning, and appeared to cause damage to neighbouring buildings. The strike comes as Israel intensifies its airstrikes across Lebanon as Lebanese officials prepare to give their response to an Israeli ceasefire proposal on Monday. The Israeli military issued a series of evacuation warnings on Saturday and Sunday for Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, striking over a dozen targets in bombings heard across the capital city. Israeli soldiers continue to advance on the ground in south Lebanon, with Israeli soldiers reaching the village of Chamaa \u2013 about three miles from the Lebanese-Israel border. Hezbollah stepped up its attacks in northern Israel in tandem, announcing the targeting of five military targets in Haifa on Saturday night. Lebanese officials noted positive steps in the ceasefire negotiations, though they said that an Israeli request for a western-led mediation body in Lebanon was a stumbling block. Israeli demands reportedly involve pushing Hezbollah past the Litani river, some 18 miles from the border. The Israeli military intensification is reportedly meant to put pressure on Lebanese negotiators, who accused their Israeli counterparts of conducting negotiations \u201cunder fire\u201d. Note, this post has been updated to reflect new information about which building was hit by the strike. The first Israeli airstrike on central Beirut in over a month has killed Mohammed Afif, the main spokesperson for Hezbollah, an official from the group has confirmed to the Guardian and Associated Press. AP reports: Afif had been especially visible after Israel\u2019s military escalation in September and following the assassination of longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli warplanes had earlier pounded the southern suburbs of Beirut after the military warned people to evacuate from several buildings. The Hezbollah militant group has a strong presence in the area, known as the Dahiyeh, and the strikes came as Lebanese officials are considering a U.S.-brokered cease-fire proposal.",

      "bodyText": "Members of the Women\u2019s Equality party (WE) have voted to dissolve the organisation after nearly a decade of activism, with its leaders blaming challenging finances and a more polarised political landscape. The move, backed by the WE\u2019s leader, Mandu Reid, and the party co-founders Catherine Mayer and Sandi Toksvig, was supported by 78% of members at the special conference, narrowly above the three-quarters majority needed for it to pass. In an interview with the Observer in October setting out the idea, Reid said that while its policies and priorities were as relevant as ever, a lack of donations that started during Covid and changes to politics meant the party seemed no longer to be workable. Announcing the result of the vote on Sunday, a WE statement said the party had \u201cwon a raft of important victories: for reproductive rights, towards ending violence against women and girls and for equality\u201d. Arguing that a more polarised political landscape was at odds with the party\u2019s \u201ccollaborative approach to politics at the same time as challenging other parties to do better\u201d, the statement said the members had decided to \u201ccall time on the party but not on activism\u201d, with a meeting taking place later this month to discuss next steps.

There is some dispute over whether Talmy also produced the classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_MqfF0WBsU\">Waterloo Sunset</a> \u2013 its composer, Ray Davies, says he produced it himself, while Talmy begged to differ.</p> <p>In any event, Talmy\u2019s work impressed the Who, with whom he recorded their definitive hits <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3h--K5928M\">I Can\u2019t Explain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zwum1w-iIM\">Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgJ9K7cPRKk\">My Generation</a>.

This gave him experience of working with artists including the Castells and surf band the Marketts, and with the group of session musicians who would become known as the Wrecking Crew. Talmy recalled how \u201cI used to work out miking techniques for how to make drums sound better or guitars sound better \u2026 it was all totally new.\u201d</p> <p>In 1962 he travelled to Britain, initially planning to stay for five weeks.

His friend Nick Venet, an A&amp;R man at Capitol Records in LA who had signed the Beach Boys to the label, gave him a batch of acetates (or test pressings) of songs by various artists and told Talmy he could claim that he had produced them. He played songs by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> and the soulman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/10/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Lou Rawls</a> to Dick Rowe at Decca Records in London, telling Rowe that he was \u201cthe greatest thing since oxygen was invented, in terms of producers\u201d, and was promptly offered a job. One of his first projects was producing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGw-62pWcLA\">Charmaine</a>, a Top 10 hit by Irish trio The Bachelors.</p> <p>He felt energised by the creative energy he found in London, describing how \u201cnobody got a lot of sleep, but nobody gave a damn.

We all worked long into the night, and then we\u2019d go out to parties</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1964 he went solo as an independent producer, and one of his earliest signings was the Kinks. He first began working with them in late 1963 when they were still called the Ravens, and he gave them their first hit in 1964 with the UK chart-topper You Really Got Me. Talmy\u2019s innovative microphone placings, using a dozen of them where other producers might only use three or four, helped to capture the power and resonance of the group\u2019s sound, and would become a Talmy trademark. His relationship with the group would continue into 1967, bringing them two more No&nbsp;1 hits with Sunny Afternoon and Tired of Waiting for You and half a dozen more Top 10 placings. They also scored three Top 10 hits in the US during this period.</p> <p>The jagged guitar riff of You Really Got Me was an inspiration to the Who\u2019s Pete Townshend, prompting him to write I Can\u2019t Explain. It was the Who\u2019s production manager Mike Shaw who played a demo of the song to Talmy down the telephone, who immediately loved it. \u201cThey were loud, raw, but they had balls,\u201d Talmy recalled. \u201cI said \u2018let\u2019s do it\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>I Can\u2019t Explain was a Top 10 hit in 1964, and the following year the band\u2019s Talmy-produced singles Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere and My Generation reached No 10 and No 2 respectively. However, the partnership was scuppered by the fact that Talmy and one of the Who\u2019s managers, Kit Lambert, loathed each other. Also, the Who\u2019s deal with Talmy\u2019s production company gave them a very poor royalty rate, and Townshend disliked the way Talmy made the Who part of \u201ca pop-record-churning-out type machine, a big package\u201d. </p> <p>This all prompted a legal dispute eventually settled out of court (Talmy had hired Quintin Hogg \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/15/guardianobituaries.conservatives\">Lord Hailsham</a> \u2013 to represent him), giving Talmy a share of the group\u2019s royalties for the next six years.

These were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqZe-G0SfkA\">I Pity the Fool</a>, credited to the Manish Boys, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgVfAkIOTOo\">You\u2019ve Got a Habit of Leaving</a>, by Davy Jones &amp; the Lower Third. He also produced the single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvD0_aeAf2E\">A Summer Song</a> and the 1964 album Yesterday\u2019s Gone for the duo Chad &amp; Jeremy.</p> <p>He enjoyed a notable success with the Australian group the Easybeats, whose anthemic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBJLoYd8xak\">Friday on My Mind</a> (1966) was a hit around the world, reaching No 6 in Britain and 16 in the US. He also produced Manfred Mann\u2019s version of Bob Dylan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtZhk9Bs28A\">Just Like a Woman</a>, which reached 10 in the UK.

The attack in the busy residential area came without warning, and appeared to damage to neighbouring buildings.</p> <p>The son of a prominent Shia cleric, Afif managed the Hezbollah-run TV network Al Manar before taking over as head of the militant Islamist group\u2019s media relations. Since the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, on 28 September, Afif became one of the group\u2019s most prominent officials, holding several press conferences in Beirut.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/united-nations-special-committee-israel-gaza-genocide\">UN special committee likens Israeli policy in Gaza to genocide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Analysts said Asif was the first official with such a role to be killed by Israel, as all previous targets had military or senior leadership posts. Until Sunday, there had been no Israeli airstrikes on central Beirut since mid-October.</p> <p>Witnesses saw four bodies at the scene of the strike, which took place a day before Lebanon was expected to deliver its response to a US-delivered ceasefire proposal. There was no official word on the exact death toll.<br><br>\u201cI was asleep and awoke from the sound of the strike, and people screaming, and cars and gunfire,\u201d said Suheil Halabi, a local resident. \u201cI was startled, honestly. This is the first time I experience it so close.\u201d</p> <p>Late on Sunday, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said another Israeli strike in central Beirut killed two people and wounded 13. Firefighters were battling a blaze triggered by the strike in the commercial-residential area.</p> <p>The education minister later announced Beirut-area schools would close for two days. Lebanon\u2019s army, which is not a party to the conflict, said Israel had \u201cdirectly targeted\u201d an army centre in south Lebanon on Sunday, killing two soldiers.<br><br>In Gaza, civil defence workers confirmed 34 deaths, including children, from an Israeli strike that hit a five-storey residential building in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza. Dozens more were missing.</p> <p>An Israeli military spokesperson said strikes were conducted on \u201cterrorist targets\u201d.<br><br>\u201cWe emphasise that there have been continued efforts to evacuate the civilian population from the active war zone in the area, in parallel with efforts to expand the humanitarian area in al-Mawasi \u2026 The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is precisely operating and is doing everything possible to avoid causing harm to civilians,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Evacuation orders on leaflets distributed on Sunday told civilians to leave northernmost parts of Gaza immediately.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an early warning before the attack! You are in a dangerous battle zone. For your safety, go urgently,\u201d the leaflets read.</p> <p>Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge the militant Islamist group denies. There was no independent confirmation of the death toll.</p> <p>The airstrikes in Gaza on Sunday came amid Israeli offensives in Beit Lahiya and the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya. Witnesses said much of the area was obscured by smoke and shelling on Sunday.</p> <p>The tight siege of the three towns and a series of evacuation orders has raised widespread concerns that Israel intends to force civilian populations to leave the northernmost parts of Gaza and will not permit their return. Humanitarian conditions there are described as \u201capocalyptic\u201d by aid workers, with very limited food, water, medicine and communications.</p> <p>In a statement, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res accused Israel of following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/israel-generals-plan-clear-north-gaza-palestinians\">plan proposed by former senior Israeli military officers</a> to forcibly displace or kill Palestinians in northern Gaza.</p> <p>\u201cThe way the ongoing offensive in the north is being waged \u2026 reinforces the idea that we are witnessing the execution of this plan,\u201d the NGO said.</p>    <p>Israel denies any such intention and says the offensives, launched last month, are an effort to prevent Hamas from regrouping in areas that have been cleared in previous multiple rounds of combat.</p> <p>In other deadly strikes on Sunday, civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said attacks killed 15 people in central Gaza and five in the southern city of Rafah. Also in the south, in the Khan Younis area, civil defence said an Israeli drone targeted a group of unarmed people securing an aid delivery, killing six.</p>    <p>On Saturday evening, an Israeli airstrike on a UN-run school sheltering displaced people killed 10, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Israel\u2019s military said it struck a command centre of the militant Islamist organisation in the compound.</p> <p>The latest strikes in Lebanon came as Israel\u2019s media reported that Israeli troops had advanced as far as three miles (5km) from the contested border.</p> <p>Israeli media said the IDF were deliberately \u201cblurring\u201d the extent of its operations in Lebanon, even though most aims set out by the Israeli government had been achieved.</p> <p>\u201cThe IDF won\u2019t admit this, but the Northern Command completed the mission it was given by the political leadership two weeks ago, on schedule. That mission was to remove the threat of an \u2026 invasion of the Galilee,\u201d wrote Yoav Zitun in the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.</p> <p>Israeli attacks also targeted buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, on Sunday after warnings for residents to evacuate.</p>    <p>There were also reports of strikes in several other areas of the country, including the port city of Tyre, where the Lebanese health ministry said 11 people were killed and 48 wounded.</p> <p>In a statement, the Israeli military said the attacks were \u201cintelligence-based\u201d and targeted Hezbollah command centres and infrastructure. </p> <p>Israel launched its offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon to allow an estimated 60,000 Israelis to return to homes near the border evacuated in the first days of the war for fear of attack and bombardment by the militant Islamist group.</p> <p>Although Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities have been significantly reduced, it has continued to fire rockets and missiles into Israel since the beginning of the conflict in Gaza.</p>    <p>Israel\u2019s military said on Saturday that Hezbollah had fired more than 80 projectiles across the border that day. Most were intercepted or did not cause injuries but a synagogue was struck and two civilians were wounded in a \u201cheavy rocket barrage\u201d by Hezbollah on Haifa, northern Israel\u2019s largest city. Hezbollah said it fired missiles at five Israeli military facilities in Haifa and its suburbs.</p> <p>More than 3,400 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire according to the Lebanese health ministry. Israel\u2019s military said a soldier died in combat in southern Lebanon on Friday.</p> <p>By the beginning of November, more than 60 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights by Hezbollah attacks in almost 13 months of the conflict. </p> <p>Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has previously linked any ceasefire in the north to an end to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, though some analysts now believe the group may consider a separate deal.<br><br>A copy of a draft proposal presented by the US earlier this week was handed over to the speaker of Lebanon\u2019s parliament, Nabih Berri, who has been negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah, according to a Lebanese official. The proposal is based on UN security council resolution 1701, which ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.</p> <p>The multi-front conflict began after Palestinian militants from Hamas and other armed groups launched a surprise attack from Gaza into southern Israel in October last year, killing about 1,200 people \u2013 mostly civilians \u2013 and abducting 250 others. <br><br>About 100 hostages are thought to be still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israelis rallied again in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to demand a ceasefire deal to return the hostages.</p> <p>The Gaza health ministry said 43,799 people have been confirmed dead in Gaza since the war began. More than half of identified casualties have been women or children.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hezbollah\u2019s chief spokesman has been killed by an Israeli airstrike on Beirut, as Israel intensifies its air offensive in Lebanon despite ongoing indirect negotiations for a ceasefire. Mohammed Afif, who has been the public face of Hezbollah for months, was killed in a strike on offices of the Ba\u2019ath party in Ras al-Nabaa, central Beirut. The attack in the busy residential area came without warning, and appeared to damage to neighbouring buildings. The son of a prominent Shia cleric, Afif managed the Hezbollah-run TV network Al Manar before taking over as head of the militant Islamist group\u2019s media relations. Since the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, on 28 September, Afif became one of the group\u2019s most prominent officials, holding several press conferences in Beirut. Analysts said Asif was the first official with such a role to be killed by Israel, as all previous targets had military or senior leadership posts. Until Sunday, there had been no Israeli airstrikes on central Beirut since mid-October. Witnesses saw four bodies at the scene of the strike, which took place a day before Lebanon was expected to deliver its response to a US-delivered ceasefire proposal. There was no official word on the exact death toll. \u201cI was asleep and awoke from the sound of the strike, and people screaming, and cars and gunfire,\u201d said Suheil Halabi, a local resident. \u201cI was startled, honestly. This is the first time I experience it so close.\u201d Late on Sunday, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said another Israeli strike in central Beirut killed two people and wounded 13. Firefighters were battling a blaze triggered by the strike in the commercial-residential area. The education minister later announced Beirut-area schools would close for two days. Lebanon\u2019s army, which is not a party to the conflict, said Israel had \u201cdirectly targeted\u201d an army centre in south Lebanon on Sunday, killing two soldiers. In Gaza, civil defence workers confirmed 34 deaths, including children, from an Israeli strike that hit a five-storey residential building in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza. Dozens more were missing. An Israeli military spokesperson said strikes were conducted on \u201cterrorist targets\u201d. \u201cWe emphasise that there have been continued efforts to evacuate the civilian population from the active war zone in the area, in parallel with efforts to expand the humanitarian area in al-Mawasi \u2026 The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is precisely operating and is doing everything possible to avoid causing harm to civilians,\u201d they said. Evacuation orders on leaflets distributed on Sunday told civilians to leave northernmost parts of Gaza immediately. \u201cThis is an early warning before the attack! You are in a dangerous battle zone. For your safety, go urgently,\u201d the leaflets read. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge the militant Islamist group denies. There was no independent confirmation of the death toll. The airstrikes in Gaza on Sunday came amid Israeli offensives in Beit Lahiya and the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya. Witnesses said much of the area was obscured by smoke and shelling on Sunday. The tight siege of the three towns and a series of evacuation orders has raised widespread concerns that Israel intends to force civilian populations to leave the northernmost parts of Gaza and will not permit their return. Humanitarian conditions there are described as \u201capocalyptic\u201d by aid workers, with very limited food, water, medicine and communications. In a statement, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res accused Israel of following a plan proposed by former senior Israeli military officers to forcibly displace or kill Palestinians in northern Gaza. \u201cThe way the ongoing offensive in the north is being waged \u2026 reinforces the idea that we are witnessing the execution of this plan,\u201d the NGO said. Israel denies any such intention and says the offensives, launched last month, are an effort to prevent Hamas from regrouping in areas that have been cleared in previous multiple rounds of combat. In other deadly strikes on Sunday, civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said attacks killed 15 people in central Gaza and five in the southern city of Rafah. Also in the south, in the Khan Younis area, civil defence said an Israeli drone targeted a group of unarmed people securing an aid delivery, killing six. On Saturday evening, an Israeli airstrike on a UN-run school sheltering displaced people killed 10, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Israel\u2019s military said it struck a command centre of the militant Islamist organisation in the compound. The latest strikes in Lebanon came as Israel\u2019s media reported that Israeli troops had advanced as far as three miles (5km) from the contested border. Israeli media said the IDF were deliberately \u201cblurring\u201d the extent of its operations in Lebanon, even though most aims set out by the Israeli government had been achieved. \u201cThe IDF won\u2019t admit this, but the Northern Command completed the mission it was given by the political leadership two weeks ago, on schedule. That mission was to remove the threat of an \u2026 invasion of the Galilee,\u201d wrote Yoav Zitun in the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. Israeli attacks also targeted buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, on Sunday after warnings for residents to evacuate. There were also reports of strikes in several other areas of the country, including the port city of Tyre, where the Lebanese health ministry said 11 people were killed and 48 wounded. In a statement, the Israeli military said the attacks were \u201cintelligence-based\u201d and targeted Hezbollah command centres and infrastructure. Israel launched its offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon to allow an estimated 60,000 Israelis to return to homes near the border evacuated in the first days of the war for fear of attack and bombardment by the militant Islamist group. Although Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities have been significantly reduced, it has continued to fire rockets and missiles into Israel since the beginning of the conflict in Gaza. Israel\u2019s military said on Saturday that Hezbollah had fired more than 80 projectiles across the border that day. Most were intercepted or did not cause injuries but a synagogue was struck and two civilians were wounded in a \u201cheavy rocket barrage\u201d by Hezbollah on Haifa, northern Israel\u2019s largest city. Hezbollah said it fired missiles at five Israeli military facilities in Haifa and its suburbs. More than 3,400 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire according to the Lebanese health ministry. Israel\u2019s military said a soldier died in combat in southern Lebanon on Friday. By the beginning of November, more than 60 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights by Hezbollah attacks in almost 13 months of the conflict. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has previously linked any ceasefire in the north to an end to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, though some analysts now believe the group may consider a separate deal. A copy of a draft proposal presented by the US earlier this week was handed over to the speaker of Lebanon\u2019s parliament, Nabih Berri, who has been negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah, according to a Lebanese official. The proposal is based on UN security council resolution 1701, which ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. The multi-front conflict began after Palestinian militants from Hamas and other armed groups launched a surprise attack from Gaza into southern Israel in October last year, killing about 1,200 people \u2013 mostly civilians \u2013 and abducting 250 others. About 100 hostages are thought to be still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israelis rallied again in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to demand a ceasefire deal to return the hostages. The Gaza health ministry said 43,799 people have been confirmed dead in Gaza since the war began. More than half of identified casualties have been women or children.",

      "bodyText": "Big UK businesses including Ovo, SSE and BT Openreach are urging the government to stick to current electric car targets as struggling carmakers pile pressure on ministers to relax the rules before industry talks this week. The businesses said the zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which forces carmakers to sell greater numbers of electric cars each year, is an essential part of the plan to reduce the carbon and air pollution emissions caused by vehicles on Britain\u2019s roads. Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach, the BT subsidiary that builds broadband infrastructure, said the government needed to \u201ccut through the noise and listen to businesses who are already investing large sums in the switch\u201d when considering the future of the mandate. \u201cDon\u2019t waver on the ZEV mandate,\u201d Selley said. Carmakers, however, are increasingly vocal that the mandate needs to be watered down as their global profits come under pressure and sales of electric cars slow. Carmakers with factories in the UK, as well as those involved in the new charging infrastructure, are due to discuss the mandate as well as weak consumer demand for electric cars with the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, this week. After weekend reports that the Japanese manufacturer Nissan intended to use the meeting to warn ministers that the UK car industry is reaching a \u201ccrisis point\u201d, Haigh said she would look at \u201cflexibilities\u201d but insisted that the mandate \u201cwill not be weakened\u201d.

Another option \u2013 although expensive \u2013 would be to reintroduce some purchase subsidies for consumers. One of the big concerns is that without a change of heart there could be UK job losses. Stellantis is due to give a decision on a review of the future of its Vauxhall van factories at Luton and Ellesmere Port, after threatening to close them unless market demand for electric vehicles picks up and the UK loosens regulations. The mandate means 22% of manufacturers\u2019 electric car sales this year must be electric, rising to 80% in 2030 \u2013 although in practice various loopholes mean most carmakers appear on track to avoid fines if they overshoot. The industry meeting will also include several companies that are likely to express support for the mandate. Alex Thwaites, director of electric vehicles at Ovo, which has 4 million customers across Britain, said it provided \u201ccertainty for both UK drivers and the automotive industry\u201d, and added that industry and government should be making \u201cthe switch to electric vehicles an easier choice\u201d. Some energy companies stand to lose out if the ZEV mandate is relaxed because it will hit demand for electric charging at home and at their dedicated charge points. SSE, for example, is investing heavily in a joint venture with the French oil company TotalEnergies to install 3,000 ultra-rapid charge points. Nathan Sanders, managing director for distributed energy at SSE, said it was \u201cvital the government continues to maintain a supportive policy environment with a strong zero-emission vehicle mandate at its core\u201d for it to continue to invest. While delaying the EV transition would ease the short-term pressure on manufacturers, many activists as well as industry analysts argue that doing so could hurt the UK car industry in the longer term, as a host of Chinese electric car manufacturers would probably race to fill the gap.

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for joining me. Until we meet again! Here\u2019s Tom Garry\u2019s report from Goodison Park. The socials are in. Liverpool will be left fuming about a dreadful referring decision that has cost them a point in the Merseyside derby. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Brosnan to the rescue again! Enderby slips a pass to Bonner who whacks a shot at goal but Brosnan is equal to it. A throughly deserved victory for Marc Skinner\u2019s side thanks to Terland and Bizet. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: It is backs against the walls for the Toffees \u2026 Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Eight minutes added on! Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Kapocs wants a penalty after going down in the box but the referee is having none of it. A dreadful mistake from Bott allows Bizet in and she calmly slots home a second. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Hobson is on for Toni Payne, so that\u2019s a defender for a striker. I think we can see how the final 10 minutes or so will play out. Leicester 0-1 Man Utd: Bizet is sent through on goal but the goalkeeper is out quickly and stops the shot, the rebound falls to Clinton but Leicester scramble it clear. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Every blue shirt seems to be permanently behind the ball. It seems ill-advised to be this defensive so early in the game. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Hayashi is down with cramp, an indication of how much graft Everton have put in thus far. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Lots of lovely rain on Merseyside. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Kiernan flicks a Hinds cross towards the far corner but there is no pace on it and Brosnan grabs. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Everton gaffer Sorensen permanently has an earphone in and is now talking into his phone. The modern manager (plus baseball cap). Leicester 0-1 Man Utd: The visitors are still on top but Leicester have threatened a few times. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: The reason it is not a penalty is because Smith is diving. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Smith goes down in the penalty area but the referee is not interested. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: An incredible double save from Brosnan keeps Everton in the lead. First Nagamo pings a shot from 12 yards which the goalkeeper does well to stop but the Liverpool midfielder reaches the rebound first and Brosnan dives at her feet to prevent an equaliser. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Beard has his head in his hands after a word with the fourth official. I assume he is still angry over the penalty decision and I suspect the answers he\u2019s receiving from the fourth official are inadequate. Leicester 0-1 Man Utd: Bizet attempts an optimistic overhead kick and she does not nail it, sending the ball meekly wide. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Kiernan is penalised for a handball and she can have no complaints as her hands are well above her head. We are back playing at Goodison and the King Power. Salmon wins it at the end with an incredible goal to earn Villa their first victory of the season. Heartbreak for Palace, joy for Villa as Salmon spins on the edge of the box and whacks the ball into the top corner. Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace: Four minutes added on. Can anyone find a winner? Blanchard loses her marker at the back post, allowing her to volley home an equaliser. Aston Villa 2-1 Crystal Palace: The Villans have had 20 shots in the match, which is pretty impressive. Aston Villa 2-1 Crystal Palace: Five minutes to go for the Eagles to find an equaliser. United took a very late lead after dominating the first half. A penalty is the difference but it never should have happened. Despite additional time being up, Terland is able to open the scoring with a looping header back across the goalkeeper. Everton 1-0 Liverpool: Matthew Beard rightly has a good moan at the fourth official. With the naked eye, it looked half a yard outside the box and replays further prove it. No VAR, of course. Snoeijs sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to further punish Liverpool for some truly awful officiating. Everton 0-0 Liverpool: PENALTY TO EVERTON! Hayashi is tripped outside the box but the referee away a penalty! Leicester 0-0 Man Utd: Cain drives through the United defence and benefits from a ricochet in the box but someone sends her shot wide from six yards. She looks unhappy with herself. Everton 0-0 Liverpool: Those couple of chances for Everton seems to have given them an extra impetus and they have ramped up their press and energy levels. Aston Villa 2-1 Crystal Palace: Daly has a decent chance inside the box but a defender produces a fine block at the vital moment. Everton 0-0 Liverpool: Former Liverpool player Lawley whacks a drive from 20 yards, it is heading for the bottom corner until Micah fingertips it wide. Everton 0-0 Liverpool: After withstanding a lot of pressure, Everton\u2019s Toni Payne leads a break before cutting in from the left and taking aim for the top corner, only to see her shot fly just wide. Everton 0-0 Liverpool: Hinds does well to control a cross and spin on the spot but she drags her shot wide. One-way traffic. Everton 0-0 Liverpool: The visitors are first to everything at Goodison. They are playing at a far higher tempo than Everton, who are battling to cope. Aston Villa 2-1 Crystal Palace: It is the hosts who are on top in this one as they seek their first win over the season. Everton 0-0 Liverpool: The Toffees try to play out from the back but it almost ends in complete farce, only saved by a generous referee who gives a free-kick for a foul on the goalkeeper. Leicester 0-0 Man Utd: Clinton should give United the lead when a cross finds her unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box but she complete misses the target. Leicester 0-0 Man Utd: The Foxes cannot get out of their own half. They are under plenty of pressure. Aston Villa 2-1 Crystal Palace: We are off again at Villa Park! Everton 0-0 Liverpool: It is all Liverpool at Goodison. Everton seem to be planning to cling on for as long as possible, which I guess is a type of plan. Leicester 0-0 Man Utd: United are having the better of the opening minutes at the King Power without threatening. Everton 0-0 Liverpool: The first chance of the match falls to Kiernan who pings a shot from 30 yards which does not dip in time as it flies over. Peep! Peep! Peep! The whistles go to start the 3pm kick offs. It was a fine turnaround for Villa thanks to Patten and Daly after going behind. Hanson plays a perfect through ball for Daly to latch on to and smash past the goalkeeper at the first time of asking. Aston Villa 1-1 Crystal Palace: Seven minutes added on after those early head injuries. Aston Villa 1-1 Crystal Palace: Now it is the Villans who are aiming for a second. They have a few chances in the space of a minute or two, forcing Yanez into some decent saves. A looping cross is not cleared by Palace and lands at the the feet Patten who takes a touch before firing a shot under Yanez to equalise. Aston Villa 0-1 Crystal Palace: Understandably, the opening goal has given the visitors a confidence boost and they are on the hunt for a second. After Villa miss plenty of decent chances, Cato produces a hammer blow with a calm sidefooted shot into the corner to give Palace the lead. Aston Villa 0-0 Crystal Palace: The match has calmed down after the early flurry of chances. Villa are still on top and Hanson has a decent opportunity but whacks her shot well over from the edge of the box. Aston Villa 0-0 Crystal Palace: After another lengthy delay, Everett is patched up and ready to go again in a new, unbloodied shirt. Aston Villa 0-0 Crystal Palace: Tomas and Everett clash heads in the box, leaving the Eagles captain on the deck while she is treated. Aston Villa 0-0 Crystal Palace: The hosts are dominating the early part of the match, which was halted for a couple of minutes to allow Green to have treatment for a head injury. Everton: Brosnan, Hayashi, Wheeler, Vanhaevermaet, T. Payne, Lawley, Hope, H. Payne, Finnigan, S. Holmsgaard, Snoeijs Subs: Hobson, Bissell, Ramsey, Foster, Sarri, Settle, Jones, Thomas, Olesen Liverpool: Micah, Fisk, Clark, Bonner, Silcock, Hinds, Nagano, Holland, Hobinger, Smith, Kiernan Subs:Spencer, Evans, Fahey, Kapocs, Enderby, Daniels, Shaw Leicester: Leitzig, Nevin, Bott, Howard, Takarada, Cayman, Cain, Kees, Chossenotte, Momiki, Mace Subs: Kop, Ale, Thibaud, Swaby, Las, Sherwood, Pelgander, Rose, Goodwin Man United: Tullis-Joyce, George, Le Tissier, Clinton, Awujo, Riviere, Bizet, Janssen, Terland, Turner, Geyse Subs: Middleton-Patel, Newell, Sandberg, Simpson, Ladd, Miyazawa, Watson, Malard, Williams Aston Villa 0-0 Crystal Palace: I am starting to think these two are are struggling because they can\u2019t defence. Gejl is set free down the middle but she is repelled twice by D\u2019Angelo. Aston Villa 0-0 Crystal Palace: Yanez is called into action again soon after when Nobbs takes aim from 20 yards but the goalkeeper does well to tip it clear. Aston Villa 0-0 Crystal Palace: A chance on 60 seconds as Villa cut through Palace, allowing Daly to ping an effort from 15 yards but the keeper is equal to it. Aston Villa 0-0 Crystal Palace: The first game of the day has started! Is it cold at Villa Park? According to the players who have given their pre-match jackets to mascots, yes, yes it is. Some early afternoon reading: Aston Villa: D\u2019Angelo, Mayling, Patten, Turner, Tomas, Staniforth, Nobbs, Grant, Hanson, Nunes, Daly. Subs: Kelly, Maritz, Pacheco, Taylor, Kearns, Robinson, Dali, Leon, Salmon. Crystal Palace: Yanez, Veje, Cato, Everett, Blanchard, Green, Potter, Riley, Gejl, Woodham, Stengel. Subs: Majasaarl, Gibbons, Arthur, Sharpe, Weerden, Pritchard, Larkin, Aspin, Atkinson. Welcome one and all! The focus of today\u2019s action is the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park where winless Everton host Liverpool. It\u2019s been a dreadful start to the season for the Toffees who have three points from seven matches and are very much underdogs against sixth-placed Liverpool. Speaking of teams without victories, Aston Villa host Crystal Palace, who can boast one triumph since promotion. The Villans have struggled since the departure of Carla Ward and Robert de Pauw desperately needs to slide to end. Elsewhere, unbeaten Manchester United travel to Leicester. Marc Skinner\u2019s side have won and drawn three of their six matches thus far and beating Leicester by a few goals would help them jump above Arsenal as United search for momentum after three draws in a row. Aston Villa v Crystal Palace, 2pm (GMT) Everton v Liverpool, 3pm Leicester v Manchester United, 3pm",

      "body": "<p>\u201cMy dream is that people\u2019s eyes will be opened instinctively to their surroundings,\u201d says Simon Jenkins at the end of his new book. \u201cI want people to point at buildings, laugh, cry or get angry. I want them to hate and to love what they see. I want them to speak architecture.\u201d So he has written <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-short-history-of-british-architecture-9780241674956/\">A Short History of British Architecture</a></em>, which he hopes will help people understand what he calls the \u201clanguage\u201d of styles \u2013 such things as the difference between Doric and Corinthian columns, or between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/10/gothic-architecture-british\">early English and perpendicular gothic</a>.</p> <p>It turns out to be two books in one. The first 200 pages are a brisk rattle through four-and-a-half millennia of the greatest hits of British building from Stonehenge onwards, talking about cathedrals, country houses and monuments rather than the places of everyday life, delivered with the measured if sometimes opinionated tone of a benign tour guide.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He\u00a0lambasts the postwar destruction of British cities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The last 70 pages are a partisan polemic about the ravages wreaked on British cities by modernist planners and architects. He writes these as an engaged and enraged combatant: as a young journalist he was involved in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/concrete-bungle-how-public-fury-stopped-the-1970s-plan-to-turn-london-into-a-motorway\">1970s campaign to save Covent Garden from redevelopment</a>, and he has taken an interest in issues of heritage and planning \u2013 including as a former chairman of the National Trust \u2013 ever since.</p> <p>The first part is a readable retelling of the standard histories, animated by the odd engaging tale and personal observation.

      "bodyText": "\u201cMy dream is that people\u2019s eyes will be opened instinctively to their surroundings,\u201d says Simon Jenkins at the end of his new book. \u201cI want people to point at buildings, laugh, cry or get angry. I want them to hate and to love what they see. I want them to speak architecture.\u201d So he has written A Short History of British Architecture, which he hopes will help people understand what he calls the \u201clanguage\u201d of styles \u2013 such things as the difference between Doric and Corinthian columns, or between early English and perpendicular gothic. It turns out to be two books in one. The first 200 pages are a brisk rattle through four-and-a-half millennia of the greatest hits of British building from Stonehenge onwards, talking about cathedrals, country houses and monuments rather than the places of everyday life, delivered with the measured if sometimes opinionated tone of a benign tour guide. The last 70 pages are a partisan polemic about the ravages wreaked on British cities by modernist planners and architects. He writes these as an engaged and enraged combatant: as a young journalist he was involved in the 1970s campaign to save Covent Garden from redevelopment, and he has taken an interest in issues of heritage and planning \u2013 including as a former chairman of the National Trust \u2013 ever since. The first part is a readable retelling of the standard histories, animated by the odd engaging tale and personal observation. He makes sweeping statements as to what architecture is. Stonehenge is; the intricate, older complex of circular houses at Skara Brae in Orkney is not. He contestably asserts that the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall \u2013 a towering and violently original assertion of power and wealth in glass and stone and tapestry \u2013 \u201cexudes an English dignity and calm\u201d. He seems uncomfortable with more creative and inventive architects, such as Nicholas Hawksmoor (whose use of baroque elements is called \u201ctentative\u201d) or Sir John Soane. His own preference is for what he calls a \u201cgolden age\u201d in the second half of the 18th century, a more tasteful and stylistically orderly era when \u201cfor perhaps the first and only time, a large constituency of Britons managed to speak architecture\u201d, by which he means a mostly aristocratic clientele who shared with their architects an education in ancient Roman and Greek styles. The second part of the book is more vivid. Here Jenkins lambasts the postwar destruction of British cities by architects, planners and politicians, intent on sweeping away the \u201cobsolete\u201d, handing over public spaces to cars, and fulfilling (in his telling) the demented visions of the Swiss-French modernist Le Corbusier, a man who hated the ordinary shop-lined streets that make up most cities. This tale has been much told, and it\u2019s a little wearying that Le Corbusier continues to be belaboured (as he is in Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s recent Humanise) at least 50 years after his urban ideas went out of fashion. The collateral damage of Jenkins\u2019s onslaught on the modern also includes much beautiful and successful architecture, but it is nonetheless hard to disagree that some true atrocities were perpetrated. And the author, who was there in those planning battles, has earned the right to talk about them.

      "bodyText": "The lack of engagement with the NHS health check should be deeply concerning for the secretary of state, as it is with me, an emergency medicine doctor who treats the consequences of undiagnosed heart disease (Less than half of eligible people received NHS \u2018midlife MOT\u2019 since 2019, says watchdog, 13 November). When you look into it further, the inequalities are alarming. If you come from a deprived part of England, such as east London, where I work, then you are four times more likely to die from a heart condition than those from more affluent areas. If you are male or from a Black or South Asian background, then you have a higher risk of developing heart disease, yet men from those communities are less likely to attend their NHS health check invitation. The term \u201chard to reach\u201d is old fashioned and, quite frankly, discriminatory and neglectful. We must do more to prevent high\u2011risk communities being \u201chard to serve\u201d. Black, Caribbean and South Asian men should be invited for their health check earlier, at 30 years of age, then again at every five years. The evidence for prevention is the earlier the better. We must then take the service to the people. This includes NHS health check buses on council estates, integrating the offer into corporate occupational health services, and multilingual public health messaging on community TV and radio that serve these communities, explaining the importance of the checks. The solutions are not new nor innovative, but now that the government wants to shift from hospital to community, and from treatment to prevention, then we must harness the political enthusiasm to maximise healthier living for my patients.

      "body": "<p>In 2010, the year he turned 80, the artist Daniel Spoerri returned to Romania, the country he had left at the age of 12. Among his many discoveries was the local custom of picnicking in cemeteries. \u201cRomanians eat with their dead,\u201d Spoerri remarked in a 2015 biopic, gazing at a photograph he had brought back from his visit of a dining table next to a grave.</p> <p>The image might have been of one of his own works. In 1983, Spoerri had organised an al fresco dinner for 120 guests in a town outside Paris. As they ate, a nearby crane dug a trench the same size as the dining table. Halfway through the meal, diners were asked to remove their place settings \u2013 plates, glass and cutlery \u2013 and lower them into the 40-metre ditch, which was then filled in with earth. The performance was called <a href=\"https://www.dejeunersouslherbe.org/\">Le D\u00e9jeuner sous l\u2019Herbe</a>, a play on the title of the <a href=\"https://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/oeuvres/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-904\">famous Manet painting</a>.</p>    <p>This was the latest in a mode of work described as \u201ceat art\u201d by Spoerri, who has died aged 94. In 1968, in D\u00fcsseldorf, he had opened the Restaurant Spoerri, serving up such exotica as grilled ant omelettes and python cutlets. An exhibition space was added to this two years later. All the works in the Eat Art Galerie were to be edible: among the artists who showed there during its four-year life were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/30/fat-felt-fall-earth-making-and-myths-joseph-beuys\">Joseph Beuys</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/obituary-roy-lichtenstein-1233307.html\">Roy Lichtenstein</a>. </p> <p>In Spoerri\u2019s telling, the defining instincts of mankind were reproduction and nutrition. Sex being well served iconographically in art, he decided to concentrate his work on food. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d he said, \u201cbut survival means eating and eating means cuisine.\u201d </p>    <p>This idea had come to him as a young man working in Paris among future members of the post-dadaist fluxus movement. In 1961, Spoerri made the first of what would be his most famous group of works, known as <em>tableaux pi\u00e8ges</em>, or snare-pictures. Entitled Le Petit D\u00e9jeuner de Kichka, it consisted of the leftovers of his then girlfriend\u2019s breakfast, glued to the table and chair on which it had been served, turned vertically and hung from a wall. The work is now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, as is Spoerri\u2019s Taboo Catalogue of the same year, a loaf of bread baked with dust, nails and broken glass in it. \u201cInstead of putting bread in the garbage, I decided to put garbage in bread,\u201d the artist recalled, adding, \u201cIt smelled delicious at the opening, but you couldn\u2019t eat it.\u201d</p> <p>If all this sounded cheerily madcap, Spoerri\u2019s work was underpinned by a profound fascination with parallel ideas of taste in food and art, as also between literal and metaphorical consumption. In 1960, the young Romanian had been one of the original signatories of the French group known as the <em>nouveaux</em> <em>r\u00e9alistes</em>, whose aim had been to blur the gap between art and life. Making work \u2013 paintings, sculpture, performance \u2013 that did not merely reproduce food, but consisted of it, squared a moral circle. \u201cMaking an artwork out of life itself appears to me to be the most delicious way to employ one\u2019s time,\u201d Spoerri said.</p> <p>Eat art also had a biographical resonance for him. When he returned to Romania in 2010, it was to try to discover the fate of his father. Spoerri had been born Daniel Feinstein, the oldest of six children of Isaac Feinstein and his Swiss Protestant wife, Lydia (nee Spoerri), a schoolteacher, in Gala\u0163i, in the historical region of western Moldavia. Isaac, a Romanian Jew who had converted to Lutheranism, worked as a Christian missionary. This did not save him when, in 1941, the Romanian fascist organisation the Iron Guard whipped up a pogrom that killed 13,000 Jews around the Feinsteins\u2019 home town of Ia\u0219i. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Making an artwork out of life itself appears to me to be the most delicious way to employ one\u2019s time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Isaac was taken away, and assumed killed. Desperate to get her six children home to Switzerland, Lydia had to bribe a local doctor to produce a death certificate for her murdered husband after local authorities refused to acknowledge what had happened and issue official paperwork.</p> <p>\u201cThey told the truth by lying,\u201d Spoerri would later say.</p> <p>It took Lydia a year to get all the paperwork together, during which time, as the son of a Jew unable to go to the local school, the 12-year-old Daniel ran wild. It was then that he learned to cook, his first dish being a pilaf with ground beef and raisins. In retrospect, the instinct to nourish seemed like a corrective to death. It was only on his 2010 visit to Ia\u0219i that Spoerri discovered exactly what had happened to his father \u2013 that he had been left to suffocate with other Jews in a railway carriage, then dumped in a trench by the train tracks, like the one dug for Dejeuner sous l\u2019Herbe.</p> <p>Finally reaching Zurich in late 1942, he was adopted by his maternal uncle, Theophil Spoerri, and took his surname. In the early 1950s, Spoerri studied dance, joining the troupe of the State Opera of Berne before moving to the Landestheater in Darmstadt, West Germany, in 1957.</p> <p>There he met and married Vera Mertz, daughter of the theatre\u2019s designer. The couple left for Paris, where Spoerri was befriended by surrealist artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/oct/15/conceptualist-art-fountain-is-fake-say-historians-marcel-duchamp\">Marcel Duchamp</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/16/man-ray-in-la-what-happened-when-the-pioneering-artist-hit-hollywood\">Man Ray</a>. With the encouragement of these, he set up Edition MAT (Multiplication d\u2019Art Transformable), producing multiples of artworks by famous artists affordable to the average buyer. The three MAT collections published between 1959 and 1965 included pieces by Duchamp, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/10/bauhaus-josef-anni-albers-art\">Josef Albers</a> and Lichtenstein.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, Spoerri bought a 16-hectare estate in Italy, south of Siena.

Among his many discoveries was the local custom of picnicking in cemeteries. \u201cRomanians eat with their dead,\u201d Spoerri remarked in a 2015 biopic, gazing at a photograph he had brought back from his visit of a dining table next to a grave. The image might have been of one of his own works. In 1983, Spoerri had organised an al fresco dinner for 120 guests in a town outside Paris.

      "bodyText": "A bitter feud that tore apart an illustrious actors\u2019 charity has been reignited by the emergence of poison pen letters threatening former trustees. The annual meeting of the Actors\u2019 Benevolent Fund (ABF) takes place on Tuesday after at least three years of turmoil with little prospect that it will pass off uneventfully. The ABF is a charity that dates back to 1892, created to help actors and stage managers experiencing hardship because of injury, illness or old age. Its patron is King Charles and its membership is a roll call of the some of the most famous names in British stage and screen. The fund has been riven by an acrimonious public row between long-serving trustees ousted in 2022 and \u201cmodernising\u201d trustees who replaced them. The ousted trustees were headed by Dame Penelope Keith, best known as Margot from The Good Life, who was president for more than 30 years, taking the position after the death of Laurence Olivier. At the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that Keith and other former trustees, including the actors Si\u00e2n Phillips and Robert Bathurst, had received a nasty poison pen letter before Tuesday\u2019s meeting. It warned them: \u201cYou think police make me afraid. I\u2019m not afraid. It\u2019s you who should be afraid.\u201d It continued: \u201cIf you go to the AGM you\u2019re done.\u201d A source at the ABF said its chief executive, Alison Wyman, who took over in July 2023, had also received a particularly unpleasant letter. It is understood all the poison pen letters have been passed on to the police. The letters are the latest twist in a saga that, if it were a television script, a producer would probably say: \u201cIt\u2019s too complicated.\u201d The civil war at the ABF, which has assets of \u00a340m, began in 2021. It was first reported by Private Eye which has continued to chart its convoluted twists and turns. The saga has featured allegations of there being a \u201ccoup\u201d with the actor James Bolam, an ousted trustee, once arguing that the ABF\u2019s West End headquarters had gone from \u201ca place of creativity and goodwill\u201d to being \u201cmore like Bleak House\u201d. Keith and her supporters argued that their removal in February 2022 breached company law and that the board that replaced them was therefore illegitimate. Legal skirmishes and public wars of words followed while mediation failed; the ousted trustees claimed they were open to talks, but were ignored. One trustee told the Guardian privately that reform had been necessary to inject fresh energy into the charity, make it more democratic, and refocus its resources more tightly on new services for struggling actors, such as talking therapy and cost of living grants. The ousted trustees \u2013 several of whom are in their 80s \u2013 are angry at claims they were out of touch, saying they had developed their own modernising strategy for the ABF. They have in turn suggested that their critics have been guilty of age discrimination and accused them of acting dishonourably. The charities regulator, the Charity Commission, intervened in what it said was a \u201cdamaging and costly dispute\u201d. The commission admitted in a review of its handling of the case that it had made a series of errors but it offered no apology or remedy to the ousted trustees. In a statement, the ABF said: \u201cThe Charity Commission, in 2022, identified many governance issues within the charity dating back years, which the current trustees and ABF team have subsequently worked hard to address. \u201cThese include trustees not having had terms of office, leading to some being in post for many years, and no policies in place for important areas of work, which is not in line with good charity governance. \u201cThe Charity Commission closed its regulatory compliance case into the ABF in May 2024 after the work by the new board and team. The charity is now in a positive place, focused on its beneficiaries, and by the end of 2024 we project we will have directly helped over 40% more people than in 2023.\u201d A spokesperson for Penelope Keith said the actor did not wish to comment.",

Jane Dodds, who was briefly the MP for Brecon and Radnorshire and is now the only Lib Dem member of the Senedd, was criticised in a C of E report about abuse carried out by the late bishop of Chester Hubert Victor Whitsey. While the report, A Betrayal of Trust, was published in early 2021, the criticism of Dodds has received fresh prominence since the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, announced last week he would step down over his handling of another abuse scandal, connected to the church\u2019s cover-up of abuse by John Smyth. The report into Whitsey\u2019s abuse details that Dodds committed a \u201cgrave error of judgment\u201d in failing to arrange a meeting about allegations about abuse by the bishop when she worked as a senior casework manager for the church in 2016, with matters progressing only after she left the job. Asked about the case, Davey told BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuennsberg show: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Jane about this. She has apologised, and she has had a incredible career looking after children, but I\u2019ve made it clear I think she needs to think about her responsibility on this.\u201d Asked if that meant she should consider resigning, Davey said: \u201cI think she does need to reflect on this very carefully.

I have spoken to her. I\u2019ve made my feelings really clear to her about what I think she should do, and I think she\u2019s reflecting. I hope she does.\u201d The Church of England review, led by a senior judge, David Pearl, said an unnamed complainant who said they had been abused by Whitsey was \u201csadly let down\u201d by Dodds\u2019s safeguarding team. Dodds told the inquiry she could not initially remember the case, but that after reading the report she acknowledged \u201cthat there were clear shortcomings in her practice in responding\u201d to the church\u2019s safeguarding adviser over the case. Welby resigned amid intense pressure after the independent report by the safeguarding expert Keith Makin detailed failings in stopping Smyth, a powerful barrister who died in 2018. He is believed to have abused about 130 boys in the UK in the late 1970s and early 80s, and later in Zimbabwe and, it is suspected, South Africa.

There has been no enforcement action from HSE regarding Thames Water since the incident on 29 August 2017. There is no ongoing investigation.\u201d</p> <p>An Ofwat spokesperson said: \u201cThe Guardian has raised a number of serious allegations about Thames Water. We will take action if there is evidence of breach of the company\u2019s obligations.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been pushing Thames Water to make significant improvements in its operational performance and financial resilience for some time. It is of course essential that all water companies provide a safe and reliable water supply. The company has made a request for a substantial increase in expenditure, including to address issues of asset health, as part of the current price review process. We are reviewing that request and the supporting information provided, and will announce our final decisions in December.</p> <p>\u201cIn assessing the business case put forward by companies and in our enforcement work, we work closely with other regulators where needed and seek their views. This includes the Drinking Water Inspectorate in regard to security and cyber measures related to water services, and the Health and Safety Executive and National Cyber Security Centre on matters relating to safety and cybersecurity.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Drinking Water Inspectorate said it considered supply of clean drinking water to be \u201cthe highest priority\u201d of a water company, which was a duty under the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/614/contents\">regulations</a>. </p> <p>It added: \u201cWhere there are any circumstances which give rise to a concern to drinking water, the company are required to notify the inspectorate. Similarly, water company staff are able report matters directly to the inspectorate. In both cases the inspectorate will carry out an investigation and will take action as necessary to maintain the high standard of drinking water in England. The inspectorate carry out a programme of risk-based audits to identify, monitor and verify areas of concern, and take enforcement action based on our <a href=\"https://dwi.gov.uk/what-we-do/enforcement-policy/\">enforcement policies</a>.\u201d</p>",

Sarah [Albon] undertakes many similar visits in her role as chief executive. \u201cWhether HSE would be involved as a regulator would depend on the type of incident \u2013 namely one that would fall under remit. There has been no enforcement action from HSE regarding Thames Water since the incident on 29 August 2017. There is no ongoing investigation.\u201d An Ofwat spokesperson said: \u201cThe Guardian has raised a number of serious allegations about Thames Water. We will take action if there is evidence of breach of the company\u2019s obligations. \u201cWe have been pushing Thames Water to make significant improvements in its operational performance and financial resilience for some time. It is of course essential that all water companies provide a safe and reliable water supply. The company has made a request for a substantial increase in expenditure, including to address issues of asset health, as part of the current price review process. We are reviewing that request and the supporting information provided, and will announce our final decisions in December. \u201cIn assessing the business case put forward by companies and in our enforcement work, we work closely with other regulators where needed and seek their views. This includes the Drinking Water Inspectorate in regard to security and cyber measures related to water services, and the Health and Safety Executive and National Cyber Security Centre on matters relating to safety and cybersecurity.\u201d A spokesperson for the Drinking Water Inspectorate said it considered supply of clean drinking water to be \u201cthe highest priority\u201d of a water company, which was a duty under the regulations. It added: \u201cWhere there are any circumstances which give rise to a concern to drinking water, the company are required to notify the inspectorate. Similarly, water company staff are able report matters directly to the inspectorate. In both cases the inspectorate will carry out an investigation and will take action as necessary to maintain the high standard of drinking water in England. The inspectorate carry out a programme of risk-based audits to identify, monitor and verify areas of concern, and take enforcement action based on our enforcement policies.\u201d",

That [the riots] was the ugliest representation of the years of racism that have been manufactured through the political media conversation. And if we don\u2019t do something differently, that won\u2019t be a one-off, and that ugliness will become just a regular feature of our politics.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking exclusively to the Guardian amid the launch of the Runnymede Trust\u2019s report on Islamophobia, Begum said the devastating war in Gaza and the response to the ceasefire protests in the UK meant the issue had become \u201cinescapable\u201d and had to be confronted.</p> <p>While she did not name specific MPs, Begum said Labour and the Conservatives had both been guilty of feeding a hostile climate for British Muslims that is \u201cbleak and dystopian\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/27/victims-far-right-riots-lingering-fear-uncertain-future\">\u2018We wake up with anxiety\u2019: victims of far-right riots on lingering fear and an uncertain future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She pointed to the reaction to the summer\u2019s racist riots as particularly worrying, saying there was \u201ca real reluctance to use the term Islamophobia during that period because no one wants to be seen to defend Muslims\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cPoliticians are engaging in a popularity contest and that popularity contest is measured by how far they are willing to bully and demonise Muslims. And that has become not just an acceptable kind of currency, but a way in which to earn your political stripes.\u201d</p> <p>The report, backed by Lady Warsi, Amnesty International UK and the Muslim Council for Britain, explores the way Islamophobia is \u201cintensifying\u201d in different areas.</p>    <p>It notes in the four months to February 2024, the national project Tell Mama, which measures anti-Muslim attacks, recorded a 335% increase in hate incidents against Muslims compared with the previous year, most of them against women.</p> <p>In the past year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/10/religious-hate-crimes-at-record-levels-in-england-and-wales-official-figures-show\">38% of all religious hate crimes recorded by the police</a> were against Muslim people. There was a 13% increase in hate crimes against Muslims.</p> <p>Almost two in five religious hate crimes are targeted against Muslims \u2013 the largest of any other religious community. Muslim people are disproportionately victims of assault (without injury), and of stalking or harassment.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-year-ending-march-2024\">statistical bulletin</a>, last year there were the highest recorded number of anti-religious hate crimes since records began. The police note this increase coincided with the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p> <p>Much of this increase was driven by antisemitic incidents, which accounted for a third (33%) of all religious hate crimes. British Jews were more likely to be victims of criminal damage and arson, and malicious communication.</p> <p>Begum said the issue went much further than violent, racist attacks. \u201cWe often focus on those more spectacular incidents of violence, which are real and inflict a deep and long-lasting harm on individuals and communities, but that can ignore the state-sponsored Islamophobia that rests within our legislation, our policies, and within our narratives,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Begum criticised what she described as a double standard for Muslims, who she said were criticised as failing to integrate if they did not participate in public life, but also criticised when they did. \u201cWhether it\u2019s through being governors at schools, as we see through the Trojan horse affair \u2026 we are seen trying to take over and hijack local schools. Or when we go on protest marches, along with many other people, we are described as hate marchers and Islamist extremists. And when we use our vote to express our political preferences, we\u2019re described as sectarian and divisive.\u201d</p> <p>For Begum, politics has always felt deeply personal. Born in the 1970s to parents who migrated from Bangladesh, she spent her early years in Tower Hamlets in London as part of the large, vibrant Bangladeshi community there. \u201cMy parents ended up as accidental squatters because of the housing crisis and racism that was there at the time,\u201d she said. She became a teacher in east London, where she thought intensively about what an anti-racist education looked like.</p> <p>She changed careers after more than 20 years to do a PhD in the sociopolitical history of squatting. That put her in the orbit of Runnymede, where a six-month research contract led to her working her way to becoming chief executive.</p> <p>While she welcomed the government announcement of a \u00a315m community recovery fund to address the deeper roots of the riots, she called for substantial funding to tackle the deprivations caused by austerity and structural racism.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone wants communities to be cohesive and we\u2019re not objecting to that. What we\u2019re objecting to is a dispersal of insecure funds to community groups and not accepting that mainstream state infrastructures need to be provided, and challenging the broader story of who we are. There\u2019s no point saying all Muslims are all bad, but go and have a cup of tea with them in your local community.\u201d</p>",

Shabna Begum, who became the chief executive of the Runnymede Trust earlier this year, said the country was entering a new phase in how it talks about Muslims. \u201cSayeeda Warsi coined the term \u2018the dinner table test\u2019, but I think we\u2019ve got even beyond that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way politicians talk about Muslims now is so derogatory, it\u2019s in the most brutally divisive terms.\u201d She said that unless something changed in political rhetoric and policy, last summer\u2019s riots would not be a one-off. \u201cI think they will come back. That [the riots] was the ugliest representation of the years of racism that have been manufactured through the political media conversation. And if we don\u2019t do something differently, that won\u2019t be a one-off, and that ugliness will become just a regular feature of our politics.\u201d Speaking exclusively to the Guardian amid the launch of the Runnymede Trust\u2019s report on Islamophobia, Begum said the devastating war in Gaza and the response to the ceasefire protests in the UK meant the issue had become \u201cinescapable\u201d and had to be confronted. While she did not name specific MPs, Begum said Labour and the Conservatives had both been guilty of feeding a hostile climate for British Muslims that is \u201cbleak and dystopian\u201d. She pointed to the reaction to the summer\u2019s racist riots as particularly worrying, saying there was \u201ca real reluctance to use the term Islamophobia during that period because no one wants to be seen to defend Muslims\u201d. She added: \u201cPoliticians are engaging in a popularity contest and that popularity contest is measured by how far they are willing to bully and demonise Muslims. And that has become not just an acceptable kind of currency, but a way in which to earn your political stripes.\u201d The report, backed by Lady Warsi, Amnesty International UK and the Muslim Council for Britain, explores the way Islamophobia is \u201cintensifying\u201d in different areas. It notes in the four months to February 2024, the national project Tell Mama, which measures anti-Muslim attacks, recorded a 335% increase in hate incidents against Muslims compared with the previous year, most of them against women. In the past year, 38% of all religious hate crimes recorded by the police were against Muslim people. There was a 13% increase in hate crimes against Muslims. Almost two in five religious hate crimes are targeted against Muslims \u2013 the largest of any other religious community. Muslim people are disproportionately victims of assault (without injury), and of stalking or harassment. According to the statistical bulletin, last year there were the highest recorded number of anti-religious hate crimes since records began. The police note this increase coincided with the Israel-Gaza conflict. Much of this increase was driven by antisemitic incidents, which accounted for a third (33%) of all religious hate crimes. British Jews were more likely to be victims of criminal damage and arson, and malicious communication. Begum said the issue went much further than violent, racist attacks. \u201cWe often focus on those more spectacular incidents of violence, which are real and inflict a deep and long-lasting harm on individuals and communities, but that can ignore the state-sponsored Islamophobia that rests within our legislation, our policies, and within our narratives,\u201d she said. Begum criticised what she described as a double standard for Muslims, who she said were criticised as failing to integrate if they did not participate in public life, but also criticised when they did. \u201cWhether it\u2019s through being governors at schools, as we see through the Trojan horse affair \u2026 we are seen trying to take over and hijack local schools. Or when we go on protest marches, along with many other people, we are described as hate marchers and Islamist extremists. And when we use our vote to express our political preferences, we\u2019re described as sectarian and divisive.\u201d For Begum, politics has always felt deeply personal. Born in the 1970s to parents who migrated from Bangladesh, she spent her early years in Tower Hamlets in London as part of the large, vibrant Bangladeshi community there. \u201cMy parents ended up as accidental squatters because of the housing crisis and racism that was there at the time,\u201d she said. She became a teacher in east London, where she thought intensively about what an anti-racist education looked like. She changed careers after more than 20 years to do a PhD in the sociopolitical history of squatting. That put her in the orbit of Runnymede, where a six-month research contract led to her working her way to becoming chief executive. While she welcomed the government announcement of a \u00a315m community recovery fund to address the deeper roots of the riots, she called for substantial funding to tackle the deprivations caused by austerity and structural racism. \u201cEveryone wants communities to be cohesive and we\u2019re not objecting to that. What we\u2019re objecting to is a dispersal of insecure funds to community groups and not accepting that mainstream state infrastructures need to be provided, and challenging the broader story of who we are. There\u2019s no point saying all Muslims are all bad, but go and have a cup of tea with them in your local community.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>More than 5,000 people who invested in Neil Woodford\u2019s collapsed equity fund are suing Hargreaves Lansdown, claiming that the investment platform was still promoting the fund even when it was aware of its problems.</p> <p>The number of people suing Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK\u2019s largest investment site, has almost doubled in the past two years, according to the claims management firm RGL Management. Two years ago the number of people taking part stood at 2,750.</p> <p>RGL said it expected the claims to total more than \u00a3200m, with the average individual claim, including interest, about \u00a320,000.</p> <p>The Woodford equity income fund (WEIF), run by the former star stock picker Woodford, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/19/neil-woodford-demise-puts-fund-management-industry-under-scrutiny\">failed in October 2019</a> after investors rushed to withdraw money in response to a raft of poorly performing company investments, including some hard-to-sell, illiquid assets. The fund was frozen and later closed and wound up.</p> <p>About 300,000 people had invested in the fund, including 130,000 through Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> <p>RGL <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/16/hargreaves-lansdown-hit-by-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-woodford-fund-investors\">filed an initial claim in the high court</a> against Hargreaves Lansdown in London in October 2022. The firm said it was processing further claims and would file another tranche, with thousands more claims, by March. The number of claimants could reach 10,000. </p> <p>RGL argues on behalf of investors who lost their savings that Hargreaves Lansdown continued to recommend the Woodford fund right up to the day of its collapse, even though the investment platform was \u201caware of the fund\u2019s longstanding portfolio diversification and liquidity issues\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Green, director of RGL, said: \u201cAdding thousands more claimants today to the RGL Group action represents another step closer to holding Hargreaves Lansdown to account for its conduct in relation to the WEIF.\u201d</p> <p>Investors are seeking to recoup their capital losses, but are also claiming damages for the lost opportunity of investing in alternative investments that would have generated positive returns.</p> <p>Last year, the administrator of the failed Woodford fund, Link Fund Solutions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/20/woodford-fund-compensation-for-investors-likely-to-total-77p-in-the-pound\">agreed to pay \u00a3230m</a> to help regulators to compensate more than 300,000 customers.

      "bodyText": "More than 5,000 people who invested in Neil Woodford\u2019s collapsed equity fund are suing Hargreaves Lansdown, claiming that the investment platform was still promoting the fund even when it was aware of its problems. The number of people suing Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK\u2019s largest investment site, has almost doubled in the past two years, according to the claims management firm RGL Management. Two years ago the number of people taking part stood at 2,750. RGL said it expected the claims to total more than \u00a3200m, with the average individual claim, including interest, about \u00a320,000. The Woodford equity income fund (WEIF), run by the former star stock picker Woodford, failed in October 2019 after investors rushed to withdraw money in response to a raft of poorly performing company investments, including some hard-to-sell, illiquid assets. The fund was frozen and later closed and wound up. About 300,000 people had invested in the fund, including 130,000 through Hargreaves Lansdown. RGL filed an initial claim in the high court against Hargreaves Lansdown in London in October 2022. The firm said it was processing further claims and would file another tranche, with thousands more claims, by March. The number of claimants could reach 10,000. RGL argues on behalf of investors who lost their savings that Hargreaves Lansdown continued to recommend the Woodford fund right up to the day of its collapse, even though the investment platform was \u201caware of the fund\u2019s longstanding portfolio diversification and liquidity issues\u201d. Michael Green, director of RGL, said: \u201cAdding thousands more claimants today to the RGL Group action represents another step closer to holding Hargreaves Lansdown to account for its conduct in relation to the WEIF.\u201d Investors are seeking to recoup their capital losses, but are also claiming damages for the lost opportunity of investing in alternative investments that would have generated positive returns. Last year, the administrator of the failed Woodford fund, Link Fund Solutions, agreed to pay \u00a3230m to help regulators to compensate more than 300,000 customers. That redress scheme was approved by a high court judge in February, and the first payments, totalling \u00a3185.7m, were made to customers in March. Investors have already had capital representing 67p in the pound returned to them via distributions since the fund\u2019s collapse in June 2019, and the redress scheme is offering a further 10p in the pound. Link was responsible for monitoring and supervising the investments executed by Woodford before the fund failed. It was found to have made \u201ccritical mistakes and errors\u201d after an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority, particularly in ensuring it was able to easily repay customers who might want to withdraw their investments. Woodford\u2019s equity fund was worth more than \u00a310bn at its peak but suffered from several poorly performing investments in companies including the estate agent Purplebricks, the finance firm Burford Capital and the doorstep lender Provident Financial. Hargreaves Lansdown declined to comment. It previously rejected all the claims made by RGL when it filed for the first set of claimants in 2022 \u201cfor lack of a substantive basis of claim\u201d.",

Charli xcx walking out of the theater with a bunch of green paint around her mouth is one of the show\u2019s better sight gags of late.</p> <p>This was a mostly middle of the road episode, which still made for a huge improvement on last week. Charli xcx was a game host, although the biggest highlights came from returning stars Baldwin, Mooney, Samberg, and Carvey (who might as well be a full time cast member at this point). It\u2019s starting to feel a little more like a proper 50th season. Now that the election is over and done with, perhaps SNL will dedicate more time to recognizing and celebrating that milestone.</p>",

He proclaims his innocence (\u201cAll I did was take care of my cats, make love to my two straight husbands, and try to kill Carole Baskin multiple times\u201d), and appeals to Trump for a pardon and position as director of Fish and Wildlife, all while getting mauled by one of his tigers. Yang\u2019s impression is solid, although the regrettable Tiger King phenomenon deserves to be memory-holed. Later, Jost brings on Sherman as Hazel, the widow of social media squirrel star Peanut, recently euthanized after biting a police officer. Dressed in a giant squirrel costume, Sherman is a ball of manic energy. The squirrel puns (\u201c[Peanut] stuffed his cheeks on OnlyFans \u2013 both sets\u201d) are funny, but the best bits are when she goes after Jost: \u201cCan you imagine if they chopped off your penis every time you tested positive for chlamydia, Colin?\u201d Their chemistry remains the best of any cast members on the show. Charli xcx performs her second set. Then it\u2019s time for the It Girl Thanksgiving special, hosted by Marc Jacobs (Yang) and Julia Fox (Fineman). Their dinner table is filled by the glamorous likes of Naomi Campbell (Ego Nwodim), Victoria Beckham (Charli xcx), Rachel Sennott (Sherman), the Olsen twins (Ashley Padilla, Jane Wickline), Cher (Heidi Gardner), and Law Roach (Kenan Thompson). There are a few okay bits throughout \u2013 Campbell bringing The Substance to dinner, the Olsen\u2019s getting lost in their \u201cbig ass coat\u201d, but for the most part this is sloppy and annoying. The final sketch of the night sees a group of friends hooking up with Shrek prior to and following a performance of Shrek the Musical. Charli xcx walking out of the theater with a bunch of green paint around her mouth is one of the show\u2019s better sight gags of late. This was a mostly middle of the road episode, which still made for a huge improvement on last week. Charli xcx was a game host, although the biggest highlights came from returning stars Baldwin, Mooney, Samberg, and Carvey (who might as well be a full time cast member at this point). It\u2019s starting to feel a little more like a proper 50th season. Now that the election is over and done with, perhaps SNL will dedicate more time to recognizing and celebrating that milestone.",

In that time, the sunny comedy about local government has become a modern classic. It\u2019s also become a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Capsule_(Parks_and_Recreation)\">time capsule</a> for a certain Obama-era mindset: its relentlessly upbeat protagonist, Amy Poehler\u2019s Leslie Knope, wholeheartedly believes in government\u2019s power to make people\u2019s lives better.

In its time, Parks felt like a small-town sitcom; in 2024 it can feel like a fantasy.</p> <p>That\u2019s not lost on Jim O\u2019Heir, AKA Jerry Gergich, the show\u2019s hapless target of office mockery.

The show\u2019s premier was supposed to come after a post-Super Bowl episode of The Office, but Poehler was due to give birth when shooting would have started. \u201cThere is no one else who could do this,\u201d Schur remembers saying. \u201cThis is just Amy Poehler; it just has to be.\u201d They told NBC they\u2019d let the slot go, and three months after Poeher gave birth, they began shooting. It was, Schur says, sacrificing the short-term gain for the long-term one.</p> <p>And it paid off. The show was never secure in terms of ratings: \u201cWhen I say we worried, I mean, we were sure we were being canceled,\u201d O\u2019Heir says. (In fact, as he relates in the book, he has heard the show <em>was</em><strong> </strong>canceled by executives during a flight \u2013 by the time they landed, they had changed their minds.) But once the show hit its stride, its cultural impact was never in doubt. Barack Obama was a fan; Michelle Obama, Joe Biden and John McCain made cameos. Ansari and Retta (AKA Donna, known for brutal honesty and a love of the finer things in life) brought the world <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSjM5B3QNlw\">\u201ctreat yo self\u201d</a>, a license for self-indulge. Ron Swanson has become a moustachioed icon.</p> <p>As for O\u2019Heir, as a longtime character actor, he\u2019s been on every show from ER to Better Call Saul. But he knows he\u2019ll always be seen as Jerry, and he\u2019s fine with that. \u201cI will be Jerry for ever,\u201d he says. En route from Austin last weekend, O\u2019Heir got randomly selected for a search at airport security. \u201cClassic Jerry,\u201d said a nearby stranger.</p>    <p>But while the characters poked ruthless fun at Jerry, that behavior was the exception rather than the rule.

      "body": "<p>The prosaic anti-escapism of this sprawling American indie thoroughly subverts the expectations of the festive family movie. <em>Christmas Eve </em><em>in Miller\u2019s Point</em> is a mosaic portrait of an extended Italian American family gathered for their traditional seasonal celebration in Long Island. This may be the last year they do so: the suburban home of the ailing family matriarch is to be sold.

      "bodyText": "Melania Trump will probably not be returning to the White House for the next four years with her husband, multiple sources told CNN this week, but rather will be splitting her time between Palm Beach, Florida, and New York City, where Barron is going to college. For many observers it is unclear who might be more relieved by that decision: Melania, who famously did not love her life in DC the first time around, or the White House itself, where Trump\u2019s wife once expressed her discontent by filling the halls with blood-red Christmas trees and destroying the historically beloved Rose Garden. Melania\u2019s apparent refusal to return to the White House for her second run as Flotus is a stunning break from American tradition. No other first lady in American history has simply opted to live alone in a Manhattan apartment instead of moving back into the East Wing, where she would have a full staff doting on her and the best possible security apparatus. But the decision came as no surprise after her absence from the campaign trail this year, which was so glaring that when she did show up on election day in oversized sunglasses, Melania body double conspiracy theories quickly ran rampant. She seemingly relished her freedom from the White House the first time around, as evidenced by her beaming smile upon landing in Palm Beach after Trump lost in 2020. And her apparent personal disdain for her husband, whose sexual misconduct allegations reportedly inspired her to renegotiate the conditions of her prenup before agreeing to move into the East Wing the first time around, has been likewise obvious for some time. (She reportedly quietly renegotiated the prenup again ahead of Trump\u2019s second term, but this time without even agreeing to live in the same city as him.) The latest news of Melania keeping her distance from the Beltway follows her rejection earlier this week of Jill Biden\u2019s invitation to have tea at the White House. The invitation is part of a symbolic \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d tradition that sitting and incoming first ladies do every four years to project a peaceful transition. Melania did have a \u201ctea and tour\u201d with Michelle Obama in 2016, where they discussed raising children in the White House. But this time around, the incoming Flotus is reportedly angry with the Bidens over the federal investigation into Trump holding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cShe ain\u2019t going,\u201d a source familiar with Melania\u2019s decision told the New York Post. \u201cJill Biden\u2019s husband authorized the FBI snooping through her underwear drawer. The Bidens are disgusting.\u201d Melania\u2019s team was less forthcoming about her motivations behind the snub. \u201cHer husband\u2019s return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success,\u201d her office said in a statement.

A source told People magazine in 2021 that Trump winning a second term would be \u201cthe worst-case scenario\u201d for Melania, and her clear distance from her husband\u2019s political career has only grown since the violent end to his first term in office. Melania was even paid six figures to make a rare appearance at one of Trump\u2019s fundraisers in September. She also passionately defended abortion rights in her new memoir, just a month before the election, which could be interpreted either as an attempt to distance herself from her husband\u2019s legacy or to help him revamp his image with women ahead of election day. It also could just be a ploy to sell books. Regardless of Melania\u2019s motivations, it\u2019s clear that the US will witness a new era of a first lady unconcerned with traditional optics and unconstrained by expectations of what an American president\u2019s wife is supposed to be and do. Contrarians might even be inclined to celebrate it as a feminist achievement, if Melania hadn\u2019t served as an accomplice all these years \u2013 reluctantly or not \u2013 to a president whose appointments to the US supreme court saw a huge loss in women\u2019s reproductive rights.",

      "body": "<p>It was news to her 44-year-old son. Geraldine Finucane recalled that John had struggled as an eight-year-old with her decision for them to stay put in the family home after the murder of his father in the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYou did at the start,\u201d she said to him. \u201cI changed everything in the kitchen so it made it easier to go into that particular room.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a haze around that,\u201d said John quietly from a comfy chair on the other side of his mother\u2019s lounge overlooking the back garden.</p> <p>Pat Finucane, 39, was killed at 7.25pm on 12 February 1989, when the front door of the family\u2019s double-fronted redbrick home in north Belfast, in which Geraldine, 74, remains today, was kicked down by two men as the couple and their three children were eating a Sunday roast in the kitchen.</p>    <p>As Pat, still gripping his fork, rose from the table, a total of 14 shots were fired. Six bullets struck his head, one or more of which had been fired at a range of 15ins or less. One ricocheted, hitting Geraldine in the ankle, as the couple\u2019s children, John, eight, Katherine, 12, and Michael, 17, cowered under the table.</p> <p>The loyalist Ulster Defence Association (UDA) claimed it killed the 39-year-old lawyer because he was an IRA officer, a claim for which no evidence has materialised.</p> <p>Scant effort was put into the police investigation.</p> <p>John recalls finding a spent bullet cartridge from the attack in one of his socks a few days after the murder. He said: \u201cI remember showing up in the morning and saying, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019\u201d A hard question for a grieving widow to answer. \u201cI must have ironed [in the kitchen] on the Sunday,\u201d Geraldine said. Further spent cartridges were found under the kitchen cupboards when Geraldine did a spring clean.</p> <p>Over the past three and a half decades, as a result of campaigning by the Finucane family and others, an extraordinary story has emerged of the British state\u2019s complicity in the murder of a lawyer who had simply proven to be a thorn in the side of the state.</p> <p>What is already known from government-commissioned reviews is damning enough: Royal Ulster Constabulary officers \u201clikely\u201d encouraged the UDA to target Finucane, whose clients had included Bobby Sands, the IRA man who died on hunger strike. A British government minister as good as named him in the House of Commons four weeks before the murder as being \u201cunduly sympathetic\u201d to the IRA. The UDA intelligence chief who had provided the gunmen with information on Finucane was a British agent \u2013 and had informed his handlers of the intended hit.</p> <p>The UDA quartermaster who had provided the weapon was a British agent. One of the murder weapons was a 9mm Browning pistol that had been stolen from a British army barracks. On three occasions, the British security services knew of plans to kill Finucane, including six weeks before the murder, and did nothing.</p> <p>When one of the murder weapons was discovered, it ended up being returned to the army for reuse rather than kept as evidence. And when the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, had been personally asked to give legislative cover for British agents in the ranks of terrorist organisations breaking the law, the senior RUC officer asking the question was left to understand that they should simply <em>\u201c</em>carry on with what you\u2019re doing but don\u2019t tell us the details\u201d.</p> <p>In September, the Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, finally announced that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/11/public-inquiry-announced-into-1989-of-belfast-solicitor-pat-finucane\">British government would hold a public inquiry</a> into a case that could expose collusion in the worst crimes by those at the highest levels of the state.</p>    <p>It was extremely welcome news, coming after decades of foot-dragging and worse. Geraldine had to move out of her house for two months in 2000 after a threat was made to her own life but returned to the family home. \u201cWhy would I give it up?\u201d she said. She admits to some nervousness still today when out and about, but puts that down to old habits. It is evidently with some trepidation that the Finucanes have put their hopes in Keir Starmer.</p> <p>Tony Blair\u2019s administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/23/georgewright\">promised a public inquiry in 2004</a> only for the government to be unable to provide the Finucanes with assurances over full access to papers and witnesses. Then in 2012, the then prime minister, David Cameron, invited Geraldine and the family into Downing Street to tell them that he was going to backtrack and order a barrister-led review of the evidence.</p> <p>\u201cI was holding the side of the chair, and my knuckles had actually gone white,\u201d Geraldine recalled of her meeting with Cameron. \u201cI mean, I can get annoyed or upset after various meetings, but I\u2019m never angry. I was furious, like absolutely furious. I just intervened, and I said, \u2018Excuse me. I said I can\u2019t take any more of this. I\u2019m calling this meeting to an end\u2019. It\u2019s the only time that I have never got up after a meeting and said, \u2018Thank you very much for your time\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>As a result of the review, Cameron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/12/david-cameron-pat-finucane-murder\">apologised for the \u201cshocking levels of collusion\u201d</a> in Finucane\u2019s murder. Still, the family do not believe it was at all clear for what the then prime minister was apologising. Boris Johnson\u2019s government then tried to kill any hope of that question being answered with an announcement in 2020 that an inquiry would not go ahead until separate reviews by the police and the police ombudsman in Northern Ireland were completed.</p> <p>That decision was quashed by the Northern Ireland high court in December 2022, but Geraldine was not confident of a good outcome when asked to meet the new Northern Ireland secretary following Labour\u2019s election win. </p> <p>She said: \u201cI had [prepared] all these diplomatic ways to say, \u2018I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re giving us\u2019, and he gives you an inquiry. We were all a bit shell-shocked.\u201d</p> <p>The concern now is that the terms of the inquiry and the selection of the chair are right. The government has yet to provide further details about these crucial elements despite Finucane\u2019s former business partner Peter Madden recently seeking clarity.</p>    <p>Geraldine said: \u201cI want it to be wide-ranging enough. I don\u2019t want it to be curtailed, because the whole case around my husband, as we have discovered over 35 years, wasn\u2019t about one man. It was a strategy that was applied in the whole of the country \u2026 I feel more angry today than I did when it happened because we know so much more.\u201d</p> <p>They are hopeful that the Irish government will keep the pressure on for the terms to be right. On 19 November, Geraldine and her children will address a congressional hearing in the US. There has been cross-party support in the US for the Finucane campaign and Washington is expected to play its role in keeping Westminster honest.</p> <p>Geraldine had once worried that an inquiry would only be granted when the key figures were dead and paperwork shredded. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t all dead,\u201d said Geraldine.</p> <p>She is looking forward to seeing the retired brigadier Gordon Kerr giving evidence. Kerr was head of the army\u2019s Force Research Unit, the secretive outfit that ran agents in the UDA. He was later promoted to be a senior British military attach\u00e9 in Beijing. But Geraldine has little doubt that the inquiry will discover a dirty trail all the way to the door of No 10.</p> <p>\u201cI think Margaret Thatcher was very hands on, and would have known about all the things that were happening,\u201d she said. \u201cI was never particularly interested in the gunman, per se. It was all the people behind the gunman. Gunmen at that time in Belfast were ten a penny. It was who briefed them, who sent them, why they did it, and where it all came from. That\u2019s what I was always interested in. Still am.\u201d</p>",

Geraldine had to move out of her house for two months in 2000 after a threat was made to her own life but returned to the family home. \u201cWhy would I give it up?\u201d she said. She admits to some nervousness still today when out and about, but puts that down to old habits. It is evidently with some trepidation that the Finucanes have put their hopes in Keir Starmer. Tony Blair\u2019s administration promised a public inquiry in 2004 only for the government to be unable to provide the Finucanes with assurances over full access to papers and witnesses. Then in 2012, the then prime minister, David Cameron, invited Geraldine and the family into Downing Street to tell them that he was going to backtrack and order a barrister-led review of the evidence. \u201cI was holding the side of the chair, and my knuckles had actually gone white,\u201d Geraldine recalled of her meeting with Cameron. \u201cI mean, I can get annoyed or upset after various meetings, but I\u2019m never angry. I was furious, like absolutely furious. I just intervened, and I said, \u2018Excuse me. I said I can\u2019t take any more of this. I\u2019m calling this meeting to an end\u2019. It\u2019s the only time that I have never got up after a meeting and said, \u2018Thank you very much for your time\u2019.\u201d As a result of the review, Cameron apologised for the \u201cshocking levels of collusion\u201d in Finucane\u2019s murder. Still, the family do not believe it was at all clear for what the then prime minister was apologising. Boris Johnson\u2019s government then tried to kill any hope of that question being answered with an announcement in 2020 that an inquiry would not go ahead until separate reviews by the police and the police ombudsman in Northern Ireland were completed. That decision was quashed by the Northern Ireland high court in December 2022, but Geraldine was not confident of a good outcome when asked to meet the new Northern Ireland secretary following Labour\u2019s election win. She said: \u201cI had [prepared] all these diplomatic ways to say, \u2018I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re giving us\u2019, and he gives you an inquiry. We were all a bit shell-shocked.\u201d The concern now is that the terms of the inquiry and the selection of the chair are right. The government has yet to provide further details about these crucial elements despite Finucane\u2019s former business partner Peter Madden recently seeking clarity. Geraldine said: \u201cI want it to be wide-ranging enough. I don\u2019t want it to be curtailed, because the whole case around my husband, as we have discovered over 35 years, wasn\u2019t about one man. It was a strategy that was applied in the whole of the country \u2026 I feel more angry today than I did when it happened because we know so much more.\u201d They are hopeful that the Irish government will keep the pressure on for the terms to be right. On 19 November, Geraldine and her children will address a congressional hearing in the US. There has been cross-party support in the US for the Finucane campaign and Washington is expected to play its role in keeping Westminster honest. Geraldine had once worried that an inquiry would only be granted when the key figures were dead and paperwork shredded. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t all dead,\u201d said Geraldine. She is looking forward to seeing the retired brigadier Gordon Kerr giving evidence. Kerr was head of the army\u2019s Force Research Unit, the secretive outfit that ran agents in the UDA. He was later promoted to be a senior British military attach\u00e9 in Beijing. But Geraldine has little doubt that the inquiry will discover a dirty trail all the way to the door of No 10. \u201cI think Margaret Thatcher was very hands on, and would have known about all the things that were happening,\u201d she said. \u201cI was never particularly interested in the gunman, per se. It was all the people behind the gunman. Gunmen at that time in Belfast were ten a penny. It was who briefed them, who sent them, why they did it, and where it all came from. That\u2019s what I was always interested in. Still am.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s pro-business Free Democratic party, which collapsed Olaf Scholz\u2019s governing coalition this month in a dispute over the budget, reportedly plotted its exit weeks before the final split, referring to the plans internally as \u201cD-day\u201d. Newspapers Die Zeit and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reported that the FDP had intended from at least September to force a situation that would provoke the German chancellor into pulling the plug on his tripartite coalition. The timing of the collapse, on the same day Donald Trump was declared as the victor of the US presidential elections, sent shock waves across Europe, especially when Germany was being looked to for stability, leadership and continuity. It came earlier this month when Scholz sacked his finance minister Christian Lindner, the FDP leader, following his presentation of an 18-page ultimatum that would have upended many of the three-year-old administration\u2019s policies. All but one of the other FDP ministers in the government resigned subsequently, leading to the governmental collapse. According to the newspapers\u2019 research, the FDP first hatched the \u201cD-day\u201d plans at a meeting in a prominent Potsdam villa at the end of September, honing them at several subsequent meetings. Lindner\u2019s list of demands was referred to as the \u201ctorpedo\u201d. Lindner has dismissed the accusations as \u201celection campaign hullabaloo\u201d. The government collapse has sparked a political crisis in Europe\u2019s largest economy, at a time when it is dealing with considerable economic difficulties and growing internal strife over how to tackle significant issues such as Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine and the climate emergency. Early elections are due to take place on 23 February, more than seven months ahead of schedule, after a vote of confidence in Scholz in December, which he is expected to lose. Rolf M\u00fctzenich, the parliamentary head of Scholz\u2019s SPD, was among those to criticise Lindner. He said the party\u2019s use of the term D-day, which refers to Europe\u2019s liberation from the Nazis, \u201cfor its own political enactment \u2026 shows how far Mr Lindner has fallen.

      "bodyText": "The Greens have dropped their demand for a climate trigger to be incorporated in the government\u2019s stalled Nature Positive legislation, indicating they are now prepared to pass the bills in return for an Australia-wide ban on native forest logging alone. The party has previously refused to support Labor\u2019s legislation, insisting that both a climate trigger and a forest-logging ban must be included. But in the lead-up to the final parliamentary sitting week of the year \u2013 and after faring worse than they anticipated in the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland elections \u2013 the Greens\u2019 key Senate negotiators are to announce a compromise position to try to restart negotiations with the government. With the Coalition and some crossbenchers continuing to oppose them, the government cannot get the bills passed without Greens support. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The Greens Senate leader, Sarah Hanson-Young, accused the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, of bowing to pressure from the resources sector in his refusal to countenance a climate trigger. \u201cThe PM might not be willing to budge but the Greens are if it\u2019s in the best interests of our environment,\u201d Hanson-Young told Guardian Australia. \u201cFor this reason, we have offered the Albanese government passage of their Nature Positive bills in return for real action to save our native forests and critical habitat.\u201d The three Nature Positive bills would create an environmental protection authority and a data-gathering body, and increase penalties and enforcement powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The Greens offer represents the second concession on stalled legislation from the party in less than a week. On Friday it watered down its demands on one of two blocked housing bills \u2013 the government\u2019s Help to Buy legislation \u2013 dropping its insistence that the government end negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, which it has said it will not do. Instead, the Greens submitted an amended request list, seeking funding for 25,000 more social and affordable homes, tweaks to how repayments would be made under the proposed shared-equity scheme and more homes to be available under the other blocked program, Build to Rent. Before the Greens\u2019 revised Nature Positive offer, the government had refused to budge on either of its original demands. The party is still demanding a ban on logging, which the Greens forests spokesperson, Senator Nick McKim, said had \u201callowed the loggers to trash nature and destroy threatened species\u2019 habitats for far too long\u201d. But with Albanese focused on next year\u2019s election and especially on maintaining electoral support in Western Australia \u2013 where the government has already announced a native-forest logging ban \u2013 the party hopes its climate-trigger concession will be enough to secure a deal. \u201cClosing the legal loopholes that allow large-scale native forest logging and land clearing to go unassessed will have tangible impacts for the protection of critical habitat in Tasmania, NSW, and northern Australia, where deforestation is out of control,\u201d Hanson-Young said. \u201cWe have shifted our position here in order to get an outcome for the environment and the prime minister should do the same.

      "body": "<p>How do you know when it\u2019s time to slow down? I\u2019ve been wondering that ever since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/24/underactive-overindulging-40s-now-im-trying-to-live-to-100\">I decided to live to 100</a>. Sure, I may not make it; but if I do I expect exercise to play a huge part, alongside a healthy diet and (seriously, kids, this really isn\u2019t rocket science) evidence-based medicine rather than wellness influencers and coffee enemas.</p> <p>Bone density, muscle mass and cardiorespiratory fitness all decline as we get older; mobility and balance also take a hit. Exercise can slow or reverse most of this, and help <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html#:~:text=It%20can%20improve%20memory%20and,to%20those%20who%20are%20active.\">protect our brains</a>. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a long and independent life but it does make it more likely.</p> <p>And it can make you happier, though I only realised this after decades of abusing and undervaluing my body. I was in my 40s before I discovered how much I could enjoy hiking, swimming and skiing; my 50s before I learned to love running; my 60s before I got into yoga. I know it sounds ridiculous, but after more than 22,000 days on Earth I\u2019m just getting started.</p> <p>I hate to think I might already be too fragile for anything more hardcore like gymnastics, CrossFit, or \u2013 let\u2019s dare to dream \u2013 cliff diving or parkour. I watch videos of twentysomethings doing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9LKP0HfmWs\">handsprings</a>, leaping from roof to roof, generally giving the finger to gravity, and all I can think is: \u201cI want some of that!\u201d</p> <p>Then I remember I\u2019m 61, with a 61-year-old\u2019s muscles, joints and bones. If I did try it, how long would it be till I tore, sprained or broke something?</p>    <p>Actually, that\u2019s the wrong question. How long would it be till I tore, sprained or broke something <em>else</em>? My right knee has been swollen, weak and tender for months, thanks to a damaged meniscus. This C-shaped bit of cartilage is supposed to act as a kind of shock absorber, but for me it\u2019s more of an agony generator. It hurts to run, climb a lot of stairs or even sit for a long time. Yoga\u2019s out too, because I keep getting swept up in the flow and bending or sitting on something I really shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>At least part of my knee trouble is down to wear and tear. Every swelling, throb and cramp drums home the fact that the older you get, the harder it is to avoid injury \u2013 and to recover from it. I\u2019m not gonna lie \u2013 there\u2019s been times when it\u2019s made me sad with a capital S.</p> <p>Then I remember I can still walk for hours without any problem, and use both arms. I can even give my knees a good workout if I do it carefully. In fact, I have to: my rehabilitation plan includes endless squats, raises, deadlifts and stretches to strengthen my leg muscles.</p> <p>My physiotherapist, who is also a runner, encourages me to exercise in any way that doesn\u2019t hurt me. So I\u2019ve had a lot of fun with calisthenics, where you\u2019re mostly working your upper body on rings and pull-up bars, and handstands, where you don\u2019t do much with your legs except a bit of kicking.</p> <p>It helps that any good instructor will \u201cregress\u201d exercises as needed. That\u2019s fitness-speak for \u201cmake easier\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.deborahleept.com/\">Deborah Lee</a> is a personal trainer based in Grantham in Lincolnshire. She is the same age as me, and used to dealing with injuries and older clients. \u201cYou and I come from a generation where you had to \u2018hit it hard\u2019 all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cUnless you were bright red in the face and your veins were bulging, you weren\u2019t working hard enough. We now know different.\u201d</p> <p>***</p>    <p>Anyway, this is the mix of frustration and ambition that has brought me to a converted railway arch in east London, where I am heading nervously towards a mini-trampoline. I\u2019m hoping that when I bounce off it I will fly high enough to manage at least half a forward roll before I smash down on the crash mats that have been positioned to break my fall. If you know anything about gymnastics, I think you\u2019d call what I\u2019m attempting a front tuck.</p> <p>I have never done anything similar \u2013 not even as a child. I don\u2019t remember a single bounce on a trampoline, and was never one of those kids who could cartwheel. But everyone at the <a href=\"https://overgravitygymnastics.uk/\">Over Gravity</a> gym acts as if it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world. When I talk to co-founder Matteo Cara before my first \u201ctumbling\u201d class, he tells me I could still learn to backflip.</p> <p>As for my dodgy knee, Cara\u2019s got two of his own. But at 41, he\u2019s still limber enough to do double backflips every time he trains. \u201cI\u2019m not too old to have fun,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like a kid with an ice-cream.\u201d He kindly spends half an hour teaching me yet more exercises for my knee \u2013 and showing me how I can strap it up for extra support. I\u2019m both grateful and inspired.</p> <p>Alan Cooper, 65, has been coming to Over Gravity since he was in his late 50s. \u201cIt\u2019s the most worthwhile, most satisfying thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish I\u2019d taken it up years ago.\u201d</p> <p>How did he get started? \u201cI asked Matteo to teach me how to do a roundoff back tuck before I was 60 \u2013 and he did.\u201d</p> <p>I have no idea what Cooper is talking about, so I find a video online and have a WTF?! moment. I don\u2019t have the language to describe a roundoff back tuck, but it seems to contain something a bit like a cartwheel, and a sort of spring up, and a backflip, and \u2026 look, just watch the video here and be amazed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkEDxWBR3GY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hkEDxWBR3GY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Watch and be amazed \u2026 a roundoff back tuck</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The tumbling class itself is led by Mitchell March. He\u2019s decades younger than me, like my 11 fellow beginners, but I\u2019m encouraged that no one does a double take when they see me. Maybe we\u2019re all feeling a little out of place. Gymnastics in the UK is so dominated by kids\u2019 classes that when I headed off to Over Gravity my wife told me to \u201chave a nice time at <a href=\"https://www.tumbletots.com/our-programme/\">Tumble Tots</a>\u201d. </p> <p>We warm up with some running, skipping, jumping and arm-waving (these are not technical terms), plus some shoulder and wrist exercises. I\u2019m fine with all the bouncing, thanks to the sprung floor that softens every impact. I\u2019m also at home with the handstand practice. As usual, I struggle to stay up for more than a couple of seconds, but one of the many nice things about gymnastics is the proliferation of big thick pads. There\u2019s always somewhere soft to land, then up you go again \u2026</p> <p>There are forward rolls too, which most people can do, unlike the final stage to prepare us for the front tuck \u2013 cartwheels. While almost everyone else is cartwheeling from one end of the gym to the other, I\u2019m struggling with a regression designed for total klutzes. It doesn\u2019t make sense. Every time I put my hands on the ground and prepare to put <em>this</em> leg here and then <em>that</em> leg there, I find myself putting <em>that</em> leg here and then <em>this</em> leg there. At times I\u2019m actually going backwards.</p> <p>The more I work out, the more I realise the importance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/18/the-power-of-proprioception-how-to-improve-your-sixth-sense-and-become-healthier-and-happier\">proprioception</a> \u2013 knowing which bit of your body is where, and being able to move that bit rather than a different one. But mine\u2019s not getting any better. Instead, I\u2019m gradually training a nation of coaches that if they want me to move my hips, say, rather than my ankles, they\u2019ll have to tap me on the right bit instead of just tell me what to do. All I hear is: \u201cNow you need to move your blahblahblah.\u201d</p>    <p>After my cartwheel shame, the news that we are about to move on comes as a relief \u2013 until March demonstrates that front tuck. As he runs towards the trampoline, bounces high, then rolls forward in mid-air to land on his feet, there are gasps and nervous giggles. Everything so far has seemed achievable, given enough time and application (12 months till I master the cartwheel?); this seems aspirational. It\u2019s practically flying! It\u2019s magic! It\u2019s terrifying!</p> <p>But you know what? Even at 61, with a faulty knee and a stomach full of butterflies, it\u2019s not impossible. I run, I bounce, I spin, I crash down on my back, time after time after time. I almost land on my feet on a couple of occasions, which is gratifying, and I 100% land on my head and face, which is less so. I don\u2019t lift my hands high enough when I jump, according to March, or sweep them down hard enough as I flip. I do almost everything wrong, and I\u2019m about as graceful as a sack of potatoes, and yet it still feels great.</p> <p>I get chatting to some of the other students afterwards and everyone is amazed at how quickly we progressed, and how much we enjoyed it. It feels so natural. I book another class, and then a third. And then, during the photoshoot for this article, I take the opportunity to get some more tips from Cara. Look how high I got! Sometimes I love my job.</p> <p>***</p>    <p>Is there anything that would stop me doing this regularly? Only something that my calisthenics teacher <a href=\"https://www.mission-e1.com/teacher-page-lucy/\">Lucy Joslin</a> said to me. She is one of the most physically fit women I\u2019ve ever met. But, at 50, even she\u2019s thinking about ageing. The older you get, she says, the more you have to be selective about what you do. You build muscle more slowly than you used to, and you lose it more rapidly. It takes you longer to get over injuries. It\u2019s easy to spread yourself too thinly, so that any progress you make in your new favourite activity comes at the expense of what you were doing, and maybe loving, before.</p> <p>In short, if I want to become a regular at Tumble Tots, maybe I\u2019ll have to give up something else.</p> <p>Ugh. Choices. I guess it\u2019s good to still have them. </p>",

      "bodyText": "How do you know when it\u2019s time to slow down? I\u2019ve been wondering that ever since I decided to live to 100. Sure, I may not make it; but if I do I expect exercise to play a huge part, alongside a healthy diet and (seriously, kids, this really isn\u2019t rocket science) evidence-based medicine rather than wellness influencers and coffee enemas. Bone density, muscle mass and cardiorespiratory fitness all decline as we get older; mobility and balance also take a hit. Exercise can slow or reverse most of this, and help protect our brains. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a long and independent life but it does make it more likely. And it can make you happier, though I only realised this after decades of abusing and undervaluing my body. I was in my 40s before I discovered how much I could enjoy hiking, swimming and skiing; my 50s before I learned to love running; my 60s before I got into yoga. I know it sounds ridiculous, but after more than 22,000 days on Earth I\u2019m just getting started. I hate to think I might already be too fragile for anything more hardcore like gymnastics, CrossFit, or \u2013 let\u2019s dare to dream \u2013 cliff diving or parkour. I watch videos of twentysomethings doing handsprings, leaping from roof to roof, generally giving the finger to gravity, and all I can think is: \u201cI want some of that!\u201d Then I remember I\u2019m 61, with a 61-year-old\u2019s muscles, joints and bones. If I did try it, how long would it be till I tore, sprained or broke something? Actually, that\u2019s the wrong question. How long would it be till I tore, sprained or broke something else? My right knee has been swollen, weak and tender for months, thanks to a damaged meniscus. This C-shaped bit of cartilage is supposed to act as a kind of shock absorber, but for me it\u2019s more of an agony generator. It hurts to run, climb a lot of stairs or even sit for a long time. Yoga\u2019s out too, because I keep getting swept up in the flow and bending or sitting on something I really shouldn\u2019t. At least part of my knee trouble is down to wear and tear. Every swelling, throb and cramp drums home the fact that the older you get, the harder it is to avoid injury \u2013 and to recover from it. I\u2019m not gonna lie \u2013 there\u2019s been times when it\u2019s made me sad with a capital S. Then I remember I can still walk for hours without any problem, and use both arms. I can even give my knees a good workout if I do it carefully. In fact, I have to: my rehabilitation plan includes endless squats, raises, deadlifts and stretches to strengthen my leg muscles. My physiotherapist, who is also a runner, encourages me to exercise in any way that doesn\u2019t hurt me. So I\u2019ve had a lot of fun with calisthenics, where you\u2019re mostly working your upper body on rings and pull-up bars, and handstands, where you don\u2019t do much with your legs except a bit of kicking. It helps that any good instructor will \u201cregress\u201d exercises as needed. That\u2019s fitness-speak for \u201cmake easier\u201d. Deborah Lee is a personal trainer based in Grantham in Lincolnshire. She is the same age as me, and used to dealing with injuries and older clients. \u201cYou and I come from a generation where you had to \u2018hit it hard\u2019 all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cUnless you were bright red in the face and your veins were bulging, you weren\u2019t working hard enough. We now know different.\u201d *** Anyway, this is the mix of frustration and ambition that has brought me to a converted railway arch in east London, where I am heading nervously towards a mini-trampoline. I\u2019m hoping that when I bounce off it I will fly high enough to manage at least half a forward roll before I smash down on the crash mats that have been positioned to break my fall. If you know anything about gymnastics, I think you\u2019d call what I\u2019m attempting a front tuck. I have never done anything similar \u2013 not even as a child. I don\u2019t remember a single bounce on a trampoline, and was never one of those kids who could cartwheel. But everyone at the Over Gravity gym acts as if it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world. When I talk to co-founder Matteo Cara before my first \u201ctumbling\u201d class, he tells me I could still learn to backflip. As for my dodgy knee, Cara\u2019s got two of his own. But at 41, he\u2019s still limber enough to do double backflips every time he trains. \u201cI\u2019m not too old to have fun,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like a kid with an ice-cream.\u201d He kindly spends half an hour teaching me yet more exercises for my knee \u2013 and showing me how I can strap it up for extra support. I\u2019m both grateful and inspired. Alan Cooper, 65, has been coming to Over Gravity since he was in his late 50s. \u201cIt\u2019s the most worthwhile, most satisfying thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish I\u2019d taken it up years ago.\u201d How did he get started? \u201cI asked Matteo to teach me how to do a roundoff back tuck before I was 60 \u2013 and he did.\u201d I have no idea what Cooper is talking about, so I find a video online and have a WTF?! moment. I don\u2019t have the language to describe a roundoff back tuck, but it seems to contain something a bit like a cartwheel, and a sort of spring up, and a backflip, and \u2026 look, just watch the video here and be amazed. The tumbling class itself is led by Mitchell March. He\u2019s decades younger than me, like my 11 fellow beginners, but I\u2019m encouraged that no one does a double take when they see me. Maybe we\u2019re all feeling a little out of place. Gymnastics in the UK is so dominated by kids\u2019 classes that when I headed off to Over Gravity my wife told me to \u201chave a nice time at Tumble Tots\u201d. We warm up with some running, skipping, jumping and arm-waving (these are not technical terms), plus some shoulder and wrist exercises. I\u2019m fine with all the bouncing, thanks to the sprung floor that softens every impact. I\u2019m also at home with the handstand practice. As usual, I struggle to stay up for more than a couple of seconds, but one of the many nice things about gymnastics is the proliferation of big thick pads. There\u2019s always somewhere soft to land, then up you go again \u2026 There are forward rolls too, which most people can do, unlike the final stage to prepare us for the front tuck \u2013 cartwheels. While almost everyone else is cartwheeling from one end of the gym to the other, I\u2019m struggling with a regression designed for total klutzes. It doesn\u2019t make sense. Every time I put my hands on the ground and prepare to put this leg here and then that leg there, I find myself putting that leg here and then this leg there. At times I\u2019m actually going backwards. The more I work out, the more I realise the importance of proprioception \u2013 knowing which bit of your body is where, and being able to move that bit rather than a different one. But mine\u2019s not getting any better. Instead, I\u2019m gradually training a nation of coaches that if they want me to move my hips, say, rather than my ankles, they\u2019ll have to tap me on the right bit instead of just tell me what to do.

They\u2019re now playing their way through Europe in mostly sold-out shows before coming home to Australia for a run of summer festivals.</p> <p>Their rise feels less like a whirlwind, Maddell says, and more like meeting a friend\u2019s kid as a baby and not noticing they\u2019re growing up before your eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just been like a step, step, step sort of thing, rather than going from being tiny to [big] venues,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The band\u2019s origin story feels fated: Maddell and Pavlovic ran in similar circles in the Bondi music scene for years but it wasn\u2019t until 2019 that they started collaborating \u2013 and found a perfect collision of tastes and interests. They released their first EP in 2021, and two more since. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned from being friends into almost family,\u201d Pavlovic says.</p>    <p>The combination of Pavlovic\u2019s choirboy vocals and Maddell\u2019s jangly guitar feels timeless \u2013 their breakout single, 2022\u2019s dreamy Oysters in My Pocket, sounds as though it could have come out at any point in the last 30 years. But the band might not have blown up without two cover songs, both of which went staggeringly viral.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>First, in January, Royel Otis reimagined Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s disco-pop classic Murder on the Dancefloor into an effusive sunburst for Triple J\u2019s beloved cover series Like a Version, racking up 50m Spotify streams. A few months later they performed the Cranberries\u2019 lovelorn ballad Linger for SiriusXM. That stripped-back cover, featuring just voice and guitar, has topped 82m streams.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQyL3mUVDWA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sQyL3mUVDWA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>These songs tap into a broader cultural nostalgia. \u201cSo many people love Nirvana now who were definitely not even in the womb for another 10 years,\u201d says Maddell, though he\u2019s cagey about his own age. \u201cI\u2019m older than Otis,\u201d he says, making it clear that\u2019s the end of the answer.</p> <p>Royel Otis\u2019s own music is suffused with hints of the past too. Maddell names the Smiths and the Cure as his influences but there are also echoes of 2010s indie bands including Phoenix, Passion Pit and MGMT. \u201cIt\u2019s not intentional but maybe it\u2019s in our roots from what we listened to when we were younger,\u201d Pavlovic says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGUVB19e13s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JGUVB19e13s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It might be a double-edged sword to go viral for other people\u2019s songs but Maddell says they\u2019re \u201cboth really grateful\u201d \u2013 even if the band\u2019s success has chafed against his own penchant for anonymity. On this Zoom call, as in all photos and videos, his long hair obscures his face. Has it been harder to remain hidden?</p> <p>\u201cPeople have gotten more respectful,\u201d Maddell counters, a smile visible under the locks. \u201cNow when they want to get photos, they want to cover their face with me, rather than being like, \u2018Just show your face,\u2019 which used to happen a lot \u2026 I\u2019m definitely glad it was my choice.\u201d</p> <p>The band is now on the home stretch of their mammoth tour before returning to Australia. \u201cI saw the schedule late last year, and I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll be fine, we\u2019ll be able to do it\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t really think twice,\u201d Pavlovic says. \u201cSometimes it can get a little bit tiring.

When we speak, the band is in the US, where they made their live television debut in October on Jimmy Kimmel. They\u2019re now playing their way through Europe in mostly sold-out shows before coming home to Australia for a run of summer festivals. Their rise feels less like a whirlwind, Maddell says, and more like meeting a friend\u2019s kid as a baby and not noticing they\u2019re growing up before your eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just been like a step, step, step sort of thing, rather than going from being tiny to [big] venues,\u201d he says. The band\u2019s origin story feels fated: Maddell and Pavlovic ran in similar circles in the Bondi music scene for years but it wasn\u2019t until 2019 that they started collaborating \u2013 and found a perfect collision of tastes and interests. They released their first EP in 2021, and two more since. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned from being friends into almost family,\u201d Pavlovic says. The combination of Pavlovic\u2019s choirboy vocals and Maddell\u2019s jangly guitar feels timeless \u2013 their breakout single, 2022\u2019s dreamy Oysters in My Pocket, sounds as though it could have come out at any point in the last 30 years. But the band might not have blown up without two cover songs, both of which went staggeringly viral. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning First, in January, Royel Otis reimagined Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s disco-pop classic Murder on the Dancefloor into an effusive sunburst for Triple J\u2019s beloved cover series Like a Version, racking up 50m Spotify streams. A few months later they performed the Cranberries\u2019 lovelorn ballad Linger for SiriusXM. That stripped-back cover, featuring just voice and guitar, has topped 82m streams. These songs tap into a broader cultural nostalgia. \u201cSo many people love Nirvana now who were definitely not even in the womb for another 10 years,\u201d says Maddell, though he\u2019s cagey about his own age. \u201cI\u2019m older than Otis,\u201d he says, making it clear that\u2019s the end of the answer. Royel Otis\u2019s own music is suffused with hints of the past too. Maddell names the Smiths and the Cure as his influences but there are also echoes of 2010s indie bands including Phoenix, Passion Pit and MGMT. \u201cIt\u2019s not intentional but maybe it\u2019s in our roots from what we listened to when we were younger,\u201d Pavlovic says. It might be a double-edged sword to go viral for other people\u2019s songs but Maddell says they\u2019re \u201cboth really grateful\u201d \u2013 even if the band\u2019s success has chafed against his own penchant for anonymity. On this Zoom call, as in all photos and videos, his long hair obscures his face. Has it been harder to remain hidden? \u201cPeople have gotten more respectful,\u201d Maddell counters, a smile visible under the locks. \u201cNow when they want to get photos, they want to cover their face with me, rather than being like, \u2018Just show your face,\u2019 which used to happen a lot \u2026 I\u2019m definitely glad it was my choice.\u201d The band is now on the home stretch of their mammoth tour before returning to Australia. \u201cI saw the schedule late last year, and I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll be fine, we\u2019ll be able to do it\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t really think twice,\u201d Pavlovic says. \u201cSometimes it can get a little bit tiring. But it is what it is, and \u2026 it\u2019s really exciting.\u201d Royel Otis\u2019s songs to live by Each month we ask our headline act to share the songs that have accompanied them through love, life, lust and death. What music do you clean the house to? Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor, \u2019cos we love her. What\u2019s the song you wish you wrote? Just Like Heaven by the Cure \u2013 because it fits any mood that you\u2019re in. What underrated song deserves classic status? Corridor of Dreams by the Cleaners From Venus. Have a listen and you\u2019ll know. What song do you want played at your funeral? These Days by Nico. What is the best song to have sex to? The Mario Kart theme song \u2026 or anything by Frank Ocean or Steve Lacy. Mario Kart to get the heart racing, Frank or Steve to slow things down. If your life was a movie, what would the opening credits song be? Hello by Adele. What is your go-to karaoke song? Someone Like You by Adele. This article was amended on 18 November. An earlier version incorrectly said that the bandmembers met in Byron Bay.",

I\u2019ve got a bunch of them. They\u2019re insanely compact and they have to go through Bluetooth speakers but I find them essential for touring life.</p>    <p>This belief is one of the only things I share with Keith Richards \u2013 he was always very big on dressing his hotel rooms with scarves and a stereo system, because if you\u2019re in a different one every night it\u2019s important to add a bit of your own personality to it, so there\u2019s a semblance of, \u201cOK, you\u2019re home.\u201d When you\u2019ve got your music at your disposal and can spend the wee hours listening, it helps stop you from becoming a whingeing sack of complaints. A large part of touring is keeping your head above water so you can be a good bandmate.</p> <p>Having a portable player with you also facilitates little adventures to local record stores, where I find myself gravitating no matter what part of the world I\u2019m in. I was in Torino in Italy last month with the Hard-Ons. Ray, our bass player, and I spent most nights we weren\u2019t on stage at this great little store we found, talking with these Italian dudes about records. It sparks intimate conversations with people, because people\u2019s taste, particularly in music and books, is a real window into the way they want to live their lives.</p> <h2>My most useful object</h2> <p>Definitely a book. I only live by a few little mantras, and one is always make sure you have a book on you, whether it\u2019s for reading or jotting down notes.</p>    <p>I find if there\u2019s any sadness, anxiety or tension in your life, reading \u2013 particularly fiction \u2013 is the only surefire relief and tranquillity. I studied literature at university then I got sick, and all that learning went out the window. There was a period of a couple of decades where I didn\u2019t read at all. I started reading again in my early 40s and remembered that reading is the only real way to quell the bad thoughts.</p> <p>Whatever book I\u2019m reading has inevitably got scribbles or half-concocted songs or even just witty aphorisms, purely for my own amusement, jotted in the margins. So now I\u2019ve always got a book and a pencil in my bag. I\u2019ve ditched the cigarettes, so there might even be room for a second little book in there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/12/kate-ceberano-jon-stevens-australia-tour-interview\">Three things with Kate Ceberano: \u2018I\u2019ve never seen one like it for sale \u2026 I should probably patent it\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The item I most regret losing</h2> <p>My first thought was a Gibson ES-345 guitar that I left in the back of a cab when I was out gallivanting with Brad Shepherd of the Hoodoo Gurus in 1995.

I\u2019m also a shocking flyer \u2013 I have to try and meditate a little bit so I don\u2019t annoy whoever is sitting next to me. I\u2019ve found that stashing my pockets with some gum leaves from the trees around us is wonderful for any tension or anxiety while travelling. I just chuck a gum leaf up my nostril and suddenly I\u2019m back out here.</p> <p>But of course, with quarantine and customs, I have to ditch them all the time. I keep checking with airlines, can I bring a eucalyptus plant in my luggage? They say, no, you idiot Rogers, how many times do you have to ask!

This belief is one of the only things I share with Keith Richards \u2013 he was always very big on dressing his hotel rooms with scarves and a stereo system, because if you\u2019re in a different one every night it\u2019s important to add a bit of your own personality to it, so there\u2019s a semblance of, \u201cOK, you\u2019re home.\u201d When you\u2019ve got your music at your disposal and can spend the wee hours listening, it helps stop you from becoming a whingeing sack of complaints. A large part of touring is keeping your head above water so you can be a good bandmate. Having a portable player with you also facilitates little adventures to local record stores, where I find myself gravitating no matter what part of the world I\u2019m in. I was in Torino in Italy last month with the Hard-Ons. Ray, our bass player, and I spent most nights we weren\u2019t on stage at this great little store we found, talking with these Italian dudes about records. It sparks intimate conversations with people, because people\u2019s taste, particularly in music and books, is a real window into the way they want to live their lives. My most useful object Definitely a book. I only live by a few little mantras, and one is always make sure you have a book on you, whether it\u2019s for reading or jotting down notes. I find if there\u2019s any sadness, anxiety or tension in your life, reading \u2013 particularly fiction \u2013 is the only surefire relief and tranquillity. I studied literature at university then I got sick, and all that learning went out the window. There was a period of a couple of decades where I didn\u2019t read at all. I started reading again in my early 40s and remembered that reading is the only real way to quell the bad thoughts. Whatever book I\u2019m reading has inevitably got scribbles or half-concocted songs or even just witty aphorisms, purely for my own amusement, jotted in the margins. So now I\u2019ve always got a book and a pencil in my bag. I\u2019ve ditched the cigarettes, so there might even be room for a second little book in there. The item I most regret losing My first thought was a Gibson ES-345 guitar that I left in the back of a cab when I was out gallivanting with Brad Shepherd of the Hoodoo Gurus in 1995. But then I remembered that the one thing I lose consistently is a sprig of eucalyptus leaves. We live in the country and I miss the land terribly when I\u2019m away. I\u2019m also a shocking flyer \u2013 I have to try and meditate a little bit so I don\u2019t annoy whoever is sitting next to me. I\u2019ve found that stashing my pockets with some gum leaves from the trees around us is wonderful for any tension or anxiety while travelling. I just chuck a gum leaf up my nostril and suddenly I\u2019m back out here. But of course, with quarantine and customs, I have to ditch them all the time. I keep checking with airlines, can I bring a eucalyptus plant in my luggage? They say, no, you idiot Rogers, how many times do you have to ask! So there are way too many sprigs of eucalyptus left behind in airports around this country.

This is Mary in her twenties, six or seven years younger than in the 1540s miniature, but a woman whose father Henry regards her as a \u201cbastard\u201d following the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.</p> <p>Rutherford became doubtful that this portrait was of Parr while curating a new exhibition, The Reflected Self: Portrait Miniatures, at Compton Verney House, Warwickshire. She initially made comparisons with other portraits of the two royal women. The most noted of Parr is Master John\u2019s full length picture, owned by the National Portrait Gallery (NPG), while there is a miniature at Sudeley Castle where she died and is buried. The best known of Mary, though as queen in the 1550s, are by Antonis Mor in the Prado museum, Madrid, and by Hans Eworth, also in the NPG.</p> <p>\u201cBoth Mary and Katherine had reddish hair and blueish eyes, and were a similar age of around 30 when this miniature was done,\u201d says Rutherford. \u201cHence some confusion. They wore similar clothes too, though Parr\u2019s were usually more dressy. But the noses are clearly different.\u201d Historian Dr Owen Emmerson, who is also an advisor on the BBC series, agrees with Rutherford. \u201cMary\u2019s is retrousse while Katherine\u2019s is straight.\u201d</p> <p>There are other vital, just discovered, clues. Nicola Tallis, a 16th century jewelry expert, noticed that the cross, which the sitter is wearing in the Compton Verney portrait, is similar to one she has on in a small portrait in the NPG, attributed to the Horenbout family. It has four diamonds and three pearl pendants.</p> <p>Then Emmerson, searching Mary\u2019s royal expense records, found that on 20 July 1546 she was gifted from her father a black cross with five diamonds and three pearl pendants. This jewelled cross with pearls matches the one Mary is wearing in the miniature. Records also show that Mary had gifted some black silk to the artist Susanna Horenbout, part of her circle.</p> <p>\u201cWe can now say with some certainty that Susanna painted Mary since her father Gerard Horenbout and brother Lucas were dead by the mid-1540s,\u201d says Rutherford. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting too \u2013 a woman painting a woman.\u201d She dates the portrait to about 1546 when Mary was 30.</p> <p>There is one final twist. Parr, who as queen consort petitioned Henry so that both his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, could eventually accede to the throne, was also a great lover of the arts.</p> <p>\u201cSo it is quite possible, and the timeline is right, that this miniature was actually commissioned by Katherine herself,\u201d says Emmerson. It is ironic then that the portrait, so long thought to be Parr, is in fact Mary.</p>",

Nicola Tallis, a 16th century jewelry expert, noticed that the cross, which the sitter is wearing in the Compton Verney portrait, is similar to one she has on in a small portrait in the NPG, attributed to the Horenbout family. It has four diamonds and three pearl pendants. Then Emmerson, searching Mary\u2019s royal expense records, found that on 20 July 1546 she was gifted from her father a black cross with five diamonds and three pearl pendants. This jewelled cross with pearls matches the one Mary is wearing in the miniature. Records also show that Mary had gifted some black silk to the artist Susanna Horenbout, part of her circle. \u201cWe can now say with some certainty that Susanna painted Mary since her father Gerard Horenbout and brother Lucas were dead by the mid-1540s,\u201d says Rutherford. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting too \u2013 a woman painting a woman.\u201d She dates the portrait to about 1546 when Mary was 30. There is one final twist. Parr, who as queen consort petitioned Henry so that both his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, could eventually accede to the throne, was also a great lover of the arts. \u201cSo it is quite possible, and the timeline is right, that this miniature was actually commissioned by Katherine herself,\u201d says Emmerson. It is ironic then that the portrait, so long thought to be Parr, is in fact Mary.",

But Koveleski \u2013 whose family is Haitian \u2013 has noticed a major change recently. Haitians are now coming to her to figure out how to leave. \u201cSome folks don\u2019t have credit cards or access to the internet, and they want to buy a bus ticket or a plane ticket, so we help them book a flight,\u201d she told the Guardian recently. \u201cPeople are leaving.\u201d Koveleski, leaders in Springfield\u2019s Haitian community, and others have relayed reports of Haitians fleeing the city of 60,000 people in recent days for fear of being rounded up and deported after Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 5 November presidential election. \u201cThe owner of one store is wondering if he should move back to New York or to Chicago \u2013 he says his business is way down,\u201d Koveleski remarked. Trump has repeatedly said he would end immigrants\u2019 temporary protected status (TPS) \u2013 the provision through which many Haitians are legally allowed to live and work in the US \u2013 and deport Haitians from Springfield once in office. For many, the threats are real.

Unofficial results from the presidential election found that Trump beat Harris by fewer than 150 votes in Springfield despite his making false claims about immigrants in the Ohio city a cornerstone of his anti-immigration election campaign.

      "body": "<p>Why are so many traditional stories for children, be they folk stories, fairytales or nursery rhymes, so dark, creepy or macabre? <em>Rachel Parks, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p><em>Send new questions to </em><strong><a href=\"mailto:nq@theguardian.com\">nq@theguardian.com</a></strong><em>.</em></p> <h2>Readers reply</h2> <p>Because the shadows make the light brighter and, sometimes, a little fear is the best kind of fun. <strong>Michael</strong></p> <p>I expect at least some of the tales weren\u2019t, originally, particularly aimed at children, they were just oral folk tales. But also, as authors such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl\">Roald Dahl</a> show, children often rather enjoy the dark and macabre. And, of course, there\u2019s the famous (paraphrased) GK Chesterton quote: \u201cFairytales do not tell children that dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairytales tell children that dragons can be killed.\u201d If you were living in a time when coming to a nasty end was a relatively common facet of life (even and sometimes especially for children), it\u2019s understandable that stories wouldn\u2019t be shy about it. <strong>Jebedee</strong></p> <p>Before the last century, children were more exposed to death and suffering. A child from a family of five who survived to adulthood might see three of their siblings get sick and die along the way, along with adult family members \u2013 people died in the home rather than in hospital. Today, we try to shield children from awareness of death, but that\u2019s a recent thing. <strong>Randonusername222</strong></p> <p>They were meant to be lessons. This is the problem with people today: they don\u2019t tell children about the real dangers and then they grow up to vote for bullies and narcissists. If you don\u2019t understand the way danger will show up you\u2019re not. <strong>ThatsWhatIsaid2</strong></p> <p>When I was a young child, my dad enjoyed scaring me, not with fairytales, but with reality. At bedtime, he would say things like: \u201cThe sun will burn out someday,\u201d \u201cSchool buses are deathtraps,\u201d and: \u201cThe government allows a certain number of rat hairs in cereal.\u201d Stories about dragons would have been far less scary \u2013 and less damaging to my psyche. <strong>hillandvalley</strong></p> <p>As Westley said to Buttercup in The Princess Bride: \u201cLife is pain, highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something.\u201d That\u2019s why many fairytales are dark. <strong>Atlant</strong></p> <p>They reflect reality. Life is nasty, British and short. <strong>Leoned</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/contemporary-values-no-place-in-fairytales-you-must-be-living-in-a-fantasy-world\">Fairytales have always reflected the morals of the age. It\u2019s not a sin to rewrite them | Martha Gill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Grimm brothers were studying language and folklore in Germany and gathered many tales that are now regarded as children\u2019s books. But at that time fewer people could read, so the tales were mostly for grownups \u2013 instead of going to the cinema and watching a horror movie or hanging out, you would listen to horrific stories, where often children or young women are being misled by evil agents. <strong>davidchristensen</strong></p> <p>As a kid of the 80s, I didn\u2019t notice how dark they were, as they seemed like sunshine itself compared with the public-service TV adverts aimed at kids. Bloody hell. Give me a spider interrupting my curds and whey over going within a mile of an electricity pylon any day. <strong>catchytitled</strong></p> <p>In the 19th century, alongside Romanticism in literature, the gothic grew. Mary Shelley is well known for kicking off one trend, with the likes of Edgar Allan Poe to come. Goya, at the very start, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleep_of_Reason_Produces_Monsters\">had noted</a>: \u201cThe sleep of reason produces monsters.\u201d There are plenty of Freudian and even Marxist interpretations of it all, some fun to read, and these are embedded in our thinking. But there is a simpler way out. Goya\u2019s sleep of reason and Freud\u2019s exploration of the unconscious lead to the same place: dreams. Are the dreams of children more vivid than those of adults? Maybe. Might they in their own way understand weird tales better than their parents, preoccupied with railway timetables and shopping? Stressed out grownups have been known to regress to childlike states. Hollywood has depended on it. <strong>Fallowfield</strong></p> <p>Children love to go exploring, or they should do. A lot of these tales stem from the times when towns and villages were much smaller and the parts in between were mostly forested. It was probably reasonably effective to make sure the offspring were back home before dark if they were informed about wicked elves, witches and big, bad wolves lurking in the woodlands. Even today, even if you\u2019re an adult, you can never be quite sure.

      "bodyText": "Why are so many traditional stories for children, be they folk stories, fairytales or nursery rhymes, so dark, creepy or macabre? Rachel Parks, West Yorkshire Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Readers reply Because the shadows make the light brighter and, sometimes, a little fear is the best kind of fun. Michael I expect at least some of the tales weren\u2019t, originally, particularly aimed at children, they were just oral folk tales. But also, as authors such as Roald Dahl show, children often rather enjoy the dark and macabre. And, of course, there\u2019s the famous (paraphrased) GK Chesterton quote: \u201cFairytales do not tell children that dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairytales tell children that dragons can be killed.\u201d If you were living in a time when coming to a nasty end was a relatively common facet of life (even and sometimes especially for children), it\u2019s understandable that stories wouldn\u2019t be shy about it. Jebedee Before the last century, children were more exposed to death and suffering. A child from a family of five who survived to adulthood might see three of their siblings get sick and die along the way, along with adult family members \u2013 people died in the home rather than in hospital. Today, we try to shield children from awareness of death, but that\u2019s a recent thing. Randonusername222 They were meant to be lessons. This is the problem with people today: they don\u2019t tell children about the real dangers and then they grow up to vote for bullies and narcissists. If you don\u2019t understand the way danger will show up you\u2019re not. ThatsWhatIsaid2 When I was a young child, my dad enjoyed scaring me, not with fairytales, but with reality. At bedtime, he would say things like: \u201cThe sun will burn out someday,\u201d \u201cSchool buses are deathtraps,\u201d and: \u201cThe government allows a certain number of rat hairs in cereal.\u201d Stories about dragons would have been far less scary \u2013 and less damaging to my psyche. hillandvalley As Westley said to Buttercup in The Princess Bride: \u201cLife is pain, highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something.\u201d That\u2019s why many fairytales are dark. Atlant They reflect reality. Life is nasty, British and short. Leoned The Grimm brothers were studying language and folklore in Germany and gathered many tales that are now regarded as children\u2019s books. But at that time fewer people could read, so the tales were mostly for grownups \u2013 instead of going to the cinema and watching a horror movie or hanging out, you would listen to horrific stories, where often children or young women are being misled by evil agents. davidchristensen As a kid of the 80s, I didn\u2019t notice how dark they were, as they seemed like sunshine itself compared with the public-service TV adverts aimed at kids. Bloody hell. Give me a spider interrupting my curds and whey over going within a mile of an electricity pylon any day. catchytitled In the 19th century, alongside Romanticism in literature, the gothic grew. Mary Shelley is well known for kicking off one trend, with the likes of Edgar Allan Poe to come. Goya, at the very start, had noted: \u201cThe sleep of reason produces monsters.\u201d There are plenty of Freudian and even Marxist interpretations of it all, some fun to read, and these are embedded in our thinking. But there is a simpler way out. Goya\u2019s sleep of reason and Freud\u2019s exploration of the unconscious lead to the same place: dreams. Are the dreams of children more vivid than those of adults? Maybe. Might they in their own way understand weird tales better than their parents, preoccupied with railway timetables and shopping? Stressed out grownups have been known to regress to childlike states. Hollywood has depended on it. Fallowfield Children love to go exploring, or they should do. A lot of these tales stem from the times when towns and villages were much smaller and the parts in between were mostly forested. It was probably reasonably effective to make sure the offspring were back home before dark if they were informed about wicked elves, witches and big, bad wolves lurking in the woodlands. Even today, even if you\u2019re an adult, you can never be quite sure. Try it if you like: take a room in a small village in, say, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, even better a hamlet in southern Bohemia, and go for a long walk in the late afternoon. Torches, maps and compasses not allowed; as for smartphones, don\u2019t even consider it. Now, as dusk is falling, do you really want to continue deeper into the forest? bricklayersoption",

It actually breaks collagen down, which leads to more rapid skin ageing. While UVA is less likely to cause an immediate sunburn, UVA radiation can also still penetrate deep into the skin, contributing to long-term skin damage, and increasing an individual\u2019s cancer risk.\u201d</p> <p>A Queensland Health spokesperson said the department \u201cis currently organising the purchase of quantitative UV radiation detection equipment, which will help us investigate these facilities and ascertain whether their operation constitutes a breach of the legislation\u201d.</p> <p>Queensland Health has received 89 reports of solariums, collariums and pink light systems being used in violation of solarium laws since 2022. No prosecutions have been made to date against any of them.</p> <p>Guardian Australia understands most complaints about solarium-related services in Queensland are about those advertised on private or closed-access social media accounts, which are difficult for health inspectors to investigate.

      "bodyText": "Queensland Department of Health investigators are struggling to prosecute sunbed operators claiming the devices are \u201csafe\u201d because inspectors do not have the necessary UV detection equipment, and because services are being advertised on private social media accounts. Guardian Australia called and messaged several wellness clinics and individuals operating out of their homes throughout New South Wales and Queensland, confirming that businesses are offering \u201ccollarium\u201d treatments with rates starting at $25 for 20 minutes of use. Some of these businesses did not explicitly advertise collariums on their social media pages or websites but did offer collarium bookings over the phone. Cancer Council Queensland\u2019s prevention and early detection senior manager, Sharyn Chin Fat, said \u201ca collarium is essentially a rebranded sunbed that emits both UV radiation and red-light wavelengths\u201d. These are sometimes advertised as \u201cpink light\u2019\u201d beds, and sessions of up to 40 minutes are offered. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email They are also often marketed as \u201csafe\u201d or \u201clegal\u201d alternatives to sunbeds, also known as solariums, because they primarily emit UVA radiation. Due to skin damage and cancer risk, commercial solariums are banned in all Australian states and territories except the Northern Territory, where there are no commercial tanning businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s claimed they [collariums/pink or red light beds] improve skin health by stimulating collagen, while also providing the user with a tan,\u201d Chin Fat said. \u201cHowever, UVA doesn\u2019t stimulate collagen production. It actually breaks collagen down, which leads to more rapid skin ageing. While UVA is less likely to cause an immediate sunburn, UVA radiation can also still penetrate deep into the skin, contributing to long-term skin damage, and increasing an individual\u2019s cancer risk.\u201d A Queensland Health spokesperson said the department \u201cis currently organising the purchase of quantitative UV radiation detection equipment, which will help us investigate these facilities and ascertain whether their operation constitutes a breach of the legislation\u201d. Queensland Health has received 89 reports of solariums, collariums and pink light systems being used in violation of solarium laws since 2022. No prosecutions have been made to date against any of them. Guardian Australia understands most complaints about solarium-related services in Queensland are about those advertised on private or closed-access social media accounts, which are difficult for health inspectors to investigate. Access to these accounts is often by invitation only, so inspectors are unable to issue a search warrant. A spokesperson for the Environmental Protection Authority in NSW said in 2024 it had received 32 reports about alleged illegal solariums including collariums. \u201cAll reports are assessed and we undertake a range of regulatory and investigative actions and compliance campaigns to deter unlawful operators,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis includes inspections, advisory letters, formal warnings, penalty notices and prosecutions.\u201d Prof Anne Cust, a cancer epidemiologist and deputy director of the Daffodil Centre, said people should be weary of any advertising claims that collariums are \u201clow UV\u201d and therefore \u201csafer\u201d. \u201cWhen solariums were legal, there were certain limits around how much UV radiation was allowed to be emitted from them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when these devices were tested, they were well above those limits. You can\u2019t trust claims about how much UV radiation is being emitted from them. Any UV radiation can be harmful.\u201d Chin Fat agreed: \u201cThere is no such thing as a safe sunbed or a safe tan. \u201cWe don\u2019t support the sale or use of any radiation-based tanning device. \u201cWe strongly advise against using these devices due to the significant risks they pose when it comes to skin cancer.

I\u2019d already blown it on day one. \u201cLook at that!\u201d I said to the couple opposite me in the hotel\u2019s below-ground sauna. A window looked on to the deep end of the outdoor pool. \u201cA human fish!\u201d Neither replied.</p> <p>But there is so much to talk about, starting with our hotel, the <a href=\"https://guldsmedenhotels.com/bryggen-guldsmeden-4-star-resort-with-pool/?utm_source=GBP&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=Bryggen+Guldsmeden+4-star+resort+with+pool&amp;utm_content=website_button_GBP\">Bryggen Guldsmeden Eco Resort</a>, a former shoe factory in Copenhagen\u2019s harbour-front neighbourhood of Islands Brygge. In the reception area there are trees (fake, tasteful) of pink blossom, deer heads (also fake), wicker hanging chairs, funky stained glass \u2013 and that sauna. And then there are the Balinese bedrooms, chic pool loungers, the Babette\u2019s Feast of a breakfast, and the silver bullet Airstream serving drinks by the pool.</p>    <p>We\u2019re here on a family train and road trip, looking for a mix of urban culture, countryside and coast. After two days in Copenhagen on the island of Zealand, we drove up to the Danish Riviera before heading over to Jutland to explore the Danish Lake District and, finally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/03/locals-guide-aarhus-live-music-parks-nordic-street-vibe\">Aarhus</a>, Denmark\u2019s terrific second city.</p> <p>Our first morning was well spent. We took in the Cisterns, an underground art space created in a former reservoir. We were fortunate to catch <a href=\"https://frederiksbergmuseerne.dk/en/udstillinger/start-again-the-lament/\">Start Again the Lament</a>, a sound installation by Tarya Simon exploring death, loss and grief. We walked, in the half-light, down illuminated paths floating over water, to stirring recitations by professional mourners.</p> <p>Back in the light, we took a bus back to the centre and walked, via Nyhavn, the famous 17th-century harbour, to Nordre Toldbod waterfront, home to the buzzy seven-restaurant <a href=\"https://seasidecph.dk/en/\">Seaside Toldboden complex</a>. We drank margaritas and watched the yachts in the sunshine. The city has nailed the communal experience, whether it\u2019s eating and drinking or swimming in the canals or harbours. The <a href=\"https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/planning/islands-brygge-harbour-bath-gdk482346\">Islands Brygge Harbour Bath</a>, near our hotel, is a local favourite.</p>    <p>That night we ate at <a href=\"https://gazagrill.dk/en\">Gaza Grill</a>, a good-value Middle Eastern spot in Vesterbro\u2019s Meatpacking District. We got our indulgence fix the next night at the <a href=\"https://www.nimb.dk/\">Nimb Hotel</a>, a Moorish fantasia with a wonderful rooftop bar. It backs on to Tivoli Gardens amusement park and its glam brasserie offers French cuisine and ringside seats on to the park.</p> <p>What a contrast to the clean lines of the outstanding <a href=\"https://louisiana.dk/en/\">Louisiana Museum of Modern Art</a>, a 40-minute train ride up the coast from Copenhagen. An 1870s villa and three modernist pavilions are set in a sculpture garden overlooking the sea. From there, we jumped on a 10-minute train ride up to Helsing\u00f8r\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.kronborg.dk/\">Kronborg Castle</a>, the setting for Hamlet. As we made for the ramparts, the ghost scene ready to recite from one of our phones (this is Hamlet\u2019s gaff \u2013 it had to be done!), a pair of newlyweds from Japan were posing for photographs in white silk and black sunglasses, a skull, Yorick\u2019s presumably, held aloft. How fabulous tourists are, I thought, and gave them a rather unDanish cheer.</p> <p>It was an easy 60km drive through flat, open farmland up to the Danish Riviera on the north Zealand coast, our destination - the old fishing village of Tisvilde and the rarefied <a href=\"https://helenekilde.com/\">Helenkilde Badehotel</a>. With its smart lunch terrace, porch with rattan furniture, comfy-chic living rooms and a panoramic sauna with sea views, this clifftop hotel whispers restraint.</p>    <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t got the vibe to be Danish,\u201d my younger son said over our candle-lit dinner that night in the hotel\u2019s lovely restaurant. I was stifling a giggle at the time. The naked, cuddling couple we\u2019d spotted earlier on the naturist beach from a raised walkway, had just walked in. I don\u2019t know why I found it funny to see them here, fully clothed, I just did. Not very Danish of me, I can see that now.</p> <p>The next day, after a rainy walk in Tisvilde Hegn pine forest, we warmed up with cinnamon buns and hot chocolate in Br\u00f8d &amp; Vin caf\u00e9 in the village.

      "bodyText": "Don\u2019t make small talk with strangers. Or talk about the weather. Or even ask people you know how they are\u2026 I read these social etiquette tips in a Denmark travel guide \u2013 four days into a 10-day trip. I\u2019d already blown it on day one. \u201cLook at that!\u201d I said to the couple opposite me in the hotel\u2019s below-ground sauna. A window looked on to the deep end of the outdoor pool. \u201cA human fish!\u201d Neither replied. But there is so much to talk about, starting with our hotel, the Bryggen Guldsmeden Eco Resort, a former shoe factory in Copenhagen\u2019s harbour-front neighbourhood of Islands Brygge. In the reception area there are trees (fake, tasteful) of pink blossom, deer heads (also fake), wicker hanging chairs, funky stained glass \u2013 and that sauna. And then there are the Balinese bedrooms, chic pool loungers, the Babette\u2019s Feast of a breakfast, and the silver bullet Airstream serving drinks by the pool. We\u2019re here on a family train and road trip, looking for a mix of urban culture, countryside and coast. After two days in Copenhagen on the island of Zealand, we drove up to the Danish Riviera before heading over to Jutland to explore the Danish Lake District and, finally, Aarhus, Denmark\u2019s terrific second city. Our first morning was well spent. We took in the Cisterns, an underground art space created in a former reservoir. We were fortunate to catch Start Again the Lament, a sound installation by Tarya Simon exploring death, loss and grief. We walked, in the half-light, down illuminated paths floating over water, to stirring recitations by professional mourners. Back in the light, we took a bus back to the centre and walked, via Nyhavn, the famous 17th-century harbour, to Nordre Toldbod waterfront, home to the buzzy seven-restaurant Seaside Toldboden complex. We drank margaritas and watched the yachts in the sunshine. The city has nailed the communal experience, whether it\u2019s eating and drinking or swimming in the canals or harbours. The Islands Brygge Harbour Bath, near our hotel, is a local favourite. That night we ate at Gaza Grill, a good-value Middle Eastern spot in Vesterbro\u2019s Meatpacking District. We got our indulgence fix the next night at the Nimb Hotel, a Moorish fantasia with a wonderful rooftop bar. It backs on to Tivoli Gardens amusement park and its glam brasserie offers French cuisine and ringside seats on to the park. What a contrast to the clean lines of the outstanding Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, a 40-minute train ride up the coast from Copenhagen. An 1870s villa and three modernist pavilions are set in a sculpture garden overlooking the sea. From there, we jumped on a 10-minute train ride up to Helsing\u00f8r\u2019s Kronborg Castle, the setting for Hamlet. As we made for the ramparts, the ghost scene ready to recite from one of our phones (this is Hamlet\u2019s gaff \u2013 it had to be done!), a pair of newlyweds from Japan were posing for photographs in white silk and black sunglasses, a skull, Yorick\u2019s presumably, held aloft. How fabulous tourists are, I thought, and gave them a rather unDanish cheer. It was an easy 60km drive through flat, open farmland up to the Danish Riviera on the north Zealand coast, our destination - the old fishing village of Tisvilde and the rarefied Helenkilde Badehotel. With its smart lunch terrace, porch with rattan furniture, comfy-chic living rooms and a panoramic sauna with sea views, this clifftop hotel whispers restraint. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got the vibe to be Danish,\u201d my younger son said over our candle-lit dinner that night in the hotel\u2019s lovely restaurant. I was stifling a giggle at the time. The naked, cuddling couple we\u2019d spotted earlier on the naturist beach from a raised walkway, had just walked in. I don\u2019t know why I found it funny to see them here, fully clothed, I just did. Not very Danish of me, I can see that now. The next day, after a rainy walk in Tisvilde Hegn pine forest, we warmed up with cinnamon buns and hot chocolate in Br\u00f8d &amp; Vin caf\u00e9 in the village. Fortified for the Lake District leg of our trip, we took the ferry from Odden to Aarhus on Jutland\u2019s east coast, and from there drove southwest for a night of fine dining at the Gastronomisk Institut in Ry\u2019s Knudehule Badehotel.

Here you\u2019ll find the Tollund Man bog body in the Silkeborg Museum, and Denmark\u2019s oldest paddle steamer, the Hjejlen. We scaled different heights with a visit to the circular rooftop installation by Olafur Eliasson at the ARoS Museum in Aarhus the next day, enjoying 360-degree views of this unsung port city. More circles spun their magic down at Aarhus Bay where the Infinite Bridge, a wooden circular fixture straddles beach and sea.

Shane Lowry, Adam Scott and France\u2019s Antoine Rozner shared third.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would have been miserable for a few weeks if I had not won today,\u201d the 35-year-old said. \u201cIt would have just added to the list of ones that I felt I let get away. For one to not get away and to get over the line and be the final event of the year, it feels nice.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was probably a lot of self-inflicted pressure. I really wanted to get it done. I love to end the year on a positive note. I was maybe feeling a little more pressure than I should have. But it was nice to be able to handle it in a decent way.\u201d</p> \n<p>It feels as if McIlroy\u2019s association with his home continent has strengthened in recent times. That feels significant, given the seemingly interminable delay between the PGA Tour and the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund formalising a peace deal to align elite golf. It could be that McIlroy feels more at home in the European domain. This Race to Dubai is his third in a row and moves him to within two of the record held by Colin Montgomerie.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve really made it a priority of my schedule over the last few years to give myself the best chance coming into the end of the year to win the Race to Dubai,\u201d the world No 3 said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that being any different for the foreseeable future. Going to go for my seventh next year and try to chase Monty down. It\u2019s been a long year. This was my 27th tournament, which is a lot to me. I am looking forward to a little bit of downtime.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was extra delight for McIlroy. Tom McKibbin, a 21-year-old from Belfast, earned his PGA Tour card courtesy of his season\u2019s efforts on the DP World Tour. McIlroy has offered huge help to McKibbin since he emerged as Northern Ireland\u2019s latest golfing star. \u201cHe\u2019s done amazingly well, and I think his game is going to be suited for America,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cHe hits the ball high. Hits it long. He won in Germany last year, he has had chances this year and he\u2019s been very, very consistent. For a guy that\u2019s only 21 to show that level of consistency, that bodes well for the future.\u201d</p>",

But it was nice to be able to handle it in a decent way.\u201d It feels as if McIlroy\u2019s association with his home continent has strengthened in recent times. That feels significant, given the seemingly interminable delay between the PGA Tour and the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund formalising a peace deal to align elite golf. It could be that McIlroy feels more at home in the European domain. This Race to Dubai is his third in a row and moves him to within two of the record held by Colin Montgomerie. \u201cI\u2019ve really made it a priority of my schedule over the last few years to give myself the best chance coming into the end of the year to win the Race to Dubai,\u201d the world No 3 said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that being any different for the foreseeable future. Going to go for my seventh next year and try to chase Monty down. It\u2019s been a long year. This was my 27th tournament, which is a lot to me. I am looking forward to a little bit of downtime.\u201d There was extra delight for McIlroy. Tom McKibbin, a 21-year-old from Belfast, earned his PGA Tour card courtesy of his season\u2019s efforts on the DP World Tour. McIlroy has offered huge help to McKibbin since he emerged as Northern Ireland\u2019s latest golfing star. \u201cHe\u2019s done amazingly well, and I think his game is going to be suited for America,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cHe hits the ball high. Hits it long. He won in Germany last year, he has had chances this year and he\u2019s been very, very consistent. For a guy that\u2019s only 21 to show that level of consistency, that bodes well for the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Hindu Sabha Mandir temple in the Canadian city of Brampton lies beside a busy road in a suburb where many homes are still strung with lights left over from Diwali. Standing over the parking lot, a 17-meter-tall statue of the monkey god Lord Hanuman gazes out over the traffic as worshippers come and go. A couple of minutes down the road, the Gurdwara Dasmesh Darbar Sikh temple sits near a strip mall with sari shops, Indian restaurants and other businesses indicative of the city\u2019s large south Asian population. Save for a few security guards at the Hindu temple, it would be hard to tell that this quiet residential neighbourhood was recently the site of violent clashes between Sikh activists and nationalist counterprotesters. The confrontation drew condemnation from the city\u2019s mayor, the premier of Ontario and Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau \u2013 and also from India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, who described the incident as an attack on the Hindu temple. So far, local police have made five arrests and say more may come. But as the dust settles, members of the local community say they fear further violence between Sikh separatist activists and Modi supporters, some of whom espouse Hindu nationalist ideologies. Videos of the overnight clashes on 3 November show men throwing bricks, kicking cars and striking each other with sticks or flagpoles \u2013 including some flying the Indian tricolour and others the bright yellow emblem adopted by advocates of an independent Sikh homeland known as Khalistan. The protests were prompted by a visit to the temple by Indian government officials who have been holding consular sessions at places of worship across Ontario, including Sikh temples. The 4 November visit came at a moment of high tension, soon after Canadian police and Trudeau\u2019s government alleged that Modi\u2019s government had orchestrated a campaign of violence and intimidation against Sikh activists in exile. Inderjeet Singh Gosal, a leader of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) who helped organize the demonstration, said the protest was specifically against the Indian government, not the Hindu religion, and that he had liaised with police to ensure it would not disrupt worship. Gosal was a close associate of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, another SFJ leader and Khalistan advocate whose 2023 assassination Canadian officials have linked to Indian diplomats and consular staff. The Khalistan movement is banned in India, where officials describe Sikh separatists as \u201cterrorists\u201d and a threat to national security. Gosal claimed that it was pro-Modi counterprotesters who instigated the violence, alleging that one of them had looked him in the face and told him in Hindi: \u201cWe\u2019re going to kill you.\u201d \u201cI went forward to him and said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\u2019 But before I could say anything they moved up and punched [me],\u201d he said. Peel regional police have since charged Gosal with assault with a weapon; he accepts he has been charged and has not yet entered a plea. The clashes escalated and later that night crowds waving Indian flags blocked traffic outside the temple. Video posted online shows a man with a megaphone drawing cheers from the group as he called for the Indian army to \u201cstorm\u201d Sikh temples in Canada, which he says are \u201cpromoting terrorism\u201d. Peel police confirmed the man had been charged with public incitement of hatred. Jaskaran Sandhu, a board member of the World Sikh Organization advocacy group, said such scenes were unprecedented in Canada, home to the largest Sikh population outside India. \u201cThis type of Hindu nationalist rhetoric is very normal in India, where minorities are targeted in this manner, but not in Canada. That\u2019s very disturbing,\u201d he said. Sandhu said that the unrest did not reflect tensions between Sikhs and Hindus, who have historically lived alongside each other in Brampton. \u201cWhat\u2019s different here is you have violent, pro-India, Hindu nationalist actors in this country,\u201d he said. Paritosh Kumar, an adjunct assistant professor of political science at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, said Hindu nationalists around the world have been emboldened by Modi\u2019s government \u2013 and that this has become an increasing concern in Canada. But he also said the ideology was attractive to some members of the diaspora who encountered racism in western countries. Kumar said academics in Canada have previously been harassed after denouncing Hindu nationalism, but the recent violence marked a serious escalation. \u201cThat seems like a very dangerous transition that is taking place,\u201d he said. Modi\u2019s framing of the protest as an attack on a Hindu temple by Sikhs may also further inflame the situation, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend that will probably manifest in more street violence,\u201d Kumar said. That worries Chinnaiah Jangam, an associate professor of history at Ottawa\u2019s Carleton University who focuses on Dalit peoples, considered the lowest rung of India\u2019s caste system. Jangam is a practicing Hindu and identifies as Dalit. After the protests in Brampton, relatives in India called him to see if he was safe \u2013 an indication of how successful Modi\u2019s supporters had been in casting the protests as an attack on Hindus. \u201cThey are playing into this idea of victimhood. It\u2019s a false narrative \u2026 and this is a part of a larger narrative to discredit [the Canadian government],\u201d Jangam said. Brampton city councillor Gurpartap Singh Toor said misinformation published in the Indian media or shared on WhatsApp had framed the unrest as a violent attack on the Hindu temple, fanning fear and hatred in both Canada and India. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see it happening here in our city. And then to pitch it as the Sikh community versus the Hindu community \u2013 it\u2019s just a gross injustice,\u201d he said. Roopnauth Sharma, the pandit at the Ram Mandir Hindu temple in the nearby city of Mississauga, said the unrest in Brampton did not reflect any broader sectarian tensions. \u201cThis is not a Hindu-Sikh issue \u2026 It is a group of people who have a certain opinion, and they\u2019re allowed to [express it],\u201d he said. Sharma, who is also the president of the Hindu Federation, said he had been working with local officials to create restrictions on demonstrations near places of worship. \u201cWe want to make sure people still have the right to protest \u2026 but we want to make sure there\u2019s a safe distance,\u201d he said. Leaders of the Hindu Sabha Mandir temple did not respond to a request for comment, but Vasudev Joshi, a pandit at the temple, told the Toronto Star that the protest should have been held outside the Indian consulate. Such sentiments were echoed by political leaders: Brampton\u2019s mayor, Patrick Brown, pushed for a bylaw that would ban protests at places of worship, while Trudeau said last week that acts of violence at the temple were \u201cunacceptable\u201d. But Sandhu said such statements miss the point. \u201cOur leaders are so quick to speak about mob violence \u2026 but have chosen to be absolutely silent on this India violence directed at the Canadian Sikh community,\u201d he said. \u201cAre the visuals not enough for you to realize what\u2019s happening in Canada?\u201d",

This is a woman who\u2019s been warding off media intrusion for most of her adult life. How is it going to feel to invite it all in?</p> <p>Of course there\u2019s the incentive of the plump paycheque. Rooney is being paid a record fee, reportedly more than \u00a31.5m. More than for either former pandemic health secretary Matt Hancock (who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/11/things-weve-learned-about-matt-hancock-im-a-celebrity\">appeared in 2022</a>) or now-MP and Reform UK leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/10/nigel-farage-finishes-third-in-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here\">Nigel Farage</a>, the divisive political figure whose signings prompted much criticism for ITV. Farage, in particular, provoked a&nbsp;backlash, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/dec/04/a-remarkably-bad-investment-is-it-curtains-for-im-a-celebrity\">two million fewer viewers</a> tuning in to watch last year\u2019s launch show.</p> <p>Now here\u2019s Rooney, 38, who\u2019s at an interesting pivotal point in her life and career \u2013 one that, arguably for the first time, is wholly and indisputably about her. How will the hyper-private and rigidly controlled Coleen Rooney deal with that?</p> <p>That said, Rooney is no fame rookie. Since becoming engaged as a Merseyside A-level student to Wayne at a petrol station in 2003, she\u2019s built her own multimillion-pound fortune in branding deals with the likes of Asda and Littlewoods. Her \u201cluxury item\u201d for the <em>I\u2019m a Celebrity</em> camp is reported to comprise collagen sachets from Applied Nutrition, for which she just happens to be brand ambassador.</p>    <p>However, it was in 2019 that Rooney\u2019s quasi-forensic Wagatha sleuthing (erupting with her Instagram post <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-rebekah-vardy-leaking-stories-sun\">accusing Vardy of selling stories about her</a> to the media) propelled her into a whole new cultural orbit. What could be termed Wagatha Inc has since sparked a book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/23/vardy-v-rooney-the-wagatha-christie-trial-review-wyndhams-theatre-london\">a play</a>, a 2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/21/vardy-v-rooney-a-courtroom-drama-review-wagatha-christie-channel-4#:~:text=Review-,Vardy%20v%20Rooney%3A%20A%20Courtroom%20Drama%20review%20%E2%80%93%20Peter%20Andre's%20',trouser%20equipment'%20is%20a%20highlight&amp;text=This%20drama%20is%20basically%20a,what%20more%20do%20you%20need%3F\">Channel 4 drama</a> (<em>Vardy V Rooney: A&nbsp;Courtroom Drama</em>) starring Michael Sheen, and a 2023 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/oct/18/coleen-rooney-the-real-wagatha-story-review-hour-after-hour-of-boredom\">Disney+ docuseries</a>, <em>Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story</em> (now to be shown on on ITVX and ITV2).</p> <p>If Wagatha is now sucked as dry as a half-time orange, one senses it isn\u2019t over for Vardy (as the <em>Sun</em>\u2019s guest columnist on Friday she said that she hopes Rooney eats \u201cbull\u2019s penis, ostrich bum and humble pie\u201d in the jungle). Wagatha also ushered in a New Age of Coleen, in which she became recalibrated in the public eye as composed, clever, determined. Yet, for all that, still curiously unknowable. Even in the docuseries, Rooney\u2019s most intimate venture yet, she comes across as a shyly smiling sphinx: sweet but guarded, consummately self-protective, as if poised waiting for the media to take a bite out of her again.</p> <p>If so, she could hardly be blamed. Beyond Wagatha, Rooney\u2019s core brand is the quintessential girl next door, the glossy end of ordinary, but at times it\u2019s turned dark. If there\u2019s any doubt that the British class system is still going strong in the 21st<sup> </sup>century, one only has to recall the snobbery meted out to the Rooneys\u2019 2008 multimillion-pound wedding (aided by a reputed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jun/12/celebrity\"> \u00a32.5m deal</a> from <em>OK!</em> magazine); to the choice of band (Westlife), the food (pizza), Coleen\u2019s three dresses and white \u00adstilettos; to the ceremony n Portofino, Italy. There were barely any famous&nbsp;guests, the couple asked for no gifts \u2013 just donations to a Liverpool \u00adchildren\u2019s hospice. Still, the wedding was \u00adportrayed by some as a&nbsp;full-on \u201cchav\u201d circus.</p> <p>Fast-forward through the years, and some of the same attitudes trickled through during the Wagatha trial. While certain details were irresistible (handily misplaced smartphones; poor Peter Andre\u2019s \u201cchipolata\u201d), it didn\u2019t take long for a retro whiff of Battle of the Chavs to start weaving its way in.</p> <p>It is, after all, how certain sectors of the British press and public like to think of women of \u00adworking-class origin \u2013 that, when push comes to&nbsp;shove, they\u2019re as common as muck, and you can goad them into a&nbsp;cat fight.</p>    <p>Never mind that Rooney has publicly stated she didn\u2019t like how Vardy was trolled. Nor that, for her, Wagatha hinged on the fundamental matter of protecting her family\u2019s privacy. Nor even that Coleen Mary McLoughlin, as she was, came from a loving close-knit family, and before leaving school to be with Wayne, she was a bright schoolgirl who got 10 GCSEs. But who needs such trifling details when there\u2019s a fight going down between two Wags, and all that popcorn and schadenfreude to enjoy?</p> <p>Rooney\u2019s ordinary-girl appeal may be where things get sticky for her on <em>I\u2019m a Celebrity</em>. In this specific stratum of fame, it\u2019s all about monetising your relatability, the dark art of \u201copening up\u201d, which doesn\u2019t seem to be her strength at all. How could it be when she is a walking mass of scar tissue? Chiefly from the various media frenzies surrounding her husband\u2019s various past infidelities, including drunken trips to brothels.</p> <p>For Rooney, this resulted in a dual media profile: on the one hand, our long-suffering lady of the football premiership; on the other, the calculating gold digger who couldn\u2019t bear to give up her \u201cglamorous lifestyle\u201d \u2026 of what? Full-time motherhood and flexitime tabloid abuse? Years on, was any of the mockery, castigation and judgment warranted? Was it motherhood, or, more precisely her powerful sense of family, that kept Rooney in the marriage at that point?</p> <p>Even as Rooney went into the jungle, there were reports of her attempting to micromanage her sons\u2019 lives while she was away, to the point of leaving detailed instructions <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20g88g27xjo\">on a whiteboard</a>. How many mothers arched a weary knowing brow hearing of such dogged remote mum-ing and near-militaristic future-proofing? It is in such details you sense you\u2019re getting the clearest view yet of Rooney\u2019s true core values and non-negotiables.</p>    <p>For his part, is Wayne \u2013 now managing Plymouth Argyle \u2013 still the dark blot of Coleen\u2019s story? Arguably he underwent his own reputational New Man-rehab during the Wagatha trial: supporting his wife, even carrying her tote bag into court as she struggled with an injured foot. Against considerable odds, something strong and sweet is emerging&nbsp;from their couple dynamic that isn\u2019t always a given with high-profile football couples. Is it just me, or does David Beckham sometimes give off the air that he thinks he\u2019s better than his wife? If this once also&nbsp;seemed true of Wayne, it doesn\u2019t any more. You get the impression the Rooneys respect and support each other, that they have a marriage of equals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/28/wagatha-christie-vardy-v-rooney-celebrity-trial\">\u2018High drama, with the lowest stakes\u2019 \u2013 what really happened at the Wagatha Christie trial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for Rooney\u2019s reality TV adventure, shows like <em>I\u2019m a </em><em>Celebrity</em> run on Big Personalities.

Farage, in particular, provoked a backlash, with two million fewer viewers tuning in to watch last year\u2019s launch show. Now here\u2019s Rooney, 38, who\u2019s at an interesting pivotal point in her life and career \u2013 one that, arguably for the first time, is wholly and indisputably about her. How will the hyper-private and rigidly controlled Coleen Rooney deal with that? That said, Rooney is no fame rookie. Since becoming engaged as a Merseyside A-level student to Wayne at a petrol station in 2003, she\u2019s built her own multimillion-pound fortune in branding deals with the likes of Asda and Littlewoods. Her \u201cluxury item\u201d for the I\u2019m a Celebrity camp is reported to comprise collagen sachets from Applied Nutrition, for which she just happens to be brand ambassador. However, it was in 2019 that Rooney\u2019s quasi-forensic Wagatha sleuthing (erupting with her Instagram post accusing Vardy of selling stories about her to the media) propelled her into a whole new cultural orbit. What could be termed Wagatha Inc has since sparked a book, a play, a 2022 Channel 4 drama (Vardy V Rooney: A Courtroom Drama) starring Michael Sheen, and a 2023 Disney+ docuseries, Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story (now to be shown on on ITVX and ITV2). If Wagatha is now sucked as dry as a half-time orange, one senses it isn\u2019t over for Vardy (as the Sun\u2019s guest columnist on Friday she said that she hopes Rooney eats \u201cbull\u2019s penis, ostrich bum and humble pie\u201d in the jungle). Wagatha also ushered in a New Age of Coleen, in which she became recalibrated in the public eye as composed, clever, determined. Yet, for all that, still curiously unknowable. Even in the docuseries, Rooney\u2019s most intimate venture yet, she comes across as a shyly smiling sphinx: sweet but guarded, consummately self-protective, as if poised waiting for the media to take a bite out of her again. If so, she could hardly be blamed. Beyond Wagatha, Rooney\u2019s core brand is the quintessential girl next door, the glossy end of ordinary, but at times it\u2019s turned dark. If there\u2019s any doubt that the British class system is still going strong in the 21st century, one only has to recall the snobbery meted out to the Rooneys\u2019 2008 multimillion-pound wedding (aided by a reputed \u00a32.5m deal from OK! magazine); to the choice of band (Westlife), the food (pizza), Coleen\u2019s three dresses and white stilettos; to the ceremony n Portofino, Italy. There were barely any famous guests, the couple asked for no gifts \u2013 just donations to a Liverpool children\u2019s hospice. Still, the wedding was portrayed by some as a full-on \u201cchav\u201d circus. Fast-forward through the years, and some of the same attitudes trickled through during the Wagatha trial. While certain details were irresistible (handily misplaced smartphones; poor Peter Andre\u2019s \u201cchipolata\u201d), it didn\u2019t take long for a retro whiff of Battle of the Chavs to start weaving its way in. It is, after all, how certain sectors of the British press and public like to think of women of working-class origin \u2013 that, when push comes to shove, they\u2019re as common as muck, and you can goad them into a cat fight. Never mind that Rooney has publicly stated she didn\u2019t like how Vardy was trolled. Nor that, for her, Wagatha hinged on the fundamental matter of protecting her family\u2019s privacy. Nor even that Coleen Mary McLoughlin, as she was, came from a loving close-knit family, and before leaving school to be with Wayne, she was a bright schoolgirl who got 10 GCSEs. But who needs such trifling details when there\u2019s a fight going down between two Wags, and all that popcorn and schadenfreude to enjoy? Rooney\u2019s ordinary-girl appeal may be where things get sticky for her on I\u2019m a Celebrity. In this specific stratum of fame, it\u2019s all about monetising your relatability, the dark art of \u201copening up\u201d, which doesn\u2019t seem to be her strength at all. How could it be when she is a walking mass of scar tissue? Chiefly from the various media frenzies surrounding her husband\u2019s various past infidelities, including drunken trips to brothels. For Rooney, this resulted in a dual media profile: on the one hand, our long-suffering lady of the football premiership; on the other, the calculating gold digger who couldn\u2019t bear to give up her \u201cglamorous lifestyle\u201d \u2026 of what? Full-time motherhood and flexitime tabloid abuse? Years on, was any of the mockery, castigation and judgment warranted? Was it motherhood, or, more precisely her powerful sense of family, that kept Rooney in the marriage at that point? Even as Rooney went into the jungle, there were reports of her attempting to micromanage her sons\u2019 lives while she was away, to the point of leaving detailed instructions on a whiteboard. How many mothers arched a weary knowing brow hearing of such dogged remote mum-ing and near-militaristic future-proofing? It is in such details you sense you\u2019re getting the clearest view yet of Rooney\u2019s true core values and non-negotiables. For his part, is Wayne \u2013 now managing Plymouth Argyle \u2013 still the dark blot of Coleen\u2019s story? Arguably he underwent his own reputational New Man-rehab during the Wagatha trial: supporting his wife, even carrying her tote bag into court as she struggled with an injured foot. Against considerable odds, something strong and sweet is emerging from their couple dynamic that isn\u2019t always a given with high-profile football couples. Is it just me, or does David Beckham sometimes give off the air that he thinks he\u2019s better than his wife? If this once also seemed true of Wayne, it doesn\u2019t any more. You get the impression the Rooneys respect and support each other, that they have a marriage of equals. As for Rooney\u2019s reality TV adventure, shows like I\u2019m a Celebrity run on Big Personalities. Despite her eye-watering fee, it is quite feasible she is considered too quiet and stiff (and, worse, discreet) and gets booted off early. Though arguably she earned her fee before she even set foot into camp \u2013 in that her involvement, and the attention it\u2019s attracted, has amounted to a reality television laundering of the show\u2019s increasingly dubious flirtation with controversial politicos. Still, you can\u2019t help wondering whether, if Strictly Come Dancing hadn\u2019t been mired in sundry difficulties, it might have been a better (less personally exposing) fit for the desperately private Mrs Rooney. Or is this tough, resourceful canny Coleen being underestimated yet again? And there\u2019s nothing to stop her turning her flavour of glowed-up ultra-ordinary into an even bigger brand. Wagatha Christie showed another side of Rooney \u2013 that she isn\u2019t so neutral or vanilla, that this most atypical of footballers\u2019 wives had bite. The jungle may reveal yet another.",

She\u2019s a fighter, progressive, and she loves democracy.\u201d</p> <p>A Dominican Uber driver called Robin said Trump was better on the economy and security, but Ocasio-Cortez was better on democracy. \u201cThe last three years were no good economically: half a million migrants coming to New York, being given a hotel and money, and me working 60 hours a week with three kids.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, Ocasio-Cortez herself prodded her own followers on X \u2013 the social media platform formerly known as Twitter \u2013 about vote-splitting between her and Trump. \u201cI actually want to learn from you, I want to hear what you were thinking,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Many in response to her appeal said there was no contradiction between supporting Trump and the avowed Democratic socialist.</p> <p>\u201cI feel you are both outsiders compared to the rest of DC, and less \u2018establishment\u2019,\u201d said one. Another, \u201cboth of you push boundaries and force growth\u201d. And: \u201cIt\u2019s real simple \u2026 Trump and you care for the working class.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are focused on the real issues people care about. Similar to Trump populism in some ways,\u201d said a fourth. Lastly, a respondent said: \u201cYou signaled change. Trump signified change. I\u2019ve said lately, Trump sounds more like you.\u201d</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez told The View on Thursday: \u201cOne, there is universal frustration in this country, much of it I actually think justified, that is raging at a political establishment that centers corporate interests [and] billionaires. and puts their needs ahead of the needs of working Americans.\u201d</p> <p>The exchanges on X prompted whoops of joy from<a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/11/2028-democrats-presidential-primary-election-aoc-ocasio-cortez.html\"> Salon</a>, a liberal-leaning outlet, which said there might now be an openness among bruised Democrats to \u201csomeone who simply has the sauce \u2026 And Ocasio-Cortez has the sauce.\u201d</p>    <p>To some extent, the Bronx split-ticket vote phenomenon was repeated across the US. Republicans won the White House and Senate convincingly. But in the House of Representatives, Democrats more or less held their own. (Split-ticket voting had an impact but it still left the House narrowly under Republican control.)</p> <p>\u201cPeople are looking for people to shake up the system and fight for a bold agenda so they\u2019re voting for candidates who are different and have a clear agenda outside the norms of our political system,\u201d said Jasmine Gripper, co-director of the New York Working Families party.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is not a career politician and challenges the system, and AOC is doing that in a different way. Their approaches and philosophies and values are deeply different, but they both represent a change from the status quo that voters are rejecting.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Trump was one of the first to recognize AOC\u2019s rise, warning Joe Crowley, the 10-term Democrat she defeated for the nomination, of her natural political abilities. Crowley later reflected that Trump\u2019s win two years earlier had helped to get Ocasio-Cortez elected.</p> <p>\u201cIt lit the fire on to the base of our party, and I think that\u2019s a good thing in many respects,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Trump and Ocasio-Cortez, native New Yorkers and Democrats in their origin stories, have often appeared to be perfect sparring partners, with an innate understanding of how to get under the other\u2019s skin, and clapping back at each other on social media (AOC has 8.1 million Instagram followers).</p> <p>She has called Trump a \u201cracist visionary\u201d and said he is \u201cafraid\u201d of strong Latino women. He has insulted her right back, though mixed with compliments. \u201cLook, she\u2019s a fake, and in all fairness to her, she knows it. But she\u2019s got a good thing going \u2013 a good thing for her,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9rtoy8BW_Y\">said</a> in August. \u201cShe\u2019s got a spark \u2013 I will say that. A good spark that\u2019s pretty amazing, actually.\u201d</p> <p>Both know the value of a political stunt. AOC wore a white gown with the message \u201ctax the rich\u201d emblazoned in red to the Met Gala, where tables cost $450,000. \u201cThe medium is the message,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CTybzXHAHYh/\">wrote on Instagram</a>, quoting the Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan.</p> <p>But the Democrat\u2019s ultra-progressive group in Congress, known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d, did not fare so well under the softer liberalism of the Biden-Harris administration. Two of the group no longer sit in the House. Despite that, Ocasio-Cortez was a good soldier for Harris and before her, Joe Biden, supporting and enthusiastically campaigning for both.</p> <p>But its too soon to say how much progressives are encouraged by the phenomenon of split-ticket voting and whether it will presage a tack away from traditional party elites, as the Democrats try to regroup in the political wilderness of the next four years. Certainly there are those who think the party needs a dose of economic populism and charismatic outsiders to lead it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is we have to compete in a new information environment that Trump understands, the Democrats struggle with, and AOC is a genius at,\u201d said Billy Wimsatt of the Movement Voter Project. \u201cWe need candidates and leaders that people believe in and see as authentic and not as a manufactured politicians.\u201d</p> <p>But what might be more worrying for Democrats are people like 30-year-old Bronx resident Carlos Thomas. \u201cI was rooting for Donald because he\u2019s for business, but I liked the girl he was running against [also],\u201d he said.</p> <p>But he \u2013 like tens of millions of other Americans in an election that saw <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/projects/2024-us-president-election-live-updates-harris-trump/?article_anchor=us-presidential-election-2024-voter-turnout-comparison\">turnout drop</a> \u2013 simply failed to vote.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2024 to remove a reference to Ocasio-Cortez removing her pronouns from her X bio after the election. This is incorrect; Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://x.com/AOC/status/1857858341629829537\">said</a> she removed them \u201ca long time ago after the SCOTUS Twitter ruling\u201d.</p>",

(Split-ticket voting had an impact but it still left the House narrowly under Republican control.) \u201cPeople are looking for people to shake up the system and fight for a bold agenda so they\u2019re voting for candidates who are different and have a clear agenda outside the norms of our political system,\u201d said Jasmine Gripper, co-director of the New York Working Families party. \u201cTrump is not a career politician and challenges the system, and AOC is doing that in a different way. Their approaches and philosophies and values are deeply different, but they both represent a change from the status quo that voters are rejecting.\u201d In 2018, Trump was one of the first to recognize AOC\u2019s rise, warning Joe Crowley, the 10-term Democrat she defeated for the nomination, of her natural political abilities. Crowley later reflected that Trump\u2019s win two years earlier had helped to get Ocasio-Cortez elected. \u201cIt lit the fire on to the base of our party, and I think that\u2019s a good thing in many respects,\u201d he said. Trump and Ocasio-Cortez, native New Yorkers and Democrats in their origin stories, have often appeared to be perfect sparring partners, with an innate understanding of how to get under the other\u2019s skin, and clapping back at each other on social media (AOC has 8.1 million Instagram followers). She has called Trump a \u201cracist visionary\u201d and said he is \u201cafraid\u201d of strong Latino women. He has insulted her right back, though mixed with compliments. \u201cLook, she\u2019s a fake, and in all fairness to her, she knows it. But she\u2019s got a good thing going \u2013 a good thing for her,\u201d Trump said in August. \u201cShe\u2019s got a spark \u2013 I will say that. A good spark that\u2019s pretty amazing, actually.\u201d Both know the value of a political stunt. AOC wore a white gown with the message \u201ctax the rich\u201d emblazoned in red to the Met Gala, where tables cost $450,000. \u201cThe medium is the message,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Instagram, quoting the Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan. But the Democrat\u2019s ultra-progressive group in Congress, known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d, did not fare so well under the softer liberalism of the Biden-Harris administration. Two of the group no longer sit in the House. Despite that, Ocasio-Cortez was a good soldier for Harris and before her, Joe Biden, supporting and enthusiastically campaigning for both. But its too soon to say how much progressives are encouraged by the phenomenon of split-ticket voting and whether it will presage a tack away from traditional party elites, as the Democrats try to regroup in the political wilderness of the next four years. Certainly there are those who think the party needs a dose of economic populism and charismatic outsiders to lead it. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is we have to compete in a new information environment that Trump understands, the Democrats struggle with, and AOC is a genius at,\u201d said Billy Wimsatt of the Movement Voter Project. \u201cWe need candidates and leaders that people believe in and see as authentic and not as a manufactured politicians.\u201d But what might be more worrying for Democrats are people like 30-year-old Bronx resident Carlos Thomas. \u201cI was rooting for Donald because he\u2019s for business, but I liked the girl he was running against [also],\u201d he said. But he \u2013 like tens of millions of other Americans in an election that saw turnout drop \u2013 simply failed to vote. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2024 to remove a reference to Ocasio-Cortez removing her pronouns from her X bio after the election. This is incorrect; Ocasio-Cortez said she removed them \u201ca long time ago after the SCOTUS Twitter ruling\u201d.",

Anger arising from the budget measures is also threatening splits in the farming community over the best way for food producers to voice their collective discontent. Five farmers, who came together on budget day in a WhatsApp group chat called APR BPR, are bringing thousands more food producers to London on Tuesday to a rally which they insist is a \u201ccomplement\u201d to the NFU\u2019s political lobbying.

The moves were met with backlashes from employees who signed petitions, sent public letters to their CEOs, complained to the press and on social media, and even went on strike.</p> <p>You would think that I, a business owner, would agree with the executives at those companies. I don\u2019t. Those employees are right and their bosses are making a big mistake. The reality today is that you can\u2019t mandate people to come into the office. Here\u2019s why.</p> <p><strong>Working from home is an employee benefit.</strong></p> <p>Ask any HR expert and they\u2019ll tell you that once a benefit is given, it\u2019s extremely difficult to claw it back. Any benefit \u2013 including the ability to work from home \u2013 is a form of compensation. Employees may have chosen to work at a company because of its remote working benefits. Others may have elected to stay at the company for the same reason. Taking away these benefits is like cutting an employee\u2019s pay. It\u2019s not good policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/03/small-business-pennsylvania-us-election\">Small business in Pennsylvania is middling \u2013 will that affect the vote?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Too many companies are offering this benefit.</strong></p> <p>Working from home is flexibility and flexibility has become one of the top benefits requested by employees. As such, many companies \u2013 as much as 71%, according to <a href=\"https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work/2023\">one study</a> \u2013 have recognized this and offer a work-from-home benefit. People love it. Taking this benefit away means you\u2019re no longer offering something that most of your competitors are offering, which puts you at a significant disadvantage.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s easy to quantify the upsides, hard to quantify the downsides.</strong></p> <p>Working from home has very tangible advantages. Among them: more flexibility, more time around loved ones, better control over one\u2019s hours, improved mental health, lower commute costs, less of a carbon footprint. And \u2013 what we found during the pandemic \u2013 is that even when employees are working from home, their jobs get done. Of course working in the office has its upsides: It improves culture, fosters innovation and provides mentorship. But \u2013 same as working from home - the job also gets done. The problem is that no one can specifically quantify which arrangement works better. Because proving this difference is difficult, making the case for mandating employees to commute to the office is a harder sell.</p> <p><strong>Working from home is appreciated across all generations.</strong></p> <p>Working from home isn\u2019t just a younger person\u2019s demand. Turns out it\u2019s extremely popular among older people too. A friend of mine who manages a large accounting firm said that the biggest pushback he gets from requiring people to come into the office comes from his older partners, not his staff. \u201cThey\u2019ve been slogging it for 25 years and now they want a better balance,\u201d he said to me. \u201cThey were the ones who resisted the most before Covid; now they\u2019re the biggest opponents of returning to the office.\u201d When the older, more experienced workers are the ones who are pushing for more home time, it\u2019s tough to push back.</p> <p>Most of my clients \u2013 small and mid-sized companies \u2013 have hybrid plans that allow their employees to work from their homes one or two days a week. They get it. But for those that are still sticking to the be-in-the-office-every-day-or-else policy, here\u2019s my advice: adapting to this new reality isn\u2019t as hard as you think. There\u2019s no need to have a company-wide policy on this issue. You don\u2019t have to get into public fights with your employees. Be smart: push the issue down to your management.</p> <p>If your managers are comfortable with team members working from home and they\u2019re still meeting their quotas, deliverables and promises, then who are you to argue? If a manager feels that they can run their team better in a face-to-face environment, then that\u2019s their prerogative. As a CEO or owner, you want results. You don\u2019t care how or where the work is getting done, just as long as it\u2019s getting done.</p> <p>It surprises me that these large companies are mandating a return-to-office policy. They\u2019ve invested heavily in processes, structure and strong management teams to run their teams. If I were the CEO of any of these organizations, I\u2019d punt the work-from-home issue to the people who know their own people the best and let them decide on the issue. Don\u2019t they have more important things to worry about?</p> <p>On the other hand, watching these big companies fumble the ball is enjoyable. As a small business owner who competes for talent with them, I say: go ahead, take that benefit away. Make your employees angry enough to look for other, better places to work. By doing so you\u2019re helping me.</p>",

The reality today is that you can\u2019t mandate people to come into the office. Here\u2019s why. Working from home is an employee benefit. Ask any HR expert and they\u2019ll tell you that once a benefit is given, it\u2019s extremely difficult to claw it back. Any benefit \u2013 including the ability to work from home \u2013 is a form of compensation. Employees may have chosen to work at a company because of its remote working benefits. Others may have elected to stay at the company for the same reason. Taking away these benefits is like cutting an employee\u2019s pay. It\u2019s not good policy. Too many companies are offering this benefit. Working from home is flexibility and flexibility has become one of the top benefits requested by employees. As such, many companies \u2013 as much as 71%, according to one study \u2013 have recognized this and offer a work-from-home benefit. People love it. Taking this benefit away means you\u2019re no longer offering something that most of your competitors are offering, which puts you at a significant disadvantage. It\u2019s easy to quantify the upsides, hard to quantify the downsides. Working from home has very tangible advantages. Among them: more flexibility, more time around loved ones, better control over one\u2019s hours, improved mental health, lower commute costs, less of a carbon footprint. And \u2013 what we found during the pandemic \u2013 is that even when employees are working from home, their jobs get done. Of course working in the office has its upsides: It improves culture, fosters innovation and provides mentorship. But \u2013 same as working from home - the job also gets done. The problem is that no one can specifically quantify which arrangement works better. Because proving this difference is difficult, making the case for mandating employees to commute to the office is a harder sell. Working from home is appreciated across all generations. Working from home isn\u2019t just a younger person\u2019s demand. Turns out it\u2019s extremely popular among older people too. A friend of mine who manages a large accounting firm said that the biggest pushback he gets from requiring people to come into the office comes from his older partners, not his staff. \u201cThey\u2019ve been slogging it for 25 years and now they want a better balance,\u201d he said to me. \u201cThey were the ones who resisted the most before Covid; now they\u2019re the biggest opponents of returning to the office.\u201d When the older, more experienced workers are the ones who are pushing for more home time, it\u2019s tough to push back. Most of my clients \u2013 small and mid-sized companies \u2013 have hybrid plans that allow their employees to work from their homes one or two days a week. They get it. But for those that are still sticking to the be-in-the-office-every-day-or-else policy, here\u2019s my advice: adapting to this new reality isn\u2019t as hard as you think. There\u2019s no need to have a company-wide policy on this issue. You don\u2019t have to get into public fights with your employees. Be smart: push the issue down to your management. If your managers are comfortable with team members working from home and they\u2019re still meeting their quotas, deliverables and promises, then who are you to argue? If a manager feels that they can run their team better in a face-to-face environment, then that\u2019s their prerogative. As a CEO or owner, you want results. You don\u2019t care how or where the work is getting done, just as long as it\u2019s getting done. It surprises me that these large companies are mandating a return-to-office policy. They\u2019ve invested heavily in processes, structure and strong management teams to run their teams. If I were the CEO of any of these organizations, I\u2019d punt the work-from-home issue to the people who know their own people the best and let them decide on the issue. Don\u2019t they have more important things to worry about? On the other hand, watching these big companies fumble the ball is enjoyable. As a small business owner who competes for talent with them, I say: go ahead, take that benefit away. Make your employees angry enough to look for other, better places to work. By doing so you\u2019re helping me.",

Even when the location shifts fleetingly to America, where Wywrot\u2019s parents live, the expressionist mood is sustained in dreamlike landscapes of lakes, trees and beaches that look bleakly beautiful in the manner of early, monochrome Jim Jarmusch movies.

I think all the elements that form my distinctive style are rooted in my childhood, when I experienced the world in vivid pictures. I loved to watch the changing light through the day, but with the camera I try to speak not with light, but darkness.\u201d</p>    <p>Before she turned to photography, she was a working musician, playing the clarinet and guitar in a quartet that performed classical, swing jazz and what she calls \u201cvery modern music\u201d. She met Pestka\u2019s father, who was 23 years older then her, when she was finishing high school, and they were married when she was just 19. Unsurprisingly, it did not work out and she moved with her young daughter to Krak\u00f3w.

I documented things just like any mother would but I wouldn\u2019t call it photography. My photographic awareness \u2013 the understanding that photography could be a medium for self-expression \u2013 came later, when I realised I could \u2018write\u2019 by photographing.\u201d</p>    <p>The mysteriously expressive narrative that Wywrot has created through her images is in one profound way a reflection of the deep bond between mother and daughter, but it is also rooted in the creatively imaginative environment she created for their collaboration to flower. That, in itself, was an act of defiant self-determination, as Wywrot makes clear.</p> <p>\u201cI was told by so many photographers, \u2018Do not touch this subject of your daughter. The family is sacred.\u2019 But I thought, I can do this, I can go outside the one-dimensional portrait of the smiling, always happy daughter and make something more challenging and difficult. I can try to reflect the turbulence inside.\u201d</p>    <p>Her daughter takes over. \u201cThere is a saying in Poland \u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone what is going on inside your house<em>\u2019.</em> It\u2019s a traditional cultural thing that is deep-rooted, but Mum was a rebel.\u201d She sounds proud.</p> <p>\u201cPhotography, for me, is a sort of fever,\u201d Wywrot concludes. \u201cI never know when I will take a picture.

      "bodyText": "The announcement that Donald Trump has appointed Robert F Kennedy as the US secretary of health and human services has sent shock waves through the health and scientific community. Kennedy ran as an independent presidential candidate before bowing out and supporting Trump\u2019s run in exchange for an influential position, so we have a pretty good idea of his positions on public health. The main goal Kennedy has trumpeted recently is to \u201cMake America healthy again\u201d. At face value, it\u2019s a noble aim. That\u2019s the essence of public health: how to reduce risk factors for disease and mortality at a population level and improve the quality of health and wellbeing. But behind this slogan comes a darker, conspiracy-laden agenda. As someone who has spent a lot of time researching global public health, these are the positions I believe could be the most dangerous. Anti-vaxxer views Kennedy is well known as a prominent anti-vaxxer. He has claimed that vaccines can cause autism, and also said that \u201cthere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d. He called the Covid-19 vaccine the \u201cdeadliest vaccine ever made\u201d. None of these claims are true: repeat studies have shown that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism, we have numerous safe and effective vaccines against childhood killers such as whooping cough and measles, and the Covid-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives globally. Much of what he is saying is what people want to hear: being anti-vax is increasingly a way to build a fanbase. I have seen this as a scientist: if you talk about childhood vaccinations, you get daily abuse.

Eliminate research into new vaccines? With avian flu continuing to spread in mammals and birds, will he support the stockpiling and rollout of H5N1 vaccines if necessary in a future outbreak or pandemic? If his appointment is approved, experts say that vaccines will be \u201cthe first issue on the table\u201d. The \u201cbenefits\u201d of raw milk Similarly, he has tweeted about the benefits of raw milk, which has become a bizarre Maga talking point generally. Raw milk consumption is a risk factor for a number of dangerous illnesses from E coli to salmonella, but is even more worrying with the widespread infection of dairy herds in the US. While pasteurisation has been shown to kill the H5N1 virus in milk and prevent its ability to infect, raw milk retains its pathogens.

Seven people have been killed in Ukraine as Russia launched a barrage of air and drone strikes in the early hours of Sunday morning. More than 200 strikes hit areas including the capital Kyiv, with Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure the main focus of Russia\u2019s attack. The strikes were the largest aerial assault since August. DTEK, Ukraine\u2019s largest private energy provider said it had \u201cseriously damaged\u201d equipment at thermal power stations. Emergency power cuts were put into place in Kyiv, Donetsk and the Dnipropetrovsk regions. People were killed in Lviv, Dnipropetovsk, Odesa and Mykolaiv. Dozens have been injured. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy sent his \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the families of victims. Meanwhile two people have been killed in Ukrainian drone strikes on the Belgorod and Kursk regions. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said Vladimir Putin has not shifted in his thinking about the war in Ukraine. A march by the Russian opposition in exile will begin at 1pm on Sunday in Berlin. The Guardian\u2019s Defence and Security editor Dan Sabbagh has the latest on the airstrikes here One person has been killed and two injured in Russia\u2019s Kursk region by a Ukrainian drone attack on Sunday. Regional governor Alexei Smirnov said on the Telegram messaging app that the victims were journalists, who worked for the Bolshesoldatsky District newspaper. Vladimir Putin has not shifted in his thinking on the war in Ukraine, according to the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who defended his much-criticised decision to phone the Kremlin. Speaking from Berlin airport on Sunday, immediately before his departure for the G20 summit in Brazil, Scholz said it had been worth talking to Putin to dispel any illusions he might harbour that the West was about to abandon its support for Ukraine. He added, with reference to Donald Trump\u2019s imminent return to the US presidency, that it would also not be good if Washington were in regular contact with Putin while no European leader was. \u201cThe conversation was very detailed but contributed to a recognition that little has changed in the Russian President\u2019s views of the war \u2013 and that\u2019s not good news,\u201d Scholz told reporters, according to Reuters. One person has been killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian border region of Belgorod, the region\u2019s governor has announced. Vyacheslav Gladkov, said one person was killed in the Ukrainian drone attack on Russia\u2019s border region of Belgorod on Sunday morning. The exiled Russian opposition will hold its first major demonstration against the invasion of Ukraine, in Berlin on Sunday afternoon. The Russian opposition lost its main figurehead in February, when Putin\u2019s rival Alexei Navalny died in an Arctic prison in mysterious circumstances. Yulia Navalnaya, his widow who took the helm of the movement, is one of the main organisers of the march, according to Agence France-Presse. Unable to operate at home, the opposition is forced to relaunch abroad, where hundreds of thousands of Russians fled in the aftermath of the February 2022 invasion. The march will take place in Berlin, which is home to thousands of anti-Putin Russians and Ukrainian refugees. It is due to begin at 1pm in central Berlin and will end outside the Russian embassy. Navalnaya is joining forces with two other oppositionists for the rally: former Moscow city councillor and longtime anti-Putin campaigner Ilya Yashin and British-Russian activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who survived two poisoning attempts. Both Yashin and Kara-Murza were freed from prison \u2013 where they served sentences for denouncing the Ukrainian invasion \u2013 after a prisoner swap with the West this summer. \u201cThe march aims to unite everyone who stands against Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggressive war in Ukraine and political repressions in Russia,\u201d the organisers said in a statement. The opposition says it has three main demands: the \u201cimmediate withdrawal\u201d of troops from Ukraine, the trial of Putin as a \u201cwar criminal\u201d and the liberation of all political prisoners in Russia. The Kremlin, which has painted oppositionists as traitors, has dismissed the march as insignificant. Its spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the march organisers \u201cmonstrously detached from their country\u201d and said \u201ctheir opinion has no importance\u201d. Ukrainian air defences destroyed 102 missiles and 42 drones launched by Russia during its latest overnight airstrike, Kyiv\u2019s air force said on Sunday. According to Reuters, it said that Russian forces had launched a total of 120 missiles of various types, including hypersonic ones, and 90 drones across Ukraine. Some more details from the air strikes overnight on Ukraine, as further casualty figures have been released. Two people were killed in an attack on a rail depot in the Dnipropetrovsk region of central Ukraine, Reuters reports. Meanwhile in Lviv, near the border with Poland, a woman in a car was killed by the attack according to the region\u2019s governor. Another two people were also killed in the southern Odesa area. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy had already announced that two people had died in the southern Mykolaiv region during the barrage from Russia. Here are some photos of the aftermath of the airstrikes in Ukraine overnight. Another 1,640 Russia troops were killed in the last 24 hours, the Ukrainian armed forces have announced. According to the daily statistics, which have not been verified by the Guardian, about 720,880 Russian personnel have been killed since the invasion on February 2022. This was reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook. Additionally, the Ukrainian Defense Forces have destroyed another 12 Tanks, and 60 drones.

Russia\u2019s relentless aerial bombardment with missiles and drones has destroyed half of Ukraine\u2019s energy production capacity, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously said. Kyiv has implored its western allies for help in rebuilding its energy grid \u2013 a hugely expensive undertaking \u2013 and to supply its forces with more aerial defence weapons. With the harsh Ukrainian winter fast approaching, the country is already suffering from major energy shortfalls. A drone crashed into a factory workshop in west-central Russia, causing an explosion and injuring one person, the head of Udmurtia republic said on Sunday. \u201cThere was no serious damage,\u201d Alexander Brechalov said on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cUnfortunately, one person was injured. He\u2019s been hospitalised - his condition is moderate.\u201d Blasts could be heard in Kyiv in the early hours of Sunday morning after the aerial attack by Russian forces. A roof of a residential building in the country\u2019s capital was set alight by the missile and drone strike, the city\u2019s mayor Vitali Klitschko said. One woman was taken to hospital after a drone fragment hit another apartment block, he added. Missiles also hit the regions of Lviv, Volyn, Rivne and Zaporizhzhia, with energy infrastructure the main target. Poland scrambled aircraft to monitor its borders after the strikes were launched, its air force announced. Ukraine\u2019s largest private energy provider says that the early morning Russian air strikes on Ukraine\u2019s power infrastructure has \u201cseriously damaged\u201d equipment at thermal power stations. In a statement on X, DTEK said its employees were working on repairing the equipment, but did not specify what exactly had been hit. It said it is assessing the extent of the damage and information about casualties. DTEK added its thermal power plants have been shelled more than 190 times since the start of the conflict in February 2022. Russia has launched a \u201cmassive\u201d air strike on Ukraine\u2019s energy system in the early hours of Sunday morning, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said. Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces have fired about 120 missiles and 90 drones, Reuters reported. Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s air defences had downed about 140 of them. Two people were killed in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, by a drone attack. Six others were injured, including two children. \u201cThe enemy\u2019s target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from strikes and falling debris,\u201d he said in a statement on social media.

It\u2019s not quite a direct transposition: projected credits during the introduction, and at the close, tell us that what we are meant to be watching is a 1960s or 70s sitcom, made by \u201cENOTV\u201d and set during the early 1940s, a framing device that explains the updating, but adds little to the staging itself.</p> <p>Adina\u2019s farm has become a dilapidated country mansion, requisitioned by the Women\u2019s Land Army for use as a hostel and canteen, and an opera almost invariably set in the open air is now brought indoors, with the first act taking place in a kitchen and the second in a disused ballroom, where dust sheets are hastily removed from furniture to allow wedding festivities to take place. Rhian Lois\u2019s Adina is the glamorous lady of the manor, unsure of her feelings for Thomas Atkins\u2019s conscientious objector Nemorino, and playing him off against Dan D\u2019Souza\u2019s Belcore, a flying ace in this instance, rather than a soldier. Brandon Cedel\u2019s Dulcamara, meanwhile, is an American racketeer, flashy and charming, albeit unscrupulously on the make.</p>    <p>Much of it is hugely enjoyable, but not all of it quite works. Atkins by and large plays Nemorino as sweet, gauche and rather shy, much as we might usually expect, so we have to take it on trust from those opening credits that he is meant to be a conscientious objector, though that also explains why D\u2019Souza\u2019s Belcore, whose \u201cGod\u2019s gift\u201d sexuality masks a vicious temper, treats him with a contempt bordering on violence. Cedel is a younger, more immediately charismatic Dulcamara than most, whose fraudulent interventions now result in chaos as well as love and joy: the final scene, in which he leaves the villagers fighting among themselves for bottles of his elixir (bourbon rather than bordeaux, here), jars with the rest of it.</p> <p>Musically, it\u2019s lovely from start to finish, though conductor Teresa Riveiro B\u00f6hm sometimes favours extreme speeds and occasionally allows the orchestra to be fractionally over-prominent. Atkins, in a fine ENO debut, makes a wonderful Nemorino, beautifully acted, and sung with often exquisite lyrical ease. Lois is terrific, too, with a blaze in her tone and superbly expressive coloratura. D\u2019Souza sings with admirable swagger in a characterisation more unpleasant than most, which is Fehr\u2019s doing. Cedel has great fun as Dulcamara, his patter wonderfully clear, the mockery, humour and flashes of venality all superbly realised. Segomotso Masego Shupinyaneng, meanwhile, does much with little as Gianetta, a role sometimes undercast, though not here. The playing and choral singing are both outstanding.</p> <p>\u2022 In repertory at <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/the-elixir-of-love/\">the Coliseum, London</a>, until 5 December.</p>",

He described Labour MPs sympathetic to Margaret Hodge\u2019s position on registers as potential \u201cforces of negativity\u201d and said lobbyists needed to \u201cneutralise\u201d them with positive messages. Cohen, who has advised several leading Conservative politicians and now advises the BVI government, said there was a hope that the Treasury would be open to stopping short of full public registers of beneficial ownership. \u201cWe know Treasury are a lot more pragmatic and are going to be pulling a lot of strings across government,\u201d he said during the presentation, given shortly after Labour won the election. A Foreign Office spokesperson said the government was pursuing fully public registers with \u201cfull vigour\u201d. Hodge and Mitchell said: \u201cIf the overseas territories and crown dependencies will not accept the will of parliament we must use our powers to insist that they act.\u201d Hodge has previously called on the government to issue an \u201corder in council\u201d to compel overseas territories to comply and suggested the crown dependencies could be forced to follow suit, a proposal that would test constitutional convention and law. A spokesperson for the Cayman Islands countered that there was \u201cno evidence to back up any such claims with respect to illicit finance or sanctions evasion in the Cayman Islands\u201d. \u201cIt shows that money laundering cases involving the Cayman Islands are in fact extremely rare and that sanctions have been implemented effectively,\u201d they said. Ian Gorst, Jersey\u2019s minister for external relations, said: \u201cAny suggestion that Jersey plays a pivotal role in helping criminals and tax evaders launder and hide illicit funds is wholly inaccurate.\u201d A spokesperson for the Isle of Man government said it \u201cremains committed to playing its part in deterring, preventing and detecting criminals and tax evaders who wish to launder or hide illicit funds\u201d. The Guardian also approached representatives of the BVIs and the Isle of Man for comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2024 to add a comments from Jersey minister Ian Gorst and the Isle of Man government",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Andr\u00e9 Onana (Manchester United)</strong></h2> <p>The Cameroonian had a debut season to forget in England. A series of blunders during a nightmarish Champions League campaign helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/29/galatasaray-manchester-united-champions-league-match-report\">contribute to Manchester United\u2019s group-stage exit</a>, while high-profile errors on the domestic front led to serious questions about his future. Onana has enjoyed a far better start this time, dropping no conspicuous clangers and keeping five clean sheets in 11 games, the highest of any goalkeeper. He is overperforming in shot-stopping metrics and boasts a pass-completion rate that is on course to be higher than last season. An unexpectedly reassuring presence during another period of early-season turmoil at Old Trafford.</p> <h2><strong>Ola Aina (Nottingham Forest)</strong></h2> <p>Only awarded a one-year contract extension last summer after a stop-start first season at Forest punctuated by a trip to the Africa Cup of Nations and injury, Aina has played well enough in the past three months to have those responsible for this parsimony ruing their reluctance to offer him a longer deal. Having started the season at left-back, the Nigeria international was switched to the right after three games and has thrived. The tight rein on which he kept Luis D\u00edaz during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/14/liverpool-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">Forest\u2019s win over Liverpool</a> was one of the best defensive performances of any player in this campaign.</p>    <h2><strong>Nikola Milenkovic (Nottingham Forest)</strong></h2> <p>In a feature that could have been comprised exclusively of Forest players, the Serbia captain is a standout inclusion as a Premier League success story since his \u00a312m summer arrival from Fiorentina. Drafted into a side that haemorrhaged goals from set pieces last season, Milenkovic needed little or no time to acclimatise while helping transform Nuno Espir\u00edto Santo\u2019s defence into the top flight\u2019s second meanest. While Forest\u2019s scattergun approach to transfer business has been the subject of derision, the outstanding partnership forged between Milenkovic and his central-defensive sidekick Murillo is a major contributory factor to the club\u2019s unexpectedly exalted league position.</p> <h2><strong>Michael Keane (Everton)</strong></h2> <p>A peripheral figure who made only nine league appearances last season, Michael Keane has already equalled that total with 11 games of this campaign played. Almost certainly one of the four or five unnamed players who Sean Dyche acknowledged that Everton fans didn\u2019t want to see in his side, the 31-year-old is unlikely to keep his place now that Jarrad Branthwaite has returned to fitness but was a decent deputy, even scoring two goals. The pick of them? A left-footed screamer into the roof of the net from a tight angle against Ipswich that will have had even his most vocal detractors on their feet.</p>    <h2><strong>Antonee Robinson (Fulham)</strong></h2> <p>While Robinson\u2019s season-on-season improvement will not surprise Fulham fans, his remarkable form has raised eyebrows among those less used to seeing him play. Ranked third among Premier League defenders when it comes to making tackles and interceptions, it is going forward that he has excelled in a Fulham side performing well above expectation. The pacy United States international has been accumulating frequent-flyer points with his regular overlapping sprints down the left wing and no top-flight defender has bettered his three assists. On current form, Robinson is arguably the top flight\u2019s best left-back and the force is very much with the 27-year-old known as Jedi.</p> <h2><strong>Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)</strong></h2> <p>A squad player under J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Gravenberch has taken just 11 games to become the outstanding defensive midfielder many Liverpool fans didn\u2019t realise their club already had on the books. The young Dutchman is thriving in his deep-lying role as the sitting midfielder in the double-pivot favoured by Arne Slot, a position in which he previously played for Ajax. \u201cThis season my goal is to play even more than last season and I\u2019m on my way,\u201d said the midfielder who has started each of Liverpool\u2019s 11 Premier League matches and failed to finish only one of them.</p>    <h2><strong>Pape Sarr (Tottenham)</strong></h2> <p>When Tottenham Hotspur came from behind to demolish Aston Villa after going a goal behind their standout performer was Sarr. The 22-year-old Senegal international won the ball nine times in midfield and his direct running at the visitors led to two of his side\u2019s four goals. An apparently tireless athlete whose excellent partnership alongside Dejan Kulusevski in Ange Postecoglou\u2019s midfield has edged James Maddison to the fringes despite the England international not having done a great deal wrong. With more questions being asked of the Australian following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/tottenham-ipswich-premier-league-match-report\">Spurs\u2019 home defeat against Ipswich</a>, he will hope Sarr\u2019s work ethic helps keep him in a job.</p> <h2><strong>Matheus Nunes (Manchester City)</strong></h2> <p>A bit-part player last season following his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/30/manchester-city-agree-55m-deal-to-sign-matheus-nunes-from-wolves\">move from Wolves</a>, Nunes has made the most of the additional responsibilities handed to him by Pep Guardiola due to the club\u2019s injury crisis. A central midfielder by trade, Nunes has been deployed on the left and in all competitions has scored three goals, provided four assists and created seven big chances. With reports suggesting Nunes has done enough to earn himself a spot in his favoured position upon the return of Jack Grealish and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku from the treatment room, the 26-year-old could yet enjoy an extended run in the team.</p> <h2><strong>Facundo Buonanotte (Leicester)</strong></h2> <p>On loan from Brighton, this teenage Argentinian winger has come into a promoted side that was always likely to struggle and made an immediate impact. A first-team staple despite Abdul Fatawu and Stephy Madvididi\u2019s stellar contributions to Leicester\u2019s promotion cause last season, Buonanotte has already equalled last season\u2019s top-flight tally of three goals while providing two assists. Always keen to take on defenders on the edge of their own box, he is similarly enthusiastic when it comes to getting his hands dirty and is happy to do his fair share of defensive donkey-work.</p>    <h2><strong>Chris Wood (Nottingham Forest)</strong></h2> <p>Few expected this thirtysomething throwback to trouble the Golden Boot standings, but there he is on eight goals, rubbing shoulders with Mo Salah and Bryan Mbeumo, with only Erling Haaland ahead of them. The lone striker at the tip of Nuno Espir\u00edto Santo\u2019s 4-2-3-1 spear, Wood\u2019s physicality makes him a handful while he is also benefiting from the excellent service provided by Morgan Gibbs-White, Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Not as good in the air as he should be, the big Kiwi is a scorer of important goals, with each of his eight having contributed to the points tally which has Forest riding high in fifth.</p> <h2><strong>Liam Delap (Ipswich)</strong></h2> <p>Despite being just 21, Delap had something of a point to prove when he moved to Ipswich after three fairly underwhelming loan spells from Manchester City at various Championship clubs. Thrown in at the deep end due to Ipswich\u2019s failure to secure other summer targets, he got off the mark with a wonderful solo goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/31/ipswich-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">against Fulham</a> and has since added five more. Fast, fond of a stepover, a tormentor of central defenders and blessed with the ability to strike the ball with the power of 10,000 suns, he is well on his way to repaying the faith in him shown by Kieran McKenna.</p>",

The pacy United States international has been accumulating frequent-flyer points with his regular overlapping sprints down the left wing and no top-flight defender has bettered his three assists. On current form, Robinson is arguably the top flight\u2019s best left-back and the force is very much with the 27-year-old known as Jedi. Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool) A squad player under J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Gravenberch has taken just 11 games to become the outstanding defensive midfielder many Liverpool fans didn\u2019t realise their club already had on the books. The young Dutchman is thriving in his deep-lying role as the sitting midfielder in the double-pivot favoured by Arne Slot, a position in which he previously played for Ajax. \u201cThis season my goal is to play even more than last season and I\u2019m on my way,\u201d said the midfielder who has started each of Liverpool\u2019s 11 Premier League matches and failed to finish only one of them. Pape Sarr (Tottenham) When Tottenham Hotspur came from behind to demolish Aston Villa after going a goal behind their standout performer was Sarr. The 22-year-old Senegal international won the ball nine times in midfield and his direct running at the visitors led to two of his side\u2019s four goals. An apparently tireless athlete whose excellent partnership alongside Dejan Kulusevski in Ange Postecoglou\u2019s midfield has edged James Maddison to the fringes despite the England international not having done a great deal wrong. With more questions being asked of the Australian following Spurs\u2019 home defeat against Ipswich, he will hope Sarr\u2019s work ethic helps keep him in a job. Matheus Nunes (Manchester City) A bit-part player last season following his move from Wolves, Nunes has made the most of the additional responsibilities handed to him by Pep Guardiola due to the club\u2019s injury crisis. A central midfielder by trade, Nunes has been deployed on the left and in all competitions has scored three goals, provided four assists and created seven big chances. With reports suggesting Nunes has done enough to earn himself a spot in his favoured position upon the return of Jack Grealish and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku from the treatment room, the 26-year-old could yet enjoy an extended run in the team. Facundo Buonanotte (Leicester) On loan from Brighton, this teenage Argentinian winger has come into a promoted side that was always likely to struggle and made an immediate impact. A first-team staple despite Abdul Fatawu and Stephy Madvididi\u2019s stellar contributions to Leicester\u2019s promotion cause last season, Buonanotte has already equalled last season\u2019s top-flight tally of three goals while providing two assists. Always keen to take on defenders on the edge of their own box, he is similarly enthusiastic when it comes to getting his hands dirty and is happy to do his fair share of defensive donkey-work. Chris Wood (Nottingham Forest) Few expected this thirtysomething throwback to trouble the Golden Boot standings, but there he is on eight goals, rubbing shoulders with Mo Salah and Bryan Mbeumo, with only Erling Haaland ahead of them. The lone striker at the tip of Nuno Espir\u00edto Santo\u2019s 4-2-3-1 spear, Wood\u2019s physicality makes him a handful while he is also benefiting from the excellent service provided by Morgan Gibbs-White, Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Not as good in the air as he should be, the big Kiwi is a scorer of important goals, with each of his eight having contributed to the points tally which has Forest riding high in fifth. Liam Delap (Ipswich) Despite being just 21, Delap had something of a point to prove when he moved to Ipswich after three fairly underwhelming loan spells from Manchester City at various Championship clubs. Thrown in at the deep end due to Ipswich\u2019s failure to secure other summer targets, he got off the mark with a wonderful solo goal against Fulham and has since added five more. Fast, fond of a stepover, a tormentor of central defenders and blessed with the ability to strike the ball with the power of 10,000 suns, he is well on his way to repaying the faith in him shown by Kieran McKenna.",

With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, complete with a Republican-dominated Congress, anti-abortion groups are unfurling ambitious lists of policies they hope to see enacted under a sympathetic administration.

      "body": "<p>All over the country, the lights are going out. The level of need for adult and children\u2019s care is constantly increasing. People are still suffering the dire human effects of the pandemic. Thanks to the long years when Conservative politicians mercilessly cut the money that went from Whitehall to councils, the fear of municipal bankruptcy now stalks scores of places. And after years of cuts, in the face of other rising costs \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/24/special-educational-needs-bill-england-10bn-school-council-funding\">funding special needs education</a> and <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/homelessness_bill_doubles_in_five_years_to_2_3bn\">providing temporary accommodation</a> for those who are homeless \u2013 the local politicians who have to somehow find a way through all this face an impossible question: how else can they reduce their spending? The answers involve vital services. But as winter bites and the nights draw in, one set of savings comes with an awful symbolism.</p> <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/26/concern-as-more-councils-in-england-and-wales-plan-to-turn-off-street-lights\">streetlamps are being dimmed,</a> switched off and left broken: over the past 15 years, the majority of councils are reckoned to have taken such decisions. And, of course, this great switch-off is bound up with all the other ongoing local cuts: to social work, road maintenance, transport for disabled people, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-council-budget-cuts-are-affecting-domestic-violence-services-and-those-who-need-them-224995\">domestic abuse services</a>, youth clubs, libraries, leisure centres, bus subsidies, parks, and more. For millions of people, the continued hacking down of the most basic amenities and infrastructure seals a sense of deep neglect, and the feeling that politicians at the top choose to look away. When Rachel Reeves <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-10-30/debates/11809FC2-3FF8-4B3A-9C78-4A56268F0D5E/FinancialStatementAndBudgetReport\">gave her budget speech</a> a few weeks ago, she repeated a stock Labour line: \u201cI said there would be no return to austerity; that is the choice I have made today.\u201d The truth is that local austerity is not just grinding on, but getting worse.</p> <p>We are now well beyond the phase of this story that included a handful of broke local authorities in England \u2013 perhaps most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/may/01/birmingham-city-council-accused-of-making-cuts-based-on-imagined-data\">notably, Birmingham city council</a> \u2013 whose predicament could be blamed on mismanagement. The crisis is spreading fast: among the places and areas now said to fear bankruptcy are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gdlnzegz8o\">Bristol</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lgcplus.com/finance/met-needs-urgent-action-to-avoid-s114-18-10-2024/\">Dudley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp35e43pgwzo\">Cheshire East</a>, <a href=\"https://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/24660601.somerset-council-predicting-possible-130m-budget-gap/\">Somerset</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newburytoday.co.uk/news/report-warns-that-county-council-could-declare-itself-effec-9391886/\">Hampshire</a>. Though stories elsewhere in the UK are slightly complicated by devolution, local authorities <a href=\"https://audit.scot/news/scotland%E2%80%99s-councils-face-severe-challenges-to-balance-the-books\">in Scotland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wlga.wales/council-services-face-%E2%80%9Cunsustainable%E2%80%9D-budget-pressures-says-wlga#:~:text=Councils%20across%20Wales%20are%20grappling,to%20deliver%20essential%20local%20services.\">Wales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-66845968\">Northern Ireland</a> are also in the midst of grave difficulties. The same thing is happening everywhere: the decline and collapse of a layer of government that is central to the way we all live.</p> <p>If you want a sense of the seemingly unlikely places now on the brink, consider Shropshire, that expanse of sparsely populated land and venerable towns \u2013 Shrewsbury, Whitchurch, Oswestry, Ludlow \u2013 that sits on England\u2019s mid-western edge. Last year, its county council cut \u00a340m from its spending; this year, it is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx9kgpzzelo\">in the midst of \u00a362.5m of savings</a>, which works out at \u00a3191 for every resident. Research by the BBC suggests this is the highest figure of any local authority in the country. And the pain looks set to continue.</p> <p>Shropshire\u2019s council leader is Lezley Picton, who recently said that her county was \u201cunbelievably close\u201d to effective insolvency. She is a Conservative, but in the context of the disaster she faces her party affiliation does not seem all that relevant. Since 2011, \u00a3400m has been taken out of the council\u2019s budget. Of every five pounds it now spends, she reckons that four go on social care. \u201cOf the remaining quid,\u201d she told me last week, \u201c50 pence is spent on our waste contract, and everything else we do \u2013 including other statutory services \u2013 comes out of that last 50p.\u201d</p> <p>Never mind air pollution and gridlock: the park and ride system in Shrewsbury, she said, may have to go.

      "bodyText": "All over the country, the lights are going out. The level of need for adult and children\u2019s care is constantly increasing. People are still suffering the dire human effects of the pandemic. Thanks to the long years when Conservative politicians mercilessly cut the money that went from Whitehall to councils, the fear of municipal bankruptcy now stalks scores of places. And after years of cuts, in the face of other rising costs \u2013 including funding special needs education and providing temporary accommodation for those who are homeless \u2013 the local politicians who have to somehow find a way through all this face an impossible question: how else can they reduce their spending? The answers involve vital services. But as winter bites and the nights draw in, one set of savings comes with an awful symbolism. Our streetlamps are being dimmed, switched off and left broken: over the past 15 years, the majority of councils are reckoned to have taken such decisions. And, of course, this great switch-off is bound up with all the other ongoing local cuts: to social work, road maintenance, transport for disabled people, domestic abuse services, youth clubs, libraries, leisure centres, bus subsidies, parks, and more. For millions of people, the continued hacking down of the most basic amenities and infrastructure seals a sense of deep neglect, and the feeling that politicians at the top choose to look away. When Rachel Reeves gave her budget speech a few weeks ago, she repeated a stock Labour line: \u201cI said there would be no return to austerity; that is the choice I have made today.\u201d The truth is that local austerity is not just grinding on, but getting worse. We are now well beyond the phase of this story that included a handful of broke local authorities in England \u2013 perhaps most notably, Birmingham city council \u2013 whose predicament could be blamed on mismanagement. The crisis is spreading fast: among the places and areas now said to fear bankruptcy are Bristol, Dudley, Cheshire East, Somerset and Hampshire. Though stories elsewhere in the UK are slightly complicated by devolution, local authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also in the midst of grave difficulties. The same thing is happening everywhere: the decline and collapse of a layer of government that is central to the way we all live. If you want a sense of the seemingly unlikely places now on the brink, consider Shropshire, that expanse of sparsely populated land and venerable towns \u2013 Shrewsbury, Whitchurch, Oswestry, Ludlow \u2013 that sits on England\u2019s mid-western edge. Last year, its county council cut \u00a340m from its spending; this year, it is in the midst of \u00a362.5m of savings, which works out at \u00a3191 for every resident. Research by the BBC suggests this is the highest figure of any local authority in the country. And the pain looks set to continue. Shropshire\u2019s council leader is Lezley Picton, who recently said that her county was \u201cunbelievably close\u201d to effective insolvency. She is a Conservative, but in the context of the disaster she faces her party affiliation does not seem all that relevant. Since 2011, \u00a3400m has been taken out of the council\u2019s budget. Of every five pounds it now spends, she reckons that four go on social care. \u201cOf the remaining quid,\u201d she told me last week, \u201c50 pence is spent on our waste contract, and everything else we do \u2013 including other statutory services \u2013 comes out of that last 50p.\u201d Never mind air pollution and gridlock: the park and ride system in Shrewsbury, she said, may have to go. The only way to save libraries is to hand them over to volunteers. Bust streetlights are going to go unrepaired. \u201cThere is nothing that isn\u2019t under threat,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything we do is being looked at.\u201d One aspect of Shropshire\u2019s finances is shocking: the fact that the number of children in council care has increased by 85% since the pandemic. \u201cThere is a view from the outside world that Shropshire is leafy and green,\u201d Picton told me, \u201cbut we\u2019ve also got significant pockets of poverty.

These seahorse-shaped parts of the brain measure about 5cm, sit just above both ears and drive our spatial awareness and orientation. London taxi drivers, famed for taking the Knowledge, a test that involves memorising the central streets of the capital, have full-sized hippocampi. But <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2011.9602\">in 2011, neuroscientists at University College London</a> discovered that the cabbies\u2019 hippocampi shrunk significantly after retirement.</p> <p>The development of the hippocampus can also be stunted in childhood. Children living in urban environments rarely see the sun rise or set and cannot tell the difference between east and west. When I volunteered to go into my local school to teach kids about direction, I found they struggled to distinguish north from south and east from west \u2013 though they could do so if allowed to use their phones.</p> <p>Since 2005, when Google Maps was launched claiming it would help users get from A to B and then, three years later, when the iPhone 3G was released featuring \u201clive\u201d location, the online tech giants stated that today\u2019s digital native kids would be the first generation who would not know what it meant to get lost. But is that a good thing? Their horizons and orientation, like their hippocampi, are shrinking with the collusion of online providers.

Many parents know the subsequent 50% rise in agoraphobia has profoundly affected children\u2019s mental and physical health. But it also drives <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/02/prevent-biophobia-fear-of-nature-conservation/673211/\">biophobia</a>, an avoidance, even fear of the natural world.

Maps have never been more accessible in the palm of our hands on our phones, but they are as much a tyranny as a liberation. Our phones now map us, harvesting our online likes and dislikes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The famous \u2018blue marble\u2019 Apollo 17 photograph of the Earth is upside down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Current studies suggest a link between this so-called <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(13)70133-9/fulltext\">developmental topographical disorientation</a> and mental health, as online experiences lead to a digitally poisoned awareness of space and place. We are becoming, quite literally, disoriented in a digital world where we have given up on tools that enhance our cognitive abilities, like paper maps and magnetic compasses that enabled us to navigate and orient ourselves in tandem with the physical world. We have retreated from using the spatial skills that sustained us for millennia. No wonder our sense of being lost is existential as much as directional.</p> <p>To be disoriented means to be \u201clost to the east\u201d: the word comes from Latin for the sun rising in the east. In ancient history, most societies were oriented with east as their prime direction, the source of light, heat and life-giving sun. West, where the sun sets, came next. North and south then followed, as people located them by the position of the sun at midday, and visual astronomical observation of Polaris, the North Star. Early polytheistic societies worshipped the sun rising in the east, a tradition inherited by monotheistic Judeo-Christian belief that put east at the top of their maps, as the location of the beginning of Creation and the place of Resurrection. In the Old Testament, Creation starts in the Garden of Eden in the east. The medieval Mappa Mundi in <a href=\"https://www.themappamundi.co.uk/\">Hereford Cathedral</a> has east at the top, showing Adam and Eve in Eden, and west at the bottom. This was an orientation that defined European Christianity for more than 1,000 years.</p> <p>By contrast, early Islamic maps placed south at the top, because the people that first converted to the faith lived directly north of Mecca. The easiest way to understand their holy direction was to orient their maps so that Mecca was \u201cup\u201d. We still talk about going up north and down south in the UK, an old hangover from understanding the four points of the compass according to our bodies: up and down, front and back, or left and right. South does just as well as the cardinal direction, as it was for classical Chinese science, which had its magnetic compasses pointing south, not north. They are called <em>luojing</em>, \u201cthe thing that points south\u201d. Australians know this: in 1979, Stuart McArthur published his Universal Corrective Map of the World, oriented southwards with Australia at the top.</p> <p>The compass appeared in the 13th century on European maritime maps that allowed navigators to orientate themselves on a north-south axis. But it took another 400 years for these maps to agree on putting north at the top, which had always been an inauspicious direction in most societies as a place of cold and darkness. It was crowned cardinal direction by the Flemish mapmaker Gerardus Mercator. But Mercator was more interested in enabling pilots to sail accurately east to west. On his world map (1569), distortion was minimised either side of the equator, which was ideal for European maritime empires sailing east to west via Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope. The north and south poles were projected to infinity, as everyone presumed they were ice-bound and travelling there seemed pointless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rather than looking up, we spend our time looking down, glued to the blue dot on our phones</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So north triumphed accidentally, because nobody wanted to go there.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve lost direction and our brains are shrinking \u2013 at least, our hippocampi are. These seahorse-shaped parts of the brain measure about 5cm, sit just above both ears and drive our spatial awareness and orientation. London taxi drivers, famed for taking the Knowledge, a test that involves memorising the central streets of the capital, have full-sized hippocampi. But in 2011, neuroscientists at University College London discovered that the cabbies\u2019 hippocampi shrunk significantly after retirement. The development of the hippocampus can also be stunted in childhood. Children living in urban environments rarely see the sun rise or set and cannot tell the difference between east and west. When I volunteered to go into my local school to teach kids about direction, I found they struggled to distinguish north from south and east from west \u2013 though they could do so if allowed to use their phones. Since 2005, when Google Maps was launched claiming it would help users get from A to B and then, three years later, when the iPhone 3G was released featuring \u201clive\u201d location, the online tech giants stated that today\u2019s digital native kids would be the first generation who would not know what it meant to get lost. But is that a good thing? Their horizons and orientation, like their hippocampi, are shrinking with the collusion of online providers. In four generations children have gone from roaming up to six miles from home to an average of just 300 yards. Even before Covid, surveys found that three-quarters of children spent less time outdoors than prison inmates. Many parents know the subsequent 50% rise in agoraphobia has profoundly affected children\u2019s mental and physical health. But it also drives biophobia, an avoidance, even fear of the natural world. If we come to dread nature, the result is an indifference, even hostility, towards environmental conservation. Wherever kids do travel they are probably following the blue dot on their phone screen, showing them the way without reference to the world around them. Maps have never been more accessible in the palm of our hands on our phones, but they are as much a tyranny as a liberation. Our phones now map us, harvesting our online likes and dislikes. Current studies suggest a link between this so-called developmental topographical disorientation and mental health, as online experiences lead to a digitally poisoned awareness of space and place. We are becoming, quite literally, disoriented in a digital world where we have given up on tools that enhance our cognitive abilities, like paper maps and magnetic compasses that enabled us to navigate and orient ourselves in tandem with the physical world. We have retreated from using the spatial skills that sustained us for millennia. No wonder our sense of being lost is existential as much as directional. To be disoriented means to be \u201clost to the east\u201d: the word comes from Latin for the sun rising in the east. In ancient history, most societies were oriented with east as their prime direction, the source of light, heat and life-giving sun. West, where the sun sets, came next. North and south then followed, as people located them by the position of the sun at midday, and visual astronomical observation of Polaris, the North Star. Early polytheistic societies worshipped the sun rising in the east, a tradition inherited by monotheistic Judeo-Christian belief that put east at the top of their maps, as the location of the beginning of Creation and the place of Resurrection. In the Old Testament, Creation starts in the Garden of Eden in the east. The medieval Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral has east at the top, showing Adam and Eve in Eden, and west at the bottom. This was an orientation that defined European Christianity for more than 1,000 years. By contrast, early Islamic maps placed south at the top, because the people that first converted to the faith lived directly north of Mecca. The easiest way to understand their holy direction was to orient their maps so that Mecca was \u201cup\u201d. We still talk about going up north and down south in the UK, an old hangover from understanding the four points of the compass according to our bodies: up and down, front and back, or left and right. South does just as well as the cardinal direction, as it was for classical Chinese science, which had its magnetic compasses pointing south, not north. They are called luojing, \u201cthe thing that points south\u201d. Australians know this: in 1979, Stuart McArthur published his Universal Corrective Map of the World, oriented southwards with Australia at the top. The compass appeared in the 13th century on European maritime maps that allowed navigators to orientate themselves on a north-south axis. But it took another 400 years for these maps to agree on putting north at the top, which had always been an inauspicious direction in most societies as a place of cold and darkness. It was crowned cardinal direction by the Flemish mapmaker Gerardus Mercator. But Mercator was more interested in enabling pilots to sail accurately east to west. On his world map (1569), distortion was minimised either side of the equator, which was ideal for European maritime empires sailing east to west via Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope. The north and south poles were projected to infinity, as everyone presumed they were ice-bound and travelling there seemed pointless. So north triumphed accidentally, because nobody wanted to go there. As Europe\u2019s imperial mapmakers cemented north as the cardinal direction, other traditions prioritising different directions were dismissed and erased. The west succeeded in putting north on top at the expense of places it denigrated and labelled \u201csouthern\u201d (America and Africa), or as part of the \u201cMiddle East\u201d. When Nasa first saw the image of the Earth photographed by the Apollo 17 astronauts on 7 December 1972, they rotated the original photo 180 degrees to show north at the top rather than south. The famous \u201cblue marble\u201d photograph, one of the most reproduced images in human history, is actually upside down. Historically no societies have put west at the top of world maps because of its associations with sunset and death. But as a political idea, the west has situated north on top after centuries of imperial domination. But will it stay there as India and China reorientate our global economy, and potentially turn it 180 degrees? Might the use of compasses disappear altogether \u2013 and with them the cardinal directions? In my lifetime we have gone from looking up, aspiring to a shared global village inspired by Nasa\u2019s blue marble photograph, to looking down, glued to the blue dot on our phones as our hippocampi shrink and many of us withdraw from nature.

Petros Elia, the general secretary of the UVW, said: \u201cMalina\u2019s case highlights the injustice and harm caused when employers ignore the wellbeing of disabled workers. UVW remains committed to supporting her and ensuring that no disabled worker has to endure the same mistreatment in the future.\u201d A Wilson James spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the circumstances related to this individual, and remain committed to working with all parties to achieve a positive resolution.\u201d",

Now, many are too afraid to venture into the forest.</p> <p>\u201cThey became traumatised because they didn\u2019t think a bear could kill a person,\u201d said Andreas Pichler, whose documentary Pericolosamente Vicini (Dangerously Close), was recently aired on <a href=\"https://www.raiplay.it/programmi/pericolosamentevicini-viverecongliorsi\">Rai</a>. \u201cNow we have this total panic. On top of this, people have totally lost faith in the institutions [responsible for managing the situation].\u201d</p> <p>The Andrea Papi committee is calling for a scientific commission to be created and to establish a limit on the number of bears the territory can feasibly accommodate. They want all bears deemed dangerous to be killed, similar to a policy in neighbouring Switzerland.</p> <p>Alessandro De Guelmi, a vet, is wholly supportive of the animals, even taking tourists into the forest to see them, but he agrees with the committee. \u201cDangerous bears need to be immediately culled. I\u2019ve been saying it for 20 years \u2013 this is the best way to keep the human population and the other bears safe.\u201d</p> <p>Claudio Groff, the chief of the large carnivores division of Trentino\u2019s wildlife department, said his unit\u2019s policy towards problematic bears was three-pronged: reduce as much as possible their contact with humans by installing anti-bear bins, using dogs and rubber bullets to deter them, and properly informing people how to keep safe.</p> <p>\u201cIn rare cases when these measures aren\u2019t enough, the only solution is to eliminate the bear and not keep it in captivity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Roberto Failoni, a forestry councillor, said the province would \u201ccontinue to implement every possible strategy to guarantee the safety of people\u201d, and that it felt \u201ceven more responsibility\u201d now that citizens\u2019 had expressed themselves.</p> <p>But for Papi\u2019s parents, who are taking Fugatti and their local mayor to court for alleged manslaughter, the action has come too late. \u201cAndrea was accused of imprudence, but it\u2019s the authorities that have been imprudent,\u201d said his father, Carlo. \u201cWe want justice.\u201d</p>",

But his death in April last year marked a watershed moment in a fierce debate over brown bears, imported into western Trentino from Slovenia as part of a rewilding project 25 years ago, that has pitted politicians against animal activists. The wrangle has overshadowed the grief of Papi\u2019s family and the solidarity of the residents living in Caldes and the 12 other villages that make up the Val di Sole area of the province. But the community in the valley, which is the only place in the world where wild bears live in such close proximity to humans, made their voices heard loud and clear in a recent consultative ballot organised by a committee set up in Papi\u2019s memory: 98% expressed that they were no longer willing to tolerate the animals, deeming them to be a threat to public safety as well as the local economy. The organisers hope the vote will reverberate as far as Brussels and force a solution to their problems. For animal rights\u2019 associations, the plebiscite was \u201ca farce aimed at deceiving people\u201d. Papi, who had been studying for a master\u2019s in mountain sport science, had gone for run along a popular path in the late afternoon when he encountered JJ4, a female bear.

An autopsy confirmed Papi had been killed by JJ4, a bear born after mating between Jurka and Joze, two of the 10 imported bears released into the Adamello Brenta nature park through Life Ursus, an EU-funded project aimed at reversing the area\u2019s dwindling brown bear population. Bears became the symbol of Trentino, with images of the animal adorning promotional material and featuring in the logo of the local newspaper. The project was hailed a success by conservationists, but the bear population rapidly grew \u2013 numbers today are estimated at between 86 and 120 \u2013 and public opinion turned when the animals started gravitating towards inhabited areas, preying on livestock and rummaging through bins in search of food. Franca Penasa, a member of the Andrea Papi committee and a former president for the Trentino section of the Stelvio national park, opposed the rewilding project from the start. \u201cThere was no counterbalance with the local community,\u201d she said. \u201cThe animals were put at the top of the food chain.

JJ4, who was classified as dangerous after attacking two hikers in 2020, was captured soon after Papi\u2019s death and has since been held in an enclosure. Her life was spared after a regional court struck down a culling order by Maurizio Fugatti, the president of Trentino province. Before Papi\u2019s death, people did not perceive the danger the animals posed. Now, many are too afraid to venture into the forest. \u201cThey became traumatised because they didn\u2019t think a bear could kill a person,\u201d said Andreas Pichler, whose documentary Pericolosamente Vicini (Dangerously Close), was recently aired on Rai. \u201cNow we have this total panic. On top of this, people have totally lost faith in the institutions [responsible for managing the situation].\u201d The Andrea Papi committee is calling for a scientific commission to be created and to establish a limit on the number of bears the territory can feasibly accommodate. They want all bears deemed dangerous to be killed, similar to a policy in neighbouring Switzerland. Alessandro De Guelmi, a vet, is wholly supportive of the animals, even taking tourists into the forest to see them, but he agrees with the committee. \u201cDangerous bears need to be immediately culled. I\u2019ve been saying it for 20 years \u2013 this is the best way to keep the human population and the other bears safe.\u201d Claudio Groff, the chief of the large carnivores division of Trentino\u2019s wildlife department, said his unit\u2019s policy towards problematic bears was three-pronged: reduce as much as possible their contact with humans by installing anti-bear bins, using dogs and rubber bullets to deter them, and properly informing people how to keep safe. \u201cIn rare cases when these measures aren\u2019t enough, the only solution is to eliminate the bear and not keep it in captivity,\u201d he said. Roberto Failoni, a forestry councillor, said the province would \u201ccontinue to implement every possible strategy to guarantee the safety of people\u201d, and that it felt \u201ceven more responsibility\u201d now that citizens\u2019 had expressed themselves. But for Papi\u2019s parents, who are taking Fugatti and their local mayor to court for alleged manslaughter, the action has come too late. \u201cAndrea was accused of imprudence, but it\u2019s the authorities that have been imprudent,\u201d said his father, Carlo. \u201cWe want justice.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, his predecessor and successor, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/biden-trump-transition-white-house\">the pair shook hands</a> in the Oval Office. For Biden, it was important to show the world that America can still conduct a peaceful transfer of power. \u201cA transition that\u2019s so smooth it\u2019ll be as smooth as it can get,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>It was an outward show of permanence and stability. But behind the two men a fire was burning fiercely in the grate. TV comedian Stephen Colbert <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yF8KJwR0c\">observed</a>: \u201cI do think it was fitting that they held the meeting in front of a roaring metaphor for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Trump will not be president for another two months but he is already dominating the Washington agenda again. This week a flurry of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/pompeo-kennedy-and-musk-who-could-be-in-trumps-new-administration\">controversial and extremist picks</a> for his cabinet and other high-ranking administration positions came at a hectic pace and with a level of provocation that made heads spin.</p> <p>The choices included a Fox News host, a tech billionaire, an anti-vaccine activist, an alleged apologist for Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and a congressman once embroiled in a sex-trafficking investigation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/donald-trump-cabinet-picks-reaction-gaetz-gabbard-kennedy-hesgeth-rubio-waltz-noem\">The lineup raised fears</a> of authoritarianism or chaos \u2013 or both \u2013 once Trump and his allies are back in the Oval Office.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tarasetmayer.com/\">Tara Setmayer</a>, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: \u201cTheir entire political brand is shock and awe. Prior to Trump\u2019s re-election it was notional. Now they have the power to execute all of their depravity with the full backing of American government power virtually unchecked. I don\u2019t think the people who voted for Donald Trump, allegedly because of economic angst, have a full appreciation for what that means.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who has promised not to be a \u201cdictator\u201d except on \u201cday one\u201d, will enter office with far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/09/president-trump-election-maga\">fewer guardrails and checks</a> on his power than last time. He will return to Washington with a Republican-controlled Congress and a conservative supreme court, containing three justices he appointed, that ruled he is largely immune from prosecution.</p>    <p>He has said of his day one plans: \u201cI want to close the border, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-election-climate-pollution-oil-gas-clean-energy-f6ad39e23613396a7536fb1dc25fca62\">I want to drill, drill, drill</a>.\u201d The immigration issue animated his successful election campaign, often coupled with racist rhetoric and falsehoods. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told Fox News: \u201cWe know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history.\u201d</p> <p>To make it happen he is bringing back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/who-is-tom-homan-trump-border-czar\">Tom Homan</a>, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during his first administration, as his \u201cborder czar\u201d. Homan, 62, has said he will prioritise deporting immigrants illegally in the US who posed safety and security threats as well as those working at job sites.</p> <p>He will receive zealous ideological backing from Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy. An immigration hardliner, the 39-year-old was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump\u2019s priority of mass deportations. At a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/trump-msg-rally.html\">he adopted nativist language</a> as he asserted that only Trump would stand up and say \u201cAmerica is for Americans and Americans only.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/26/trump-kristi-noem-shot-dog-and-goat-book\">Kristi Noem</a>, the governor of South Dakota, will serve as the next homeland security secretary, responsible for everything from border protection and immigration to disaster response and the Secret Service. Noem, 52, rose to national prominence after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>    <p>A mass deportation effort could face logistical problems as well as a barrage legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists. But when Trump takes the oath of office on 20 January, his team will be expected to hit the ground running.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/larry-jacobs\">Larry Jacobs</a>, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cThe world needs to strap in because the first day of the Trump administration has been in the planning for at least a couple of years and so the white papers, the executive orders are already in files and ready to be pulled out.</p> <p>\u201cWe can expect certainly that some of the most radical ideas about curtailing immigration into the United States and then the expelling of unauthorised immigrants within the United States will get a boost from the president making a speech or a press conference followed up with directives to the executive branch. That\u2019ll be off and running day one.\u201d</p> <p>Jacobs added: \u201cWe can also expect a pretty sharp attack on the independence of the judiciary. This is going to be a rupture in the generations-old practice of political independence in terms of the Department of Justice. That\u2019s coming to an end.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has long said the biggest mistake of his first term was choosing the wrong people. He had arrived in Washington as the first president without prior political and military experience and relied on others for personnel recommendations. He felt frustrated at and betrayed by officials who slow-walked or ignored directives they saw as ill-advised.</p> <p>Having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election\">beaten Vice-President Kamala Harris</a> in the 5 November election, Trump is determined to avoid that mistake second time around. His blitz of announcements this week shows the premium he places on absolute loyalty.</p> <p>His early to-do list could include imposing sweeping tariffs on imported goods, pardoning supporters involved in the 6 January 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-baku-climate-cop29.html\">pulling the US out of the Paris climate agreement</a>, reversing protections for transgender students in schools and fulfilling his campaign promise to end the war between Ukraine and Russia \u201cin a day\u201d.</p> <p>Some have been relatively mainstream selections reassuring to the political class. They include Susie Wiles, 67, who will be the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff, and Senator Marco Rubio, 53, now in line to become the first Latino in the role of secretary of state. Rubio is seen as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/trump-america-first-foreign-policy\">a foreign policy hawk</a> who has previously taken a hard line on foes including China, Iran and Cuba.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/30/elise-stefanik-trump-republican-election\">Elise Stefanik</a>, 40, a Republican congresswoman and staunch Trump supporter, has been named as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. Mike Waltz, 50, a Republican congressman and retired Army Green Beret, is set to be his national security adviser. And John Ratcliffe, 59, a former director of national intelligence, will serve as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p> <p>But other picks have almost seemed to be political performance art, designed to goad and outrage Democrats (\u201cowning the libs\u201d) and impose a loyalty test on the Senate Republicans who will have to decide whether to confirm or reject Trump\u2019s cabinet members, judges and ambassadors.</p> <p>On Tuesday night Trump picked Pete Hegseth as his defence secretary. The 44-year-old is a former co-host of Fox &amp; Friends Weekend on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s conservative Fox News network and once <a href=\"https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01JCM11FVQRCZW243MJ6TP9CQY_16\">said he</a> \u201chasn\u2019t washed hands in 10 years\u201d because \u201cgerms are not a real thing\u201d. Hegseth, a military veteran, has opined that women <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/pete-hegseth-trump-pick-pentagon-rcna180011\">should not serve in combat</a> and expressed disdain for the so-called \u201cwoke\u201d policies of Pentagon leaders.</p> <p>In his recent book, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-war-on-warriors-pete-hegseth?variant=41763497803810\">The War on Warriors</a>: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free, Hegseth wrote: \u201cThe next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. Lots of people need to be fired.\u201d</p> <p>A day later Trump named Tulsi Gabbard, 43, a former Democratic congresswoman and critic of the Biden administration, as his director of national intelligence. Gabbard served in the army national guard for more than two decades, deploying to Iraq and Kuwait. But she secretly met with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/tulsi-gabbard-syria-assad/index.html\">Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad</a> in 2017 and <a href=\"https://x.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1496695830715142148\">blamed the US and Nato</a> for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/27/rick-wilson-lincoln-project-dismiss-trump-ron-desantis\">Rick Wilson</a>, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, said: \u201cSo far the candidates range from the unserious to the terrifying. Tulsi Gabbard is going to send a shock wave through the intelligence community and not in a good way. I can tell you that her Putin sympathies being rather evident to everyone around her is going to become a major issue. I\u2019m not sure Tulsi Gabbard can be confirmed.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps most outlandish, Trump selected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/republicans-matt-gaetz-trump-attorney-general\">Matt Gaetz</a>, a Florida congressman and \u201cMake America great again\u201d provocateur, for attorney general. The position of America\u2019s top law enforcement official is potentially central to his plans to carry out mass deportations, pardon January 6 rioters and seek retribution against those who prosecuted him over the past four years.</p> <p>The decision prompted howls of derision and doubts over whether Gaetz, 42, will receive Senate confirmation. He was once the subject of a justice department investigation into sex-trafficking allegations involving underage girls, although it ended last year with no federal charges against him.</p> <p>The staunch Trump loyalist was also under scrutiny by the House ethics committee over allegations including sexual misconduct, although that investigation in effect ended on Wednesday when Gaetz resigned from Congress. Republican and Democratic senators on the judiciary committee that would review Gaetz\u2019s nomination are calling for the findings to be made available to them.</p> <p>Senator Dick Durbin, the Democrat who currently chairs the judiciary committee, said Gaetz \u201cwould be a disaster\u201d in part because of Trump\u2019s threat to use the justice department \u201cto seek revenge on his political enemies\u201d. John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump, described it as \u201cthe worst nomination for a cabinet secretary in American history\u201d.</p> <p>Then, on Thursday, Trump delivered the coup de grace by saying he will nominate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/trump-administration-rfk-criticisms\">Robert Kennedy Jr</a>, 70, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy is one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world. Long advancing the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism, he has said vaccines have caused a \u201cholocaust\u201d and travelled the world spreading false information about the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>    <p>Kennedy, the nephew of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/18/jfk-assassination-dallas-legacy-political-conspiracy-extremism\">President John F Kennedy</a>, has also said he would recommend that water agencies stop adding fluoride to drinking water and made a variety of other claims not backed by science, such as questioning whether HIV causes Aids and suggesting antidepressants lead to school shootings.</p> <p>Adding to the mix, Trump named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-appoints-mike-huckabee-ambassador-israel\">Mike Huckabee</a>, 69, as ambassador to Israel.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWelcome back,\u201d Joe Biden told Donald Trump, his predecessor and successor, as the pair shook hands in the Oval Office. For Biden, it was important to show the world that America can still conduct a peaceful transfer of power. \u201cA transition that\u2019s so smooth it\u2019ll be as smooth as it can get,\u201d Trump said. It was an outward show of permanence and stability. But behind the two men a fire was burning fiercely in the grate. TV comedian Stephen Colbert observed: \u201cI do think it was fitting that they held the meeting in front of a roaring metaphor for the future.\u201d Trump will not be president for another two months but he is already dominating the Washington agenda again. This week a flurry of controversial and extremist picks for his cabinet and other high-ranking administration positions came at a hectic pace and with a level of provocation that made heads spin. The choices included a Fox News host, a tech billionaire, an anti-vaccine activist, an alleged apologist for Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and a congressman once embroiled in a sex-trafficking investigation. The lineup raised fears of authoritarianism or chaos \u2013 or both \u2013 once Trump and his allies are back in the Oval Office. Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: \u201cTheir entire political brand is shock and awe. Prior to Trump\u2019s re-election it was notional. Now they have the power to execute all of their depravity with the full backing of American government power virtually unchecked. I don\u2019t think the people who voted for Donald Trump, allegedly because of economic angst, have a full appreciation for what that means.\u201d Trump, who has promised not to be a \u201cdictator\u201d except on \u201cday one\u201d, will enter office with far fewer guardrails and checks on his power than last time. He will return to Washington with a Republican-controlled Congress and a conservative supreme court, containing three justices he appointed, that ruled he is largely immune from prosecution. He has said of his day one plans: \u201cI want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill.\u201d The immigration issue animated his successful election campaign, often coupled with racist rhetoric and falsehoods. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told Fox News: \u201cWe know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history.\u201d To make it happen he is bringing back Tom Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during his first administration, as his \u201cborder czar\u201d. Homan, 62, has said he will prioritise deporting immigrants illegally in the US who posed safety and security threats as well as those working at job sites. He will receive zealous ideological backing from Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy. An immigration hardliner, the 39-year-old was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump\u2019s priority of mass deportations. At a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York, he adopted nativist language as he asserted that only Trump would stand up and say \u201cAmerica is for Americans and Americans only.\u201d Trump also announced that Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, will serve as the next homeland security secretary, responsible for everything from border protection and immigration to disaster response and the Secret Service. Noem, 52, rose to national prominence after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the coronavirus pandemic. A mass deportation effort could face logistical problems as well as a barrage legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists. But when Trump takes the oath of office on 20 January, his team will be expected to hit the ground running. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cThe world needs to strap in because the first day of the Trump administration has been in the planning for at least a couple of years and so the white papers, the executive orders are already in files and ready to be pulled out. \u201cWe can expect certainly that some of the most radical ideas about curtailing immigration into the United States and then the expelling of unauthorised immigrants within the United States will get a boost from the president making a speech or a press conference followed up with directives to the executive branch. That\u2019ll be off and running day one.\u201d Jacobs added: \u201cWe can also expect a pretty sharp attack on the independence of the judiciary. This is going to be a rupture in the generations-old practice of political independence in terms of the Department of Justice. That\u2019s coming to an end.\u201d Trump has long said the biggest mistake of his first term was choosing the wrong people. He had arrived in Washington as the first president without prior political and military experience and relied on others for personnel recommendations. He felt frustrated at and betrayed by officials who slow-walked or ignored directives they saw as ill-advised. Having beaten Vice-President Kamala Harris in the 5 November election, Trump is determined to avoid that mistake second time around. His blitz of announcements this week shows the premium he places on absolute loyalty. His early to-do list could include imposing sweeping tariffs on imported goods, pardoning supporters involved in the 6 January 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, pulling the US out of the Paris climate agreement, reversing protections for transgender students in schools and fulfilling his campaign promise to end the war between Ukraine and Russia \u201cin a day\u201d. Some have been relatively mainstream selections reassuring to the political class. They include Susie Wiles, 67, who will be the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff, and Senator Marco Rubio, 53, now in line to become the first Latino in the role of secretary of state. Rubio is seen as a foreign policy hawk who has previously taken a hard line on foes including China, Iran and Cuba. Elise Stefanik, 40, a Republican congresswoman and staunch Trump supporter, has been named as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. Mike Waltz, 50, a Republican congressman and retired Army Green Beret, is set to be his national security adviser. And John Ratcliffe, 59, a former director of national intelligence, will serve as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. But other picks have almost seemed to be political performance art, designed to goad and outrage Democrats (\u201cowning the libs\u201d) and impose a loyalty test on the Senate Republicans who will have to decide whether to confirm or reject Trump\u2019s cabinet members, judges and ambassadors. On Tuesday night Trump picked Pete Hegseth as his defence secretary. The 44-year-old is a former co-host of Fox &amp; Friends Weekend on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s conservative Fox News network and once said he \u201chasn\u2019t washed hands in 10 years\u201d because \u201cgerms are not a real thing\u201d. Hegseth, a military veteran, has opined that women should not serve in combat and expressed disdain for the so-called \u201cwoke\u201d policies of Pentagon leaders. In his recent book, The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free, Hegseth wrote: \u201cThe next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. Lots of people need to be fired.\u201d A day later Trump named Tulsi Gabbard, 43, a former Democratic congresswoman and critic of the Biden administration, as his director of national intelligence. Gabbard served in the army national guard for more than two decades, deploying to Iraq and Kuwait. But she secretly met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017 and blamed the US and Nato for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, said: \u201cSo far the candidates range from the unserious to the terrifying. Tulsi Gabbard is going to send a shock wave through the intelligence community and not in a good way. I can tell you that her Putin sympathies being rather evident to everyone around her is going to become a major issue. I\u2019m not sure Tulsi Gabbard can be confirmed.\u201d Perhaps most outlandish, Trump selected Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman and \u201cMake America great again\u201d provocateur, for attorney general. The position of America\u2019s top law enforcement official is potentially central to his plans to carry out mass deportations, pardon January 6 rioters and seek retribution against those who prosecuted him over the past four years. The decision prompted howls of derision and doubts over whether Gaetz, 42, will receive Senate confirmation. He was once the subject of a justice department investigation into sex-trafficking allegations involving underage girls, although it ended last year with no federal charges against him. The staunch Trump loyalist was also under scrutiny by the House ethics committee over allegations including sexual misconduct, although that investigation in effect ended on Wednesday when Gaetz resigned from Congress. Republican and Democratic senators on the judiciary committee that would review Gaetz\u2019s nomination are calling for the findings to be made available to them. Senator Dick Durbin, the Democrat who currently chairs the judiciary committee, said Gaetz \u201cwould be a disaster\u201d in part because of Trump\u2019s threat to use the justice department \u201cto seek revenge on his political enemies\u201d. John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump, described it as \u201cthe worst nomination for a cabinet secretary in American history\u201d. Then, on Thursday, Trump delivered the coup de grace by saying he will nominate Robert Kennedy Jr, 70, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy is one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world. Long advancing the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism, he has said vaccines have caused a \u201cholocaust\u201d and travelled the world spreading false information about the Covid-19 pandemic. Kennedy, the nephew of President John F Kennedy, has also said he would recommend that water agencies stop adding fluoride to drinking water and made a variety of other claims not backed by science, such as questioning whether HIV causes Aids and suggesting antidepressants lead to school shootings. Adding to the mix, Trump named Mike Huckabee, 69, as ambassador to Israel. He has rejected a Palestinian homeland in territory occupied by Israel, calling for a so-called \u201cone-state solution\u201d. He has also denied that the West Bank, seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 six-day war, is under military occupation. Meanwhile the tech billionaire Elon Musk, 53, a campaign surrogate and increasingly close ally, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, 39, will lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency. Trump said the pair will reduce government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut waste and restructure federal agencies. Newt Gingrich, a former Republican speaker in the House of Representatives, defended Trump\u2019s team selection as an effort to bypass the establishment. \u201cEinstein once said, thinking there\u2019ll be a different outcome by doing the same thing over and over again is a sign of insanity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told now for decades that the American people think we\u2019re on the wrong track. We keep hiring people who are marginally more off the track a half-inch and we get the same result. Well, Trump is going to move the track by many feet.\u201d But the rapid-fire onslaught has left many in Washington dazed and confused about the prospect of Trump\u2019s first day in office. Setmayer, co-founder and chief executive of the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, said: \u201cI expect chaos and a series of constitutionally questionable actions exponentially worse than what we saw on day one last time. It\u2019s already started. There will be many of us who said, we warned you.\u201d She added: \u201cThe Trump administration is going to plunge America into a cross between The Hunger Games and The Celebrity Apprentice, unfortunately at great expense to the future of our democracy and the humanity of millions of Americans who will suffer at the hands of this gallery of degenerates. The American electorate fucked around and now they\u2019re going to find out.\u201d \u2022 This story was amended on 19 November 2024 to clarify that Pete Hegseth is a former co-host of Fox &amp; Friends Weekend.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a weekday lunchtime and about 30&nbsp;people, mostly millennials in fashionable hiking trainers, are milling around in an alleyway off London\u2019s Hackney Road. The scent of a wood-fired oven wafts in as everyone waits for the sandwich they preordered the night before; a maximum of 200 will be sold. Rogue Sarnies isn\u2019t the only sandwich place taking preorders these days. Eric\u2019s and Chatsworth Bakehouse, both in London, and Fat Pat\u2019s in Manchester do it too. It speaks to the prudence of the operators \u2013 wasting as little as possible \u2013 and confirms the sandwich as a status symbol, something to post&nbsp;about for clout, replacing burgers and joining baked goods as items to display in foodies\u2019 social media feeds.</p> <p>Sahil Patel and two friends, who live nearby, have been to Rogue Sarnies every Thursday for a month, working their way through the menu. \u201cWe normally get four sandwiches and share,\u201d Patel says. \u201cThere\u2019s a new one today, the bolognese.\u201d All agree that their favourite so far is a stir-fry pork number. The sandwiches are stacked and made with wood-fired bread similar to a crisp pizza base. They also cost north of \u00a310, but \u201cit\u2019s like a three-course meal in one bite\u201d, Patel says.</p>    <p>Sandwiches have changed a great deal since the days of being either a way to use up leftovers, served at afternoon teas or made to order as a basic, affordable lunch staple. A <a href=\"https://flashbackshop.com/products/sandwiches-london-1972\">photograph from 1972</a> regularly does the rounds on social media, showing piles of them in a London shop, with fillings on offer between sliced white bread including ham (13p) and liver sausage (10p).</p> <p>The era of the packaged sandwich began in 1980, thanks to Marks &amp; Spencer. By 2017, Britain\u2019s sandwich industry, led by the ubiquitous meal deal, was worth \u00a38bn. Covid slowed its growth, but in 2021 Bloomberg introduced a \u201cPret Index\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/pret-index/\">to track workers returning to the office</a> \u2013 a sure sign of recovery. Sales in 2022 were up <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/281823/market-value-of-sandwiches-and-baguettes-in-the-uk-from-2007/\">\u00a366m on the year before</a>, creeping back to 2019\u2019s all-time high.</p> <p>Now, we are in the middle of a new, more radical period of change driven by independent operators around the country. The result is that some of Britain\u2019s most delicious food is now served between slices of bread.</p> <p>It is common to see queues and cult outlets in major cities and beyond. Manchester has Rack and Bada Bing as well as Fat Pat\u2019s, and in 2022 local website Eat MCR declared \u201cManchester\u2019s golden age of sandwiches is upon us\u201d. Alby\u2019s is making waves in Edinburgh, and Cabin sells its chicken shawarma sandwiches from a business park in Buckinghamshire. In London, Dom\u2019s Subs, down the road from Rogue Sarnies, opened in 2020 and quickly gained a following. Cured in Crouch End (Italian deli meats in thick focaccia wedges), Chatsworth Bakehouse in Crystal Palace (doorstops with creative fillings such as patatas bravas with romesco sauce, roasted peppers and crunchy fried almonds) and pop-up Wilde\u2019s Deli (modern takes on Jewish classics), currently in Nunhead, all opened after the pandemic. Even restaurants are getting in on the act. A star dish at Jos\u00e9 Pizarro\u2019s Lolo, which recently opened in Bermondsey in south-east London, is a steak sandwich with cheese and peppers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Basically, it\u2019s a little restaurant, but instead of using plates, we\u2019re putting things in bread</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This upstart generation has aspirations. Sandwich Sandwich, a small Bristol chain, launched a branch near St Paul\u2019s in London earlier this year to considerable fanfare, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/pret-prices-sandwich-sandwich-london-b2582473.html\">announcing its desire to take on Pret</a>. This month, it announced a second site in the capital as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sandwichsandwichuk/p/DB1IWf0MPmy/?img_index=1\">3,500 sq ft of sandwich heaven</a>\u201d, saying \u201cwe weren\u2019t joking\u201d about \u201ccoming for some of the biggest players in the industry\u201d. </p> <p>Gourmet sandwiches, like many food trends, are at least in part inspired by the US, where huge, filled sandwiches have always been popular. But here in the UK, prices have prompted <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13489391/Rise-10-sandwich-chefs-rebranding-humble-sarnie-sando-ditching-ham-cheese-fancy-fillings-Gen-Z-social-media.html\">scorn from elements of the press</a>, who have dubbed it a social-media fad \u2013 and there\u2019s no doubt sandwiches do well on TikTok: they are brightly coloured and abundantly stuffed.</p> <p>Fraser Searle started the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_sensationalsandwiches/?hl=en\">Sensational Sandwiches</a> account in 2022 and now has more than 1.5 million followers. He believes there\u2019s a \u201csandwich renaissance. They\u2019re a great platform for trying new combinations and pushing the boat out to make something familiar seem brand new.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s exactly how the current wave began. In November 2014, Max Halley found a site in a quiet north London neighbourhood. Having worked in top restaurants, his logical next step may have been a \u201csmall plates, modern European restaurant looking for a Michelin star. I didn\u2019t want to do that. I thought: what was a thing that had mass appeal but had been&nbsp;largely neglected?\u201d</p>    <p>Burgers were already all the rage, so Halley launched Max\u2019s Sandwich Shop. At first it opened only in the evenings, like a restaurant, and riffed on classic meals: fillings included \u201cham, egg and chips\u201d made with braised ham hock, homemade piccalilli, fried eggs and shoestring fries. Homemade focaccia was favoured over sourdough (\u201ctoo chewy\u201d). They immediately made an impact. \u201cLargely, sandwiches were rubbish for a long time,\u201d says&nbsp;Halley. \u201cMost were from a supermarket and needed to come with a bottle of Coke and crisps to be considered a meal.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic spurred another wave. Chefs pivoted to takeaways, putting skill and creativity into a more portable format. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any specialist equipment and you can make them in a small space,\u201d says Josh Jones, editor of <em>Sandwich</em> magazine. Customers were enticed by the familiarity, quality and ultimately the price, despite the criticisms \u2013 a filling meal for \u00a310 is hard to find these days.</p> <p>In Manchester, I find myself in a slightly seedy backstreet, dodging wheelie bins. At a hole in the wall I find Fat Pat\u2019s; I ring the bell and a server opens the hatch. Fat Pat\u2019s offers huge, American-inspired subs with fillings including Nashville spicy fried chicken and Philly cheesesteak with crispy onions and a gooey five-cheese mix. They aren\u2019t cheap, ranging from \u00a313-17 with a drink, but they are delicious: well balanced with soft bread, crunchy fillings and plenty of sauce.</p> <p>Previously a restaurant chef, Aanish Chauhan opened Fat Pat\u2019s in 2022. \u201cMy brother said, \u2018You can\u2019t do anything here; it\u2019s hidden, you\u2019re in an alleyway.\u2019\u201d Unperturbed, Chauhan spent 10 months developing the perfect sub roll \u2013 soft, yielding to the fillings, but never disintegrating. The \u201cjunk food gourmet sandwiches\u201d, as Chauhan describes them, are all halal, which he says makes them more accessible. A limited menu (just four options) allows him to focus on each option. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in fine dining restaurants and there\u2019s an obsession with making each component as good as it can be. I\u2019ve done that with a sandwich,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>Manchester isn\u2019t the only city outside&nbsp;London where sandwiches are firmly in vogue. Things in Bread, in Leeds \u2013 a diminutive shop a few doors down from a branch of Greggs \u2013 sells up to 300 sandwiches a day. They are British classics \u2013 BLT, tuna mayo, chicken salad \u2013 but made with shokupan, incredibly soft Japanese milk bread, from a&nbsp;local bakery.</p> <p>Tom Stafford opened Things in Bread in 2022. \u201cI hate being compared to meal deals, but that\u2019s kind of what we do. Classic, nostalgic sandwiches, but elevated a bit.\u201d He recommends a humble egg mayo (top tip: always ask the proprietor what their favourite sandwich is). It\u2019s fantastic: huge chunks of egg, lots of cress and plenty of flavour. The secret? A touch of salad cream and pickle juice.</p> <p>Another of Leeds\u2019s most hyped spots is five miles west in the suburb of Bramley, on a quiet high street boasting a Chinese takeaway and kebab shop. The sandwiches at Silver\u2019s Deli are completely different to those at Things in Bread, but equally popular. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty mad since day one,\u201d founder Chris Riley-Smith says. \u201cI&nbsp;love food trends, and I knew sandwiches were going to be massive.\u201d During a cost of living crisis, \u201cpeople still want that luxury of eating out, but they\u2019re not going to spend \u00a325-30 a head every week\u201d. </p>    <p>Like Fat Pat\u2019s, Silver\u2019s looks primarily to the US. The bread is inspired by the hoagie roll and made by a local bakery. Fillings are partly inspired by New York: salt beef with pickles; Swiss cheese and mustard; a meatball sub. Tuna mayo comes with dill, capers, olives, pickled onion and cucumber, and is superb. Chicken and bacon might sound like a supermarket favourite but here&nbsp;the chicken is roasted every morning with thyme, garlic and olive oil, and the aioli is homemade.</p> <p>Back at Rogue Sarnies, I\u2019m in the kitchen on a Wednesday morning, a day before the shop opens. It\u2019s in an annexe of a restaurant run by the same team, and several boxes of produce, from red onions to runner beans, which co-founder Zac Whittle picked up overnight at New Covent Garden market, are being prepped. One kitchen is dedicated to sandwiches and it\u2019s clear they benefit from the same amount of painstaking work as the restaurant\u2019s tasting menu.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a weekday lunchtime and about 30 people, mostly millennials in fashionable hiking trainers, are milling around in an alleyway off London\u2019s Hackney Road. The scent of a wood-fired oven wafts in as everyone waits for the sandwich they preordered the night before; a maximum of 200 will be sold. Rogue Sarnies isn\u2019t the only sandwich place taking preorders these days. Eric\u2019s and Chatsworth Bakehouse, both in London, and Fat Pat\u2019s in Manchester do it too. It speaks to the prudence of the operators \u2013 wasting as little as possible \u2013 and confirms the sandwich as a status symbol, something to post about for clout, replacing burgers and joining baked goods as items to display in foodies\u2019 social media feeds. Sahil Patel and two friends, who live nearby, have been to Rogue Sarnies every Thursday for a month, working their way through the menu. \u201cWe normally get four sandwiches and share,\u201d Patel says. \u201cThere\u2019s a new one today, the bolognese.\u201d All agree that their favourite so far is a stir-fry pork number. The sandwiches are stacked and made with wood-fired bread similar to a crisp pizza base. They also cost north of \u00a310, but \u201cit\u2019s like a three-course meal in one bite\u201d, Patel says. Sandwiches have changed a great deal since the days of being either a way to use up leftovers, served at afternoon teas or made to order as a basic, affordable lunch staple. A photograph from 1972 regularly does the rounds on social media, showing piles of them in a London shop, with fillings on offer between sliced white bread including ham (13p) and liver sausage (10p). The era of the packaged sandwich began in 1980, thanks to Marks &amp; Spencer. By 2017, Britain\u2019s sandwich industry, led by the ubiquitous meal deal, was worth \u00a38bn. Covid slowed its growth, but in 2021 Bloomberg introduced a \u201cPret Index\u201d to track workers returning to the office \u2013 a sure sign of recovery. Sales in 2022 were up \u00a366m on the year before, creeping back to 2019\u2019s all-time high. Now, we are in the middle of a new, more radical period of change driven by independent operators around the country. The result is that some of Britain\u2019s most delicious food is now served between slices of bread. It is common to see queues and cult outlets in major cities and beyond. Manchester has Rack and Bada Bing as well as Fat Pat\u2019s, and in 2022 local website Eat MCR declared \u201cManchester\u2019s golden age of sandwiches is upon us\u201d. Alby\u2019s is making waves in Edinburgh, and Cabin sells its chicken shawarma sandwiches from a business park in Buckinghamshire. In London, Dom\u2019s Subs, down the road from Rogue Sarnies, opened in 2020 and quickly gained a following. Cured in Crouch End (Italian deli meats in thick focaccia wedges), Chatsworth Bakehouse in Crystal Palace (doorstops with creative fillings such as patatas bravas with romesco sauce, roasted peppers and crunchy fried almonds) and pop-up Wilde\u2019s Deli (modern takes on Jewish classics), currently in Nunhead, all opened after the pandemic. Even restaurants are getting in on the act. A star dish at Jos\u00e9 Pizarro\u2019s Lolo, which recently opened in Bermondsey in south-east London, is a steak sandwich with cheese and peppers. This upstart generation has aspirations. Sandwich Sandwich, a small Bristol chain, launched a branch near St Paul\u2019s in London earlier this year to considerable fanfare, announcing its desire to take on Pret. This month, it announced a second site in the capital as \u201c3,500 sq ft of sandwich heaven\u201d, saying \u201cwe weren\u2019t joking\u201d about \u201ccoming for some of the biggest players in the industry\u201d. Gourmet sandwiches, like many food trends, are at least in part inspired by the US, where huge, filled sandwiches have always been popular. But here in the UK, prices have prompted scorn from elements of the press, who have dubbed it a social-media fad \u2013 and there\u2019s no doubt sandwiches do well on TikTok: they are brightly coloured and abundantly stuffed. Fraser Searle started the Sensational Sandwiches account in 2022 and now has more than 1.5 million followers. He believes there\u2019s a \u201csandwich renaissance. They\u2019re a great platform for trying new combinations and pushing the boat out to make something familiar seem brand new.\u201d That\u2019s exactly how the current wave began. In November 2014, Max Halley found a site in a quiet north London neighbourhood. Having worked in top restaurants, his logical next step may have been a \u201csmall plates, modern European restaurant looking for a Michelin star. I didn\u2019t want to do that. I thought: what was a thing that had mass appeal but had been largely neglected?\u201d Burgers were already all the rage, so Halley launched Max\u2019s Sandwich Shop. At first it opened only in the evenings, like a restaurant, and riffed on classic meals: fillings included \u201cham, egg and chips\u201d made with braised ham hock, homemade piccalilli, fried eggs and shoestring fries. Homemade focaccia was favoured over sourdough (\u201ctoo chewy\u201d). They immediately made an impact. \u201cLargely, sandwiches were rubbish for a long time,\u201d says Halley. \u201cMost were from a supermarket and needed to come with a bottle of Coke and crisps to be considered a meal.\u201d The pandemic spurred another wave. Chefs pivoted to takeaways, putting skill and creativity into a more portable format. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any specialist equipment and you can make them in a small space,\u201d says Josh Jones, editor of Sandwich magazine. Customers were enticed by the familiarity, quality and ultimately the price, despite the criticisms \u2013 a filling meal for \u00a310 is hard to find these days. In Manchester, I find myself in a slightly seedy backstreet, dodging wheelie bins. At a hole in the wall I find Fat Pat\u2019s; I ring the bell and a server opens the hatch. Fat Pat\u2019s offers huge, American-inspired subs with fillings including Nashville spicy fried chicken and Philly cheesesteak with crispy onions and a gooey five-cheese mix. They aren\u2019t cheap, ranging from \u00a313-17 with a drink, but they are delicious: well balanced with soft bread, crunchy fillings and plenty of sauce. Previously a restaurant chef, Aanish Chauhan opened Fat Pat\u2019s in 2022. \u201cMy brother said, \u2018You can\u2019t do anything here; it\u2019s hidden, you\u2019re in an alleyway.\u2019\u201d Unperturbed, Chauhan spent 10 months developing the perfect sub roll \u2013 soft, yielding to the fillings, but never disintegrating. The \u201cjunk food gourmet sandwiches\u201d, as Chauhan describes them, are all halal, which he says makes them more accessible. A limited menu (just four options) allows him to focus on each option. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in fine dining restaurants and there\u2019s an obsession with making each component as good as it can be. I\u2019ve done that with a sandwich,\u201d he says. Manchester isn\u2019t the only city outside London where sandwiches are firmly in vogue. Things in Bread, in Leeds \u2013 a diminutive shop a few doors down from a branch of Greggs \u2013 sells up to 300 sandwiches a day. They are British classics \u2013 BLT, tuna mayo, chicken salad \u2013 but made with shokupan, incredibly soft Japanese milk bread, from a local bakery. Tom Stafford opened Things in Bread in 2022. \u201cI hate being compared to meal deals, but that\u2019s kind of what we do. Classic, nostalgic sandwiches, but elevated a bit.\u201d He recommends a humble egg mayo (top tip: always ask the proprietor what their favourite sandwich is). It\u2019s fantastic: huge chunks of egg, lots of cress and plenty of flavour. The secret? A touch of salad cream and pickle juice. Another of Leeds\u2019s most hyped spots is five miles west in the suburb of Bramley, on a quiet high street boasting a Chinese takeaway and kebab shop. The sandwiches at Silver\u2019s Deli are completely different to those at Things in Bread, but equally popular. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty mad since day one,\u201d founder Chris Riley-Smith says. \u201cI love food trends, and I knew sandwiches were going to be massive.\u201d During a cost of living crisis, \u201cpeople still want that luxury of eating out, but they\u2019re not going to spend \u00a325-30 a head every week\u201d. Like Fat Pat\u2019s, Silver\u2019s looks primarily to the US. The bread is inspired by the hoagie roll and made by a local bakery. Fillings are partly inspired by New York: salt beef with pickles; Swiss cheese and mustard; a meatball sub. Tuna mayo comes with dill, capers, olives, pickled onion and cucumber, and is superb. Chicken and bacon might sound like a supermarket favourite but here the chicken is roasted every morning with thyme, garlic and olive oil, and the aioli is homemade. Back at Rogue Sarnies, I\u2019m in the kitchen on a Wednesday morning, a day before the shop opens. It\u2019s in an annexe of a restaurant run by the same team, and several boxes of produce, from red onions to runner beans, which co-founder Zac Whittle picked up overnight at New Covent Garden market, are being prepped. One kitchen is dedicated to sandwiches and it\u2019s clear they benefit from the same amount of painstaking work as the restaurant\u2019s tasting menu. Chefs roast kilos of chicken bones for a jus, there\u2019s a wagyu topside on the counter, and a huge porchetta is resting. Almost everything in the sandwiches, from grilled vegetables to the bread itself, is cooked in a small wood-fired oven. Tomorrow, the sandwiches will be assembled, heated and served. \u201cWe adopt the same approach as in the restaurant,\u201d Whittle says. \u201cWe don\u2019t dumb it down. Basically, it\u2019s a little restaurant but instead of using plates, we\u2019re putting things in bread.\u201d What does he make of criticisms about the price? \u201cSandwiches for a tenner? Yeah, it\u2019s a lot of money, but I sleep well at night knowing the work that goes into them.\u201d Halley\u2019s mantra is \u201chot-cold, sweet-sour, crunchy-soft. In those three core contrasts, deliciousness lies.\u201d For Stafford, the perfect sandwich should provide \u201cevery ingredient with every bite\u201d. Riley-Smith adds that something as simple as dressing the salad can elevate a sandwich. Is it a fad? \u201cIt does seem to be the in-thing,\u201d Whittle says, \u201cbut we have people who come back every week. If there wasn\u2019t a foundation to it, it would eventually peter out.\u201d At 6pm on a Wednesday I scroll through Rogue Sarnies\u2019 website and order a zucchini zest. It\u2019s stuffed with wood-fired courgettes, borlotti beans and chervil, with sweet tomatoes, cooling burrata and lemony dressing.

      "body": "<p>In March 2012, Lola Young, who sits as a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, clambered on to the rush-hour bus that would take her from the children\u2019s social care office in Islington, north London, to her home. In her arms was a box: a collection of papers she was so anxious to open she did it there on the bottom deck of the number 38, spreading the pages precariously across her lap. Names, dates, brief notes about prams and the application of olive oil to infant skin\u2026</p> <p>As the bus wove and lurched, Young read the story of the beginning of her life, and already there was so much to take in. On 30 July 1951, a baby with her name was, she learned, delivered to a Daisy Vince of 207 Tufnell Park Road \u2013 a baby that was then eight weeks old, rather than six, as she\u2019d always been told. The traffic inched along, and as it did, she wondered\u2026 What difference does a fortnight make? None, probably. But if she\u2019d been misinformed about this, there was surely more news to come.</p> <p>The documents were far more numerous than Young had imagined \u2013 for a long time, it had seemed as if Islington council might have lost her file altogether \u2013 and a lot more reading lay ahead, some of it consoling, and some very upsetting. In the end, though, better to have done it than not. She has no regrets. \u201cI\u2019d written an autobiography before I began trying to find my records,\u201d she says, once we\u2019ve found our way to the room in the Palace of Westminster where we\u2019ll talk (after 20 years in the Lords, she still gets lost in its warren of corridors). \u201cBut it didn\u2019t settle with me until I had them. They were an archive of my life, and they provided a kind of anchor: a through line for the story.\u201d Last March, two decades after she first learned she was legally entitled to access her files and 55 years after she left the care of the London borough of Islington, she finally finished reworking it \u2013 and now she\u2019s about to publish the result.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I had some horrible moments growing up\u2026 but I\u2019m old now and I\u2019ve met so many people in the most desperate of circumstances</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Does this feel like a full stop? She smiles. \u201cI\u2019m glad I got it out of my system. But it\u2019s more of a semicolon than a full stop.\u201d Her life these days is hugely successful and replete, but the fallout from a childhood in care goes on, as it doubtless will for ever. \u201cIt [her childhood] is contested,\u201d she says, a reference to a member of her birth family who disputes her account of events. So many people are involved. She\u2019s close to her adult son, Gregg, and reading her book has, she tells me, been painful for him: \u201cHe has strong views about the situation.\u201d</p> <p>What about his father? Young divorced her husband several years ago, but they remain close friends. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak for him now, but I know that when we first started going out, he was incredibly moved [by what had happened to her]. I used to end up feeling sorry for him. I sort of felt I had to comfort him, that I had to say: it\u2019s all right, you know?\u201d</p>    <p>Her husband would tell her that it really <em>wasn\u2019t</em> all right \u2013 and he was correct to do so. But human beings are extraordinary: \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not scarred. But scars do fade.\u201d The years she has spent working on behalf of the \u201ccare experienced\u201d have, she insists, given her a sharp sense of perspective. \u201cI remember telling someone when I first looked into the policy side of this that I had three different social workers as a child, and they said: well, you were lucky because some kids now have 33. I had some horrible moments growing up, some really difficult moments. But I\u2019m old now [she is 73] and I do feel that I\u2019ve met so many people in the most desperate of circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in care needn\u2019t define a person, she says, but it does shape them. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s offensive to ask if what I went through made me the person I am today. I\u2019d rather <em>not</em> have had those experiences, of course. But it\u2019s a sliding doors thing. What if, instead of refusing, I\u2019d said: yes, Mother, I will come to Lagos with you? That would have been one life. Or what if I\u2019d said, yes, Father, I\u2019ll live with you and your family after all? That would have been another life. Or what if someone had adopted me when I was a year old? Another life there. They all would have been different, but what\u2019s the point of thinking like that?\u201d She sounds straightforward as she says this, almost upbeat. But I\u2019ve read her book \u2013 it made me sad and furious \u2013 and thanks to this, I know that life taught her long ago not to daydream.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Young spent her first years in a world that brings to mind the fiction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/27/biography\">Patrick Hamilton</a>. Her Nigerian parents, who were not married (her father already had a family at home), had come to the UK to train and to work, and an unexpected baby was something they were seemingly neither able nor willing to take care of. And so, Daisy Vince stepped in: one of only two women in the area who were willing to foster black children. But the arrangement was unofficial. Vince received no money from the council for Young\u2019s care, and though health visitors and social workers visited periodically, recording their impressions of mother and child in their notes \u2013 \u201c20 July 1952: Well &amp; happy. Has won a prize at a baby show recently\u201d \u2013 they were hands-off by today\u2019s standards. It was, perhaps, a case of out of sight, out of mind. No one thought to query the situation.</p> <p>Vince was a widow and by 1951, on her way to being elderly. \u201cShe was born in 1886,\u201d says Young, a date that seems, in context, scarcely credible. \u201cI\u2019ve a photograph of her with her sister aged about 15, and they\u2019re in long pinafore dresses, like something out of Conan Doyle.\u201d Her tall Victorian house in Tufnell Park had been divided into four flats. On the ground floor lived two middle-aged single women. Above them, lived Daisy\u2019s daughter and granddaughter.</p> <p>Vince, a longstanding foster parent, lived in the basement. It had a kitchen, a front room, a scullery, and one bedroom, in which she and all the foster children slept together. When Young first arrived, there were two other children living there. Their fortnightly bath night was, she recalls, \u201ca palaver\u201d: buckets and saucepans had to be filled with water and heated on the stove in the scullery; these were then carried carefully into the front room, where a tin bath stood by the fire.</p> <p>Vince was, in her own way, kind and encouraging to Young, and so were her extended family: at Christmas, there were lots of presents. But the times were racist, and so, at moments, were Vince\u2019s daughter and son-in-law. \u201cDaisy was unusual, I think,\u201d says Young. \u201cShe used to tell me Africans were more intelligent than white people, perhaps because she had only encountered those who were here to study medicine, the law, chemistry.\u201d Tufnell Park was shabbily genteel, and very white, and so, later, was her secondary school. \u201cMost black people who came here then were from the Caribbean; they were in west London, not our patch of Islington. There just weren\u2019t many black children around.\u201d The only black child she knew well was her cousin, who also came to live with Vince. The two of them were \u2013 and still are \u2013 close.</p> <p>Reading about this, one\u2019s mind fills with questions. Why did Vince cleave to Young, even in the face of resistance from her family? (Daisy was firmly against the idea of Young being taken into official council care.) And what of Young\u2019s biological parents? Her cousin\u2019s parents visited regularly, and gave Vince money for her keep, but Young\u2019s were mostly absent, and cash rarely forthcoming. At first, I tried to believe they must have been in some kind of hell. Perhaps, I thought, Young\u2019s illegitimacy had brought shame to them, or maybe they were working all hours, struggling financially.</p>    <p>However, as the years tick by, and they never return, it becomes apparent they\u2019ve chosen to abandon their daughter, and that their parsimony has nothing to do with circumstance. As Young suggested earlier, both of them later gave her the option to live with them in Nigeria. But when she refused \u2013 she didn\u2019t know them; she wanted to stay with Vince and her schoolfriends \u2013 they didn\u2019t press her; they shrugged and went home to pack their suitcases. Onwards, and upwards. In Nigeria, Young\u2019s father went on to become an important and wealthy man: a judge with a big reputation and his own driver.</p> <p>Young cannot really provide any answers. All she will say of Vince is that she\u2019d had a hard life. Her father died when she was young, she\u2019d lost two husbands; on some level, perhaps, she needed to be needed. As for her biological parents, she can only agree with me. \u201cNeither my father nor my mother dragged me, screaming and kicking, on to the ship that was sailing to Lagos. I\u2019d love to know why they acted as they did \u2013 that\u2019s one of the things I hoped to find in my records \u2013 but there is no explanation. They just sort of\u2026 cut the link.\u201d Memories are, she insists, often fuzzy. But even her adult encounters with them \u2013 they\u2019re both dead now \u2013 were chilly and unyielding. She went to Lagos once for a family wedding, and it was agonising (an experience she recounts in her book). She has travelled widely in Africa, but she will never return to Nigeria.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Young liked school: the girlfriends she made there, a kind of surrogate family, are still her close gang. But she never felt secure, knowing the arrangement with Vince could end at any moment \u2013 and as things would turn out, she was right to feel this. When she was 14, Vince died. Life changed overnight. At first, she went to live with her cousin, whose parents now wanted her back. But she was a cuckoo in their nest. In the end, she had to go. The only option was a children\u2019s home. It was a long way out of London, and it took her hours to get to and from school. In the winter, she hated the walk down a dark country lane. And the place was noisy, chaotic. It was hard to be studious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Systems are usually designed to perpetuate the system, not to serve the people who encounter it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Did she miss Vince? Had she loved the woman she always called Mum? This isn\u2019t something she writes in her book. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever asked me that question before,\u201d she says. \u201cThis sounds\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what love was.\u201d She thinks. \u201cWhat are the components of love? You want to please somebody. You want to feel that they matter, and you matter. You want to feel wanted.\u201d The truth is that she doesn\u2019t <em>know</em> if she loved her.</p> <p>She hoped to go to university but she failed to get the grades \u2013 and now, aged 18, she was on her own, the council free of its responsibilities towards her. For me, this is both the most heartbreaking section of her book, and the most inspiriting. In her rented room, she gets herself together, and on she goes. She works in an administrative job, and in a children\u2019s home. She trains as an actor, and appears in <em>Play School </em>and <em>Metal Mickey</em>. She goes to university, and becomes an academic. Finally, she applies to become a so-called people\u2019s peer, succeeding on her second go to become Baroness Young of Hornsey. And she has a family, too. \u201cI used to say I\u2019d never have children. I didn\u2019t want them to go through what I had. But in the end I realised that, whoever my child turned out to be, all I had to do was to make sure they always felt loved.\u201d Did she fear abandonment herself? \u201cMaybe that was underneath. But my principal feeling was more puzzlement than fear. I would always think: why does that person like me? Why does she want to be my friend?\u201d</p> <p>Before I go, we talk about what has changed for the better for children in care, and what is worse \u2013 the issues that keep her at her desk in the Lords even as she thinks about retirement. \u201cSystems are usually designed to perpetuate the system, not to serve the people who encounter it,\u201d she says. \u201cSome changes have been good. There have been improvements in record-keeping; children receive a memory box now. If you and your foster carer are in agreement, you can stay with them now past the age of 18. At 18, some local authorities will also put you to the top of the housing list. But [on the negative side] children are often constantly moved, and to places where you wouldn\u2019t want to put them; where there is criminal activity going on. Children\u2019s homes have been privatised and, run for a profit, the accommodation they offer is often substandard.\u201d</p>    <p>At the root of all this, however, is the stark fact that there are 100,000 children in care in England and Wales. Why are they, and what can be done to reduce such numbers? There are not nearly enough black foster carers, she says, and while the ideal is that black children be placed with black parents, absolutes are not always useful here. \u201cWhat I am saying is that these things are complicated. For example, I know of some couples where only one partner is black, but social workers felt they had a lifestyle that wasn\u2019t right for a mixed-heritage or black child because it was too middle class, essentially. There is this idea of essential blackness, that if you don\u2019t go to carnival or listen to reggae\u2026 \u201d</p> <p>The phrase \u201cpeople who look like me\u201d irks her. \u201cIt\u2019s an oversimplification.\u201d Difference is important, but the differences even well-meaning people infer when it comes to skin colour are often dubious. \u201cDoes it mean, you know, that I\u2019m supposed to be a better dancer than you?\u201d Actually, she probably <em>is</em> a better dancer than me, I say: I\u2019m a total embarrassment under a glitter ball. She laughs. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen me on the dancefloor!\u201d</p> <p>After this we set off, back through the warren, looking for a lift she\u2019d never used before this morning. Does she like being a baroness? She tells me that it took her a long time to learn the ropes, and as she writes in her book, soon after she was introduced, an elderly peer made a racial slur in her presence. But the place has changed a lot, and her title is a useful weapon in her armoury (her areas of interest include the fashion industry and modern slavery as well as child protection; she is founding co-chair of the all-party parliamentary groups on <a href=\"https://appgfashion.co.uk/\">ethics and sustainability for fashion</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.unglobalcompact.org.uk/all-party-parliamentary-group-on-sport-modern-slavery-and-human-rights/\">sport, modern slavery and human rights</a>): \u201cWalk into a room where people know you\u2019re Baroness This or Lord That, and it makes a difference. I would say it makes too much difference, but I try to ride with it, and to use it for the better.\u201d In a courtyard at last, we say goodbye, and as she disappears briskly around a corner, all I can think is that I\u2019ve truly never been happier to be just another item on someone else\u2019s to-do list.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Eight Weeks: Looking Back, Moving Forwards, Defying the Odds</em> by Lola Young is published on 28 November by Fig Tree (\u00a318.99).

She went to Lagos once for a family wedding, and it was agonising (an experience she recounts in her book). She has travelled widely in Africa, but she will never return to Nigeria. *** Young liked school: the girlfriends she made there, a kind of surrogate family, are still her close gang. But she never felt secure, knowing the arrangement with Vince could end at any moment \u2013 and as things would turn out, she was right to feel this. When she was 14, Vince died. Life changed overnight. At first, she went to live with her cousin, whose parents now wanted her back. But she was a cuckoo in their nest. In the end, she had to go. The only option was a children\u2019s home. It was a long way out of London, and it took her hours to get to and from school. In the winter, she hated the walk down a dark country lane. And the place was noisy, chaotic. It was hard to be studious. Did she miss Vince? Had she loved the woman she always called Mum? This isn\u2019t something she writes in her book. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever asked me that question before,\u201d she says. \u201cThis sounds\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what love was.\u201d She thinks. \u201cWhat are the components of love? You want to please somebody. You want to feel that they matter, and you matter. You want to feel wanted.\u201d The truth is that she doesn\u2019t know if she loved her. She hoped to go to university but she failed to get the grades \u2013 and now, aged 18, she was on her own, the council free of its responsibilities towards her. For me, this is both the most heartbreaking section of her book, and the most inspiriting. In her rented room, she gets herself together, and on she goes. She works in an administrative job, and in a children\u2019s home. She trains as an actor, and appears in Play School and Metal Mickey. She goes to university, and becomes an academic. Finally, she applies to become a so-called people\u2019s peer, succeeding on her second go to become Baroness Young of Hornsey. And she has a family, too. \u201cI used to say I\u2019d never have children. I didn\u2019t want them to go through what I had. But in the end I realised that, whoever my child turned out to be, all I had to do was to make sure they always felt loved.\u201d Did she fear abandonment herself? \u201cMaybe that was underneath. But my principal feeling was more puzzlement than fear. I would always think: why does that person like me? Why does she want to be my friend?\u201d Before I go, we talk about what has changed for the better for children in care, and what is worse \u2013 the issues that keep her at her desk in the Lords even as she thinks about retirement. \u201cSystems are usually designed to perpetuate the system, not to serve the people who encounter it,\u201d she says. \u201cSome changes have been good. There have been improvements in record-keeping; children receive a memory box now. If you and your foster carer are in agreement, you can stay with them now past the age of 18. At 18, some local authorities will also put you to the top of the housing list. But [on the negative side] children are often constantly moved, and to places where you wouldn\u2019t want to put them; where there is criminal activity going on. Children\u2019s homes have been privatised and, run for a profit, the accommodation they offer is often substandard.\u201d At the root of all this, however, is the stark fact that there are 100,000 children in care in England and Wales. Why are they, and what can be done to reduce such numbers? There are not nearly enough black foster carers, she says, and while the ideal is that black children be placed with black parents, absolutes are not always useful here. \u201cWhat I am saying is that these things are complicated. For example, I know of some couples where only one partner is black, but social workers felt they had a lifestyle that wasn\u2019t right for a mixed-heritage or black child because it was too middle class, essentially. There is this idea of essential blackness, that if you don\u2019t go to carnival or listen to reggae\u2026 \u201d The phrase \u201cpeople who look like me\u201d irks her. \u201cIt\u2019s an oversimplification.\u201d Difference is important, but the differences even well-meaning people infer when it comes to skin colour are often dubious. \u201cDoes it mean, you know, that I\u2019m supposed to be a better dancer than you?\u201d Actually, she probably is a better dancer than me, I say: I\u2019m a total embarrassment under a glitter ball. She laughs. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen me on the dancefloor!\u201d After this we set off, back through the warren, looking for a lift she\u2019d never used before this morning. Does she like being a baroness? She tells me that it took her a long time to learn the ropes, and as she writes in her book, soon after she was introduced, an elderly peer made a racial slur in her presence. But the place has changed a lot, and her title is a useful weapon in her armoury (her areas of interest include the fashion industry and modern slavery as well as child protection; she is founding co-chair of the all-party parliamentary groups on ethics and sustainability for fashion; and sport, modern slavery and human rights): \u201cWalk into a room where people know you\u2019re Baroness This or Lord That, and it makes a difference. I would say it makes too much difference, but I try to ride with it, and to use it for the better.\u201d In a courtyard at last, we say goodbye, and as she disappears briskly around a corner, all I can think is that I\u2019ve truly never been happier to be just another item on someone else\u2019s to-do list.

      "body": "<p>How charged and potent words can be. And how they can mislead. The title of British playwright Mike Bartlett\u2019s 2009 play is principally a reference to the cockfights he saw in Mexico. But this bait-and-switch is merely the starting gun of a play about the slipperiness of language and labels: gay, straight, boyfriend, brother. Their elasticity is strained and snapped.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tension that buzzes through this new production \u2013 the first time the play has been seen in the north of England. Joe Gill plays John, the only named character, who confesses to his boyfriend, M, at the start to cheating on him with a woman, W. The play rolls through the fallout, rewinds to John\u2019s first encounter with W, then culminates in them all meeting for a prickly dinner.</p> <p><em>Cock</em> \u2013 first staged in 2009 \u2013 dates from Bartlett\u2019s early career, before he turned to political subjects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/13/charles-iii-birdland-small-family-business-review\">King Charles III</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/17/the-great-middlemarch-mystery-coventry-review-the-47th-mike-bartlett-bertie-carvel-old-vic-for-black-boys-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-hue-gets-too-heavy-ryan-calais-cameron-royal-court\">Donald Trump</a>. But it was a time when sexual fluidity was less examined \u2013 and accepted \u2013 than today, and the drama hangs on an obligation to define your sexuality that feels a little dated.</p> <p>Director Rupert Hill confidently controls the bombast of Bartlett\u2019s script, with its elaborate metaphors and narrated sex scene, so it lands less like engineered provocation. Gill\u2019s John, described as \u201cfudge\u201d, droops and sags like a marionette awaiting a puppeteer. John O\u2019Neill\u2019s M glowers, his frenzied agitation suggesting insecurity about John from the start. Hannah Ellis Ryan is poised and needle-like as the disruptor. If they overgesticulate, the effect is of characters grasping for fixed points and physical connection.</p> <p>The volleying and jockeying plays out on a chalked rectangle resembling a sports court, audience on either side of the traverse stage. The characters hurl insults at each other like darts, often leaning forward and finishing with the jab of a finger. This is love and lust as blood sport.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cock-by-mike-bartlett-tickets-995072026217\">Cock</a></em><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cock-by-mike-bartlett-tickets-995072026217\"> is at 53two, Manchester, until 17 November</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "How charged and potent words can be. And how they can mislead. The title of British playwright Mike Bartlett\u2019s 2009 play is principally a reference to the cockfights he saw in Mexico. But this bait-and-switch is merely the starting gun of a play about the slipperiness of language and labels: gay, straight, boyfriend, brother. Their elasticity is strained and snapped. It\u2019s a tension that buzzes through this new production \u2013 the first time the play has been seen in the north of England. Joe Gill plays John, the only named character, who confesses to his boyfriend, M, at the start to cheating on him with a woman, W. The play rolls through the fallout, rewinds to John\u2019s first encounter with W, then culminates in them all meeting for a prickly dinner. Cock \u2013 first staged in 2009 \u2013 dates from Bartlett\u2019s early career, before he turned to political subjects such as King Charles III and Donald Trump. But it was a time when sexual fluidity was less examined \u2013 and accepted \u2013 than today, and the drama hangs on an obligation to define your sexuality that feels a little dated. Director Rupert Hill confidently controls the bombast of Bartlett\u2019s script, with its elaborate metaphors and narrated sex scene, so it lands less like engineered provocation. Gill\u2019s John, described as \u201cfudge\u201d, droops and sags like a marionette awaiting a puppeteer. John O\u2019Neill\u2019s M glowers, his frenzied agitation suggesting insecurity about John from the start. Hannah Ellis Ryan is poised and needle-like as the disruptor. If they overgesticulate, the effect is of characters grasping for fixed points and physical connection. The volleying and jockeying plays out on a chalked rectangle resembling a sports court, audience on either side of the traverse stage. The characters hurl insults at each other like darts, often leaning forward and finishing with the jab of a finger. This is love and lust as blood sport. \u2022 Cock is at 53two, Manchester, until 17 November",

He and Cheramie ventured out on 7 November to the chambers of New Orleans\u2019 city council, where civic leaders honored Scrim for displaying \u201cresilience\u201d, as one of the body\u2019s members worded it. The plan was for Scrim to stay at Cheramie\u2019s home to recover from his wounds before he was again put up for adoption. Yet Scrim turned that plan on its head when, according to what Cheramie told Nola.com, he chewed through the screen of an open second-story window, squeezed through and leapt out. Cheramie wrote on Instagram that soon her team was distributing flyers and knocking on doors, asking people to keep a lookout for Scrim as a second search for him got under way. \u201cI am not focusing on his escape but focusing all my mental energy on safely capturing him again,\u201d Cheramie\u2019s post said. \u201cIt took all of us coming together to find him last time. I am asking for your help again.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You know the Bank of Mum and Dad when you see it: it\u2019s your friend who seems broke, but always has a safety net, or who suddenly (but discreetly) acquires the deposit for a home. It\u2019s those who stayed with their parents while they saved for a flat, or stuck it out in a profession they were passionate about even though the wages are chronically low. It\u2019s those who do not need to consider the financial costs of having children. It\u2019s those whose grandparents are covering nursery or university fees, with the Bank of Grandma and Grandad already driving an economic wedge between different cohorts in generations Alpha (born between 2010 and 2024) and Z (born in the late 1990s and early 2000s).</p> <p>This is the picture we know, but the Bank of Mum and Dad is not just a luxury confined to the 1% \u2013 it is also evident in families like mine. I grew up in a working-class household and was the first person in my family to get a degree, but it was the fact my parents had scrimped in the 1980s to purchase properties in London (and allowed me to crash in one throughout my 20s) that has arguably been the true source of opportunities in my life.</p> <p>My parents were subversive punks whose working-class roots also meant that the notion of getting ideas above your station never fully wore off. My great-aunt was a Pearly Queen, and we really did all stand around the piano bashing out Maybe it\u2019s Because I\u2019m a Londoner. But inspired by Thatcher\u2019s vision of a property-owning democracy, in the 1980s my parents invested in two houses in Tooting and, crucially, held on to them. By the turn of the millennium, they were sitting on property wealth that was gaining value at a rate they could never have imagined. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008 my parents had become paper millionaires. It was a degree of wealth they had never expected and we, as a family, were only forced to confront when my father died in 2018.</p> <p>But is this really the true story? Or have I just fed you a \u201cworking-class done good\u201d tale, because that\u2019s how I attempt to justify my own exceedingly privileged position? One academic investigation into the Bank of Mum and Dad found that its beneficiaries tend to frame this considerable financial support not in terms of their own individual privilege, but as evidence of their parents\u2019 hard work and upward mobility. Whereas once parents lived vicariously through their children\u2019s successes, now it seems their kids live vicariously through their parents\u2019 struggles. And there lies the problem.</p>    <p>In recent years, we have rightly widened the conversation about privilege in society. And yet how honest are we about one of the most obvious forces shaping anyone under 45: the presence or absence of a parental safety net? The truth is that we live in an inheritocracy. If you\u2019ve grown up in the 21st century, your opportunities are increasingly determined by your access to the Bank of Mum and Dad, rather than by what you earn or learn. The economic roots of this story go back to the 1980s, but it accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis, as private wealth soared and wage growth stalled. In the 2020s, rather than a meritocracy \u2013 where hard work pays off \u2013 we have evolved into an inheritocracy, based on family wealth.</p> <p>Young people\u2019s frustration is so pronounced these days because this reality runs contrary to what we were told growing up. Then the message was, work hard, get a degree and you will be rewarded. Education was increasingly geared towards exams and qualifications, with little options for those unsuited to this system. But, as more of us became graduates, the price of a degree went up and its value went down.</p> <p>Increasingly, it became about our parents\u2019 ability to \u201cinvest\u201d in these talents as the real source of opportunity and the key definer of our class, status and success. As <a href=\"https://www.pensionbee.com/uk/blog/authors/becky-o-connor#:~:text=Becky%20is%20PensionBee's%20Director%20(VP,personal%20finance%20and%20investment%20issues.\">Becky O\u2019Connor</a> from pension provider PensionBee tells me: \u201cParents have become the gatekeepers to their children\u2019s adulthood, the wealth level of the previous generation ultimately determining which milestones are achievable and which are not.\u201d Inheritocracy is the driver of milestone culture.</p> <p>For a long time much of the intergenerational debate focused on how lucky the baby boomers were and how unlucky millennials are. This duality is not just unhelpful, it\u2019s also increasingly untrue. In 2010, David Willetts wrote <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/07/the-pinch-david-willetts\">The Pinch</a></em>, an economic dissection of baby boomer privilege and millennials\u2019 hardship that would become a narrative for millennials frustrated at the level of intergenerational unfairness. But when I spoke to Willetts, he admitted that over the past 10 years the dynamic had changed. It was no longer about intergenerational unfairness as such, but intragenerational unfairness, with the new dependency culture within the family halting social mobility. \u201cIt is absolutely making the family more significant,\u201d he said. But Willetts\u2019s framing here is important because what some describe as the growing \u201cimportance of the family\u201d, others call the unfair privilege of birth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is absolutely making the family more significant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At a time when the market has become dysfunctional and the state retracted, the family has stepped up. It is a dynamic that the economist <a href=\"https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/j.sefton\">James Sefton</a> likes to call \u201cgood parents, poor citizens\u201d. And it\u2019s a dynamic that has provided untold opportunity, for some. In an inheritocracy, certain advantages really matter: those whose parents are together, those who live in the south-east, those who are only children, those whose parents are able to \u201cgift\u201d an early inheritance and, to be blunt, those whose parents do not live too long or have complex expensive caring needs. Knowing that my own tale was a uniquely London-centric, female, white privileged experience, I set out to discover this mosaic of family stories across Britain.</p> <p><em><strong>I spoke to Tom, 34,</strong></em> who had been supported through private education and Oxford, but had mixed feelings about the springboard his parents had given him in his 20s and 30s as they indulged him in his dream of becoming an actor. \u201cI moved into my mother\u2019s central London flat that she got free with her job. I was being completely financed,\u201d he admits. Tom made money during this time, but \u201cit was about earning enough to maintain a bit of respect, nothing substantial\u201d. After seven years of trying to carve out an acting career, Tom decided to pack it in. Looking back, he now has regrets about this period in his life. \u201cI was just so fucking lazy. I wish someone had said to me: \u2018You should be earning more money; you have a lot of advantages.\u2019 I didn\u2019t take advantage of that properly. I count that as a personal failure.\u201d Now married and a father, Tom laments that he will not be able to recreate for his son the life his parents gave him.</p> <p>If Tom was an inheritocrat, I spoke to many meritocrats, those who had made it in modern Britain with little parental help, but this came with much resentment. Greg, 31, describes himself as a working-class boy from Surrey. Raised in a single-parent household, when he was 16 his mum told him that if he wanted financial freedom, he was going to have to work for it. Greg graduated from a top-class London university and found himself on a graduate scheme in London, tutoring rich kids on the side, something he ended up hugely resenting. \u201cI actually went to counselling to get over my anger at other people\u2019s wealth and family support\u2026 I was tutoring all these wealthy kids who literally had everything on a plate, and I found it quite depressing, as here I was scrimping for \u00a3100.

This sets up a different dynamic: \u201cYou don\u2019t even feel that there is an obligation because they are your parents; you want to look after them.\u201d All these testimonies attest to how our inheritance stories are as much to do with the state of our familial bonds, cultural heritage and lived experience as the state of the housing market or inheritance tax thresholds.</p> <p>As the economist Thomas Piketty set out in his 2013 book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/capital-twenty-first-century-thomas-piketty-review\">Capital in the </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/capital-twenty-first-century-thomas-piketty-review\">Twenty-First Century</a></em>, inheritance and the divides it reveals have always existed but, if anything, we are returning to the dynamics and characteristics of the 19th century. Today\u2019s family tales of misfortune and opportunity echo the pages of Dickens, and the modern dating game resembles the pages of Austen. While interracial relationships have increased, inter-class relationships have seemingly declined. In one UK survey, 40% of upper-class participants said they would not even consider entering a long-term relationship with someone from a different social class. A <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/the-million-dollar-be-question-inheritances-gifts-and-their-implications-for-generational-living-standards/\">recent report</a> from the Resolution Foundation concluded that: \u201cPeople tend to couple up with those who have similar inheritance expectations to their own.\u201d The latest TikTok trend may be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/marrying-a-finance-man\">marrying a finance man</a>\u201d, but a more accurate piece of advice, perhaps, should be to marry someone <em>whose dad</em> was a finance man.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A more accurate piece of advice, perhaps, should be to marry a mansomeone whose dad was a finance man</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I interviewed self-sufficient women whose financial independence was often bankrolled by Mum and Dad and were reluctant to partner up with someone without similar security.

Among baby boomers, 51% own a house with two spare bedrooms, often housing offspring that are unable to get on the housing ladder. This means that the inheritance economy shows no signs of abating and, in fact, over the next 30 years we will see the largest transference of wealth in history. Of millennials, 80% expect some kind of inheritance, but it will be unequal. Millennial inheritances will average 16% of lifetime earnings, up from 9% for Gen X.

      "bodyText": "You know the Bank of Mum and Dad when you see it: it\u2019s your friend who seems broke, but always has a safety net, or who suddenly (but discreetly) acquires the deposit for a home. It\u2019s those who stayed with their parents while they saved for a flat, or stuck it out in a profession they were passionate about even though the wages are chronically low. It\u2019s those who do not need to consider the financial costs of having children. It\u2019s those whose grandparents are covering nursery or university fees, with the Bank of Grandma and Grandad already driving an economic wedge between different cohorts in generations Alpha (born between 2010 and 2024) and Z (born in the late 1990s and early 2000s). This is the picture we know, but the Bank of Mum and Dad is not just a luxury confined to the 1% \u2013 it is also evident in families like mine. I grew up in a working-class household and was the first person in my family to get a degree, but it was the fact my parents had scrimped in the 1980s to purchase properties in London (and allowed me to crash in one throughout my 20s) that has arguably been the true source of opportunities in my life. My parents were subversive punks whose working-class roots also meant that the notion of getting ideas above your station never fully wore off. My great-aunt was a Pearly Queen, and we really did all stand around the piano bashing out Maybe it\u2019s Because I\u2019m a Londoner. But inspired by Thatcher\u2019s vision of a property-owning democracy, in the 1980s my parents invested in two houses in Tooting and, crucially, held on to them. By the turn of the millennium, they were sitting on property wealth that was gaining value at a rate they could never have imagined. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008 my parents had become paper millionaires. It was a degree of wealth they had never expected and we, as a family, were only forced to confront when my father died in 2018. But is this really the true story? Or have I just fed you a \u201cworking-class done good\u201d tale, because that\u2019s how I attempt to justify my own exceedingly privileged position? One academic investigation into the Bank of Mum and Dad found that its beneficiaries tend to frame this considerable financial support not in terms of their own individual privilege, but as evidence of their parents\u2019 hard work and upward mobility. Whereas once parents lived vicariously through their children\u2019s successes, now it seems their kids live vicariously through their parents\u2019 struggles. And there lies the problem. In recent years, we have rightly widened the conversation about privilege in society. And yet how honest are we about one of the most obvious forces shaping anyone under 45: the presence or absence of a parental safety net? The truth is that we live in an inheritocracy. If you\u2019ve grown up in the 21st century, your opportunities are increasingly determined by your access to the Bank of Mum and Dad, rather than by what you earn or learn. The economic roots of this story go back to the 1980s, but it accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis, as private wealth soared and wage growth stalled. In the 2020s, rather than a meritocracy \u2013 where hard work pays off \u2013 we have evolved into an inheritocracy, based on family wealth. Young people\u2019s frustration is so pronounced these days because this reality runs contrary to what we were told growing up. Then the message was, work hard, get a degree and you will be rewarded. Education was increasingly geared towards exams and qualifications, with little options for those unsuited to this system. But, as more of us became graduates, the price of a degree went up and its value went down. Increasingly, it became about our parents\u2019 ability to \u201cinvest\u201d in these talents as the real source of opportunity and the key definer of our class, status and success. As Becky O\u2019Connor from pension provider PensionBee tells me: \u201cParents have become the gatekeepers to their children\u2019s adulthood, the wealth level of the previous generation ultimately determining which milestones are achievable and which are not.\u201d Inheritocracy is the driver of milestone culture. For a long time much of the intergenerational debate focused on how lucky the baby boomers were and how unlucky millennials are. This duality is not just unhelpful, it\u2019s also increasingly untrue. In 2010, David Willetts wrote The Pinch, an economic dissection of baby boomer privilege and millennials\u2019 hardship that would become a narrative for millennials frustrated at the level of intergenerational unfairness. But when I spoke to Willetts, he admitted that over the past 10 years the dynamic had changed. It was no longer about intergenerational unfairness as such, but intragenerational unfairness, with the new dependency culture within the family halting social mobility. \u201cIt is absolutely making the family more significant,\u201d he said. But Willetts\u2019s framing here is important because what some describe as the growing \u201cimportance of the family\u201d, others call the unfair privilege of birth. At a time when the market has become dysfunctional and the state retracted, the family has stepped up. It is a dynamic that the economist James Sefton likes to call \u201cgood parents, poor citizens\u201d. And it\u2019s a dynamic that has provided untold opportunity, for some. In an inheritocracy, certain advantages really matter: those whose parents are together, those who live in the south-east, those who are only children, those whose parents are able to \u201cgift\u201d an early inheritance and, to be blunt, those whose parents do not live too long or have complex expensive caring needs. Knowing that my own tale was a uniquely London-centric, female, white privileged experience, I set out to discover this mosaic of family stories across Britain. I spoke to Tom, 34, who had been supported through private education and Oxford, but had mixed feelings about the springboard his parents had given him in his 20s and 30s as they indulged him in his dream of becoming an actor. \u201cI moved into my mother\u2019s central London flat that she got free with her job. I was being completely financed,\u201d he admits. Tom made money during this time, but \u201cit was about earning enough to maintain a bit of respect, nothing substantial\u201d. After seven years of trying to carve out an acting career, Tom decided to pack it in. Looking back, he now has regrets about this period in his life. \u201cI was just so fucking lazy. I wish someone had said to me: \u2018You should be earning more money; you have a lot of advantages.\u2019 I didn\u2019t take advantage of that properly. I count that as a personal failure.\u201d Now married and a father, Tom laments that he will not be able to recreate for his son the life his parents gave him. If Tom was an inheritocrat, I spoke to many meritocrats, those who had made it in modern Britain with little parental help, but this came with much resentment. Greg, 31, describes himself as a working-class boy from Surrey. Raised in a single-parent household, when he was 16 his mum told him that if he wanted financial freedom, he was going to have to work for it. Greg graduated from a top-class London university and found himself on a graduate scheme in London, tutoring rich kids on the side, something he ended up hugely resenting. \u201cI actually went to counselling to get over my anger at other people\u2019s wealth and family support\u2026 I was tutoring all these wealthy kids who literally had everything on a plate, and I found it quite depressing, as here I was scrimping for \u00a3100. I felt like the underclass. I couldn\u2019t help but see the irony that my student would pay me \u00a3100 for tutoring and I passed that straight on to the therapist to help me cope with it!\u201d When it comes to class, social mobility and wealth, we tend to see it through an entirely British prism, when in fact the Bank of Mum and Dad is an international trend, but also one that differs across different cultures. This is something that Alina from Mumbai, now living in London, recognises. Alina tells me that her parents have been supporting her throughout her life, paying for her to study in New York while her in-laws purchased a flat for her husband in central London.

This sets up a different dynamic: \u201cYou don\u2019t even feel that there is an obligation because they are your parents; you want to look after them.\u201d All these testimonies attest to how our inheritance stories are as much to do with the state of our familial bonds, cultural heritage and lived experience as the state of the housing market or inheritance tax thresholds.

Makin made clear Welby was one of the people who had displayed a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/13/justin-welby-archbishop-resignation-church-of-england\">distinct lack of curiosity</a>\u201d about the \u201cmost prolific serial abuser to be associated with the Church of England\u201d.</p> <p>The former chair of the Iwerne Trust \u2013 a conservative charity that ran evangelical camps where Welby was once a dormitory officer \u2013 Smyth is thought to have groomed and savagely beaten <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/13/highly-likely-john-smyth-continued-to-abuse-young-men-in-south-africa\">as many as 130 boys and young men</a> in three countries across five decades. Eight boys received a total of 14,000 lashes, and two more suffered 8,000 between&nbsp;them.</p> <p>He started his sado-sexual campaign in the 1970s and by 1982, after one of his victims attempted suicide, the trust and a number of church members were aware of the allegations against him. In a familiar out-of-sight, out-of-mind move, funds were raised to send Smyth to Zimbabwe in 1984, where he would later be charged with the manslaughter of a 16-year-old boy \u2013 he was never convicted of the offence, it is thought because of his powerful connections within the Zimbabwean government.</p> <p>However appalling the Smyth case is, there is a danger whenever assessing the Church of England of crying wolf, simply because it is <em>always</em> in crisis. After all, it has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/church-of-england-declining-congregations-councils\">losing its congregation</a> for \u00addecades, is stuck in an existential battle between its liberal and evangelical wings, and struggles to hold together a global communion of 85&nbsp;million Anglicans.</p> <p>Defenders of the church, including Welby himself, have pointed out that Smyth was not a clergyman and his vicious assaults on boys from Winchester College, where he took part in the school\u2019s Christian Union, were outside the church\u2019s jurisdiction.</p> <p>Ian Paul, an associate \u00administer and member of the General Synod who writes an \u00adevangelical blog, <em>Psephizo</em>, says there is no comparison with the plight of the Catholic church in Ireland, where religious influence has dramatically waned after a succession of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/catholic-church-still-failing-to-deal-with-sexual-abuse-cases-says-vatican-report\">sex and abuse scandals</a> involving priests and nuns.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about abuse within the Church of England,\u201d he says. \u201cSmyth was not a minister of the Church of England.\u201d</p> <p>This is true, but he was a lay reader who served at Christ Church Winchester, and an active part of the laity, so any attempt to distance Smyth from the church looks more like an act of self-protection than one of communal moral responsibility. And it\u2019s not a good look for an institution that prides itself on its high ethics and benevolence to say about a monstrous abuser operating in its midst: \u201cNothing to do with us, guv.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, Paul does not dismiss the unprecedented significance of Welby\u2019s resignation.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1621,\u201d he says, \u201cthe incumbent archbishop of Canterbury actually killed somebody with a bow and arrow on a hunting trip, and even then <em>he</em> didn\u2019t resign.\u201d</p> <p>So something major is afoot: it\u2019s just that the clergy can\u2019t agree on what it is. For Paul, Welby represented an anything-goes liberalism that stood in contradiction to church doctrine, and was a poor leader. \u201cJustin managed to make \u00adenemies of every single group.

      "bodyText": "The resignation last week of the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has raised far-reaching questions among clergy and observers about the future of the Church of England. \u201cThis is a crisis moment for the church,\u201d says Giles Fraser, an Anglican priest and media theologian. \u201cI think it\u2019s a turning point.\u201d \u201cThere needs to be a complete reset as to how this whole organisation is run at the top,\u201d says Martyn Percy, former dean of Christ Church, University of Oxford. \u201cWe need a statutory independent inquiry.\u201d These reactions follow the publication of the long-delayed Makin review on how the church handled the allegations of sexual abuse by John Smyth, a man who was an early influence on Welby. Makin made clear Welby was one of the people who had displayed a \u201cdistinct lack of curiosity\u201d about the \u201cmost prolific serial abuser to be associated with the Church of England\u201d. The former chair of the Iwerne Trust \u2013 a conservative charity that ran evangelical camps where Welby was once a dormitory officer \u2013 Smyth is thought to have groomed and savagely beaten as many as 130 boys and young men in three countries across five decades. Eight boys received a total of 14,000 lashes, and two more suffered 8,000 between them. He started his sado-sexual campaign in the 1970s and by 1982, after one of his victims attempted suicide, the trust and a number of church members were aware of the allegations against him. In a familiar out-of-sight, out-of-mind move, funds were raised to send Smyth to Zimbabwe in 1984, where he would later be charged with the manslaughter of a 16-year-old boy \u2013 he was never convicted of the offence, it is thought because of his powerful connections within the Zimbabwean government. However appalling the Smyth case is, there is a danger whenever assessing the Church of England of crying wolf, simply because it is always in crisis. After all, it has been losing its congregation for decades, is stuck in an existential battle between its liberal and evangelical wings, and struggles to hold together a global communion of 85 million Anglicans. Defenders of the church, including Welby himself, have pointed out that Smyth was not a clergyman and his vicious assaults on boys from Winchester College, where he took part in the school\u2019s Christian Union, were outside the church\u2019s jurisdiction. Ian Paul, an associate minister and member of the General Synod who writes an evangelical blog, Psephizo, says there is no comparison with the plight of the Catholic church in Ireland, where religious influence has dramatically waned after a succession of sex and abuse scandals involving priests and nuns. \u201cThis is not about abuse within the Church of England,\u201d he says. \u201cSmyth was not a minister of the Church of England.\u201d This is true, but he was a lay reader who served at Christ Church Winchester, and an active part of the laity, so any attempt to distance Smyth from the church looks more like an act of self-protection than one of communal moral responsibility. And it\u2019s not a good look for an institution that prides itself on its high ethics and benevolence to say about a monstrous abuser operating in its midst: \u201cNothing to do with us, guv.\u201d Nonetheless, Paul does not dismiss the unprecedented significance of Welby\u2019s resignation. \u201cIn 1621,\u201d he says, \u201cthe incumbent archbishop of Canterbury actually killed somebody with a bow and arrow on a hunting trip, and even then he didn\u2019t resign.\u201d So something major is afoot: it\u2019s just that the clergy can\u2019t agree on what it is. For Paul, Welby represented an anything-goes liberalism that stood in contradiction to church doctrine, and was a poor leader. \u201cJustin managed to make enemies of every single group. He made enemies of liberals by talking about evangelism. He made enemies of evangelicals by talking about sexuality. He made enemies of conservatives by talking about new forms of church.\u201d The kind of change Paul would like to see \u2013 a return to established and more conservative doctrine \u2013 will be hampered, he says, by the bishops that Welby appointed during his 12-year tenure. \u201cIt\u2019s been widely observed that the bench of bishops we now have is the weakest we\u2019ve ever had in the history of the church,\u201d he says. \u201cJustin himself tried to get Paula Vennells [the disgraced former head of the Post Office] shortlisted for bishop of London. That is absolutely catastrophic.\u201d Percy, an academic specialising in ecclesiology who has been an outspoken critic of the hierarchy\u2019s failure to listen to survivors of abuse within the church, agrees that the problem lies at the top but sees it as primarily a lack of transparency and accountability, exemplified by the issue of safeguarding. \u201cIt\u2019s another serious rupture in the reservoir of trust. People just look at the church and say or intuit that this is not an institution they can trust \u2013 and it\u2019s very hard to get that trust back,\u201d he says. He describes Lambeth Palace as a self-preserving bureaucracy riven by intrigue, \u201cincluding secretive organisations\u201d, and intent on obfuscation and damage limitation. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have any perception that their secrecy and their lack of accountability, their lack of transparency and external scrutiny, is 100% the problem,\u201d he says. He maintains that Smyth was not an isolated case. In 2016, he says he met a group of survivors in Oxford who told him \u201cutterly harrowing\u201d stories of abuse by figures within the church. The perpetrators, he says, were made known to the authorities but remained in the church and were subsequently promoted. \u201cThey\u2019ve suffered absolutely no penalty whatsoever,\u201d he says. Yet at the same time, he argues, the safeguarding measures that Welby oversaw are ill-thought-out and arbitrarily enforced, and deter the sort of volunteers on whom the church has traditionally relied for local good works. Percy\u2019s remedy is for the church to open itself up to independent assessment and break up its top-heavy bureaucracy. One aspect of this reform, he says, would be disestablishment from the British state. Ever since Henry VIII\u2019s Act of Supremacy in 1534, the church has been part of the English and, later, British state, with the monarch as the supreme governor and ecclesiastical representation in the House of Lords. \u201cWhat they need to do is get themselves back down to ground level and work out what it means to be a national church which is not an established church,\u201d says Percy. It sounds like the continuation of the Protestant revolution that was never quite completed in the 16th century, when elements of the Catholic system of hierarchy were absorbed into the newly formed church. On balance, Fraser is against disestablishment, but he agrees that the church should scale back its global operations and focus more on the parish level. \u201cWhy did Welby miss all of this? It wasn\u2019t that he was malevolent but that he was so overstretched. And there\u2019s an ego thing going on here. They prefer to get out of the airport in Kigali with 3,000 people waving flags rather than spending a rainy afternoon in Stockport with survivors shouting at him. Who wouldn\u2019t?

While nobody expects that Welby\u2019s resignation will arrest the long-term decline in church attendance, Paul argues that Britain is a less secular nation than is often believed. \u201cThere will be more Christians in church on a Sunday morning than people attending football matches at every level from schools up to professional,\u201d he says. But a diminishing number of them are in Church of England ministries. How much this has to do with a country losing its religion, and how much it is a reflection of the church\u2019s shrinking sociocultural relevance, is open to debate. What does seem clear, though, is that the church finds it hard to establish a coherent message because so much of its doctrinal teaching is subject to internal and international dispute. Nor is it adept at capitalising on wider social movements, partly for that reason. One example is the rise in some quarters of what\u2019s called \u201ccultural Christianity\u201d, a sort of secular appreciation of the religion\u2019s active legacy, as well as the rituals and traditions that accompany it. Some critics suggest it is a movement born of anxiety about the cultural changes wrought by mass immigration, and in particular the rise of Islam. That is a major red flag for a church that promotes inter-faith relations.

The full details of the government and Royal British Legion\u2019s plans have not yet been revealed but it is understood they are concerned about making remembrance more relevant to younger people and those from non-white backgrounds, as the number of armed forces families and those with direct links to the 1939-45 conflict decline.

The role of Henry is tricky: easy to collapse into cosplay caricature.

      "body": "<p>Our two-year-old daughter mounts the scooter. She places one unsteady foot in front of the other on its central board. An initial attempt at balance is rebuffed as gravity asserts itself and she yelps as the scooter leaves her feet, throwing her backwards. Her helmet, pink and cream, remains in place. Miraculously, there are no tears. Undaunted, our little Boudicca rights her chariot and repeats.</p> <p>We\u2019re in our local park, giving her \u2013 and us \u2013 a crash course in resilience. It is nail-biting. We bought her the thing in the hope we\u2019d avoid the mess we made of her brother\u2019s tutelage. He never warmed to the various scooters and bikes we\u2019ve inherited from his older cousins and which now languish, substantially cobwebbed, in our shed. He showed no interest in using them, and we didn\u2019t insist, due to the fact we weren\u2019t particularly keen on equipping him with a vehicle that could wallop him into the path of cars at 20mph and, if we\u2019re honest, pure old-fashioned laziness.</p> <p>Now, of course, we feel stupid when we visit friends and see the joy, and speedy transport, their kids\u2019 scooters provide. My son shows no such regrets and runs alongside these friends as they scoot, like a secret service agent escorting a presidential motorcade, evincing zero discomfort or embarrassment over this commitment to radical pedestrianism.

      "bodyText": "Our two-year-old daughter mounts the scooter. She places one unsteady foot in front of the other on its central board. An initial attempt at balance is rebuffed as gravity asserts itself and she yelps as the scooter leaves her feet, throwing her backwards. Her helmet, pink and cream, remains in place. Miraculously, there are no tears. Undaunted, our little Boudicca rights her chariot and repeats. We\u2019re in our local park, giving her \u2013 and us \u2013 a crash course in resilience. It is nail-biting. We bought her the thing in the hope we\u2019d avoid the mess we made of her brother\u2019s tutelage. He never warmed to the various scooters and bikes we\u2019ve inherited from his older cousins and which now languish, substantially cobwebbed, in our shed. He showed no interest in using them, and we didn\u2019t insist, due to the fact we weren\u2019t particularly keen on equipping him with a vehicle that could wallop him into the path of cars at 20mph and, if we\u2019re honest, pure old-fashioned laziness. Now, of course, we feel stupid when we visit friends and see the joy, and speedy transport, their kids\u2019 scooters provide. My son shows no such regrets and runs alongside these friends as they scoot, like a secret service agent escorting a presidential motorcade, evincing zero discomfort or embarrassment over this commitment to radical pedestrianism. Part of me thinks he\u2019s just doubling down on; that he can\u2019t possibly enjoy stretching and sweating while his friends sail effortlessly beside him. But, if that is the case and it is all an act, I can\u2019t help but admire him more. He may not have the resilience of his sister when it comes to scooting, but his stubbornness is a marvel.

He remains best known as a novelist, garnering laurels including the International Dublin literary award and the David Cohen prize for literature, and being praised for his sheer range as well as a near-magical ability to capture all that goes unsaid in life. His greatest commercial success to date is <em>Brooklyn </em>(2009), which follows Eilis Lacey as she leaves her home town \u2013 and T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s own \u2013 of Enniscorthy, County Wexford, for greater opportunities in the US. It later became a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/brooklyn-observer-film-review-saoirse-ronan\">film starring Saoirse Ronan</a>. His 11th novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/19/long-island-by-colm-toibin-review-sequel-to-breakthrough-brooklyn#:~:text=Long%20Island%20often%20reads%20like,but%20is%20a%20vivid%20highlight.\">Long Island</a></em>, is the sequel he swore he\u2019d never write, catching up with Eilis two decades on. T\u00f3ib\u00edn divides his time between Los Angeles and New York City, where he teaches English literature at Columbia University.</p> <p><em><strong>Long Island</strong></em><strong> is on the shortlist for Waterstones </strong><strong>book of the </strong><strong>year, which must be nice\u2026<br></strong>It cheers you up.

Have you changed your opinion in light of </strong><em><strong>Long Island</strong></em><strong>\u2019s reception?<br></strong>I haven\u2019t. The idea that a novel would have a sequel, that the ending is merely provisional, I think really makes a difference to the experience of reading the book. A novel is not a line, it doesn\u2019t just chug along like a train. It is an actual arc, and you have to have a real sense of that as a reader. </p> <p><strong>So why did you make an exception?<br></strong><em>Long Island</em> is set 20 years later and has an entirely different structure to <em>Brooklyn</em>. It moves only according to the rules of plot, so it is a different book in that sense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I do get homesick, yes.

Normally, in film and novels, Irishmen are unreliable, charming, brooding. It makes making an Irishman who\u2019s quiet and stable particularly difficult. Jim in <em>Brooklyn</em> is a very nice fellow but he\u2019s not the point of the book. The actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jul/31/on-my-radar-domhnall-gleeson-cultural-highlights\">Domhnall Gleeson</a> managed to give him a sort of glow, a strange power that came from his quietness. I saw a new way his character could be done, so Jim in <em>Long Island</em> derived partly from my watching of the film. I can\u2019t find a precedent for it, where a novelist gets a gift like that.</p> <p><strong>Do you continue to think of Ireland as home, and if so, do you get homesick? <br></strong>Yes. It\u2019s the music that gets me.

I like to think of it as the people\u2019s opera \u2013 it was on at 11 in the morning and it only cost \u20ac25 [\u00a321] to go to. A lot of local people booked and there was a nice feeling.

For starters, it\u2019s a lot easier to be gay\u2026 <br></strong>It\u2019s a much freer place. The gay thing was odd and unexpected because it was a conservative movement. It was families saying we want our families to be strengthened by the presence of our gay son, and the gay son saying I want my own family.

      "body": "<p>Joyous, curious, inventive and droll, the English artist <strong>Tirzah Garwood</strong> (1908-51) is as original as she is \u2013 so far \u2013 almost entirely unknown. If you have never seen any of her works you won\u2019t be alone: the last show took place more than 70 years ago, after her premature death of cancer at 42. Tenderly curated by <a href=\"https://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/whats-on/lectures-talks/2024/november/online-curators-talk-tirzah-garwood/\">James Russell</a>, this retrospective <a href=\"https://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/2024/november/tirzah-garwood-beyond-ravilious/\">at Dulwich Picture Gallery</a> is therefore effectively her first. It is a bright surprise from first to last.</p> <p>Garwood\u2019s earliest eagle-eyed woodcuts were made when she was a teenager: feathers snowing from bolsters in a bout of spring cleaning; girls in one-piece swimsuits negotiating summer waves; a woman retreating disconsolately to bed for the winter. She began <em>The Four Seasons</em> (1927) at Eastbourne School of Art, aged 18, tutored by Eric Ravilious, who had himself only three years experience of this hardwon medium. The artists would later marry.</p> <p>Garwood\u2019s woodcuts are incisive in every respect. They catch the ticking of a grandfather clock as a woman dozes, a gramophone horn observing her with the same alert impatience as the spaniel at her feet. They notice the sly side-eye of a card player sneaking a glance at her neighbour\u2019s hand, and the minute difference between 10 schoolgirls marching in crocodile \u2013 round a bend, no less \u2013 from the smiler distracted by a terrier to the scrape eagerly sucking up to the form leader at the front.</p> <p>Garwood laughs at her own outsize reflection in a hall of mirrors, the crisscross pattern of her woollen suit enlarged in repeat. She satirises the vogue for table-turning seances, five pairs of white hands clawing at an obliterating disc of darkness. There is a deft send-up of her own father, pointedly ignoring the window cleaner, cloth raised, who is staring at him through the glass as he pauses with pen pompously aloft, about to sign some important document. Their gestures are subtly matched to point up the class distinctions on either side of the window.</p>    <p>From the very start, Garwood had an extraordinary gift for texture and tone. With the finest of lines she conjures the interior of a railway carriage trundling through the English landscape, from scratchy horsehair seats to stiff leather gloves, felt cloches, fur collars and the oddly irregular sheen of pre-war silk stockings. The noses of three passengers on the left raise the eye in comical steps to the view through the window, which has its miniature echo in a tiny mirror on the wall.</p> <p>Ravilious pictured a similar situation in his nearly mystical <em><a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Train_Landscape_by_Eric_Ravilious_-_Eric_Ravilious_-_ABDAG003039.jpg\">Train Landscape</a></em>, but his compartment is deserted, whereas hers is teeming with human presence. A few of his works are judiciously introduced here, to show such different minds looking at similar worlds.</p>    <p>After her marriage, and the birth of three children, Garwood had far less time for the exacting creation of woodcuts, and her quizzical observations appear in watercolour, collage and cardboard relief. There is a beguilingly strange sense of scale \u2013 of animals and even people dwarfed by the flowers and grasses that so often appear in closeup in her foregrounds; of dolls that double as living beings in small paintings.</p> <p>She made collages using leaf prints, which become tiny forests, overlaid with a stranded missionary\u2019s hut of wood veneer, or a scout\u2019s tent scissored out of paper. Her little daughter, Anne, kneels on a windowsill, looking for something to happen outside, one foot edging out of the collage. The world is growing smaller. In 1942, Ravilious disappeared during a wartime flight off the coast of Iceland. Garwood had her first operation for breast cancer.</p> <p>And still she works, and she works, raising her children in a draughty house in Essex. She makes abstract marbled papers for the market, their watercolour delicacy nearly Japanese. She conjures the most compelling facades \u2013 a village shop, a Methodist chapel, a semi-detached house by night \u2013 boxed inside frames. Unique hybrids of mid-century watercolour and doll\u2019s house, they resemble yet exceed the wartime <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/shop/books/art-sculpture/recording-britain-110127.html\">Recording Britain</a> project, in which English artists such as Graham Sutherland and John Piper made sympathetic images of vulnerable buildings and landscapes.</p> <p>All the paintings \u2013 still small, but by now in oil \u2013 in the final room here made in bed, during Garwood\u2019s final months in a nursing home. A wicked cat, a goose-stepping gander, a \u201cprehistoric encounter\u201d, as she called it, between a tortoise and a frog in a primeval forest of mare\u2019s tails: her visions are as wild and spry as they are, eventually, self-reflective. Most touching of all is a portrait \u2013 self-portrait? \u2013 of a ceramic figure that belonged to the family.</p>    <p>Pale, long-necked, her eyes raised into the distance, the woman stands with her hands clasped beneath a starry night sky. Above her leans a pale, perhaps protective daffodil. No self-pity here, only dreams of what has been wondrous in this life; we should all be so brave when facing our end.</p> <p>There is so much more to this enchanting show, perfectly suited to the graceful galleries at Dulwich. If only the same could be said of <strong><a href=\"https://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/dora-carrington/\">Dora Carrington</a></strong> (1893-1932), receiving the most admiring of attention in Chichester. Pallant House Gallery has done its utmost for her art \u2013 surreal landscapes, male and female nudes, interiors, portraits of friends and lovers \u2013 and ended up giving us more of a memoir.</p> <p>Among the 100 works are too many by (and too few <em>of</em>) all those lovers, and would-be lovers: fellow Slade students Paul Nash, Dorothy Brett and CR Nevinson. Mark Gertler, especially, outshines Carrington at every turn. His hieratic portraits of a Spanish boy and a young servant hang right next to hers, which look like faltering pastiche.</p>    <p>This show undoubtedly has the best of Carrington. Her marvellously strong <a href=\"https://www.wikigallery.org/wiki/painting_92668/Dora-Carrington/Female-Figure-Standing--1913\">rear-view nude</a>, painted as a student c.1913, is as fine as Laura Knight\u2019s mature and more famous <em><a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw03686/Laura-Knight-with-model-Ella-Louise-Naper-Self-Portrait\">Self-Portrait With Nude</a></em> of the same year. The Tate has loaned Carrington\u2019s outlandish <em>Farm at Watendlath</em>, where the green hills huddle like bodies around the dazzling white farmhouse and washing below. The climax is her portrait of Lytton Strachey reading in bed: eyes to words, bony hands to heaven, as if he were holding a bible. She was in love with Strachey, who only loved men. Two months after his death, she shot herself.</p> <p>Less context and more Carrington might just have been persuasive. Sensitively written labels want us to see her paintings as passionate, disarming, romantic, but they are too uncertain \u2013 and unfulfilled \u2013 for such words. Carrington had no ambition to show her work, which she did not sign, and my sense is that her writing, in the much-loved diaries and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/17/carringtons-letters-anne-chisholm-review-dora-carrington-lytton-strachey-bloomsbury-group\">letters</a>, was far stronger. The worst of this show is decor, furnishings, photographs of Bloomsbury antics, and her tinfoil mirror paintings for Fortnum &amp; Mason; all of them fit only for Charleston.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Tirzah Garwood: Beyond Ravilious </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Dora Carrington: Beyond Bloomsbury </em>\u2605\u2605</p> <ul> <li><p>Tirzah Garwood: Beyond Ravilious is at Dulwich Picture Gallery, London, until 26 May 2025</p></li> <li><p>Dora Carrington: Beyond Bloomsbury is at Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, until 27 April</p></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>Paul Sagar, 37, is reader in political theory in the department of political economy at King\u2019s College London. He studied at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and London and in 2020 received the British and Irish Association for Political Thought early career award for excellence in research and teaching. A once passionate rock climber, he suffered a catastrophic accident last year while climbing in Scotland. The accident left him tetraplegic, paralysed from the collarbones down, with only residual use of his hands. After eight months in hospital, he resumed academic work in early 2024, continuing physical rehabilitation and attempting to adjust to life with severe disability. This is an extract from his diary of the past 16 months.</p> <h2><strong>22 August 2023</strong></h2> <p>On 5 June, I was climbing in Glencoe with a friend. Because of friability in the rock, a route we had thought to be in unusually safe condition turned out to be almost lethal. On the final pitch, as I was leading, the rock collapsed and much of my gear exploded out of the placements. I fell about 20 metres. My left arm was shattered severely, and my right arm was also broken, albeit less badly. Worst of all I fractured two vertebrae in my neck.</p> <p>Luckily, I was climbing with a surgeon that day and through amazing good fortune and his incredible skill and composure, he saved my life. I was airlifted to Glasgow hospital where I had several operations and awoke four weeks later. After a period of drug-induced insanity I eventually came to something like my senses. Since then, I have been transferred to the Royal London hospital, where I am undergoing the start of a very long physio journey.</p> <p>At present, I have limited use of my hands and no control of my body below my abdominal muscles. This is not exactly how I planned to spend my summer, to say the least.</p> <p>I have written this short post using voice dictation software, partly just to prove to myself that I can. The likelihood is I will never walk again, let alone climb.</p> <h2><strong>1 September</strong></h2> <p>If I had to pick the single worst thing about living in hospital, there would be some stiff competition. There is the constant disruption, having no control over when I wake up, with people barging into the room at whatever time suits them to jab me with needles or slam bin lids. There is the total dependency on others to complete the most mundane of tasks, be it feeding myself or getting my teeth brushed. There is the infuriating frequency with which staff will talk about me when I\u2019m in the room, or ask each other questions that I know the answers to, but which they do not bother to consult me about because the default assumption is that the patient is clueless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. The fact this is impossible doesn\u2019t stop me wanting it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the number one worst thing about being an early stage spinal injury patient in hospital is, for me at least, the daily humiliation. You see, an aspect of spinal injury I wasn\u2019t aware of until it happened to me is that it\u2019s not just that you lose the ability to use your legs and possibly your hands . You also lose functional control of your bowels and bladder. </p> <p>Hence this week I underwent a minor surgery to drill a tube directly into my bladder, making my penis effectively redundant. I have anyway by now lost count of the number of strangers who have either seen or had to wash my genitals.</p>    <h2><strong>11 September</strong></h2> <p>Who am I? It\u2019s hard to be sure any more. In recent days I have found it harder and harder to shake the feeling that I am an impostor. Increasingly I am struck with the sense that somebody did die that day in early June. I share his name, his legal details, his date of birth, and even his memories. Other people seem to think that I am him. But I am increasingly unsure. I look at the arms attached to me now, and they are thin like twigs. Forearms have disappeared completely, while biceps are a rump of what once was. When I have glanced at my chest during occasions of being washed, I am astounded to see that it simply no longer exists. There is just flat bone above visible ribs. When attempting to do the most basic of exercises, a mind that remembers developing serious core strength over years tries to engage abdominal muscles that cannot perform even the beginning of a single measly sit-up. And then, of course, there are the hands that barely function and the legs that do not move at all. The person who woke up on 5 June looked and felt absolutely nothing like this.</p> <p>Somebody died that day, and somebody different survived. I am the survivor, playing the role once held by a dead man, and every day slightly puzzled as to why nobody seems to have noticed the switch.</p> <h2><strong>1 October</strong></h2> <p><em>I am now in the </em><em>rehab department</em><em> at the </em><em>Royal National Orthopaedic hospital</em><em> at </em><em>Stanmore, Middlesex</em><em>.</em></p> <p>Conversation matters. It distracts me from my situation and connects me to a world beyond my circular thoughts. But it\u2019s also risky. Topics that ought to be safe are, for me, not necessarily so.</p> <p>Take the weather. Comments on the unseasonable warmth we\u2019re having are tough for me to hear. Yes, it means I can visit the rehab centre gardens. On the other hand, I immediately think of how I\u2019m not out climbing in such perfect weekend conditions. And never will be again.</p> <p>Many remarks can trigger pain without the other person meaning to, or even realising. Take the friendly Irish nurse who tonight told me of her love of hiking in the Peak District, her trips to the Lake District, her walks in Switzerland. It took all my strength not to reply <em>you have no fucking idea</em>. <em>I didn\u2019t just hike those places. I saw and accessed sights you can\u2019t even imagine</em>. And then my mind is flooded with all the places I\u2019ll never see again. The North London Mountaineering Club hut in Snowdonia, my home from home that I planned to visit regularly until I died. Wen Zawn at Gogarth. My favourite Kalymnos bar. Portland sport routes. The Borrowdale trad crags. The view of Italy from 3,000m. The feeling of slinging a full rucksack back into the van after a long day\u2019s effort. Wyoming. El Chorro. Fontainebleau. Never again. And the list goes on.</p> <p>It might sound strange but the emotion I feel in relation to this is heartbreak. I realised this today after a kind nursing assistant asked me (respectfully, in appropriate circumstances) what my accident had been. I told her the story. And then I began to cry. A 36-year-old man in tears, in front of a near stranger.</p> <h2><strong>5 October</strong></h2> <p>The truth is I\u2019m finding rehab very hard. After spending nearly three months fixating on getting here, the reality of starting intensive physio and therapy is not the instant salvation I had hoped it would be.</p> <p>The rehab team gave me a power wheelchair this week, which restores a modicum of independence. All I can think about, however, is how small the rehab centre is, having now lapped it dozens of times. And about how winter will soon make even the gardens inaccessible. And this is where I will spend every day for months. The other night we were lucky enough to listen to music performed live in the large outdoor pod. Upbeat songs about love and joy? They just make me think about how I don\u2019t have a partner, I don\u2019t have children, and I\u2019ve realistically blown any chance at either from here on out. So what is left to give the fight meaning? What\u2019s the point?</p>    <h2><strong>19 October</strong></h2> <p>I am no longer the only published author among the patients at rehab. Indeed, I\u2019m not even close to being the most widely read any more. That\u2019s because a couple of weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/12/my-body-is-broken-but-im-not-going-to-give-up-hanif-kureishi-on-life-after-the-accident-that-paralysed-him\">Hanif Kureishi</a> arrived to also undergo rehabilitation. As well as being a successful novelist and screenwriter, Hanif directly inspired me to start these blogs. That\u2019s because he has been dictating Substack posts via his partner and children since he suffered a debilitating spinal cord injury himself on Boxing Day last year. I was made aware of his regular \u201cdispatches\u201d while in Royal London hospital, and read all of them. It was helpful to hear what somebody else going through the same kind of experience as me was making of it, and it brought me solace when he wrote about struggling with some of the same things that I have. More generally it made me think that if he could write, then I should try writing too. And so I did.</p> <p>Hanif and I have had a couple of good conversations since he arrived, but nothing is ever easy in this new life and he is now mostly isolated for infection control reasons.</p> <h2><strong>3 December</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve written before about how utterly overwhelming this experience is. Well it turns out that it doesn\u2019t get easier with time. I didn\u2019t realise one could be overwhelmed by constantly feeling overwhelmed. Overwhelm fatigue. Metawhelmed, if you like. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at right now. My mind is a cacophony of paradoxical, or at least incoherent, thoughts.</p> <p>Here\u2019s an example. Last week was my \u201ccase conference\u201d, when the therapists and medical leads here sat down with my parents and I to discuss my progress to date, and future steps. They congratulated me on having made real gains as a result of trying very hard in my various physio and therapy sessions, and therefore extending my admission by another month. This is only done for people who have made progress and whom it is believed will make further gains if they stay longer. By no means does everyone get extended.</p> <p>Great news for me, right? Of course I can see that this is ultimately positive. My parents were a little baffled, however, as to why I nonetheless apparently took so little cheer from it. The answer is that I find it hard to be uplifted by progress towards a goal that I fundamentally don\u2019t want. The brute truth is that I don\u2019t want to be a better-than-expected tetraplegic. I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. And the fact this is impossible doesn\u2019t stop me wanting it. </p> <h2><strong>26 January 2024</strong></h2> <p>If nothing else, the past half a year has made me acutely aware of how dependent on family one becomes even while living in the heart of the NHS. If it weren\u2019t for my mother and father, I would be truly screwed. It would have been impossible for me to single-handedly deal with things like securing accommodation for the future, let alone communicating with my employer and various crucial organisations during the first few months of my injury. As far as I can tell, after an accident like mine, those who don\u2019t have family to pick up the pieces are in the direst of dire&nbsp;straits.</p> <p>So I\u2019m lucky to have parents who care enough, and are competent enough and financially stable enough, to offer me serious help in rebuilding something like a life. And for this, of course, I am grateful. Which leads to a question: why then do I sometimes behave like such a shit?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most painful thing is sorting old clothes. Every item had a connection to my former life and put a dagger through my heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last weekend was not my finest hour. Having made the long trek down from Merseyside to the rehab centre just outside Watford, my mum and dad came to spend time with me. And I rewarded them with toddler levels of truculence and incivility. Why can\u2019t I behave nicely, as a fitting display of the gratitude that I do genuinely feel towards them?</p> <p>The answer I think lies, at least in part, in the fact that half a year ago I was an independent adult with his own income, career, projects, and so forth, but I am now effectively reduced to the status of a child. I need Mummy and Daddy to help me with everything in life. And this is a very difficult thing to come to terms with. And if one is now living like a baby, why not act like one?</p> <p>Add to that the fact that I\u2019m now in the position of having to be grateful <em>all the time</em>: to the person that wipes my arse, to whoever washes me, or puts my clothes on or brushes my teeth. I am grateful to the person that brings my lunch out and puts it in front of me, to the nurse who puts my afternoon medication into my mouth. I am grateful to the staff in the gym that I spend most of the day with, most of whom by now have had to cope with either my piss or shit at least once. I am grateful to whichever persons put me to bed before propping up my iPad so that I can watch some crap on Netflix before falling asleep and repeating it all again.</p> <p>The result of this is what one might call gratitude exhaustion. </p> <h2><strong>5 February</strong></h2> <p>One of the many things that I never appreciated about my old life is that I was virtually never bored. My work consisted mostly of reading and discussing interesting ideas with colleagues and students. If I got bored during the day, I\u2019d amuse myself by playing online chess (poorly). I trained for climbing 10 to 15 hours a week, while weekends were almost always spent driving somewhere it wasn\u2019t raining so as to climb outdoors.</p> <p>Evenings after training left time for good-quality TV, or reading a novel. And of course there were always friends to catch up with in London if I ever felt like actually being sociable. Failing that, I\u2019d go fishing. Essentially, if I was awake I was active, either in body or mind. A lazy weekend, doing nothing, was something like my idea of a bad time.</p> <p>The contrast with my new life could hardly be more stark. I now regularly spend chunks of time just doing nothing. </p> <p>The strangest thing, though, is how accustomed I have become to this mode of living. Seconds become minutes, become hours, become days. Time just drifts by unfilled, and I watch as it passes. I\u2019m bored, but weirdly indifferent about that boredom. It doesn\u2019t drive me crazy like it would have before. I\u2019ve become somebody else; somebody I don\u2019t especially admire, but who seems worryingly like they are here to stay.</p> <h2><strong>10 March</strong></h2> <p>I have now moved on to a nursing home. There is no doubt that it is an improvement on living behind a curtain in a hospital ward. Nonetheless, I have the sense of starring in my own personal <em>Groundhog</em> <em>Day</em>. Every day is basically the same. Mornings are lost, waiting for my various needs to be dealt with. Afternoons I spend trying to work, with decreasing levels of enthusiasm. Evenings I play some online chess, wondering how it is possible to get progressively worse as the days pass. Then it is back to bed for yet more TV. Rinse, repeat. I never go anywhere new. I have no plans. There are no holidays to look forward to. No weekends away. Just more of the same, day after day. Bill Murray, I get it now.</p> <p>And so it might not be especially surprising to hear that I am not doing very well psychologically. Leaving the hell of rehab, getting some minimal privacy, and being able to read serious work for the first time in months gave me an initial mental boost. But it is not especially surprising that this was not a magic cure. And yet I am still taken aback by the scale of my mental collapse. I feel as hopeless, as unable to accept and adapt, as at any other time since I regained consciousness. For a few weeks, I genuinely thought I was getting better. I do not feel even remotely close to that any more.</p>    <p>All of which has led me to a decision. I have begun the process of formally applying to Dignitas, with the eventual possibility of assisted suicide. Many more steps will be required if I am ultimately to go through with this, and I will have the option of changing my mind at many points in the future. (Some people have tried to tell me that I will not be eligible because I am not terminally ill, but I have done my research and although there is no guarantee that I will be accepted for consideration, tetraplegics from Britain have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/27/the-britons-who-made-their-final-journey-to-dignitas-clinic\">used the Swiss service before</a>.) At the very least, what this gives me is the psychological comfort of knowing there is an escape route. I am so tired of feeling completely trapped, forced to stay alive by other people, with all the power and control removed from my own life. Even if I don\u2019t take the option, knowing that the option is at least there provides a kind of comfort: the knowledge that I still have a final small amount of meaningful agency, that I can finally make this <em>stop</em> if I want to.</p> <h2><strong>11 May</strong></h2> <p>Last week I completed the long process of losing my home. The apartment I lived in for three years has changed hands, and now belongs to somebody else. And it hurts so much.</p> <p>The place was very modest; just a small one-bedroom flat. But it was <em>mine</em>. Those were my bookshelves. My choices of mountainscape on the wall. My arrangement of furniture. My base of operations for work, whenever I wasn\u2019t travelling, trying to get as much time in the great outdoors as I could. Shortly before my accident, as a way of channelling the emotional pain from the breakup of a four-year relationship I had repainted most of the walls and doors, even had a new carpet fitted in the bedroom. And then one day I walked out and drove away, not knowing that it was for the last time. Nobody told me that I would never see the place again. I never got to say goodbye.</p> <h2><strong>5 June</strong></h2> <p>It has been a year to the day since my accident. A year since I woke up somewhere peaceful, somewhere quiet, at a time of my own choosing. Since it was up to me alone how long I stayed in bed. A year since I could piss standing up, of my own volition, rather than it dribbling out of me into a plastic bag. A year since I made my own breakfast. Since I was able to lift a normal cup of coffee. A year since I was able to drive, often hundreds of miles at a time, just to be outdoors and in the wild.</p> <p>Far more than a year since I held a woman\u2019s hand, felt the touch of a human body against mine. But a year since these things were even possible for me; something that could sanely be hoped for some future day. A year since it was physically possible for me to enjoy exercise, or use it as a weapon against the parasite of depression that now resides in regal ascendancy over my mind. A year since I climbed. That indescribable world of adventure, which gave my life satisfaction and meaning. The antidote to the psychological ill-health that an academic career made me otherwise so especially vulnerable to.</p> <p>A year since I woke up even just indifferent about, let alone looking forward to, the day ahead. A year since my first thought hasn\u2019t been wishing that I had died in the night. A year since I felt more than fleeting moments of happiness. A year since I felt joy.</p> <p>A year since I died.</p> <p>A year since I was reborn into a life I never agreed to, and would never have chosen, but am condemned by others to continue. A lot can change in a year. And so perhaps, out of the darkness, comes also the light of hope.</p> <h2><strong>18 June</strong></h2> <p>Through the herculean efforts of my parents, I now have a new place to call my own. And making the adjustment has been perhaps the most difficult thing I have been through so far.</p> <p>I really didn\u2019t think it would be this way. While nervous, before the date of the move I experienced a definite uptick in mood. This began to fade once we pulled on to the North Circular. Here was a route I had driven many times in my old life. The store where I bought furniture for my first apartment. The pet shop where I sometimes got supplies for the cats (that I no longer have). The turning I used to take to the Lea Valley to fish for pike in the winter. When I last saw these places, I was driving my own van. Now I was in the back of an ambulance, being awkwardly jolted around. Memories came flooding back punching me in the gut, reminding me how much I have lost.</p> <p>My mum came down to meet the ambulance crew and help transfer me and my possessions up into the new flat.</p> <p>One thing stopping this apartment from feeling like a home is that the walls are all bare. The answer to which would normally be obvious and easy: hang up my own pictures. But there\u2019s the rub. Hanging any of my old artwork on the walls is almost too painful to contemplate, not least because a lot of it consists of framed pictures of mountains. Mountains <em>that</em> <em>I</em> <em>have</em> <em>climbed</em>. Even non-climbing artwork inevitably comes with memories of previous homes it has hung in; past times in my past life; friends in happier years.</p> <p>But pictures were by no means the worst of it. Also transported from my old home to my new were my old clothes. The problem is that now I can\u2019t wear most of them. All of my old jeans, and anything with a button or a buckle, now poses the threat of pressure sores. When it comes to upper layers, anything snug against my former physique is now impossible to combine with the repulsive potbelly I permanently sport. So I agreed to help my mum triage my old clothes, deciding what to keep and what to throw away.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m exaggerating when I say this is the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. Virtually every piece of clothing had some connection to my former life: climbing gear, bouldering gym merch, T-shirts from climbing destinations, outdoor brands \u2013 aside from the odd Guns N\u2019 Roses T-shirt, almost every item put a dagger through my heart. Or rather, two daggers. One for myself, who died. One for climbing, the love I lost.</p> <h2><strong>7 August</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been a while, and enough people have been in contact in various ways, asking if I\u2019m all right, that I feel a quick update is in order. In the grand scheme of things, yes. On the physical side, putting aside for now that my body is a wreckage site that will only get worse with time, I\u2019m doing OK. No further complications, with UTIs and spasms under control, for once.</p> <p>On the mental side, well\u2026 it\u2019s a process. My occupational therapist in rehab told me that most people find the first three to six months after leaving hospital the hardest. My physical therapist said I should expect the first year to be \u201chell\u201d. So far, I can\u2019t argue with that. I\u2019ve been able to distract myself with academic research and writing, which is certainly more than nothing. But it\u2019s hard to feel like it\u2019s enough.</p>    <h2><strong>25 October</strong></h2> <p>I have been watching the debate over changing the UK\u2019s law on assisted dying with sardonic interest. On the face of it the debate should have nothing to do with me. I, after all, am not terminally ill, and what is being debated is whether people with six months or less to live should be able to die by suicide with medical help. I simply don\u2019t meet the criteria. However, those who oppose a change in the law often claim that if the law is loosened, we will be on a slippery slope down to a place where <em>people</em> <em>like</em> <em>me </em>(disabled people) are not only offered assisted suicide, but pressed by wider society into taking that option. And as this would be bad, the law should stay as it is. On the other side, those who favour changing the law vigorously deny (at least in public) that any such slippery slope will be encountered \u2013 and thus they implicitly or explicitly agree that assisted suicide should only be for those who, to put it bluntly, are going to die soon anyway. Hence, again, it is <em>not</em> <em>for me. </em>The effect of which is to compound my overwhelming sense that I am trapped in a living nightmare from which I cannot escape.</p> <p>When medical professionals decided that my ruined body should live, whether I might have wanted it to or not, they also determined that any future choice about whether to continue would for ever be taken away from me. Whereas a normal-bodied (or even just less disabled) person could take matters into their own hands and decide that enough is enough, I cannot. I need the help of someone else. And the law is pretty clear that nobody is allowed to help me. Hence, trapped. The potential loophole here is of course to go abroad, to a jurisdiction where medically assisted suicide is legal. And so, I\u2019m working on it. The application to Dignitas is active.</p> <h2><strong>11 November</strong></h2> <p>In ancient Greek mythology, Pandora is said to have unleashed a range of curses upon humankind. Curiosity led her to open a box entrusted to her husband, out of which death, sickness and a host of other evils escaped. But left behind, so the story goes, was hope.</p> <p>One way to read this is as a sort of consolation. That despite all the evils humanity is forced to endure, we are able to cling to the light of hope. But I\u2019ve long suspected (both before my accident, and especially since) that hope is the worst curse of them all.</p> <p>Moral philosophers like Adam Smith would rightly point out that being in a wheelchair, with virtually useless hands, is not a permanent obstacle to mental tranquillity. Plenty of happy tetraplegics prove it to be so (and indeed, I have met some of them). If I first <em>accept</em> my situation, and allow my psychology to adjust to it, it should be possible to escape the pit of despair.</p> <p>But I am consumed by a hope that holds me back. This comes in the form of longing for medical and technological advances that somehow \u201ccure\u201d spinal cord injury. This is indulged by regular Google searches along those lines. Like the other night, when I went down the rabbit hole of investigating NVG-291, the leading candidate for a therapeutic treatment, now in <a href=\"https://nervgen.com/cto/\">phase 1b/2a human trials</a>. Riding the high of hope, I convince myself that I\u2019m only going to have to do this for a few years, and then I\u2019m going to get my life back. But then the hope wears off, and reality hits: that even if it lives up to the most optimistic hopes, NVG-291 is only going to restore partial functions, and will anyway take years to arrive in a clinically administered setting. And even if it does arrive, I am not getting my old life back, because that life is now definitively over.</p> <p>As the saying goes, it\u2019s the hope that kills you. My hope is a curse. I need it to die. I need to accept.</p> <p>Maybe tomorrow.</p> <ul> <li><p>Read Paul Sagar\u2019s Substack, Diary of a Punter, <a href=\"https://diaryofapunter.substack.com/\">here</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Paul Sagar, 37, is reader in political theory in the department of political economy at King\u2019s College London. He studied at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and London and in 2020 received the British and Irish Association for Political Thought early career award for excellence in research and teaching. A once passionate rock climber, he suffered a catastrophic accident last year while climbing in Scotland. The accident left him tetraplegic, paralysed from the collarbones down, with only residual use of his hands. After eight months in hospital, he resumed academic work in early 2024, continuing physical rehabilitation and attempting to adjust to life with severe disability. This is an extract from his diary of the past 16 months. 22 August 2023 On 5 June, I was climbing in Glencoe with a friend. Because of friability in the rock, a route we had thought to be in unusually safe condition turned out to be almost lethal. On the final pitch, as I was leading, the rock collapsed and much of my gear exploded out of the placements. I fell about 20 metres. My left arm was shattered severely, and my right arm was also broken, albeit less badly. Worst of all I fractured two vertebrae in my neck. Luckily, I was climbing with a surgeon that day and through amazing good fortune and his incredible skill and composure, he saved my life. I was airlifted to Glasgow hospital where I had several operations and awoke four weeks later. After a period of drug-induced insanity I eventually came to something like my senses. Since then, I have been transferred to the Royal London hospital, where I am undergoing the start of a very long physio journey. At present, I have limited use of my hands and no control of my body below my abdominal muscles. This is not exactly how I planned to spend my summer, to say the least. I have written this short post using voice dictation software, partly just to prove to myself that I can. The likelihood is I will never walk again, let alone climb. 1 September If I had to pick the single worst thing about living in hospital, there would be some stiff competition. There is the constant disruption, having no control over when I wake up, with people barging into the room at whatever time suits them to jab me with needles or slam bin lids. There is the total dependency on others to complete the most mundane of tasks, be it feeding myself or getting my teeth brushed. There is the infuriating frequency with which staff will talk about me when I\u2019m in the room, or ask each other questions that I know the answers to, but which they do not bother to consult me about because the default assumption is that the patient is clueless. However, the number one worst thing about being an early stage spinal injury patient in hospital is, for me at least, the daily humiliation. You see, an aspect of spinal injury I wasn\u2019t aware of until it happened to me is that it\u2019s not just that you lose the ability to use your legs and possibly your hands . You also lose functional control of your bowels and bladder. Hence this week I underwent a minor surgery to drill a tube directly into my bladder, making my penis effectively redundant. I have anyway by now lost count of the number of strangers who have either seen or had to wash my genitals. 11 September Who am I? It\u2019s hard to be sure any more. In recent days I have found it harder and harder to shake the feeling that I am an impostor. Increasingly I am struck with the sense that somebody did die that day in early June. I share his name, his legal details, his date of birth, and even his memories. Other people seem to think that I am him. But I am increasingly unsure. I look at the arms attached to me now, and they are thin like twigs. Forearms have disappeared completely, while biceps are a rump of what once was. When I have glanced at my chest during occasions of being washed, I am astounded to see that it simply no longer exists. There is just flat bone above visible ribs. When attempting to do the most basic of exercises, a mind that remembers developing serious core strength over years tries to engage abdominal muscles that cannot perform even the beginning of a single measly sit-up. And then, of course, there are the hands that barely function and the legs that do not move at all. The person who woke up on 5 June looked and felt absolutely nothing like this. Somebody died that day, and somebody different survived. I am the survivor, playing the role once held by a dead man, and every day slightly puzzled as to why nobody seems to have noticed the switch. 1 October I am now in the rehab department at the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital at Stanmore, Middlesex. Conversation matters. It distracts me from my situation and connects me to a world beyond my circular thoughts. But it\u2019s also risky. Topics that ought to be safe are, for me, not necessarily so. Take the weather. Comments on the unseasonable warmth we\u2019re having are tough for me to hear. Yes, it means I can visit the rehab centre gardens. On the other hand, I immediately think of how I\u2019m not out climbing in such perfect weekend conditions. And never will be again. Many remarks can trigger pain without the other person meaning to, or even realising. Take the friendly Irish nurse who tonight told me of her love of hiking in the Peak District, her trips to the Lake District, her walks in Switzerland. It took all my strength not to reply you have no fucking idea. I didn\u2019t just hike those places. I saw and accessed sights you can\u2019t even imagine. And then my mind is flooded with all the places I\u2019ll never see again. The North London Mountaineering Club hut in Snowdonia, my home from home that I planned to visit regularly until I died. Wen Zawn at Gogarth. My favourite Kalymnos bar. Portland sport routes. The Borrowdale trad crags. The view of Italy from 3,000m. The feeling of slinging a full rucksack back into the van after a long day\u2019s effort. Wyoming. El Chorro. Fontainebleau. Never again. And the list goes on. It might sound strange but the emotion I feel in relation to this is heartbreak. I realised this today after a kind nursing assistant asked me (respectfully, in appropriate circumstances) what my accident had been. I told her the story. And then I began to cry. A 36-year-old man in tears, in front of a near stranger. 5 October The truth is I\u2019m finding rehab very hard. After spending nearly three months fixating on getting here, the reality of starting intensive physio and therapy is not the instant salvation I had hoped it would be. The rehab team gave me a power wheelchair this week, which restores a modicum of independence. All I can think about, however, is how small the rehab centre is, having now lapped it dozens of times. And about how winter will soon make even the gardens inaccessible. And this is where I will spend every day for months. The other night we were lucky enough to listen to music performed live in the large outdoor pod. Upbeat songs about love and joy? They just make me think about how I don\u2019t have a partner, I don\u2019t have children, and I\u2019ve realistically blown any chance at either from here on out. So what is left to give the fight meaning? What\u2019s the point? 19 October I am no longer the only published author among the patients at rehab. Indeed, I\u2019m not even close to being the most widely read any more. That\u2019s because a couple of weeks ago Hanif Kureishi arrived to also undergo rehabilitation. As well as being a successful novelist and screenwriter, Hanif directly inspired me to start these blogs. That\u2019s because he has been dictating Substack posts via his partner and children since he suffered a debilitating spinal cord injury himself on Boxing Day last year. I was made aware of his regular \u201cdispatches\u201d while in Royal London hospital, and read all of them. It was helpful to hear what somebody else going through the same kind of experience as me was making of it, and it brought me solace when he wrote about struggling with some of the same things that I have. More generally it made me think that if he could write, then I should try writing too. And so I did. Hanif and I have had a couple of good conversations since he arrived, but nothing is ever easy in this new life and he is now mostly isolated for infection control reasons. 3 December I\u2019ve written before about how utterly overwhelming this experience is. Well it turns out that it doesn\u2019t get easier with time. I didn\u2019t realise one could be overwhelmed by constantly feeling overwhelmed. Overwhelm fatigue. Metawhelmed, if you like. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at right now. My mind is a cacophony of paradoxical, or at least incoherent, thoughts. Here\u2019s an example. Last week was my \u201ccase conference\u201d, when the therapists and medical leads here sat down with my parents and I to discuss my progress to date, and future steps. They congratulated me on having made real gains as a result of trying very hard in my various physio and therapy sessions, and therefore extending my admission by another month. This is only done for people who have made progress and whom it is believed will make further gains if they stay longer. By no means does everyone get extended. Great news for me, right? Of course I can see that this is ultimately positive. My parents were a little baffled, however, as to why I nonetheless apparently took so little cheer from it. The answer is that I find it hard to be uplifted by progress towards a goal that I fundamentally don\u2019t want. The brute truth is that I don\u2019t want to be a better-than-expected tetraplegic. I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. And the fact this is impossible doesn\u2019t stop me wanting it. 26 January 2024 If nothing else, the past half a year has made me acutely aware of how dependent on family one becomes even while living in the heart of the NHS. If it weren\u2019t for my mother and father, I would be truly screwed. It would have been impossible for me to single-handedly deal with things like securing accommodation for the future, let alone communicating with my employer and various crucial organisations during the first few months of my injury. As far as I can tell, after an accident like mine, those who don\u2019t have family to pick up the pieces are in the direst of dire straits. So I\u2019m lucky to have parents who care enough, and are competent enough and financially stable enough, to offer me serious help in rebuilding something like a life. And for this, of course, I am grateful. Which leads to a question: why then do I sometimes behave like such a shit? Last weekend was not my finest hour. Having made the long trek down from Merseyside to the rehab centre just outside Watford, my mum and dad came to spend time with me. And I rewarded them with toddler levels of truculence and incivility. Why can\u2019t I behave nicely, as a fitting display of the gratitude that I do genuinely feel towards them? The answer I think lies, at least in part, in the fact that half a year ago I was an independent adult with his own income, career, projects, and so forth, but I am now effectively reduced to the status of a child. I need Mummy and Daddy to help me with everything in life. And this is a very difficult thing to come to terms with. And if one is now living like a baby, why not act like one? Add to that the fact that I\u2019m now in the position of having to be grateful all the time: to the person that wipes my arse, to whoever washes me, or puts my clothes on or brushes my teeth. I am grateful to the person that brings my lunch out and puts it in front of me, to the nurse who puts my afternoon medication into my mouth. I am grateful to the staff in the gym that I spend most of the day with, most of whom by now have had to cope with either my piss or shit at least once. I am grateful to whichever persons put me to bed before propping up my iPad so that I can watch some crap on Netflix before falling asleep and repeating it all again. The result of this is what one might call gratitude exhaustion. 5 February One of the many things that I never appreciated about my old life is that I was virtually never bored. My work consisted mostly of reading and discussing interesting ideas with colleagues and students. If I got bored during the day, I\u2019d amuse myself by playing online chess (poorly). I trained for climbing 10 to 15 hours a week, while weekends were almost always spent driving somewhere it wasn\u2019t raining so as to climb outdoors. Evenings after training left time for good-quality TV, or reading a novel. And of course there were always friends to catch up with in London if I ever felt like actually being sociable. Failing that, I\u2019d go fishing. Essentially, if I was awake I was active, either in body or mind. A lazy weekend, doing nothing, was something like my idea of a bad time. The contrast with my new life could hardly be more stark. I now regularly spend chunks of time just doing nothing. The strangest thing, though, is how accustomed I have become to this mode of living. Seconds become minutes, become hours, become days. Time just drifts by unfilled, and I watch as it passes. I\u2019m bored, but weirdly indifferent about that boredom. It doesn\u2019t drive me crazy like it would have before. I\u2019ve become somebody else; somebody I don\u2019t especially admire, but who seems worryingly like they are here to stay. 10 March I have now moved on to a nursing home. There is no doubt that it is an improvement on living behind a curtain in a hospital ward. Nonetheless, I have the sense of starring in my own personal Groundhog Day. Every day is basically the same. Mornings are lost, waiting for my various needs to be dealt with. Afternoons I spend trying to work, with decreasing levels of enthusiasm. Evenings I play some online chess, wondering how it is possible to get progressively worse as the days pass. Then it is back to bed for yet more TV. Rinse, repeat. I never go anywhere new. I have no plans. There are no holidays to look forward to. No weekends away. Just more of the same, day after day. Bill Murray, I get it now. And so it might not be especially surprising to hear that I am not doing very well psychologically. Leaving the hell of rehab, getting some minimal privacy, and being able to read serious work for the first time in months gave me an initial mental boost. But it is not especially surprising that this was not a magic cure. And yet I am still taken aback by the scale of my mental collapse. I feel as hopeless, as unable to accept and adapt, as at any other time since I regained consciousness. For a few weeks, I genuinely thought I was getting better. I do not feel even remotely close to that any more. All of which has led me to a decision. I have begun the process of formally applying to Dignitas, with the eventual possibility of assisted suicide. Many more steps will be required if I am ultimately to go through with this, and I will have the option of changing my mind at many points in the future. (Some people have tried to tell me that I will not be eligible because I am not terminally ill, but I have done my research and although there is no guarantee that I will be accepted for consideration, tetraplegics from Britain have used the Swiss service before.) At the very least, what this gives me is the psychological comfort of knowing there is an escape route. I am so tired of feeling completely trapped, forced to stay alive by other people, with all the power and control removed from my own life. Even if I don\u2019t take the option, knowing that the option is at least there provides a kind of comfort: the knowledge that I still have a final small amount of meaningful agency, that I can finally make this stop if I want to. 11 May Last week I completed the long process of losing my home. The apartment I lived in for three years has changed hands, and now belongs to somebody else. And it hurts so much. The place was very modest; just a small one-bedroom flat. But it was mine. Those were my bookshelves. My choices of mountainscape on the wall. My arrangement of furniture. My base of operations for work, whenever I wasn\u2019t travelling, trying to get as much time in the great outdoors as I could. Shortly before my accident, as a way of channelling the emotional pain from the breakup of a four-year relationship I had repainted most of the walls and doors, even had a new carpet fitted in the bedroom. And then one day I walked out and drove away, not knowing that it was for the last time. Nobody told me that I would never see the place again. I never got to say goodbye. 5 June It has been a year to the day since my accident. A year since I woke up somewhere peaceful, somewhere quiet, at a time of my own choosing. Since it was up to me alone how long I stayed in bed. A year since I could piss standing up, of my own volition, rather than it dribbling out of me into a plastic bag. A year since I made my own breakfast. Since I was able to lift a normal cup of coffee. A year since I was able to drive, often hundreds of miles at a time, just to be outdoors and in the wild. Far more than a year since I held a woman\u2019s hand, felt the touch of a human body against mine. But a year since these things were even possible for me; something that could sanely be hoped for some future day. A year since it was physically possible for me to enjoy exercise, or use it as a weapon against the parasite of depression that now resides in regal ascendancy over my mind. A year since I climbed. That indescribable world of adventure, which gave my life satisfaction and meaning. The antidote to the psychological ill-health that an academic career made me otherwise so especially vulnerable to. A year since I woke up even just indifferent about, let alone looking forward to, the day ahead. A year since my first thought hasn\u2019t been wishing that I had died in the night. A year since I felt more than fleeting moments of happiness. A year since I felt joy. A year since I died. A year since I was reborn into a life I never agreed to, and would never have chosen, but am condemned by others to continue. A lot can change in a year. And so perhaps, out of the darkness, comes also the light of hope. 18 June Through the herculean efforts of my parents, I now have a new place to call my own. And making the adjustment has been perhaps the most difficult thing I have been through so far. I really didn\u2019t think it would be this way. While nervous, before the date of the move I experienced a definite uptick in mood. This began to fade once we pulled on to the North Circular. Here was a route I had driven many times in my old life. The store where I bought furniture for my first apartment. The pet shop where I sometimes got supplies for the cats (that I no longer have). The turning I used to take to the Lea Valley to fish for pike in the winter. When I last saw these places, I was driving my own van. Now I was in the back of an ambulance, being awkwardly jolted around. Memories came flooding back punching me in the gut, reminding me how much I have lost. My mum came down to meet the ambulance crew and help transfer me and my possessions up into the new flat. One thing stopping this apartment from feeling like a home is that the walls are all bare. The answer to which would normally be obvious and easy: hang up my own pictures. But there\u2019s the rub. Hanging any of my old artwork on the walls is almost too painful to contemplate, not least because a lot of it consists of framed pictures of mountains. Mountains that I have climbed. Even non-climbing artwork inevitably comes with memories of previous homes it has hung in; past times in my past life; friends in happier years. But pictures were by no means the worst of it. Also transported from my old home to my new were my old clothes. The problem is that now I can\u2019t wear most of them. All of my old jeans, and anything with a button or a buckle, now poses the threat of pressure sores. When it comes to upper layers, anything snug against my former physique is now impossible to combine with the repulsive potbelly I permanently sport. So I agreed to help my mum triage my old clothes, deciding what to keep and what to throw away. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m exaggerating when I say this is the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. Virtually every piece of clothing had some connection to my former life: climbing gear, bouldering gym merch, T-shirts from climbing destinations, outdoor brands \u2013 aside from the odd Guns N\u2019 Roses T-shirt, almost every item put a dagger through my heart. Or rather, two daggers. One for myself, who died. One for climbing, the love I lost. 7 August It\u2019s been a while, and enough people have been in contact in various ways, asking if I\u2019m all right, that I feel a quick update is in order. In the grand scheme of things, yes. On the physical side, putting aside for now that my body is a wreckage site that will only get worse with time, I\u2019m doing OK. No further complications, with UTIs and spasms under control, for once. On the mental side, well\u2026 it\u2019s a process. My occupational therapist in rehab told me that most people find the first three to six months after leaving hospital the hardest. My physical therapist said I should expect the first year to be \u201chell\u201d. So far, I can\u2019t argue with that. I\u2019ve been able to distract myself with academic research and writing, which is certainly more than nothing. But it\u2019s hard to feel like it\u2019s enough. 25 October I have been watching the debate over changing the UK\u2019s law on assisted dying with sardonic interest. On the face of it the debate should have nothing to do with me. I, after all, am not terminally ill, and what is being debated is whether people with six months or less to live should be able to die by suicide with medical help. I simply don\u2019t meet the criteria. However, those who oppose a change in the law often claim that if the law is loosened, we will be on a slippery slope down to a place where people like me (disabled people) are not only offered assisted suicide, but pressed by wider society into taking that option. And as this would be bad, the law should stay as it is. On the other side, those who favour changing the law vigorously deny (at least in public) that any such slippery slope will be encountered \u2013 and thus they implicitly or explicitly agree that assisted suicide should only be for those who, to put it bluntly, are going to die soon anyway. Hence, again, it is not for me. The effect of which is to compound my overwhelming sense that I am trapped in a living nightmare from which I cannot escape. When medical professionals decided that my ruined body should live, whether I might have wanted it to or not, they also determined that any future choice about whether to continue would for ever be taken away from me. Whereas a normal-bodied (or even just less disabled) person could take matters into their own hands and decide that enough is enough, I cannot. I need the help of someone else. And the law is pretty clear that nobody is allowed to help me. Hence, trapped. The potential loophole here is of course to go abroad, to a jurisdiction where medically assisted suicide is legal. And so, I\u2019m working on it. The application to Dignitas is active. 11 November In ancient Greek mythology, Pandora is said to have unleashed a range of curses upon humankind. Curiosity led her to open a box entrusted to her husband, out of which death, sickness and a host of other evils escaped. But left behind, so the story goes, was hope. One way to read this is as a sort of consolation. That despite all the evils humanity is forced to endure, we are able to cling to the light of hope. But I\u2019ve long suspected (both before my accident, and especially since) that hope is the worst curse of them all. Moral philosophers like Adam Smith would rightly point out that being in a wheelchair, with virtually useless hands, is not a permanent obstacle to mental tranquillity. Plenty of happy tetraplegics prove it to be so (and indeed, I have met some of them). If I first accept my situation, and allow my psychology to adjust to it, it should be possible to escape the pit of despair. But I am consumed by a hope that holds me back. This comes in the form of longing for medical and technological advances that somehow \u201ccure\u201d spinal cord injury. This is indulged by regular Google searches along those lines. Like the other night, when I went down the rabbit hole of investigating NVG-291, the leading candidate for a therapeutic treatment, now in phase 1b/2a human trials. Riding the high of hope, I convince myself that I\u2019m only going to have to do this for a few years, and then I\u2019m going to get my life back. But then the hope wears off, and reality hits: that even if it lives up to the most optimistic hopes, NVG-291 is only going to restore partial functions, and will anyway take years to arrive in a clinically administered setting. And even if it does arrive, I am not getting my old life back, because that life is now definitively over. As the saying goes, it\u2019s the hope that kills you. My hope is a curse. I need it to die. I need to accept. Maybe tomorrow. Read Paul Sagar\u2019s Substack, Diary of a Punter, here",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Global emissions continue to increase, carbon sinks are being degraded and we can no longer exclude the possibility of surpassing 2.9C of warming by 2100.\u201d It is a bleak assessment of our planet\u2019s future and could have been made by just about any environmental organisation on Earth.</p> <p>In fact, they are the views of an international group of climate experts that highlight, in sharp detail, the manifest failings of the UN\u2019s annual Cop climate summits, whose 29th iteration is now being staged in Baku, Azerbaijan. These talks, they said last week, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/15/cop-summits-no-longer-fit-for-purpose-say-leading-climate-policy-experts\">no longer fit for purpose</a> and need an urgent overhaul.</p> <p>The group \u2013 which includes former UN secretary general Ban-Ki moon and former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres \u2013 are to be congratulated for the veracity and timing of their warning. Cop summits have become a byword for talk and very little action, as illustrated by the fact they have taken almost 30 years merely to agree to \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels when a decision to have a full-blooded phasing-out has been needed desperately for decades.</p> <p>The grim state of Cop negotiations was further underlined last week by Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, who told world leaders that natural gas was a \u201cgift from God\u201d. Countries should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market, he said, because \u201cthe market needs them\u201d.</p> <p>At the same time, Cop29 has witnessed little progress in finding finance to help developing nations adapt to global warming or to highlight how the world is going to cut emissions in future. \u201cThis has been the worst first week of a Cop in my 15 years attending these summits,\u201d Mohamed Adow, director of the climate thinktank, Power Shift Africa said today.</p> <p>It would be tempting, under these circumstances, to think about starting afresh and to consider a completely new diplomatic initiative to introduce speedier, more effective ways to curtail climate change, and so stave off the increasingly severe floods, droughts and storms that are being unleashed on our planet.</p> <p>The idea may sound attractive but it would be folly to act so precipitously. Cop summits are still the only meetings at which every nation \u2013 rich and poor \u2013 gets a seat at the table when it comes to trying to save Earth. As Adow points out, they are akin to Winston Churchill\u2019s description of democracy; they are the worst way of doing it except for all the other ways.</p> <p>Given this stricture, last week\u2019s intervention by Ban-Ki moon, Figueres and the others was all the more important. If we are stuck with Cop summits, we must find ways to make them effective, they insist. Exclude countries that do not support the phasing out of fossil energy, they suggest. Summits should be smaller, more frequent and focused on solving specific climate-related problems, they also argue, while mechanisms should be introduced to hold nations accountable to their climate targets.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Global emissions continue to increase, carbon sinks are being degraded and we can no longer exclude the possibility of surpassing 2.9C of warming by 2100.\u201d It is a bleak assessment of our planet\u2019s future and could have been made by just about any environmental organisation on Earth. In fact, they are the views of an international group of climate experts that highlight, in sharp detail, the manifest failings of the UN\u2019s annual Cop climate summits, whose 29th iteration is now being staged in Baku, Azerbaijan. These talks, they said last week, are no longer fit for purpose and need an urgent overhaul. The group \u2013 which includes former UN secretary general Ban-Ki moon and former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres \u2013 are to be congratulated for the veracity and timing of their warning. Cop summits have become a byword for talk and very little action, as illustrated by the fact they have taken almost 30 years merely to agree to \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels when a decision to have a full-blooded phasing-out has been needed desperately for decades. The grim state of Cop negotiations was further underlined last week by Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, who told world leaders that natural gas was a \u201cgift from God\u201d. Countries should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market, he said, because \u201cthe market needs them\u201d. At the same time, Cop29 has witnessed little progress in finding finance to help developing nations adapt to global warming or to highlight how the world is going to cut emissions in future. \u201cThis has been the worst first week of a Cop in my 15 years attending these summits,\u201d Mohamed Adow, director of the climate thinktank, Power Shift Africa said today. It would be tempting, under these circumstances, to think about starting afresh and to consider a completely new diplomatic initiative to introduce speedier, more effective ways to curtail climate change, and so stave off the increasingly severe floods, droughts and storms that are being unleashed on our planet. The idea may sound attractive but it would be folly to act so precipitously. Cop summits are still the only meetings at which every nation \u2013 rich and poor \u2013 gets a seat at the table when it comes to trying to save Earth. As Adow points out, they are akin to Winston Churchill\u2019s description of democracy; they are the worst way of doing it except for all the other ways. Given this stricture, last week\u2019s intervention by Ban-Ki moon, Figueres and the others was all the more important. If we are stuck with Cop summits, we must find ways to make them effective, they insist. Exclude countries that do not support the phasing out of fossil energy, they suggest. Summits should be smaller, more frequent and focused on solving specific climate-related problems, they also argue, while mechanisms should be introduced to hold nations accountable to their climate targets. The issue of the influence of the thousands of fossil fuel lobbyists who now attend summits also needs addressing. Such goals are laudable and must be seen as aspiration of extreme urgency. Cop29 is foundering and we should be under no illusion about the consequences of future summit failures. If the world continues to heat beyond rises of 2C, major tipping points will be passed and we will be at risk of witnessing the destruction of the world\u2019s tropical coral reefs, the destabilisation of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, the abrupt thawing of the world\u2019s permafrost regions, and widespread flooding along with the spread of deadly droughts and storms.

Helped by his family, Vieri hit the ground running at non-league Santa Lucia, before being spotted by Prato and then the Italian giants Torino.</p>    <p>\u201cMy grandfather was the only one that believed in me,\u201d says Vieri. \u201cAnd the first game that I played, when I scored four goals, my grandfather said to my auntie: \u2018If we keep him here, he\u2019s going to become one of the best strikers in the world.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Vieri\u2019s grandfather offered him a reward of 5,000 lira for every goal. \u201cAfter three games, we went to one. Because the first two games, I scored like seven goals, So he said: \u2018Listen, I can\u2019t keep up with this.\u2019\u201dBut Vieri\u2019s journey to becoming one of the world\u2019s best was not straightforward, with an inconsistent three years in Serie B in the early 90s for three different clubs, only returning to Serie A in 1995 with Atalanta aged 22. Initially there were few signs of the player he would become but two years on Vieri won his first&nbsp;and only <em>Scudetto</em> with Juventus, and started the 1997 Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund, having scored in both the quarter- and semi-finals.</p> <p>Alongside Zinedine Zidane and Alessandro Del Piero and under Marcello Lippi, Vieri learned a lot despite falling out with his \u00admanager, almost coming to blows in the \u00addressing room during a league game.</p> <p>\u201cI was on the bench and [Alen] Boksic got injured,\u201d says Vieri. \u201cSo I played like 10 minutes in the first half.&nbsp;Then Lippi says something to me.&nbsp;I said: \u2018But I just played five \u00adminutes, what do you want from me?\u2019 I was nervous I wasn\u2019t \u00adplaying so I answered back. He came at me. We&nbsp;had a fight, then he took me off.&nbsp;Not quite a physical fight, as another player stopped us. These things happen. That means you care.&nbsp;Zidane and I were so different,\u201d he continues.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk much. He\u2019s a silent&nbsp;man. And so when it was the winter I would take him home to my&nbsp;house and eat with my mum\u2019s friends. But I would always play around with him. We always had an amazing relationship. I like to pick on everyone, you know. So he would come for dinner, my mum would speak in French and he would enjoy that.\u201d</p>    <p>Vieri stayed at Juventus for a \u00adsingle season before Atl\u00e9tico Madrid offered to nearly double his salary, and it was in Spain where Vieri truly became elite, scoring 24 goals in as many La&nbsp;Liga games to win the 1997-98 Pichichi award, despite Atl\u00e9tico finishing sixth. \u201cAt Atl\u00e9tico they were all relaxed. When you fill your head with stress, it\u2019s all bullshit. During the pre-season, I was running like crazy. Everyone\u2019s going: \u2018Where are you going?

      "bodyText": "I am having to explain to Christian Vieri that despite us being in London and only a few miles from Lord\u2019s, organising a game of cricket with Sir Ian Botham is probably going to be a bit tricky. I just don\u2019t have that sort of pulling power, but also because the former Ashes legend is in Australia and a bit banged up after falling into crocodile-filled waters on a fishing trip. The thing is, Vieri \u2013 the former striker who at one time became the most expensive footballer in the world when he moved to Internazionale in 1999 for about \u00a330m \u2013 doesn\u2019t just like cricket, he loves it, having spent most of his childhood in Australia. As a legend of Serie A and the Azzurri \u2013 no Italian has more World Cup goals than Vieri\u2019s nine \u2013 the 51-year-old talks often about his extraordinary football career when working as a pundit in Italy but rarely of the other sport that dominated his childhood in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs. Vieri comes alive at the mention of West Indies and when I tell him that Botham also played professional football. \u201cI would go to the Sydney Cricket Ground and saw Australia play the West Indies,\u201d remembers Vieri, who speaks in perfect English with a strong Australian accent, just as he did as a young man. \u201cThe West Indies are the best cricket team ever. Ever. In those days Viv Richards, Joel Garner, Malcolm Marshall, Clive Lloyd \u2013 all those guys \u2013 they were just phenomenal. Like the 20 best players in the world, they were always West Indians, like Michael Holding, like Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes. \u201cAllan Border was my favourite Australian player,\u201d continues Vieri. \u201cHe\u2019s the boss of the boss. He gave me his cricket bat. But my No 1s are Viv Richards and Botham. Amazing, man. Maybe he was the best all-round cricketer that ever played the game.\u201d What it is about West Indies that he loves so much? \u201cJust like the West Indies, you\u2019ve got to be confident in life if you want to go somewhere. Everyone\u2019s going to put you down when you want to do something. So you\u2019ve just got to just go for it 100%.\u201d Vieri, nicknamed Bobo, has never struggled for confidence, either in front of goal or off the pitch.

Recycling in England has stalled, according to official figures released in September, with the household recycling rate falling from 44.6% in 2022 to 44.1% last year. In the three other nations of the UK, the rate increased. Overall the UK generated 191.2m tonnes of waste in 2020, the majority from construction and demolition, down from 222.2m tonnes in 2018. In 2021, Boris Johnson\u2019s government introduced the Environment Act as a replacement for EU regulations and started consulting on a deposit return scheme for drinks bottles, an extended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme where companies should pay for the cost of disposing of packaging they create, and minimum standards on bin collections. Progress has been slow. EPR was delayed after lobbying by food and drink companies and fees will be levied from October 2025. The deposit return scheme for England and Northern Ireland was announced by environment minister Mary Creagh last month and excludes glass, \u2013 schemes have previously been announced for Scotland and Wales but have been delayed. Chris Mills, programme lead for policy and insights at Wrap, the recycling campaigners, said there were environmental and economic benefits from separating waste, but there was a trade-off since it would be hard for people in communal buildings to have lots of separate collections. \u201cWe think a degree of separation is definitely beneficial,\u201d he said. Andy Graham, the District Councils Network environment spokesperson, said recycling rates could be raised through better education and the government needed to create a national approach rather than a \u201cpatchwork\u201d. \u201cWe really need a sustainable funding package for three years for us to be able to achieve any real difference,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an increase of deliveries to homes \u2013 Amazon, for example is one of the key proponents of cardboard for home deliveries and some of that volume is unnecessary.\u201d Amazon has said that it has reduced the weight of its packaging by an average of 41% since 2015 and has replaced single-use plastic with paper and cardboard in Europe. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 November 2024. An earlier version misnamed DS Smith as DH Smith. Also it was amended to clarify that deposit return schemes in Scotland and Wales have been announced but not yet implemented.",

      "body": "<p>Prepping \u2013 I\u2019m coming round to it. I\u2019ve had Prepare, the old government website that Oliver Dowden launched this spring, open on my laptop in a quivering tab for a while now, and this week I\u2019ve been dipping in every now and then to remind myself of \u201chow to prepare for an emergency\u201d. How many bottles of water we may need, tweezers, a sage reminder about the fact of tinned meat.</p> <p>I\u2019ve dabbled in prepping before, without really realising what I was doing. A fear in the early 2000s that Rimmel might stop making my favourite eyeliner led to me dashing to Boots to buy five. Which is fairly normal, I think? On the spectrum of normal? Sensible probably, when so many, as you\u2019ll know, have brushes too fine or ink that disappears in rain. In the grip of lockdown, as supermarket deliveries were increasingly scarce, when I was blessed with a Tesco slot I would focus not on toilet paper or flour, but on treats. I\u2019d stockpile the good biscuits, and, in my naivety, Biscoff spread. I remember there were very large gift bars of Galaxy chocolate on offer for a while, bars the size of a small dinghy which I would buy in bulk, nibbling away at the corners like a parasite. That was when we started decanting our pulses. Still, beside the microwave sits a proud wall of oversized Tupperware, carefully labelled in my six-year-old daughter\u2019s handwriting: \u201cspageti\u201d, \u201cgreen lenttles\u201d, \u201cryce\u201d. It felt good. I felt prepared, but for what, was unclear.</p> <p>The Doomsday Clock is now set at 90 seconds to midnight. Its operators, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, who monitor the combined risks of nuclear annihilation, climate disaster, biological threat and \u201cdisruptive technologies\u201d, say we have never been closer to global catastrophic destruction. So it should come as no surprise that the value of the preppers industry is growing \u2013 by 2030 it\u2019s due to reach $2.46bn. It\u2019s a lifestyle now, the purchases providing identity as much as security.

I\u2019ve had Prepare, the old government website that Oliver Dowden launched this spring, open on my laptop in a quivering tab for a while now, and this week I\u2019ve been dipping in every now and then to remind myself of \u201chow to prepare for an emergency\u201d. How many bottles of water we may need, tweezers, a sage reminder about the fact of tinned meat. I\u2019ve dabbled in prepping before, without really realising what I was doing. A fear in the early 2000s that Rimmel might stop making my favourite eyeliner led to me dashing to Boots to buy five. Which is fairly normal, I think? On the spectrum of normal? Sensible probably, when so many, as you\u2019ll know, have brushes too fine or ink that disappears in rain. In the grip of lockdown, as supermarket deliveries were increasingly scarce, when I was blessed with a Tesco slot I would focus not on toilet paper or flour, but on treats. I\u2019d stockpile the good biscuits, and, in my naivety, Biscoff spread. I remember there were very large gift bars of Galaxy chocolate on offer for a while, bars the size of a small dinghy which I would buy in bulk, nibbling away at the corners like a parasite. That was when we started decanting our pulses. Still, beside the microwave sits a proud wall of oversized Tupperware, carefully labelled in my six-year-old daughter\u2019s handwriting: \u201cspageti\u201d, \u201cgreen lenttles\u201d, \u201cryce\u201d. It felt good. I felt prepared, but for what, was unclear. The Doomsday Clock is now set at 90 seconds to midnight. Its operators, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, who monitor the combined risks of nuclear annihilation, climate disaster, biological threat and \u201cdisruptive technologies\u201d, say we have never been closer to global catastrophic destruction. So it should come as no surprise that the value of the preppers industry is growing \u2013 by 2030 it\u2019s due to reach $2.46bn. It\u2019s a lifestyle now, the purchases providing identity as much as security. Last week, a New Yorker piece on \u201cThe Americans Prepping for a Second Civil War\u201d reported that 20 million Americans are actively preparing for \u201ccataclysm\u201d.

Aldana paid but the agent&nbsp;promptly&nbsp;blocked him on WhatsApp and all social media.</p> <p>Patrick Gustafsson shared Aldana\u2019s dream. A part-time nursery teacher in Sweden, his passion was football. His so-called agent got in touch touting a trial in Belarus. The price: 7,000 Swedish krona \u2013 around \u00a3520 \u2013 would secure his spot.</p>    <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Gustafsson says. \u201cIt was a lot of money, but I really wanted the opportunity. It became real to me when he asked for money. But at&nbsp;the&nbsp;time, I didn\u2019t know any better.&nbsp;I&nbsp;had just turned 18 and had&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream to go pro.\u201d He paid the&nbsp;money but lost it all.</p> <p>Nathan Miles can relate to Aldana and Gustafsson. He was offered a trial at the Ukrainian club Zorya in exchange for a registration fee of $741. \u201cAs a naive 16-year-old, I wasn\u2019t 100% sure how this was meant to go,\u201d Miles says. He parted with the cash. Good news followed: before seeing him play in the flesh, Zorya wanted to pay Miles a $50,000 sign-on fee and a monthly net wage of $5,000. It simply required a $2,200 deposit. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m&nbsp;fully aware that this was completely wrong,\u201d Miles says. \u201cI&nbsp;was a pretty dumb 16-year-old but&nbsp;knew a professional team wouldn\u2019t offer a senior contract without physically seeing them.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than walk away, Miles negotiated. He didn\u2019t want the contract but did want to go to Ukraine for the trial. Eventually dates were settled, but Miles\u2019s official documentation supposedly got stuck in Switzerland. It would cost $150 to release. That was a line&nbsp;Miles refused to cross, and he asked for his initial fee to be refunded. Instead of blocking him the agent insisted Miles would be reimbursed and continued offering alternative trials. Miles never received any money back.</p> <p>What links these young players and countless others out there? \u201cThere are so many who are just so&nbsp;desperate, and they do truly believe that they need that one opportunity because they\u2019re so close,\u201d Miles says. \u201cBut opportunities in football are rare for players who aren\u2019t at the top level, and so when a player believes that their opportunity is finally here, emotions take over logical thinking.\u201d</p> <p>And it is in that mental malaise that scammers thrive. \u201cThey use a young player\u2019s dream against them,\u201d says Miles\u2019s brother Josh.

Aldana was training with a National League team when he was contacted on LinkedIn by someone claiming to be an agent and offering a trial with a Swedish third-tier club.

There were three of them in the first eight minutes. England barely made it through the first, but Van Poortvliet snapped the ball away before they buckled. By the back end of the half South Africa were picking up back-to-back penalties there. It was only when they were forced into making a series of staggered changes to their front row that England managed to gain any kind of parity. There wasn\u2019t an easy inch, or a ready breath, to be had.</p> <p>They kept at it. But all that punishment started to show. And in the second half England were falling off tackles, and flagging into contact. It didn\u2019t help that their replacements were unable to do anything much to improve them. Luke Cowan-Dickie blew one attacking lineout when he was penalised for making a dummy throw, Randall bungled another when he knocked the ball on gathering it up from down by his feet.</p> <p>These Springboks are, as Borthwick said, \u201ca very, very good team\u201d.

They are beatable. But not by this England team, who, for all their resilience, simply seem to be missing that extra something that makes the difference when the heavy pressure comes down. Borthwick\u2019s a good man, but listening to him talk afterwards, you struggled to believe that he knows what it is, much less where to find it.</p>",

Jack van Poortvliet spent the entire half trying to escape from the shadow of Eben Etzebeth, who came at him like the barn door falling on Buster Keaton. Meanwhile the scrum turned into the sort of enhanced interrogation that usually requires presidential approval, and even then is left open to challenge in the international courts. There were three of them in the first eight minutes. England barely made it through the first, but Van Poortvliet snapped the ball away before they buckled. By the back end of the half South Africa were picking up back-to-back penalties there. It was only when they were forced into making a series of staggered changes to their front row that England managed to gain any kind of parity. There wasn\u2019t an easy inch, or a ready breath, to be had. They kept at it. But all that punishment started to show. And in the second half England were falling off tackles, and flagging into contact. It didn\u2019t help that their replacements were unable to do anything much to improve them. Luke Cowan-Dickie blew one attacking lineout when he was penalised for making a dummy throw, Randall bungled another when he knocked the ball on gathering it up from down by his feet. These Springboks are, as Borthwick said, \u201ca very, very good team\u201d. But they\u2019ve lost twice already this year, once to Argentina, when Manie Libbok missed a kick in the final minute, and then to Ireland, when Ciar\u00e1n Frawley made one. They are beatable. But not by this England team, who, for all their resilience, simply seem to be missing that extra something that makes the difference when the heavy pressure comes down. Borthwick\u2019s a good man, but listening to him talk afterwards, you struggled to believe that he knows what it is, much less where to find it.",

      "body": "<p>Mark Ward should be long dead. He ought to have been a goner decades ago. \u201cSomebody dies of infected blood every two days,\u201d he explains, \u201cand every time they do, it\u2019s a step closer to being my turn.\u201d He delivers this nonchalantly. \u201cI have to live in the fast lane, because the clock is ticking and mine is running extra fast. I\u2019ve got this far on borrowed time: at some point my luck will run out.\u201d Ward\u2019s husband Richard wanders through their living room \u2013 briefly, they share a hand squeeze and smile. \u201cSo, usually, I\u2019m asked to look miserable and solemn in photographs. It\u2019s always darkness, death and destruction. It made a nice change this morning to be allowed to look <em>happy</em> for your pictures.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1970s and 80s, more than 30,000 British patients were treated with contaminated blood products teaming with harmful pathogens \u2013 a lethal scandal on a national scale. Ward, 55, a haemophiliac, was one of 6,000 bleeding-disorder patients. He was infected with HIV, multiple strains of hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19 and others. To date, at least 3,000 people have died because of a litany of institutional failures, covered up for a generation.</p> <p>\u201cBut, you know,\u201d Ward continues, \u201clife\u2019s too short to only be miserable. There\u2019s more than just one bit of me.\u201d It\u2019s this spirit which spills from the pages of his new autobiography, <em>Bleeding Fabulous.</em> While death, pain and prejudice have defined much of his life \u2013 it\u2019s all there to see \u2013 so too, has joy and love and high-camp hilarity. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the nearness of death,\u201d Ward writes, \u201cto make you want to live your very best life\u2026 Faced with my mortality, I chose to live fabulously.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s late October on the East Sussex coast. We\u2019re sitting in the neat living room of Ward\u2019s marital home, on a quiet close just down the road from Brighton. Along with a small army of volunteers and activists, he\u2019s spent years campaigning for justice for the victims of the contaminated blood scandal \u2013 a relentless battle. \u201cIt has been non-stop,\u201d he says. \u201cConstant. While every day, people around us are dying from it, who we love like family.\u201d Beyond the sliding doors out back is a cherished, verdant garden. Tending it, Ward says, has offered an escape when the fight has felt all-consuming.</p>    <p>The results of the years-long efforts are at last coming to fruition. In May this year, a damning <a href=\"https://www.infectedbloodinquiry.org.uk/reports/inquiry-report\">report</a> was published: the culmination of the six-year-long Infected Blood Inquiry led by judge <a href=\"https://www.infectedbloodinquiry.org.uk/about/the-chair\">Sir Brian Langstaff</a>. It found that the NHS\u2019s worst treatment disaster \u201cwas not an accident\u201d and that it could \u201clargely, though not entirely, have been avoided\u201d. That patients were exposed, knowingly, to \u201cunacceptable\u201d infection risks due to \u201csystemic, collective and individual failures\u201d by the authorities. During the hours that Ward and I spend together, Chancellor Rachel Reeves presents her first budget to parliament. In it, she earmarked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/budget-2024-key-points-at-a-glance\">\u00a311.8bn</a> in compensation for infected blood victims. Without activists like Ward, it is crystal clear that these milestones would have been unimaginable. \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet,\u201d Ward is keen to clarify, \u201cthere\u2019s still much more to do. I don\u2019t trust the government, or anybody, really. Because of all the lies and betrayals, I struggle in that area. But people like me have a voice now; a say in what comes next. At last, we can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d</p> <p>Recently, Ward\u2019s been working with NHS England to design a psychological support service for those impacted. Only yesterday, he was up in Newcastle meeting its new staff with four other surviving victims. Back in August, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/24/victims-of-uks-infected-blood-scandal-to-start-receiving-payouts-by-end-of-year\">compensation authority</a> was established, tasked with paying out to those affected once final figures have been agreed upon. \u201cWe were asked to assist in training the people who\u2019ll oversee the process. I was preparing them for the fact that what they\u2019ll hear is going to be horrific. And I wanted to tell them how to speak to people like me, after all we\u2019ve been through.\u201d Payout figures are yet to be published. To date, surviving victims \u2013 known as the living infected \u2013 have received interim payments totalling \u00a3310,000.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not in this for the money,\u201d Ward points out adamantly, \u201cand I never have been. Realistically, the government can\u2019t give me back my life. They can\u2019t uninfect me, or take away decades of fear, stigma and pain. Money, though, is what they can give as recognition.\u201d He hopes it\u2019s a deterrent, too. \u201cWe need to make it hit them in the pocket hard enough to ensure it\u2019s so expensive that something like this can never happen again. While I\u2019m still here, the kids who aren\u2019t\u2026 my friends\u2026 I\u2019m doing this for them. I need to get justice for those we\u2019ve lost, as well as for me. I made them a promise that while I have breath in my body, I\u2019ll keep going.\u201d</p> <p>Acknowledgment has helped heal certain scars. \u201cBut some things,\u201d Ward fears, \u201cwon\u2019t ever go away. I still need an injection every week for my treatment. Every time that needle goes in, I\u2019m transported back. That thought goes through your mind: what could this one have in it?\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>The first signs came</strong></em> when Ward was eight months old: a vast, dark purple bruise along his side that appeared from nowhere. Not long after, he nicked the inside of his upper lip. Nothing his parents tried would stop the bleeding. When he was three, specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital diagnosed him with haemophilia: a rare genetic disorder, predominantly in men, that prevents blood from clotting properly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Corporate greed put profit before patients. We were used for research</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe doctor told my family my life expectancy would be 21, if I was lucky.\u201d The smallest knocks and bumps, his parents learned, might easily become life-threatening without urgent treatments. Bleeds \u2013 whether internal or external \u2013 could prove fatal. \u201cLife became an endless back and forth in ambulances,\u201d Ward says. His regular nosebleeds didn\u2019t help matters. \u201cIn those days, parents couldn\u2019t stay overnight in the hospital. Mum would have to leave me, not knowing if she\u2019d see me alive again. They\u2019d tie me to the cots to stop me tampering with needles. It was torture, they couldn\u2019t do it today.\u201d It was a lot for the young family to handle.</p> <p>In 1976, medics floated changes to Ward\u2019s treatment. \u201cThis new treatment was called Factor VIII,\u201d the family was told. \u201cThey said it was the future and would normalise my life. It could be administered at home.\u201d Still, his parents were instinctively reluctant to mess with what was already working. Much of this Factor VIII was imported from the US to meet growing domestic demand. \u201cDad didn\u2019t trust it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen in 1977, at the age of eight,\u201d Ward says, \u201cI was hospitalised in the middle of the night. The on-call haematologist went to get the treatment I\u2019d need from the freezer.\u201d As always, it was prepared in another room. \u201cThe doctor came in, administered it as normal, and off we went. A few days later, I was back in, and Mum noticed something was different. She asked and was told I\u2019d been transferred to Factor VIII on that previous admission a few evenings earlier.\u201d The family hadn\u2019t consented to the change. \u201cWe were told it was too late now. Decision made. It was a switch we were promised would change all our lives forever. Which it did, irreparably.\u201d</p> <p>For the better, at first. Routines stabilised with the new drugs. \u201cMum learned how to do the injections,\u201d Ward explains. \u201cSo, mostly, I could be treated at home. I went to school. We could take holidays. And Factor VIII shoots up your life expectancy. Suddenly my future didn\u2019t have a limit of 21. I was told I had a whole new chance at life, I was told\u2026\u201d Ward cuts himself off, shakes his head and breathes out slowly.</p> <p>In 1984, at 14, Ward needed knee surgery due to complications from his haemophilia. He was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London\u2019s Hampstead. \u201cAfter six weeks, on the day of discharge,\u201d Ward recounts, \u201cDad was pushing my wheelchair through the hospital, when one of the nurses popped up, and shouted across the waiting room, in front of other patients: \u2018Mr and Mrs Ward, do you want to know his HIV results? He\u2019s positive. See you next time!\u2019 We stepped out and got in the car in a daze.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019d been no mention of me being tested for HIV,\u201d Ward explains, \u201cfor us, the result came from nowhere.\u201d Days later, back in hospital, medics expanded on the situation. \u201cAccidentally, we were told, the \u2018blood of homosexuals\u2019 had got into the treatment. The doctors said, don\u2019t tell anyone; we can\u2019t guarantee your safety.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were told, the \u2018blood of homosexuals\u2019 had got into the treatment. The doctors said, don\u2019t tell anyone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ward\u2019s parents fought for their son to remain in school. \u201cI could return,\u201d Ward says, \u201cthe headteacher reluctantly agreed, on the condition that if anyone found out and complained, I\u2019d be kicked out immediately. After my haemophilia diagnosis, people knowing what was wrong with me offered me protection. Now, with HIV, my health made me a target.\u201d</p> <p>A future had been dangled in front of this teenage boy\u2019s eyes. Now, it was being snatched away. \u201cI was told I\u2019d now have two, maybe three years to live. No 18th birthday. There was no cure. HIV would become Aids: a death sentence.\u201d This was the early days of the Aids epidemic; three years before the first prescriptions for antiretroviral HIV treatments. \u201cThey said I wouldn\u2019t live long enough to even finish school,\u201d says Ward. \u201cIt was totally devastating.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Around 1,250 haemophiliacs</strong></em> were infected with HIV in this way, including 380 children. Some unknowingly infected their partners. Less than 200 are still alive. Ward, like many others, was told his infection was an unfortunate accident. Decades later, the Infected Blood Inquiry would confirm the truth: that in 1982, two years before Ward tested positive, it had been established that HIV could be transmitted through blood products. This was \u201cvery well known\u201d, according to the report, by officials at the time. It took the NHS until the end of 1985 to heat-treat blood products to eliminate HIV, although the risks were known years earlier.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltS2yqxpd2g&amp;amp;list=PLD79AAAFC42164276\">Reporting from as early as 1985</a> also found that Factor VIII from the US was made not with volunteer donor blood, as in the UK, but from those paid for their plasma. Much of it was purchased on the skid rows of America\u2019s big cities from addicts, prisoners, those experiencing homelessness and sex workers, all with a high risk of being HIV and hepatitis carriers. In short, as the report found, patients were exposed to \u201cunacceptable risks\u201d. Ward puts it more bluntly: \u201cCorporate greed saw profit put before patients. We were used for research. I was treated like a piece of meat as it was assumed I\u2019d never amount to anything.\u201d</p> <p>In adulthood, Ward is an out and proud gay man, at home in the LGBTQ+ community. He\u2019s the founder of<a href=\"https://haemosexual.com/\"> Haemosexual</a>, a resource for queer people with bleeding disorders. His book, <em>Bleeding Fabulous,</em> recounts years spent working the door at London\u2019s infamous G-A-Y club, often in full drag; boyfriends loved and lost; nights out in Gran Canaria; run-ins with Princess Di and Kylie.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was treated like a piece of meat as it was assumed I\u2019d never amount to anything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His path to self-acceptance, though, followed rough terrain. Playground homophobic bullying, first. \u201cAt home, the news would come on the TV,\u201d Ward remembers, \u201cshowing these rows of gay men \u2013 with their cloned moustaches \u2013 dying of Aids in hospital. I\u2019d watch thinking: \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019ll look like when I die.\u2019 And haemophiliacs were often homophobic, having been told it was the gays who had caused them harm by selling their blood recklessly. At one point, I felt the same: I blamed gay people, too. Every night on TV, it was haemophiliacs, homosexuals and heroin addicts being demonised: I ticked two boxes. Terrified of who I was, I suppressed everything.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the pages of <em>Bleeding Fabulous</em>, Ward also points to what he feels was homophobia directed his way by medical professionals. \u201cI felt dehumanised. The way I was spoken to and treated. Invasive tests and questions. Cruel comments and derision regularly.\u201d</p> <p>Over the following years, Ward would be diagnosed with a catalogue of other viruses. His HIV developed into Aids. He suffered from a stroke, a lesion on the brain, kidney failure, cirrhosis of the liver and is deemed to be at risk of <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/patic4-3.pdf\">vCJD</a> (the human variant of mad cow disease). \u201cFor me, all the viruses and illnesses that followed,\u201d Ward says, \u201cwere due to pathogens inside that Factor VIII blood. And the authorities and those responsible for my care, could and should have known. Some did. I can never forgive them.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Ward carried on. He pursued a career in aviation \u2013 a job he loved \u2013 and built a life with his husband, Richard. \u201cThat\u2019s a disabled person\u2019s approach,\u201d Ward believes. \u201cIf you\u2019re born healthy and then become disabled, your whole life changes. When born into a world where nothing is quite normal and life feels fragile, you get on with things. Live each day as it comes. Had I listened to the doctors from the outset, I could have spent the whole time terrified of tomorrow. Instead, I\u2019ve made every second count.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Had I listened to the doctors from the outset, I could have spent the whole time terrified of tomorrow</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2006, Ward joined the newly formed<a href=\"https://www.taintedblood.info/\"> TaintedBlood</a>, a campaign group of victims and their loved ones, demanding answers. \u201cWhen I started to learn the truth,\u201d Ward says, \u201cthat what happened to me was avoidable, and the subsequent cover-up. For years, I\u2019d woken up every day thinking I\u2019d survived an accident. Then I realised it had been done to me: I am a victim of their actions and abuse. We had to do something.\u201d</p> <p>Ward\u2019s book documents setback after setback that the campaign group faced before hope appeared on the horizon, including the lies told by successive ministers: as the inquiry report found, there was \u201cdeliberate destruction of documents of relevance\u201d. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even rely on the people who were meant to be caring for us,\u201d he says. \u201cMy GP didn\u2019t believe what I was telling him. Hospital nurses and doctors tried to hide it from us.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks to their tireless efforts, David Cameron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/25/cameron-apologises-infected-hepatitis-c-hiv-contaminated-blood\">apologised</a> to the victims of infected blood in 2015. An inquiry was announced two years later. Ward attended every location the inquiry was held in across the UK through its six years of sitting. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet,\u201d he says, stoically, of all that\u2019s been achieved. \u201cI\u2019m proud, of course, of what we\u2019ve done. I genuinely feel as if I\u2019m keeping my promise to my friends who didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p> <p>All that\u2019s happened has never dulled his zest for life. With his book written and compensation soon to be paid, this prolonged chapter might at last be over. His current prognosis might not be great, but Ward is a born survivor. \u201cThe last life expectancy I heard,\u201d he says, \u201cwas 56. That\u2019s next year for me.\u201d He\u2019s not buying it. Since coming off blood treatments for his haemophilia in 2006, there have been positive developments in his outlook. \u201cI was told I had cirrhosis of the liver because of hepatitis C,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that seems to have spontaneously cleared. And with HIV, I now have an undetectable viral load, which means I can\u2019t pass it on. Hopefully my body has got a grip, even if there have been blips.\u201d</p> <p>Ward and I talk for two hours. Maybe more. As he lists each detail of all he\u2019s endured, there\u2019s steely resilience in his tone \u2013 and some righteous rage \u2013 but his positivity is infectious. How, I ask, has he remained dignified? He takes a moment to consider. \u201cAt times I\u2019ve wanted to scream,\u201d he says, \u201cto cry, and be sick.\u201d Often, he adds, simultaneously. \u201cAlong the way, so many people have told us no, we won\u2019t ever get to this point. I was determined to prove them wrong. And we have, even if the money isn\u2019t quite in our pockets yet: we got the inquiry. The apology. What was denied for decades has been proved, undeniably.\u201d Imagining this, he says, kept him going. \u201cI\u2019ve been called a liar and an attention-seeker, a troublemaker and a bad patient, for asking questions that went ignored.\u201d There\u2019s a twinkle in Ward\u2019s eye, as he looks out to Richard in their beloved garden. \u201cSo you see,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s because of all this that sometimes, I want nothing more than to stand in front of the camera, smiling.\u201d </p> <p><em>Bleeding Fabulous: The Life of a Haemosexual by Mark Ward is published by Inkandescent at \u00a311.99.

To date, at least 3,000 people have died because of a litany of institutional failures, covered up for a generation. \u201cBut, you know,\u201d Ward continues, \u201clife\u2019s too short to only be miserable. There\u2019s more than just one bit of me.\u201d It\u2019s this spirit which spills from the pages of his new autobiography, Bleeding Fabulous. While death, pain and prejudice have defined much of his life \u2013 it\u2019s all there to see \u2013 so too, has joy and love and high-camp hilarity. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the nearness of death,\u201d Ward writes, \u201cto make you want to live your very best life\u2026 Faced with my mortality, I chose to live fabulously.\u201d It\u2019s late October on the East Sussex coast. We\u2019re sitting in the neat living room of Ward\u2019s marital home, on a quiet close just down the road from Brighton. Along with a small army of volunteers and activists, he\u2019s spent years campaigning for justice for the victims of the contaminated blood scandal \u2013 a relentless battle. \u201cIt has been non-stop,\u201d he says. \u201cConstant. While every day, people around us are dying from it, who we love like family.\u201d Beyond the sliding doors out back is a cherished, verdant garden. Tending it, Ward says, has offered an escape when the fight has felt all-consuming. The results of the years-long efforts are at last coming to fruition. In May this year, a damning report was published: the culmination of the six-year-long Infected Blood Inquiry led by judge Sir Brian Langstaff. It found that the NHS\u2019s worst treatment disaster \u201cwas not an accident\u201d and that it could \u201clargely, though not entirely, have been avoided\u201d. That patients were exposed, knowingly, to \u201cunacceptable\u201d infection risks due to \u201csystemic, collective and individual failures\u201d by the authorities. During the hours that Ward and I spend together, Chancellor Rachel Reeves presents her first budget to parliament. In it, she earmarked \u00a311.8bn in compensation for infected blood victims. Without activists like Ward, it is crystal clear that these milestones would have been unimaginable. \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet,\u201d Ward is keen to clarify, \u201cthere\u2019s still much more to do. I don\u2019t trust the government, or anybody, really. Because of all the lies and betrayals, I struggle in that area. But people like me have a voice now; a say in what comes next. At last, we can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d Recently, Ward\u2019s been working with NHS England to design a psychological support service for those impacted. Only yesterday, he was up in Newcastle meeting its new staff with four other surviving victims. Back in August, a compensation authority was established, tasked with paying out to those affected once final figures have been agreed upon. \u201cWe were asked to assist in training the people who\u2019ll oversee the process. I was preparing them for the fact that what they\u2019ll hear is going to be horrific. And I wanted to tell them how to speak to people like me, after all we\u2019ve been through.\u201d Payout figures are yet to be published. To date, surviving victims \u2013 known as the living infected \u2013 have received interim payments totalling \u00a3310,000. \u201cI\u2019m not in this for the money,\u201d Ward points out adamantly, \u201cand I never have been. Realistically, the government can\u2019t give me back my life. They can\u2019t uninfect me, or take away decades of fear, stigma and pain. Money, though, is what they can give as recognition.\u201d He hopes it\u2019s a deterrent, too. \u201cWe need to make it hit them in the pocket hard enough to ensure it\u2019s so expensive that something like this can never happen again. While I\u2019m still here, the kids who aren\u2019t\u2026 my friends\u2026 I\u2019m doing this for them. I need to get justice for those we\u2019ve lost, as well as for me. I made them a promise that while I have breath in my body, I\u2019ll keep going.\u201d Acknowledgment has helped heal certain scars. \u201cBut some things,\u201d Ward fears, \u201cwon\u2019t ever go away. I still need an injection every week for my treatment. Every time that needle goes in, I\u2019m transported back. That thought goes through your mind: what could this one have in it?\u201d The first signs came when Ward was eight months old: a vast, dark purple bruise along his side that appeared from nowhere. Not long after, he nicked the inside of his upper lip. Nothing his parents tried would stop the bleeding. When he was three, specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital diagnosed him with haemophilia: a rare genetic disorder, predominantly in men, that prevents blood from clotting properly. \u201cThe doctor told my family my life expectancy would be 21, if I was lucky.\u201d The smallest knocks and bumps, his parents learned, might easily become life-threatening without urgent treatments. Bleeds \u2013 whether internal or external \u2013 could prove fatal. \u201cLife became an endless back and forth in ambulances,\u201d Ward says. His regular nosebleeds didn\u2019t help matters. \u201cIn those days, parents couldn\u2019t stay overnight in the hospital. Mum would have to leave me, not knowing if she\u2019d see me alive again. They\u2019d tie me to the cots to stop me tampering with needles. It was torture, they couldn\u2019t do it today.\u201d It was a lot for the young family to handle. In 1976, medics floated changes to Ward\u2019s treatment. \u201cThis new treatment was called Factor VIII,\u201d the family was told. \u201cThey said it was the future and would normalise my life. It could be administered at home.\u201d Still, his parents were instinctively reluctant to mess with what was already working. Much of this Factor VIII was imported from the US to meet growing domestic demand. \u201cDad didn\u2019t trust it.\u201d \u201cThen in 1977, at the age of eight,\u201d Ward says, \u201cI was hospitalised in the middle of the night. The on-call haematologist went to get the treatment I\u2019d need from the freezer.\u201d As always, it was prepared in another room. \u201cThe doctor came in, administered it as normal, and off we went. A few days later, I was back in, and Mum noticed something was different. She asked and was told I\u2019d been transferred to Factor VIII on that previous admission a few evenings earlier.\u201d The family hadn\u2019t consented to the change. \u201cWe were told it was too late now. Decision made. It was a switch we were promised would change all our lives forever. Which it did, irreparably.\u201d For the better, at first. Routines stabilised with the new drugs. \u201cMum learned how to do the injections,\u201d Ward explains. \u201cSo, mostly, I could be treated at home. I went to school. We could take holidays. And Factor VIII shoots up your life expectancy. Suddenly my future didn\u2019t have a limit of 21. I was told I had a whole new chance at life, I was told\u2026\u201d Ward cuts himself off, shakes his head and breathes out slowly. In 1984, at 14, Ward needed knee surgery due to complications from his haemophilia. He was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London\u2019s Hampstead. \u201cAfter six weeks, on the day of discharge,\u201d Ward recounts, \u201cDad was pushing my wheelchair through the hospital, when one of the nurses popped up, and shouted across the waiting room, in front of other patients: \u2018Mr and Mrs Ward, do you want to know his HIV results? He\u2019s positive. See you next time!\u2019 We stepped out and got in the car in a daze.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019d been no mention of me being tested for HIV,\u201d Ward explains, \u201cfor us, the result came from nowhere.\u201d Days later, back in hospital, medics expanded on the situation. \u201cAccidentally, we were told, the \u2018blood of homosexuals\u2019 had got into the treatment. The doctors said, don\u2019t tell anyone; we can\u2019t guarantee your safety.\u201d Ward\u2019s parents fought for their son to remain in school. \u201cI could return,\u201d Ward says, \u201cthe headteacher reluctantly agreed, on the condition that if anyone found out and complained, I\u2019d be kicked out immediately. After my haemophilia diagnosis, people knowing what was wrong with me offered me protection. Now, with HIV, my health made me a target.\u201d A future had been dangled in front of this teenage boy\u2019s eyes. Now, it was being snatched away. \u201cI was told I\u2019d now have two, maybe three years to live. No 18th birthday. There was no cure. HIV would become Aids: a death sentence.\u201d This was the early days of the Aids epidemic; three years before the first prescriptions for antiretroviral HIV treatments. \u201cThey said I wouldn\u2019t live long enough to even finish school,\u201d says Ward. \u201cIt was totally devastating.\u201d Around 1,250 haemophiliacs were infected with HIV in this way, including 380 children. Some unknowingly infected their partners. Less than 200 are still alive. Ward, like many others, was told his infection was an unfortunate accident. Decades later, the Infected Blood Inquiry would confirm the truth: that in 1982, two years before Ward tested positive, it had been established that HIV could be transmitted through blood products. This was \u201cvery well known\u201d, according to the report, by officials at the time. It took the NHS until the end of 1985 to heat-treat blood products to eliminate HIV, although the risks were known years earlier. Reporting from as early as 1985 also found that Factor VIII from the US was made not with volunteer donor blood, as in the UK, but from those paid for their plasma. Much of it was purchased on the skid rows of America\u2019s big cities from addicts, prisoners, those experiencing homelessness and sex workers, all with a high risk of being HIV and hepatitis carriers. In short, as the report found, patients were exposed to \u201cunacceptable risks\u201d. Ward puts it more bluntly: \u201cCorporate greed saw profit put before patients. We were used for research. I was treated like a piece of meat as it was assumed I\u2019d never amount to anything.\u201d In adulthood, Ward is an out and proud gay man, at home in the LGBTQ+ community. He\u2019s the founder of Haemosexual, a resource for queer people with bleeding disorders. His book, Bleeding Fabulous, recounts years spent working the door at London\u2019s infamous G-A-Y club, often in full drag; boyfriends loved and lost; nights out in Gran Canaria; run-ins with Princess Di and Kylie. His path to self-acceptance, though, followed rough terrain. Playground homophobic bullying, first. \u201cAt home, the news would come on the TV,\u201d Ward remembers, \u201cshowing these rows of gay men \u2013 with their cloned moustaches \u2013 dying of Aids in hospital. I\u2019d watch thinking: \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019ll look like when I die.\u2019 And haemophiliacs were often homophobic, having been told it was the gays who had caused them harm by selling their blood recklessly. At one point, I felt the same: I blamed gay people, too. Every night on TV, it was haemophiliacs, homosexuals and heroin addicts being demonised: I ticked two boxes. Terrified of who I was, I suppressed everything.\u201d Throughout the pages of Bleeding Fabulous, Ward also points to what he feels was homophobia directed his way by medical professionals. \u201cI felt dehumanised. The way I was spoken to and treated. Invasive tests and questions. Cruel comments and derision regularly.\u201d Over the following years, Ward would be diagnosed with a catalogue of other viruses. His HIV developed into Aids. He suffered from a stroke, a lesion on the brain, kidney failure, cirrhosis of the liver and is deemed to be at risk of vCJD (the human variant of mad cow disease). \u201cFor me, all the viruses and illnesses that followed,\u201d Ward says, \u201cwere due to pathogens inside that Factor VIII blood. And the authorities and those responsible for my care, could and should have known. Some did. I can never forgive them.\u201d Still, Ward carried on. He pursued a career in aviation \u2013 a job he loved \u2013 and built a life with his husband, Richard. \u201cThat\u2019s a disabled person\u2019s approach,\u201d Ward believes. \u201cIf you\u2019re born healthy and then become disabled, your whole life changes. When born into a world where nothing is quite normal and life feels fragile, you get on with things. Live each day as it comes. Had I listened to the doctors from the outset, I could have spent the whole time terrified of tomorrow. Instead, I\u2019ve made every second count.\u201d In 2006, Ward joined the newly formed TaintedBlood, a campaign group of victims and their loved ones, demanding answers. \u201cWhen I started to learn the truth,\u201d Ward says, \u201cthat what happened to me was avoidable, and the subsequent cover-up. For years, I\u2019d woken up every day thinking I\u2019d survived an accident. Then I realised it had been done to me: I am a victim of their actions and abuse. We had to do something.\u201d Ward\u2019s book documents setback after setback that the campaign group faced before hope appeared on the horizon, including the lies told by successive ministers: as the inquiry report found, there was \u201cdeliberate destruction of documents of relevance\u201d. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even rely on the people who were meant to be caring for us,\u201d he says. \u201cMy GP didn\u2019t believe what I was telling him. Hospital nurses and doctors tried to hide it from us.\u201d Thanks to their tireless efforts, David Cameron apologised to the victims of infected blood in 2015. An inquiry was announced two years later. Ward attended every location the inquiry was held in across the UK through its six years of sitting. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet,\u201d he says, stoically, of all that\u2019s been achieved. \u201cI\u2019m proud, of course, of what we\u2019ve done. I genuinely feel as if I\u2019m keeping my promise to my friends who didn\u2019t make it.\u201d All that\u2019s happened has never dulled his zest for life. With his book written and compensation soon to be paid, this prolonged chapter might at last be over. His current prognosis might not be great, but Ward is a born survivor. \u201cThe last life expectancy I heard,\u201d he says, \u201cwas 56. That\u2019s next year for me.\u201d He\u2019s not buying it. Since coming off blood treatments for his haemophilia in 2006, there have been positive developments in his outlook. \u201cI was told I had cirrhosis of the liver because of hepatitis C,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that seems to have spontaneously cleared. And with HIV, I now have an undetectable viral load, which means I can\u2019t pass it on. Hopefully my body has got a grip, even if there have been blips.\u201d Ward and I talk for two hours. Maybe more. As he lists each detail of all he\u2019s endured, there\u2019s steely resilience in his tone \u2013 and some righteous rage \u2013 but his positivity is infectious. How, I ask, has he remained dignified? He takes a moment to consider. \u201cAt times I\u2019ve wanted to scream,\u201d he says, \u201cto cry, and be sick.\u201d Often, he adds, simultaneously. \u201cAlong the way, so many people have told us no, we won\u2019t ever get to this point. I was determined to prove them wrong. And we have, even if the money isn\u2019t quite in our pockets yet: we got the inquiry. The apology. What was denied for decades has been proved, undeniably.\u201d Imagining this, he says, kept him going. \u201cI\u2019ve been called a liar and an attention-seeker, a troublemaker and a bad patient, for asking questions that went ignored.\u201d There\u2019s a twinkle in Ward\u2019s eye, as he looks out to Richard in their beloved garden. \u201cSo you see,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s because of all this that sometimes, I want nothing more than to stand in front of the camera, smiling.\u201d Bleeding Fabulous: The Life of a Haemosexual by Mark Ward is published by Inkandescent at \u00a311.99.

      "body": "<p>When Sally Mumford enrolled in a training course to become a psychotherapist in 2020, she was excited to start a new career.</p> <p>She hoped to help people understand how their feelings and behaviour were shaped by their pasts. But she quickly realised that the course might not be what she had expected. \u201cI arrived like a lamb to the slaughter,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a real nastiness that percolated down from the top.\u201d</p> <p>Mumford said her tutors at the training centre in London let bullying between students go unchecked. \u201cIt was all part of making you into a therapist. The whole ethos was to break you down and build you back up how they wanted you to be.\u201d</p> <p>Mumford is one of more than a dozen people who have studied for psychotherapy qualifications at UK institutions who told the <em>Observer</em> that some courses cross the line from challenging to toxic, with tutors bullying students. Some said their tutors made humiliating remarks to them in public, and left them feeling too scared to speak up or leave the course.</p> <p>Students on different courses also said they felt that complaints procedures were not robust enough.</p> <p>Demand for psychotherapists has grown as <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusanddepressioninadultsgreatbritain/julytoaugust2021\">the effects of the Covid pandemic on rates of depression</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/\">anxiety</a> lingers, and NHS waiting times for mental health treatment continue to rise. Many of those who can afford it are turning to private therapists \u2013 and, as demand for their services has risen, so has the number of people training to enter the field.</p> <p>Since 2019, there has been a 44% increase in the number of students registered with the British Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists (BACP), training to become therapists.</p> <p>But the industry is largely unregulated; \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d is not a protected profession, so anyone can set up a practice with that title. Last month, the <em>Guardian </em>reported calls for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/19/psychotherapists-in-england-must-be-regulated-experts-say-after-abuse-claims-rise\">urgent regulation of all psychotherapists</a> and counsellors in England.</p> <p>Psychotherapist training is also unregulated, and there is a wide range of qualifications across the UK. The BACP and the UK Council of Psychotherapists (UKCP), the main professional body for psychotherapy in the UK, offer accreditation for courses.</p> <p>Amanda Williamson, a psychotherapist who has been campaigning for regulation in the industry for more than a decade, is concerned about \u201ctoxic\u201d training courses. \u201cI\u2019ve heard negative feedback about all manner of courses at prominent universities, including appalling tales of bullying and badly-run \u2018group process\u2019,\u201d Williamson said.</p> <p>Since psychotherapy training requires students to be vulnerable, she argues, regulations must be more rigorous than in other industries. Therapists and training institutions should be bound by a consistent code of ethics, and regulated by the same body, she said. \u201cRegulation, or at least an inquiry to shine a light on these toxic hotspots that are allowed to fester \u2026 is very much overdue.\u201d</p> <p>Students of psychotherapy are often required to examine their own psyches, and many courses mandate that students undertake therapy alongside their studies.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental difference in power structures,\u201d said Kelly*, a qualified psychotherapist who works privately and within the NHS, and is training to further her qualifications. She said she has been bullied on her current course by a member of staff.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak about it within the training institute because of how it would look,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to not piss people off as they have all the power, and you could be interpreted as the difficult one. It\u2019s hard to voice things when power is misused, so people put up with this stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Several people who took training courses told the <em>Observer</em> they felt unable to make complaints about their tutors. BACP-accredited courses are required to have a robust complaints policy and procedure in place, and students can contact the BACP, which could result in them visiting the course to check how it is being run. But Richard*, a counsellor and lecturer, said students who raised complaints with the BACP and the UKCP were often told to sort it out themselves. \u201cWhen people complain about training institutions, professional bodies only get involved if it\u2019s really serious, such as financial irregularity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Samuel*, in his mid-40s, qualified last year after a four-year course at a London institution he describes as having a \u201cbullying, toxic\u201d environment. Samuel said he felt his supervisor had taken a sudden dislike towards him. \u201cSomething switched, and he gave me a negative report, then another, and it was horrific. He obliterated me. It was the most stressful couple of months. [There was] no intervention on my behalf from other staff. It was a very hands-off attitude.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel did not feel he could make a complaint about the tutor during his studies. \u201cI wonder, now, why I put up with it, but when you\u2019re in it, you don\u2019t realise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sarah*, who is in her late 50s and is already a trained therapist, was studying at a course in London earlier this year to help further her career. \u201cFrom day one, it was a nightmare,\u201d she said. Sarah felt that her tutors shut her down whenever she tried to speak, and, on numerous occasions, she overheard them talking about her negatively.</p> <p>After months of feeling \u201cexcluded and undermined\u201d, Sarah complained about one of her tutors to her course director. She felt that this escalated the behaviour directed towards her, and she dropped off the course. \u201cI went from happy and content to feeling belittled and small. It made me feel dismantled as a therapist.\u201d</p> <p>A few months later, Sarah was invited to an interview for her dream job. But as she sat down in front of the panel, she found she couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cI walked out, and I broke down for about four weeks. I still don\u2019t sleep, and when I do I have nightmares. I\u2019ve had anxiety, I\u2019ve lost weight, it\u2019s impacted my life quite badly,\u201d she said.</p> <p>John Fletcher, a counsellor and psychotherapist of almost 30 years, said regulatory bodies needed to focus more on how students process their own experiences and emotions during training. \u201cYou need to be straightened out so your own unprocessed stuff doesn\u2019t get in the way when working with clients, so you\u2019re going to need to be challenged,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] tutors must be able to hold this safely. Great care needs to be taken.\u201d</p> <p>A BACP spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re deeply committed to protecting \u2026 students who enrol on our courses. We believe student wellbeing and care should be a priority for all psychotherapy courses and training providers, regardless of their affiliation with BACP.\u201d UKCP did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>* Names have been changed to protect identities</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Sally Mumford enrolled in a training course to become a psychotherapist in 2020, she was excited to start a new career. She hoped to help people understand how their feelings and behaviour were shaped by their pasts. But she quickly realised that the course might not be what she had expected. \u201cI arrived like a lamb to the slaughter,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a real nastiness that percolated down from the top.\u201d Mumford said her tutors at the training centre in London let bullying between students go unchecked. \u201cIt was all part of making you into a therapist. The whole ethos was to break you down and build you back up how they wanted you to be.\u201d Mumford is one of more than a dozen people who have studied for psychotherapy qualifications at UK institutions who told the Observer that some courses cross the line from challenging to toxic, with tutors bullying students. Some said their tutors made humiliating remarks to them in public, and left them feeling too scared to speak up or leave the course. Students on different courses also said they felt that complaints procedures were not robust enough. Demand for psychotherapists has grown as the effects of the Covid pandemic on rates of depression and anxiety lingers, and NHS waiting times for mental health treatment continue to rise. Many of those who can afford it are turning to private therapists \u2013 and, as demand for their services has risen, so has the number of people training to enter the field. Since 2019, there has been a 44% increase in the number of students registered with the British Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists (BACP), training to become therapists. But the industry is largely unregulated; \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d is not a protected profession, so anyone can set up a practice with that title. Last month, the Guardian reported calls for urgent regulation of all psychotherapists and counsellors in England. Psychotherapist training is also unregulated, and there is a wide range of qualifications across the UK. The BACP and the UK Council of Psychotherapists (UKCP), the main professional body for psychotherapy in the UK, offer accreditation for courses. Amanda Williamson, a psychotherapist who has been campaigning for regulation in the industry for more than a decade, is concerned about \u201ctoxic\u201d training courses. \u201cI\u2019ve heard negative feedback about all manner of courses at prominent universities, including appalling tales of bullying and badly-run \u2018group process\u2019,\u201d Williamson said. Since psychotherapy training requires students to be vulnerable, she argues, regulations must be more rigorous than in other industries. Therapists and training institutions should be bound by a consistent code of ethics, and regulated by the same body, she said. \u201cRegulation, or at least an inquiry to shine a light on these toxic hotspots that are allowed to fester \u2026 is very much overdue.\u201d Students of psychotherapy are often required to examine their own psyches, and many courses mandate that students undertake therapy alongside their studies. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental difference in power structures,\u201d said Kelly*, a qualified psychotherapist who works privately and within the NHS, and is training to further her qualifications. She said she has been bullied on her current course by a member of staff. \u201cI can\u2019t speak about it within the training institute because of how it would look,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to not piss people off as they have all the power, and you could be interpreted as the difficult one. It\u2019s hard to voice things when power is misused, so people put up with this stuff.\u201d Several people who took training courses told the Observer they felt unable to make complaints about their tutors. BACP-accredited courses are required to have a robust complaints policy and procedure in place, and students can contact the BACP, which could result in them visiting the course to check how it is being run. But Richard*, a counsellor and lecturer, said students who raised complaints with the BACP and the UKCP were often told to sort it out themselves. \u201cWhen people complain about training institutions, professional bodies only get involved if it\u2019s really serious, such as financial irregularity,\u201d he said. Samuel*, in his mid-40s, qualified last year after a four-year course at a London institution he describes as having a \u201cbullying, toxic\u201d environment. Samuel said he felt his supervisor had taken a sudden dislike towards him. \u201cSomething switched, and he gave me a negative report, then another, and it was horrific. He obliterated me. It was the most stressful couple of months. [There was] no intervention on my behalf from other staff. It was a very hands-off attitude.\u201d Samuel did not feel he could make a complaint about the tutor during his studies. \u201cI wonder, now, why I put up with it, but when you\u2019re in it, you don\u2019t realise,\u201d he said. Sarah*, who is in her late 50s and is already a trained therapist, was studying at a course in London earlier this year to help further her career. \u201cFrom day one, it was a nightmare,\u201d she said. Sarah felt that her tutors shut her down whenever she tried to speak, and, on numerous occasions, she overheard them talking about her negatively. After months of feeling \u201cexcluded and undermined\u201d, Sarah complained about one of her tutors to her course director. She felt that this escalated the behaviour directed towards her, and she dropped off the course. \u201cI went from happy and content to feeling belittled and small. It made me feel dismantled as a therapist.\u201d A few months later, Sarah was invited to an interview for her dream job. But as she sat down in front of the panel, she found she couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cI walked out, and I broke down for about four weeks. I still don\u2019t sleep, and when I do I have nightmares. I\u2019ve had anxiety, I\u2019ve lost weight, it\u2019s impacted my life quite badly,\u201d she said. John Fletcher, a counsellor and psychotherapist of almost 30 years, said regulatory bodies needed to focus more on how students process their own experiences and emotions during training. \u201cYou need to be straightened out so your own unprocessed stuff doesn\u2019t get in the way when working with clients, so you\u2019re going to need to be challenged,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] tutors must be able to hold this safely. Great care needs to be taken.\u201d A BACP spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re deeply committed to protecting \u2026 students who enrol on our courses. We believe student wellbeing and care should be a priority for all psychotherapy courses and training providers, regardless of their affiliation with BACP.\u201d UKCP did not respond to a request for comment. * Names have been changed to protect identities",

These are exceptions. The anti-incumbent tidal wave of the past 12 months has manifested itself in places as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/20/argentina-presidential-election-far-right-libertarian-javier-milei-wins-after-rival-concedes\">diverse as Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rdygy5888o\">Austria</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/01/botswana-president-mokgweetsi-masisi-concedes-defeat-election-six-decade-rule\">Botswana</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/apr/11/south-korea-opposition-landslide-win-election-video\">South Korea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crr9n2w0lyzo\">Sri Lanka</a>.

Now, not so much.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This isn\u2019t rocket science: voters who feel they\u2019ve been made poorer tend to hand out a beating to whoever is in charge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A conventional explanation would say the unpopularity of the German social democrats is mainly down to the woes of the country\u2019s economy, quarrels over which collapsed the coalition. But \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d won\u2019t do as a sufficient account for what happened to the US Democrats. Ms Harris was rejected even though she was a high-profile member of an administration that created a lot of jobs and had the best growth rate in the G7. Yet many Americans said they weren\u2019t feeling it in their own pocketbooks and what the Democrats\u2019 campaign most lacked, notes one Labour strategist, \u201cwas any sense of a plan to make people feel personally better off\u201d.</p> <p>Phobia towards incumbents in the western democracies is connected to the stagnation in living standards that has persisted in most developed countries since the financial crisis. Politicians find it very hard to persuade people to feel well disposed towards government when they are not feeling happy about their own circumstances. Discontent has been exacerbated by the post-pandemic spike in inflation. Funnily enough, people really hate it when their groceries suddenly cost a lot more. This isn\u2019t rocket science: voters who feel they\u2019ve been made poorer tend to hand out a beating to whoever is in charge.</p> <p>Sir Keir\u2019s people might note that this makes it extra-lethal when politicians look out of touch. Endorsements of Ms Harris by countless wealthy celebrities didn\u2019t swing it for her with American voters who felt their living standards had been squeezed. Rishi Sunak would have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/17/rishi-sunak-intervened-to-ensure-vip-helicopter-contract-was-not-cancelled\">sacked his helicopter pilots</a> and gone everywhere on a scooter had he been more alive to how corrosive it is to look remote from the everyday experiences of the public. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/03/starmer-repaid-freebies-to-restore-trust-in-politics-minister-says\">freebies saga</a> damaged the Starmer government\u2019s reputation because there was no good answer to the question the typical voter asked themselves: why isn\u2019t the prime minister paying for his clothes and family treats like everyone else has to do?</p> <p>It has just been reported that <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/11/migration-to-oecd-countries-hits-new-record.html#:~:text=Permanent%20migration%20to%20OECD%20countries,to%20a%20new%20OECD%20report\">permanent migration</a> to OECD countries reached a new record last year with the numbers of temporary migrants and asylum seekers also rising sharply. The damage done to the US Democrats by hostility to cross-border population flows illustrates another factor in the unseating of incumbents. There is no challenge that makes Number 10 more apprehensive than keeping Sir Keir\u2019s promises to \u201ccontrol the borders\u201d. He\u2019s taking a risk making it his self-described \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy1n2nwnyjo\">personal mission</a> to smash the people-smuggling gangs\u201d. If the government doesn\u2019t succeed, the prime minister is going to directly own the failure. But his allies argue that trying to avoid talking about difficult subjects, \u201chiding under the table\u201d as the Democrats did, just makes voters angrier.</p> <p>Borders are a big obsession with the recast team in Downing Street. So is another b-word, \u201cbills\u201d. One of Number 10\u2019s responses to anti-incumbency will be to talk less about the \u201cfive missions\u201d, a concept that Labour MPs complain has never caught the imagination of voters, and focus more intensely on living standards. The improvement in median incomes in the UK has been so meagre since 2009 that <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/news/decade-and-half-historically-poor-growth-has-taken-its-toll\">earnings growth</a> over the past quarter of a century was probably the slowest in more than 200 years. If you want a core explanation for why so many voters have been feeling so down on politicians for such a long time, then this is good place to look.</p> <p>\u201cGrowth, growth, growth\u201d is supposed to be Labour\u2019s remedy to rescue Britain from the doom loop of suppressed living standards, high taxes and poor public services. So it is not glad tidings for the cabinet that the economy <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwygw982e3xo\">barely expanded</a> at all in the first three months of the government\u2019s life. Some business leaders are blaming the long period of fear-fuelled uncertainty in the run-up to the budget. Some ministers will tacitly acknowledge that they overdid the doom and gloom. They had better be sure that they are putting in place the right planning reforms, infrastructure investments and industrial strategies to lift growth off the floor. If they can\u2019t improve Britain\u2019s economic performance, they aren\u2019t going to be able to achieve any of their other ambitions either.</p> <p>In the first flush of victory in July, many Labour people thought they had time on their side because the size of the parliamentary majority could be interpreted as a 10-year mandate for Sir Keir\u2019s \u201cdecade of national renewal\u201d. The paucity of the vote share was a warning against that kind of complacent thinking. An analysis by Labour Together, the influential campaign group, <a href=\"https://www.labourtogether.uk/how-labour-won-2024-report\">rightly cautions</a>: \u201cThis Labour government has been cautiously hired, on a trial basis, liable to prompt dismissal if it deviates even slightly from its focus on voters\u2019 priorities.\u201d </p> <p>Some, even from within the party\u2019s own ranks, are already catastrophising that this is doomed to be a one-term administration. It is way too early to forecast that the Starmer government is destined to suffer that fate. But the Labour leader and his cabinet must try to learn from the growing heap of cast-aside incumbents if they are not to be added to it. </p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

A conventional explanation would say the unpopularity of the German social democrats is mainly down to the woes of the country\u2019s economy, quarrels over which collapsed the coalition. But \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d won\u2019t do as a sufficient account for what happened to the US Democrats. Ms Harris was rejected even though she was a high-profile member of an administration that created a lot of jobs and had the best growth rate in the G7. Yet many Americans said they weren\u2019t feeling it in their own pocketbooks and what the Democrats\u2019 campaign most lacked, notes one Labour strategist, \u201cwas any sense of a plan to make people feel personally better off\u201d. Phobia towards incumbents in the western democracies is connected to the stagnation in living standards that has persisted in most developed countries since the financial crisis. Politicians find it very hard to persuade people to feel well disposed towards government when they are not feeling happy about their own circumstances. Discontent has been exacerbated by the post-pandemic spike in inflation. Funnily enough, people really hate it when their groceries suddenly cost a lot more. This isn\u2019t rocket science: voters who feel they\u2019ve been made poorer tend to hand out a beating to whoever is in charge. Sir Keir\u2019s people might note that this makes it extra-lethal when politicians look out of touch. Endorsements of Ms Harris by countless wealthy celebrities didn\u2019t swing it for her with American voters who felt their living standards had been squeezed. Rishi Sunak would have sacked his helicopter pilots and gone everywhere on a scooter had he been more alive to how corrosive it is to look remote from the everyday experiences of the public. The freebies saga damaged the Starmer government\u2019s reputation because there was no good answer to the question the typical voter asked themselves: why isn\u2019t the prime minister paying for his clothes and family treats like everyone else has to do? It has just been reported that permanent migration to OECD countries reached a new record last year with the numbers of temporary migrants and asylum seekers also rising sharply. The damage done to the US Democrats by hostility to cross-border population flows illustrates another factor in the unseating of incumbents. There is no challenge that makes Number 10 more apprehensive than keeping Sir Keir\u2019s promises to \u201ccontrol the borders\u201d. He\u2019s taking a risk making it his self-described \u201cpersonal mission to smash the people-smuggling gangs\u201d. If the government doesn\u2019t succeed, the prime minister is going to directly own the failure. But his allies argue that trying to avoid talking about difficult subjects, \u201chiding under the table\u201d as the Democrats did, just makes voters angrier. Borders are a big obsession with the recast team in Downing Street. So is another b-word, \u201cbills\u201d. One of Number 10\u2019s responses to anti-incumbency will be to talk less about the \u201cfive missions\u201d, a concept that Labour MPs complain has never caught the imagination of voters, and focus more intensely on living standards. The improvement in median incomes in the UK has been so meagre since 2009 that earnings growth over the past quarter of a century was probably the slowest in more than 200 years. If you want a core explanation for why so many voters have been feeling so down on politicians for such a long time, then this is good place to look. \u201cGrowth, growth, growth\u201d is supposed to be Labour\u2019s remedy to rescue Britain from the doom loop of suppressed living standards, high taxes and poor public services. So it is not glad tidings for the cabinet that the economy barely expanded at all in the first three months of the government\u2019s life. Some business leaders are blaming the long period of fear-fuelled uncertainty in the run-up to the budget. Some ministers will tacitly acknowledge that they overdid the doom and gloom. They had better be sure that they are putting in place the right planning reforms, infrastructure investments and industrial strategies to lift growth off the floor. If they can\u2019t improve Britain\u2019s economic performance, they aren\u2019t going to be able to achieve any of their other ambitions either. In the first flush of victory in July, many Labour people thought they had time on their side because the size of the parliamentary majority could be interpreted as a 10-year mandate for Sir Keir\u2019s \u201cdecade of national renewal\u201d. The paucity of the vote share was a warning against that kind of complacent thinking. An analysis by Labour Together, the influential campaign group, rightly cautions: \u201cThis Labour government has been cautiously hired, on a trial basis, liable to prompt dismissal if it deviates even slightly from its focus on voters\u2019 priorities.\u201d Some, even from within the party\u2019s own ranks, are already catastrophising that this is doomed to be a one-term administration. It is way too early to forecast that the Starmer government is destined to suffer that fate. But the Labour leader and his cabinet must try to learn from the growing heap of cast-aside incumbents if they are not to be added to it. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

While it can blow a gale on the south Wales coast, today is perfectly still and the sky bright blue. After a hiccup with the electricity, milking is well under way. Yet despite the apparent serenity and beauty of the surroundings, the mood among the Evans family, who own and run the farm, is gloomy.</p> <p>They have battled for years to make the farm viable and invested heavily in technology to make that a reality.

Even though we\u2019re worth a lot on paper, we don\u2019t have that much money in our pockets. That\u2019s what\u2019s worrying people a lot at the moment. I hope the government will look after us, but we\u2019re not so sure.\u201d</p> <p>Just a few months ago, one of Labour\u2019s biggest election successes was winning scores of rural seats held by the Tories for years. According to research by YouGov\u2019s Patrick English, the Conservatives lost 164 rural constituencies and held on to just 88. The Vale of Glamorgan constituency, home to Marcross farm, is one of them. The last time Labour won it from the Tories was 1997, before losing it in 2010. The party spent serious time and resources before the last election on how to win such seats.</p>    <p>Yet it is now battling angry claims of betrayal among farmers and rural campaigners after the budget decision to subject farming assets worth more than \u00a31m to a 20% inheritance tax charge from April 2026. Ministers say that related allowances will push up the payment threshold to \u00a33m and that the vast majority of farms will be unaffected. Those reassurances do not seem to have assuaged the anger, which veterans of the industry claim is the most fervent and widespread they have ever seen.</p> <p>Dissent will culminate on Tuesday with two events. The first is an official day of action in which the National Farmers Union (NFU) is organising meetings between almost 2,000 farmers and their MPs. At the same time, a rally in Westminster, largely organised online, is gaining momentum.</p> <p>\u201cI described it this week as visceral anger,\u201d said Tom Bradshaw, the NFU\u2019s president. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything on a parallel to this. It has cut really deep. The sense of betrayal is another element. The secretary of state, Steve Reed, stood on a platform last November and said \u2018we will not be changing [inheritance tax rules]\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s also this wider sense that the government doesn\u2019t understand us. The human impact is the bit I think this government has unintentionally missed.\u201d</p> <p>Worryingly for Keir Starmer, the issue risks morphing into the wider claim that the new Labour government \u2013 which worked so hard to win rural seats \u2013 does not understand such areas. An interview with former Tony Blair adviser John McTernan, in which he said he was in favour of doing to farmers \u201cwhat Margaret Thatcher did to the miners\u201d, is cutting through.</p> <p>It certainly reached Marcross farm. For Tony\u2019s son, Hopkin, 42, it was the last straw. \u201cI was on the fence about going to London before he said that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when he said that, I thought: hang on, we\u2019ve got to stand up. We\u2019ve got to fight our corner. So I\u2019m going. We\u2019ve got to stand up and say, \u2018this is an industry worth fighting for. We are feeding you. We are trying to feed a nation.

      "bodyText": "It could scarcely be a more idyllic morning on Marcross farm. Autumn sun beams down across the Vale of Glamorgan. While it can blow a gale on the south Wales coast, today is perfectly still and the sky bright blue. After a hiccup with the electricity, milking is well under way. Yet despite the apparent serenity and beauty of the surroundings, the mood among the Evans family, who own and run the farm, is gloomy. They have battled for years to make the farm viable and invested heavily in technology to make that a reality. They have diversified to help cover costs \u2013 they have a caravan park nearby. Like farmers across the country, however, they are now seriously worried that the government\u2019s inheritance changes to farming land could scupper their best-laid plans. \u201cThe robots we have for the milking system \u2013 there\u2019s a million pounds worth of investment there,\u201d says Tony, 71, who already runs the farm in partnership with his son, Hopkin. \u201cBut as for the asset we\u2019ve got in the farm, I\u2019ll never realise the value of it because we won\u2019t sell it. Even though we\u2019re worth a lot on paper, we don\u2019t have that much money in our pockets. That\u2019s what\u2019s worrying people a lot at the moment. I hope the government will look after us, but we\u2019re not so sure.\u201d Just a few months ago, one of Labour\u2019s biggest election successes was winning scores of rural seats held by the Tories for years. According to research by YouGov\u2019s Patrick English, the Conservatives lost 164 rural constituencies and held on to just 88. The Vale of Glamorgan constituency, home to Marcross farm, is one of them. The last time Labour won it from the Tories was 1997, before losing it in 2010. The party spent serious time and resources before the last election on how to win such seats. Yet it is now battling angry claims of betrayal among farmers and rural campaigners after the budget decision to subject farming assets worth more than \u00a31m to a 20% inheritance tax charge from April 2026. Ministers say that related allowances will push up the payment threshold to \u00a33m and that the vast majority of farms will be unaffected. Those reassurances do not seem to have assuaged the anger, which veterans of the industry claim is the most fervent and widespread they have ever seen. Dissent will culminate on Tuesday with two events. The first is an official day of action in which the National Farmers Union (NFU) is organising meetings between almost 2,000 farmers and their MPs. At the same time, a rally in Westminster, largely organised online, is gaining momentum. \u201cI described it this week as visceral anger,\u201d said Tom Bradshaw, the NFU\u2019s president. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything on a parallel to this. It has cut really deep. The sense of betrayal is another element. The secretary of state, Steve Reed, stood on a platform last November and said \u2018we will not be changing [inheritance tax rules]\u2019. \u201cThere\u2019s also this wider sense that the government doesn\u2019t understand us. The human impact is the bit I think this government has unintentionally missed.\u201d Worryingly for Keir Starmer, the issue risks morphing into the wider claim that the new Labour government \u2013 which worked so hard to win rural seats \u2013 does not understand such areas. An interview with former Tony Blair adviser John McTernan, in which he said he was in favour of doing to farmers \u201cwhat Margaret Thatcher did to the miners\u201d, is cutting through. It certainly reached Marcross farm. For Tony\u2019s son, Hopkin, 42, it was the last straw. \u201cI was on the fence about going to London before he said that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when he said that, I thought: hang on, we\u2019ve got to stand up. We\u2019ve got to fight our corner. So I\u2019m going. We\u2019ve got to stand up and say, \u2018this is an industry worth fighting for. We are feeding you. We are trying to feed a nation. We\u2019re not trying to rip anyone off\u2019.\u201d The comments have also caused huge anger within the government, with officials describing them as \u201ccompletely shocking\u201d. Starmer has already distanced himself from them. The Vale of Glamorgan\u2019s new Labour MP, Kanishka Narayan, is also trying to reassure constituents. \u201cWe understand concerns, but the majority of those claiming relief will not be affected by these changes,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey will be able to pass the family farm down to their children, just as previous generations have always done. This is a fair and balanced approach that protects the family farm while also fixing the public services that we all rely on.\u201d However, it has given ammunition to Labour\u2019s political opponents. Even before the inheritance tax decision was announced, the Tories regarded winning back lost rural voters as the first stage of a long recovery. Rishi Sunak brought up the plight of farmers at one of Starmer\u2019s first PMQs as prime minister. And Kemi Badenoch, despite having championed trade deals that now anger many farmers, has leapt on \u201cLabour\u2019s family farm tax\u201d. But the Tories aren\u2019t the only problem for Labour. Despite the overtly friendly relations during the election campaign, the Lib Dems also spy an opportunity to prove their credentials as the party of the countryside. \u201cThe things that outraged farmers in the last parliament were things that were a slow burn,\u201d said Tim Farron, the party\u2019s spokesperson for the environment, food and rural affairs. \u201cBut this is a budget event.

      "body": "<p>We all thought that we knew Rebecca Hall \u2013 English rose, on stage since childhood, daughter of the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s founder Sir Peter Hall, regularly described in Hollywood as one of the best actors of her generation. But in 2021 she took what she calls now \u201ca big swing\u201d and suddenly the whole story cracked in half.</p> <p>The big swing was her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/27/rebecca-hall-race-regret-personal-history-any-family-legacy-of-passing-very-tricky\">directorial debut, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/27/rebecca-hall-race-regret-personal-history-any-family-legacy-of-passing-very-tricky\">Passing</a></em>, a film about two women of colour, one of whom is \u201cpassing\u201d for white; Hall had been working on the story for 15 years, but thinking about it for far longer. Her maternal grandfather, a doorman from Detroit, passed as white, as did Hall\u2019s mother the opera singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/12/maria-ewing-obituary\">Maria Ewing</a>, whose experience of growing up with internalised racism contributed to mental health issues that Hall had to navigate throughout her childhood. Her parents split when she was young and her mother brought her up alone in a grand country house in Sussex. But very little parenting was done \u2013 Hall (later head girl at school, later a Cambridge drop-out) was her mother\u2019s caretaker. Because, \u201cthat kind of hiding [from who you are] leads to a certain amount of chaos. I think it\u2019s safe to say that that stuff gets passed on. And I definitely grew up in an environment where my mother didn\u2019t see me. She wanted me to be a certain kind of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Making <em>Passing</em> and then, perhaps even more, talking about the film, \u201cchanged me profoundly\u201d, says Hall today, generous but watchful, drinking coffee in a hotel bar overlooking the Thames. \u201cMy public-facing world was stuck in some sort of performance of English rose, theatre actor, posh, privileged\u2026 Which is true, but also, not actually my experience. I was always confused by that, but I didn\u2019t really know how to present my actual shape to the world. So I was, \u2018It\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll just carry on doing what I love quietly,\u2019 and I\u2019ll pretend to be whatever they want me to be.\u201d Since the film, she\u2019s insisted on a kind of clarity. She wants to be precise about the <em>Grey Gardens</em> complexity to her seemingly privileged upbringing; she wants not just to act, but also direct and write and paint. She wants to say, turning brightly to face me: \u201cI\u2019m more than what you think I am.\u201d</p>    <p>This is what her typical day looks like: she\u2019ll wake beside her husband, actor Morgan Spector, in their house in Upstate New York. They used to live in Manhattan, where she would walk their old cat on a lead. \u201cIt would be like walking down the street with Madonna,\u201d she cackles with light grief. After breakfast, she\u2019ll drive their six-year-old daughter, Ida, to school and then take the dog for a walk that will end up at her studio, where she\u2019ll paint until she has to stop. At which point she will write until she \u201cburns out\u201d, then return to her easel.</p> <p>\u201cI find acting completely fulfilling when the camera\u2019s rolling, but then, the rest of the time, I get frustrated by it. Whereas painting\u2026 Oh I could do that all day long, every day.\u201d And her paintings are great \u2013 sort of neo-expressionist, emotional, alive. Recently she\u2019s been painting audiences \u2013 they smile and gasp from the canvas in purples and green. Why audiences? \u201cWell I\u2019ve spent an entire career, a pretty long one actually\u2026\u201d 42 now, she made her screen debut aged 10 in <em>The Camomile Lawn</em>, a series directed by her father, and was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2008 for Woody Allen\u2019s <em>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</em>\u2026 \u201cAn entire career doing things for people to look at and I realised that, every time, I have something of a relationship with those people. It feels like an active ignoring.\u201d The hotel fire-alarm test slices through our conversation and we wait, eyebrows raised.</p> <p>We\u2019re meeting to talk about <em>The Listeners</em>, a haunting new BBC drama directed by Janicza Bravo, in which Hall plays a teacher who, one day, starts to hear a low, unidentifiable hum. When her family starts to doubt her sanity (could it be anxiety? Could it be, one doctor suggests, menopause?), the story slips into a gripping exploration of why ordinary people search for answers in dark places. Hall has, Bravo tells me, \u201charnessed both the approachable and the enigmatic. She feels like someone you know, <em>want</em> to know. She\u2019s striking, which makes her delectable to watch, of course.\u201d</p>    <p>When the alarm stops, leaving in its wake a silent ringing, Hall continues: \u201cIt almost felt to me like I was exhaling when I first read the script,\u201d she smiles, \u201cbecause I was like, ah, someone\u2019s daring to make something that feels really about this moment, a time when reality is pretty fragile, actually.\u201d As particular as her character\u2019s story appears, \u201cit feels like an experience we\u2019re all having on some level. There\u2019s a certain amount of desperation and we\u2019re all going crazy, individually and collectively!\u201d</p> <p>Ha! we say uneasily. Ha. This unstable character sits comfortably on a timeline of Hall\u2019s recent roles, like in <em>Christine</em>, the true story of a news reporter who died by suicide live on air. \u201cYes, I suppose all the people I play have a mask, and a reality that\u2019s behind the mask, and there is this tension between trying to define the middle ground.\u201d</p> <p>She hasn\u2019t consciously chosen to spend time exclusively inside women on the edge and breaks them up with starring roles in noisy blockbusters, like this year\u2019s <em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em>. \u201cBut it\u2019s just sort of happened along the way. Someone, actually, accused me of being \u2018The queen of the gaslight narrative.\u2019\u201d Were they correct? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like being told I\u2019m anything, ever,\u201d Hall laughs.</p>    <p>In 2018, after Woody Allen\u2019s daughter, Dylan Farrow, expressed anger that Hollywood continued to support her father, despite her allegations he\u2019d sexually assaulted her as a child, Hall made a statement saying she saw \u201cthat my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed\u201d and was \u201cprofoundly sorry. I regret this decision and wouldn\u2019t make the same one today.\u201d She also pledged her salary from her recent project with Allen to the <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/times-up-legal-defense-fund/legal-help-for-sex-discrimination-and-harassment/\">Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund</a>. How does she feel about that today? \u201cI struggle with this one,\u201d she says, twisting her body into a series of crosses. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlike me to make a public statement about anything. I make the stuff, that\u2019s how I am political. I don\u2019t think of myself as an \u2018actor-vist\u2019, I\u2019m not that person. And, I kind of regret making that statement, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the responsibility of his actors to speak to that situation.\u201d</p> <p>She was in a peculiar state, she tells me \u2013 newly pregnant, deeply affected emotionally by Farrow\u2019s allegations and, at the time, working on <em>A Rainy Day in New York</em>, directed by Allen. One morning, \u201cI was outside, shooting a street scene with Jude Law where, literally, my dialogue was, \u2018You\u2019ve got to stop sleeping with these fucking 15-year-olds.\u2019 And that day, the Weinstein scandal breaks. There\u2019s a bank of journalists and paparazzi right there, because Weinstein\u2019s a producer on it, and they\u2019re all listening to me say this.\u201d</p> <p>Every interview that followed revolved around Allen and Weinstein, \u201cand I was in a tangle. Like, in this moment, it\u2019s the most important thing to believe the women. Yes, of course, there\u2019s going to be complications and nuances in these stories, but we\u2019re redressing a balance here. So I felt like I wanted to do something definitive.\u201d That\u2019s when she made the statement, trying to articulate her discomfort, but remain balanced. \u201cBut it just became, \u2018another person denounces Woody Allen and regrets working with him\u2019, which is not what I said actually. I don\u2019t regret working with him. He gave me a great job opportunity and he was kind to me.\u201d Beyond that? \u201cI have no idea. I don\u2019t talk to him any more, but I don\u2019t think that we should be the ones who are doing judge and jury on this.\u201d How would she respond if it were to happen now? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say anything \u2013 my policy actually is to be an artist. Don\u2019t come out and state your stuff so much. I don\u2019t think that makes me apathetic or not engaged. I just think it\u2019s my job.\u201d</p>    <p>And it\u2019s a busy job, a rich job \u2013 she\u2019s just wrapped on a film with Jamie Lee Curtis, and a biopic about the photographer Peter Hujar with Ben Whishaw, but she makes time for pleasure, too, which for Hall means reality TV. \u201cMorgan doesn\u2019t understand it \u2013 he\u2019s like, \u2018I thought I married this sophisticated, cultured, literate, artistic type?\u2019 But I just find it utterly fascinating. It\u2019s such a good way to look at human behaviour, in performance, which obviously is my interest.\u201d She leans in as she talks about the magic and artistry of <em>Real Housewives</em> and its sister shows, all these people \u201ctrying really hard to be themselves\u201d and \u201cthe little blips when it breaks down, the raw desperation\u201d, the way, \u201csocial constructs get remounted in these weird microcosms where they\u2019re even more crazily hetero-normative or insanely gendered\u201d. Delayed on a plane recently she watched eight hours of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> (\u201cProfound!\u201d), and now plans to watch it again, backwards.</p> <p>Another project she\u2019s working on is her second film, <em>Four Days Like Sunday</em>, loosely based on her relationship with her mother and the cast of queer and beautiful characters who raised her. Her mother died at the beginning of 2022 \u2013 that summer Hall wrote the script. Not long ago Hall came across her mother\u2019s <em>Desert Island Discs</em>, from the early 90s. \u201cIt was shocking to hear her voice \u2013 she was in this patch where she spoke in a very serious English accent. And in the interview she talks about her dad being Black. I was like, are you kidding me? Because she would never talk about it to me.\u201d</p> <p>When <em>Passing</em> was greenlit, Hall called to tell her. Her mother hung up. The next day she phoned back. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to make a movie of that?\u201d Hall quotes, in a low Detroit accent, but it cracks slightly as she continues, \u201cand it actually breaks my heart to tell this story, but she did say, \u2018I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea, Rebecca. It could be dangerous\u2019.\u201d She pauses. \u201c\u2018Look at you, you\u2019re white\u2019, is what she said.\u201d She felt her childhood flash before her: \u201cSilly stuff. Like, I\u2019d come back from holiday and she\u2019d be like, \u2018you\u2019ve got too tan\u2019. It would be loaded, there was something else there. And lots of, \u2018don\u2019t wear your hair like this, don\u2019t swear\u2019, I mean, it was all controlled around her particular internalised, racist idea of what blackness was, you know? The reality of going on this journey is that you realise it\u2019s all, obviously, a bloody construct. We\u2019re all performing something \u2013 and this was such a big piece of my childhood.\u201d And yet, when the film came out, it turned out to be a \u201cprofound release for my mother\u201d. Some of her relatives in Detroit, Republicans, born-again Christians, have thanked her, too, \u201cbut I could tell that it was a complicated gratitude\u201d.</p>    <p>One reason she lives in New York is because it\u2019s fairly equidistant between her family in the UK and Spector\u2019s in California. They\u2019ve been together for nine years and have acted opposite each other four times. Once she told a newspaper that the greatest achievement of her life was getting married. Does she stand by that? \u201cFor me, the idea of marriage was anathema. I was politically opposed to it, fundamentally opposed to it. And I think I didn\u2019t believe in the possibility of monogamy either \u2013 I had no example of it growing up. It was just divorces everywhere and lonely people. So it probably is the greatest thing I have achieved in the sense that I managed to get to a place where it seemed a completely rational choice.\u201d</p> <p>She had come to a realisation that it was possible for Spector and her to define what marriage might be. \u201cWhich makes it this completely wonderful and hopeful thing. The idea you can get to a place where you\u2019re like, \u2018I choose to believe in the impossibility of things\u2019. It\u2019s the most hopeful thing you can do, isn\u2019t it? And insane in a world where it\u2019s difficult to find places for that. So I love it, actually. I\u2019m shocked by how much that kind of stability and anchor has actually allowed me to\u2026 fly.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, she had decided from a young age that she didn\u2019t want children. \u201cHaving been brought up by very preoccupied and brilliant artistic types, I couldn\u2019t imagine a world where I, a preoccupied artistic type, could be a good parent. But I married someone who is so committed to making up for whatever deficit I might have and allowing me to be that, but also making sure I\u2019m present for my child and holding it all together. I got lucky.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mother controlled me with her internalised racist idea of blackness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As she\u2019s talking, I\u2019m remembering an exquisite monologue about motherhood towards the end of <em>The Listeners</em>. \u201cI used to look at my mother and wonder, why aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d it goes. \u201cI used to think, you made a decision to live a small life. And I will never let that happen to me.\u201d It resonated with Hall, despite the fact that, \u201cmy life has never been little,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of life already, and it\u2019s been extreme. I understand that fear, though, because I\u2019ve had a wild and chaotic and beautiful life. And I\u2019ve been frightened of doing something that might limit it. Because I\u2019ve grappled forever, in the way that people who are raised by a narcissistic personality type do, with the idea I might be silenced in some way.\u201d</p> <p>Hall was forever working not to overshadow her mother, but also to satisfy her need to live vicariously through her daughter, an impossible balance. Now though, \u201cI think I\u2019m more rooted in myself. I had a tendency to hide.\u201d In what way? \u201cWhen I was young, my choices were all about: how can I be as invisible as possible while also being the biggest star in the world?\u201d She laughs darkly.</p> <p>When she and Spector decided, finally, to get married, she found herself becoming fixated on the idea that people plan their fantasy weddings and the more precise the plan, the more likely it is they will be disappointed. \u201cAnd I was like, can we manufacture some circumstances where we have no idea what\u2019s going to happen, so that we can just experience it?\u201d They came up with the idea of, \u201cbring your own wedding, like bring your own bottle? We\u2019re just going to gather in a house and we\u2019re going to eat and drink and dance and have fun. And if at any point anyone wants to marry us,\u201d if anybody wants to perform a ceremony, \u201cplease do.\u201d</p> <p>One friend, artist Rob Roth, leapt out of the shrubbery dressed as a werewolf and sang, \u2018If a double-decker bus / crashes into us\u2026\u2019 Another, the actor Dan Stevens, called everybody out to the pond as a blood moon was rising and gave them a candle to hold. \u201cHe was like, \u2018OK, this is my thing,\u2019 and he made Morgan and I stand way up, high over there, while everyone else was on the other side of the water, and said, \u2018I just want you to have an experience of seeing us, your community.\u2019\u201d We both sit for a moment, grinning stupidly. \u201cIt was about saying, \u2018This is our world, these are our people and we will define ourselves exactly how we want to\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Listeners will air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 9pm on Tuesday 19 November</em></p> <p><em>Styling by Bailey Moon at Brigade Talent; hair by Ben Skervin using ColorWow at Walter Schupfer Management; makeup by Sam Addington at Kramer + Kramer</em></p>",

This unstable character sits comfortably on a timeline of Hall\u2019s recent roles, like in Christine, the true story of a news reporter who died by suicide live on air. \u201cYes, I suppose all the people I play have a mask, and a reality that\u2019s behind the mask, and there is this tension between trying to define the middle ground.\u201d She hasn\u2019t consciously chosen to spend time exclusively inside women on the edge and breaks them up with starring roles in noisy blockbusters, like this year\u2019s Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. \u201cBut it\u2019s just sort of happened along the way. Someone, actually, accused me of being \u2018The queen of the gaslight narrative.\u2019\u201d Were they correct? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like being told I\u2019m anything, ever,\u201d Hall laughs. In 2018, after Woody Allen\u2019s daughter, Dylan Farrow, expressed anger that Hollywood continued to support her father, despite her allegations he\u2019d sexually assaulted her as a child, Hall made a statement saying she saw \u201cthat my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed\u201d and was \u201cprofoundly sorry. I regret this decision and wouldn\u2019t make the same one today.\u201d She also pledged her salary from her recent project with Allen to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund. How does she feel about that today? \u201cI struggle with this one,\u201d she says, twisting her body into a series of crosses. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlike me to make a public statement about anything. I make the stuff, that\u2019s how I am political. I don\u2019t think of myself as an \u2018actor-vist\u2019, I\u2019m not that person. And, I kind of regret making that statement, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the responsibility of his actors to speak to that situation.\u201d She was in a peculiar state, she tells me \u2013 newly pregnant, deeply affected emotionally by Farrow\u2019s allegations and, at the time, working on A Rainy Day in New York, directed by Allen. One morning, \u201cI was outside, shooting a street scene with Jude Law where, literally, my dialogue was, \u2018You\u2019ve got to stop sleeping with these fucking 15-year-olds.\u2019 And that day, the Weinstein scandal breaks. There\u2019s a bank of journalists and paparazzi right there, because Weinstein\u2019s a producer on it, and they\u2019re all listening to me say this.\u201d Every interview that followed revolved around Allen and Weinstein, \u201cand I was in a tangle. Like, in this moment, it\u2019s the most important thing to believe the women. Yes, of course, there\u2019s going to be complications and nuances in these stories, but we\u2019re redressing a balance here. So I felt like I wanted to do something definitive.\u201d That\u2019s when she made the statement, trying to articulate her discomfort, but remain balanced. \u201cBut it just became, \u2018another person denounces Woody Allen and regrets working with him\u2019, which is not what I said actually. I don\u2019t regret working with him. He gave me a great job opportunity and he was kind to me.\u201d Beyond that? \u201cI have no idea. I don\u2019t talk to him any more, but I don\u2019t think that we should be the ones who are doing judge and jury on this.\u201d How would she respond if it were to happen now? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say anything \u2013 my policy actually is to be an artist. Don\u2019t come out and state your stuff so much. I don\u2019t think that makes me apathetic or not engaged. I just think it\u2019s my job.\u201d And it\u2019s a busy job, a rich job \u2013 she\u2019s just wrapped on a film with Jamie Lee Curtis, and a biopic about the photographer Peter Hujar with Ben Whishaw, but she makes time for pleasure, too, which for Hall means reality TV. \u201cMorgan doesn\u2019t understand it \u2013 he\u2019s like, \u2018I thought I married this sophisticated, cultured, literate, artistic type?\u2019 But I just find it utterly fascinating. It\u2019s such a good way to look at human behaviour, in performance, which obviously is my interest.\u201d She leans in as she talks about the magic and artistry of Real Housewives and its sister shows, all these people \u201ctrying really hard to be themselves\u201d and \u201cthe little blips when it breaks down, the raw desperation\u201d, the way, \u201csocial constructs get remounted in these weird microcosms where they\u2019re even more crazily hetero-normative or insanely gendered\u201d. Delayed on a plane recently she watched eight hours of Vanderpump Rules (\u201cProfound!\u201d), and now plans to watch it again, backwards. Another project she\u2019s working on is her second film, Four Days Like Sunday, loosely based on her relationship with her mother and the cast of queer and beautiful characters who raised her. Her mother died at the beginning of 2022 \u2013 that summer Hall wrote the script. Not long ago Hall came across her mother\u2019s Desert Island Discs, from the early 90s. \u201cIt was shocking to hear her voice \u2013 she was in this patch where she spoke in a very serious English accent. And in the interview she talks about her dad being Black. I was like, are you kidding me? Because she would never talk about it to me.\u201d When Passing was greenlit, Hall called to tell her. Her mother hung up. The next day she phoned back. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to make a movie of that?\u201d Hall quotes, in a low Detroit accent, but it cracks slightly as she continues, \u201cand it actually breaks my heart to tell this story, but she did say, \u2018I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea, Rebecca. It could be dangerous\u2019.\u201d She pauses. \u201c\u2018Look at you, you\u2019re white\u2019, is what she said.\u201d She felt her childhood flash before her: \u201cSilly stuff. Like, I\u2019d come back from holiday and she\u2019d be like, \u2018you\u2019ve got too tan\u2019. It would be loaded, there was something else there. And lots of, \u2018don\u2019t wear your hair like this, don\u2019t swear\u2019, I mean, it was all controlled around her particular internalised, racist idea of what blackness was, you know? The reality of going on this journey is that you realise it\u2019s all, obviously, a bloody construct. We\u2019re all performing something \u2013 and this was such a big piece of my childhood.\u201d And yet, when the film came out, it turned out to be a \u201cprofound release for my mother\u201d. Some of her relatives in Detroit, Republicans, born-again Christians, have thanked her, too, \u201cbut I could tell that it was a complicated gratitude\u201d. One reason she lives in New York is because it\u2019s fairly equidistant between her family in the UK and Spector\u2019s in California. They\u2019ve been together for nine years and have acted opposite each other four times. Once she told a newspaper that the greatest achievement of her life was getting married. Does she stand by that? \u201cFor me, the idea of marriage was anathema. I was politically opposed to it, fundamentally opposed to it. And I think I didn\u2019t believe in the possibility of monogamy either \u2013 I had no example of it growing up. It was just divorces everywhere and lonely people. So it probably is the greatest thing I have achieved in the sense that I managed to get to a place where it seemed a completely rational choice.\u201d She had come to a realisation that it was possible for Spector and her to define what marriage might be. \u201cWhich makes it this completely wonderful and hopeful thing. The idea you can get to a place where you\u2019re like, \u2018I choose to believe in the impossibility of things\u2019. It\u2019s the most hopeful thing you can do, isn\u2019t it? And insane in a world where it\u2019s difficult to find places for that. So I love it, actually. I\u2019m shocked by how much that kind of stability and anchor has actually allowed me to\u2026 fly.\u201d Similarly, she had decided from a young age that she didn\u2019t want children. \u201cHaving been brought up by very preoccupied and brilliant artistic types, I couldn\u2019t imagine a world where I, a preoccupied artistic type, could be a good parent. But I married someone who is so committed to making up for whatever deficit I might have and allowing me to be that, but also making sure I\u2019m present for my child and holding it all together. I got lucky.\u201d As she\u2019s talking, I\u2019m remembering an exquisite monologue about motherhood towards the end of The Listeners. \u201cI used to look at my mother and wonder, why aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d it goes. \u201cI used to think, you made a decision to live a small life. And I will never let that happen to me.\u201d It resonated with Hall, despite the fact that, \u201cmy life has never been little,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of life already, and it\u2019s been extreme. I understand that fear, though, because I\u2019ve had a wild and chaotic and beautiful life. And I\u2019ve been frightened of doing something that might limit it. Because I\u2019ve grappled forever, in the way that people who are raised by a narcissistic personality type do, with the idea I might be silenced in some way.\u201d Hall was forever working not to overshadow her mother, but also to satisfy her need to live vicariously through her daughter, an impossible balance. Now though, \u201cI think I\u2019m more rooted in myself. I had a tendency to hide.\u201d In what way? \u201cWhen I was young, my choices were all about: how can I be as invisible as possible while also being the biggest star in the world?\u201d She laughs darkly. When she and Spector decided, finally, to get married, she found herself becoming fixated on the idea that people plan their fantasy weddings and the more precise the plan, the more likely it is they will be disappointed. \u201cAnd I was like, can we manufacture some circumstances where we have no idea what\u2019s going to happen, so that we can just experience it?\u201d They came up with the idea of, \u201cbring your own wedding, like bring your own bottle? We\u2019re just going to gather in a house and we\u2019re going to eat and drink and dance and have fun. And if at any point anyone wants to marry us,\u201d if anybody wants to perform a ceremony, \u201cplease do.\u201d One friend, artist Rob Roth, leapt out of the shrubbery dressed as a werewolf and sang, \u2018If a double-decker bus / crashes into us\u2026\u2019 Another, the actor Dan Stevens, called everybody out to the pond as a blood moon was rising and gave them a candle to hold. \u201cHe was like, \u2018OK, this is my thing,\u2019 and he made Morgan and I stand way up, high over there, while everyone else was on the other side of the water, and said, \u2018I just want you to have an experience of seeing us, your community.\u2019\u201d We both sit for a moment, grinning stupidly. \u201cIt was about saying, \u2018This is our world, these are our people and we will define ourselves exactly how we want to\u2019.\u201d The Listeners will air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 9pm on Tuesday 19 November Styling by Bailey Moon at Brigade Talent; hair by Ben Skervin using ColorWow at Walter Schupfer Management; makeup by Sam Addington at Kramer + Kramer",

      "body": "<p>Steven Johnson has a reputation as a research software nerd. The author of 13 nonfiction books, he\u2019s constantly looking for digital tools to streamline his creative process. So when large language models \u2013 which power text-generating AI tools such as ChatGPT \u2013 started getting attention, he was most interested in what they could mean for organising information.</p> <p>In 2022, an article <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/magazine/ai-language.html\">Johnson wrote about LLMs</a> for the <em>New York Times</em> caught the eye of researchers at Google Labs, the tech company\u2019s experimental AI arm, who came to him with a proposition: would he help them develop the kind of digital research assistant he\u2019d been dreaming of? The result is NotebookLM, a note-taking tool that uses AI to help organise, summarise and answer questions about any information you give it. \u201cThe way we think about it is it\u2019s a tool for understanding things,\u201d Johnson says.</p> <p>Generative AI has been eagerly adopted in the productivity tech space, with new and existing tools promising features that can help streamline your schedule, simplify emails and take notes more effectively. I\u2019ve generally been sceptical of such products, assuming that by the time I\u2019ve fiddled around to get them set up, I\u2019ve probably negated most of their productivity benefits. But with a new generation on the scene, I wondered if my workflow couldn\u2019t benefit from an AI boost. Could these tools actually deliver some of the advantages claimed by AI acolytes, automating more humdrum aspects of work and leaving me free to focus on creative endeavours?</p>    <p>I approached NotebookLM with caution, noting the disclaimer at the bottom of the screen: \u201cNotebookLM may still sometimes give inaccurate responses, so you may want to confirm any facts independently.\u201d As a journalist, I\u2019m wary of AI\u2019s tendency to \u201challucinate\u201d. But NotebookLM differs from text generators such as ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini in that it only works with the information you provide. You can start a new \u201cnotebook\u201d for a project and upload up to 50 \u201csources\u201d. These can include pdfs, audio files (which it automatically transcribes), .txt files, web links and Google Docs. I tried uploading notes and interview files for a story I was working on, then asked the \u201cNotebook guide\u201d \u2013 an AI assistant \u2013 to produce a briefing doc based on their content.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can imagine an AI agent that schedules on your behalf, that even writes and sends fully written emails on your behalf</p> <footer> <cite>Rahul Vohra</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I immediately saw the appeal. The brief summarised key points raised from hours of audio and drew links between my sources. It even pulled out key quotes. Using the AI chat function, I interrogated the material further, asking which findings were most surprising and posing specific questions about the content. Rather than trawling through my transcripts to remember which interviewees had made a particular point, I simply asked: \u201cWho spoke about [X topic]?\u201d and got a detailed summary of who said what \u2013 along with footnotes directing me to the exact wording in the original material.</p> <p>It\u2019s the restriction at the core of NotebookLM \u2013 using only the information you provide \u2013 that makes it so useful. I could see it being adopted by students and knowledge workers of all stripes. Johnson says he has a notebook for his next book, where he stores ideas and asks the guide to suggest chapter structures or key characters. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like a targeted brainstorming notebook,\u201d he says. He also has one for the NotebookLM project itself, where he collates announcements and memos. He used the guide to draft a press release for a new feature, and got it to come up with its own tagline: \u201cThink smarter not harder.\u201d</p> <p>There are drawbacks. The guide gives long answers to queries, which results in a lot of text to wade through, and I found a level of subjectivity creeping into the AI-generated summaries (it deemed my interview with Johnson \u201cfascinating\u201d). This was particularly evident in the \u201cAudio Overview\u201d option, a much-hyped feature that creates a 10-minute AI-generated podcast based on your sources. It\u2019s fairly mind-blowing at first: it truly sounds like two podcast hosts knowledgably discussing the subject matter. But I found that it extrapolated from my material, making value judgments that didn\u2019t necessarily reflect the original content.</p>    <p>NotebookLM definitely saved me time locating information, but productivity is not just about efficiency. Johnson believes the tool can aid creativity on a deeper level. He has one notebook that he calls his \u201ceverything notebook\u201d. It contains thousands of quotations he\u2019s collected from ebooks over the past 25 years, and he\u2019s slowly adding the text of all the books he\u2019s written. He then treats it like an extension of his memory, using the AI chat to resurface topics of interest or draw connections between sources. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly good at just being like: \u2018Oh yeah, 15 years ago you read that article about ant colonies,\u2019\u201d he says.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>This idea of outsourcing or expanding brain power is a common theme in productivity circles. The metaphor of a \u201csecond brain\u201d comes up a lot. \u201cThe concept of the second brain is effectively a way that enables you to have another product that does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, freeing you up for more high-value work,\u201d says Robbie O\u2019Connor at San Francisco-based productivity platform <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a>. O\u2019Connor used to work on Google Maps and compares the second brain idea to how that app supercharged our navigational capabilities. \u201cIt gave you a lot more power, a lot more freedom, a lot more reliability,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Notion offers a suite of organisational tools, with diverse templates for note-taking including a to-do list, project planner and budget, as well as AI features. It also has a calendar app and last month announced an upcoming email app. I found it overwhelming when I logged in \u2013 I usually just write a to-do list on paper. As I gamely started filling out a weekly to-do list, habit tracker and project planner, I couldn\u2019t help but feel I was procrastinating rather than actually doing the work I was planning. A big part of Notion\u2019s appeal, however, is its collaborative features when adopted across teams; working solo, I missed out on these benefits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/16/i-ai-generated-some-podcasts-and-the-results-are-uncanny\">I AI-generated some podcasts \u2013 and the results are uncanny </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another note-taking product, <a href=\"https://capacities.io/\">Capacities</a>, is more intuitive, if still somewhat intimidating. This launched in 2022 and recently got a boost after being <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/ai-productivity-apps-capacities-raycast-readwise/\">recommended by Casey Newton</a>, a tech journalist and productivity tool power-user. Capacities\u2019s big idea is to do away with the traditional file-and-folder computer storage system. Instead, notes are classified by type as \u201cobjects\u201d \u2013 for instance, a book, pdf, person, weblink, image or document. You can then organise and link these objects by collating them or adding tags. The idea is that you should be able to rediscover relevant notes more easily; they get more organised over time, rather than having a single defined location from the start. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in storing and organising stuff if it doesn\u2019t help you in the end,\u201d says co-founder Steffen Bleher. There\u2019s also an AI assistant.</p> <p>I started collecting objects, noting down story ideas and dropping in interesting links. It was a good way to keep things in one place; usually I would jot ideas in the Apple Notes app and bookmark links in my browser. But after using Capacities for a while, I found I didn\u2019t have that many notes to benefit from its information-networking approach. It was clear it would require long-term commitment to get the most out of it. For Bleher, Capacities is basically a lifestyle choice; he uses it for both professional and personal purposes, adding thoughts about books he\u2019s reading and ideas that come out of discussions with friends. A video tour by co-founder Michael von Hohnhorst shows him jotting down reflections on a podcast he has just listened to and saving favourite quotes and recipes. I can\u2019t imagine documenting my life to this degree. A <a href=\"https://capacities.io/blog/a-second-brain\">Capacities blogpost states</a>: \u201cBuilding a second brain takes discipline.\u201d Perhaps this is what I lack.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The big challenge is confusing productivity with busyness. If you\u2019re not clear in the outcomes you want, you\u2019re not going to use the tool effectively</p> <footer> <cite>Anna Gurun</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bleher acknowledges that a small cohort of productivity power-users are dwarfed by a much longer tail of people who just want a solution to a specific workflow problem they are having. Even though he clearly falls in the first camp, he takes a pragmatic view to adopting new tech. \u201cMany people fall in this productivity trap that they need to have crazy setups and they need to do more stuff, and in the end they basically procrastinate and then they don\u2019t get anything done,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Anna Gurun, an associate director at HSM Advisory, a future-of-work advisory group, echoes this sentiment. \u201cThe big challenge is confusing productivity with busyness,\u201d she says. You might tick off lots of tasks in a to-do list app but are you actually achieving what you need to? Your AI calendar might organise your schedule but are you still spending too much time in unnecessary meetings? \u201cIf you\u2019re not clear in the outcomes you want to reach then you\u2019re not going to be able to use the tool effectively,\u201d she says. Productivity also has a more emotional side, she adds, which tech tools can\u2019t really help with. Maybe you\u2019re less productive because you\u2019re sleeping poorly or you have just been through a bad breakup. The apps can also make failure seem bigger, she says: \u201cYou sort of magnify behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>These words came to mind as I looked back at a calendar tool I\u2019d been trying out. There are many smart scheduling tools out there \u2013 I opted for Reclaim.ai, owned by Dropbox. It syncs with Google Calendar and, when used by teams, optimises the best meeting times to suit all attenders. It also has several simple but sensible features, including the ability to automatically add a \u201cdecompress\u201d buffer after meetings that include a video link and the option to input \u201chabits\u201d \u2013 regular tasks you want to reserve time for. I set a daily habit to spend an hour working on that novel I keep meaning to write, which Reclaim.ai dynamically found time for around my other obligations. At first, having the calendar reminder was a good motivator, but I soon realised I\u2019d been far too ambitious. However sophisticated the features, no scheduling tool can create more hours in the day, or force me to actually do the work.</p> <p>As AI gets smarter, though, it may be able to take care of more of those irksome little tasks that distract from what we really want to spend time on. The next trend is for AI \u201cagents\u201d \u2013 a step on from a chatbot, with the ability to actually take action. This month, AI company Anthropic demoed <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use\">an experimental AI model</a> that can automatically fill in a web form by finding data from across someone\u2019s computer. Google is reportedly developing an AI agent that could autonomously book a flight or make an online purchase.</p> <p>Rahul Vohra, founder and chief executive of email app <a href=\"https://superhuman.com/\">Superhuman</a>, says this approach will come to productivity tools. Superhuman already has AI features to help write, summarise and reply to email, and recently added one that automatically makes calendar events based on emailed details. AI agents could do more. \u201cYou can imagine an AI agent that triages on your behalf, that schedules on your behalf, that even writes and one day sends fully written emails on your behalf,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Want to set up a meeting or negotiate a contract? Have your bot speak to my bot.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Steven Johnson has a reputation as a research software nerd. The author of 13 nonfiction books, he\u2019s constantly looking for digital tools to streamline his creative process. So when large language models \u2013 which power text-generating AI tools such as ChatGPT \u2013 started getting attention, he was most interested in what they could mean for organising information. In 2022, an article Johnson wrote about LLMs for the New York Times caught the eye of researchers at Google Labs, the tech company\u2019s experimental AI arm, who came to him with a proposition: would he help them develop the kind of digital research assistant he\u2019d been dreaming of? The result is NotebookLM, a note-taking tool that uses AI to help organise, summarise and answer questions about any information you give it. \u201cThe way we think about it is it\u2019s a tool for understanding things,\u201d Johnson says. Generative AI has been eagerly adopted in the productivity tech space, with new and existing tools promising features that can help streamline your schedule, simplify emails and take notes more effectively. I\u2019ve generally been sceptical of such products, assuming that by the time I\u2019ve fiddled around to get them set up, I\u2019ve probably negated most of their productivity benefits. But with a new generation on the scene, I wondered if my workflow couldn\u2019t benefit from an AI boost. Could these tools actually deliver some of the advantages claimed by AI acolytes, automating more humdrum aspects of work and leaving me free to focus on creative endeavours? I approached NotebookLM with caution, noting the disclaimer at the bottom of the screen: \u201cNotebookLM may still sometimes give inaccurate responses, so you may want to confirm any facts independently.\u201d As a journalist, I\u2019m wary of AI\u2019s tendency to \u201challucinate\u201d. But NotebookLM differs from text generators such as ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini in that it only works with the information you provide. You can start a new \u201cnotebook\u201d for a project and upload up to 50 \u201csources\u201d. These can include pdfs, audio files (which it automatically transcribes), .txt files, web links and Google Docs. I tried uploading notes and interview files for a story I was working on, then asked the \u201cNotebook guide\u201d \u2013 an AI assistant \u2013 to produce a briefing doc based on their content. I immediately saw the appeal. The brief summarised key points raised from hours of audio and drew links between my sources. It even pulled out key quotes. Using the AI chat function, I interrogated the material further, asking which findings were most surprising and posing specific questions about the content. Rather than trawling through my transcripts to remember which interviewees had made a particular point, I simply asked: \u201cWho spoke about [X topic]?\u201d and got a detailed summary of who said what \u2013 along with footnotes directing me to the exact wording in the original material. It\u2019s the restriction at the core of NotebookLM \u2013 using only the information you provide \u2013 that makes it so useful. I could see it being adopted by students and knowledge workers of all stripes. Johnson says he has a notebook for his next book, where he stores ideas and asks the guide to suggest chapter structures or key characters. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like a targeted brainstorming notebook,\u201d he says. He also has one for the NotebookLM project itself, where he collates announcements and memos. He used the guide to draft a press release for a new feature, and got it to come up with its own tagline: \u201cThink smarter not harder.\u201d There are drawbacks. The guide gives long answers to queries, which results in a lot of text to wade through, and I found a level of subjectivity creeping into the AI-generated summaries (it deemed my interview with Johnson \u201cfascinating\u201d). This was particularly evident in the \u201cAudio Overview\u201d option, a much-hyped feature that creates a 10-minute AI-generated podcast based on your sources. It\u2019s fairly mind-blowing at first: it truly sounds like two podcast hosts knowledgably discussing the subject matter. But I found that it extrapolated from my material, making value judgments that didn\u2019t necessarily reflect the original content. NotebookLM definitely saved me time locating information, but productivity is not just about efficiency. Johnson believes the tool can aid creativity on a deeper level. He has one notebook that he calls his \u201ceverything notebook\u201d. It contains thousands of quotations he\u2019s collected from ebooks over the past 25 years, and he\u2019s slowly adding the text of all the books he\u2019s written. He then treats it like an extension of his memory, using the AI chat to resurface topics of interest or draw connections between sources. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly good at just being like: \u2018Oh yeah, 15 years ago you read that article about ant colonies,\u2019\u201d he says. * * * This idea of outsourcing or expanding brain power is a common theme in productivity circles. The metaphor of a \u201csecond brain\u201d comes up a lot. \u201cThe concept of the second brain is effectively a way that enables you to have another product that does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, freeing you up for more high-value work,\u201d says Robbie O\u2019Connor at San Francisco-based productivity platform Notion. O\u2019Connor used to work on Google Maps and compares the second brain idea to how that app supercharged our navigational capabilities. \u201cIt gave you a lot more power, a lot more freedom, a lot more reliability,\u201d he says. Notion offers a suite of organisational tools, with diverse templates for note-taking including a to-do list, project planner and budget, as well as AI features. It also has a calendar app and last month announced an upcoming email app. I found it overwhelming when I logged in \u2013 I usually just write a to-do list on paper. As I gamely started filling out a weekly to-do list, habit tracker and project planner, I couldn\u2019t help but feel I was procrastinating rather than actually doing the work I was planning. A big part of Notion\u2019s appeal, however, is its collaborative features when adopted across teams; working solo, I missed out on these benefits. Another note-taking product, Capacities, is more intuitive, if still somewhat intimidating. This launched in 2022 and recently got a boost after being recommended by Casey Newton, a tech journalist and productivity tool power-user. Capacities\u2019s big idea is to do away with the traditional file-and-folder computer storage system. Instead, notes are classified by type as \u201cobjects\u201d \u2013 for instance, a book, pdf, person, weblink, image or document. You can then organise and link these objects by collating them or adding tags. The idea is that you should be able to rediscover relevant notes more easily; they get more organised over time, rather than having a single defined location from the start. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in storing and organising stuff if it doesn\u2019t help you in the end,\u201d says co-founder Steffen Bleher. There\u2019s also an AI assistant. I started collecting objects, noting down story ideas and dropping in interesting links. It was a good way to keep things in one place; usually I would jot ideas in the Apple Notes app and bookmark links in my browser. But after using Capacities for a while, I found I didn\u2019t have that many notes to benefit from its information-networking approach. It was clear it would require long-term commitment to get the most out of it. For Bleher, Capacities is basically a lifestyle choice; he uses it for both professional and personal purposes, adding thoughts about books he\u2019s reading and ideas that come out of discussions with friends. A video tour by co-founder Michael von Hohnhorst shows him jotting down reflections on a podcast he has just listened to and saving favourite quotes and recipes. I can\u2019t imagine documenting my life to this degree. A Capacities blogpost states: \u201cBuilding a second brain takes discipline.\u201d Perhaps this is what I lack. Bleher acknowledges that a small cohort of productivity power-users are dwarfed by a much longer tail of people who just want a solution to a specific workflow problem they are having. Even though he clearly falls in the first camp, he takes a pragmatic view to adopting new tech. \u201cMany people fall in this productivity trap that they need to have crazy setups and they need to do more stuff, and in the end they basically procrastinate and then they don\u2019t get anything done,\u201d he says. Anna Gurun, an associate director at HSM Advisory, a future-of-work advisory group, echoes this sentiment. \u201cThe big challenge is confusing productivity with busyness,\u201d she says. You might tick off lots of tasks in a to-do list app but are you actually achieving what you need to? Your AI calendar might organise your schedule but are you still spending too much time in unnecessary meetings? \u201cIf you\u2019re not clear in the outcomes you want to reach then you\u2019re not going to be able to use the tool effectively,\u201d she says. Productivity also has a more emotional side, she adds, which tech tools can\u2019t really help with. Maybe you\u2019re less productive because you\u2019re sleeping poorly or you have just been through a bad breakup. The apps can also make failure seem bigger, she says: \u201cYou sort of magnify behaviour.\u201d These words came to mind as I looked back at a calendar tool I\u2019d been trying out. There are many smart scheduling tools out there \u2013 I opted for Reclaim.ai, owned by Dropbox. It syncs with Google Calendar and, when used by teams, optimises the best meeting times to suit all attenders. It also has several simple but sensible features, including the ability to automatically add a \u201cdecompress\u201d buffer after meetings that include a video link and the option to input \u201chabits\u201d \u2013 regular tasks you want to reserve time for. I set a daily habit to spend an hour working on that novel I keep meaning to write, which Reclaim.ai dynamically found time for around my other obligations. At first, having the calendar reminder was a good motivator, but I soon realised I\u2019d been far too ambitious. However sophisticated the features, no scheduling tool can create more hours in the day, or force me to actually do the work. As AI gets smarter, though, it may be able to take care of more of those irksome little tasks that distract from what we really want to spend time on. The next trend is for AI \u201cagents\u201d \u2013 a step on from a chatbot, with the ability to actually take action. This month, AI company Anthropic demoed an experimental AI model that can automatically fill in a web form by finding data from across someone\u2019s computer. Google is reportedly developing an AI agent that could autonomously book a flight or make an online purchase. Rahul Vohra, founder and chief executive of email app Superhuman, says this approach will come to productivity tools. Superhuman already has AI features to help write, summarise and reply to email, and recently added one that automatically makes calendar events based on emailed details. AI agents could do more. \u201cYou can imagine an AI agent that triages on your behalf, that schedules on your behalf, that even writes and one day sends fully written emails on your behalf,\u201d he says. Want to set up a meeting or negotiate a contract? Have your bot speak to my bot.",

At the outset, I very much wanted what it appears to offer: an account of a friendship between two uncommonly fascinating American writers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/23/joan-didion-obituary\">Joan Didion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/20/eve-babitz-chronicler-of-1960s-and-70s-hollywood-excess-dies-aged-78\">Eve Babitz</a>, inspired by the discovery of a cache of letters found hidden at the back of the latter\u2019s wardrobe after her death, aged 78, from Huntington\u2019s disease in 2021.

Didion was an alcoholic, she suggests, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/02/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">John Gregory Dunne</a>, her husband of nearly 40 years, was probably gay. One of Anolik\u2019s (secondhand) sources for the latter idea is Christopher Isherwood\u2019s partner, Don Bachardy, who once told someone Dunne couldn\u2019t stop staring at his crotch. The other is Bret Easton Ellis, who \u201chad friends\u201d who\u2019d spotted Dunne \u201cin certain gay bars at night, very drunk\u201d.</p> <p>This stuff is titillating, of course. By undercutting Didion\u2019s ruthless stage management of every aspect of her life, it has an effect on her nonfiction in ways that may ultimately make it more interesting. The writer David Thomson tells Anolik about a call Didion made to her publisher, Sonny Mehta, the day after he received the manuscript of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/08/100-best-nonfiction-books-2-the-year-of-magical-thinking-joan-didion-robert-mccrum\">The Year of Magical Thinking</a></em>, the memoir she wrote following Dunne\u2019s death in 2003. \u201cWill it be a bestseller,\u201d she asked him, sounding \u201calmost desperate\u201d \u2013 a question that grazes like a sharp object. But the tinge of spite in the repetition of such anecdotes sits uneasily in a book that hopes to elevate Babitz. Dragging Didion down doesn\u2019t in itself lift up her less famous friend.</p>    <p><em>Were</em> they friends, though? Their relationship strikes me as more casual than the word implies. When Didion and Dunne were living in LA after their marriage in 1964, Babitz, a goddaughter of Igor Stravinsky, was a designer of album covers and best known for having <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/10/eve-babitz-marcel-duchamp-chess-nude\">posed nude for a photograph with the artist Marcel Duchamp</a>.

Where the former was voluptuous (\u201cboobalicious\u201d) and direct, the other was slight to the point of emaciated, and given to calculated silences. Anolik sees them as two sides of a coin; her thesis is that Babitz\u2019s <em>Slow Days, Fast&nbsp;Company</em> (1977) and Didion\u2019s <em>The White Album</em> (1979) are companion pieces, utterly necessary to each other (both are essay collections that stake out Los Angeles/California).

Things cooled. Didion, the reader understands, did not have close friends. She had Dunne, with whom she forged both a marital myth and a literary brand. When Babitz burned half her body in a dreadful accident in 1997, the Dunnes sent a note whose gelid heartiness fairly takes the breath away; in truth, Didion no longer thought of Babitz at all.

      "bodyText": "Reading Didion &amp; Babitz is a bit like being held hostage. At the outset, I very much wanted what it appears to offer: an account of a friendship between two uncommonly fascinating American writers, Joan Didion and Eve Babitz, inspired by the discovery of a cache of letters found hidden at the back of the latter\u2019s wardrobe after her death, aged 78, from Huntington\u2019s disease in 2021. I guess you could say I was tied to my chair. After a while, though, it came to me that these women had not, after all, engaged in much of a correspondence; the letter offered as bait at the start of Lili Anolik\u2019s book, in which Babitz says mean things to Didion (\u201cCould you write what you write if you weren\u2019t so tiny, Joan?\u201d), had, it turned out, never been posted.

But she comes into bed with us.</p> <p><strong>Breakfast in bed?</strong> Very much so. I don\u2019t drink tea or coffee, but it\u2019s normally me who gets up and makes a cuppa for my Mrs and an apple juice for my little girl, plus I\u2019ll bring pancakes, fruit or whatever they want. Nothing lavish, but I put it on one of those granny trays and come upstairs like a waitress. Then I get back into bed and we have a leisurely morning.</p> <p><strong>Morning routine?</strong> I normally take my daughter to a gymnastics soft-play centre at 10.30am. It\u2019s full of hungover parents watching their kids launch themselves into foam pits. If yours forces you to join in, God forbid you should ever land in the foam pit, because it\u2019s the hardest place to get out of. You\u2019ll lose a sock trying and you\u2019ll flash your boob at someone.</p> <p><strong>Sunday roast? </strong>Yes, with two Yorkshire puddings, and I\u2019m a purist. I don\u2019t want anything fancy, like pumpkin-spiced red cabbage or paprika cauliflower cheese. I want it to be proper. My partner\u2019s a brilliant cook so she\u2019ll make it or we\u2019ll go to a local carvery.</p> <p><strong>Rainy afternoon?</strong> My daughter loves crafting. Recently, she wanted to make the characters from a song about speckled frogs, so we had to make frogs. Then she wanted a fly, too, which was a real stretch of my artistic skills. It\u2019s such a change from before I had her. When I was on <em>BBC Breakfast</em>, Sunday was about getting ready for work the next day and often that meant catching a train somewhere in the afternoon so I could interview someone. I used to hate Sundays. Now they\u2019re lovely.</p> <p><strong>Evening entertainment</strong>? We\u2019ve got lights that give our kitchen a disco effect. We love Pink and Taylor Swift and my partner is into Belinda Carlisle. So we\u2019ll do that sometimes \u2013 have a dance \u2013 then read my little girl a story. When she\u2019s in bed, we\u2019ll open a bottle of red and watch a film or read.</p> <p><em>Listen to <a href=\"https://clicktime.symantec.com/15t5emLtUvMiCF2ePAhzy?h=SS14k6bIPDpju-Fz2d9_S59yB6gMnQtF2JKeCU_KHKc=&amp;amp;u=https://lnk.to/TheRestIsMoney\">The Rest is Money</a> wherever you get your podcasts</em></p>",

Breakfast in bed? Very much so. I don\u2019t drink tea or coffee, but it\u2019s normally me who gets up and makes a cuppa for my Mrs and an apple juice for my little girl, plus I\u2019ll bring pancakes, fruit or whatever they want. Nothing lavish, but I put it on one of those granny trays and come upstairs like a waitress. Then I get back into bed and we have a leisurely morning. Morning routine? I normally take my daughter to a gymnastics soft-play centre at 10.30am. It\u2019s full of hungover parents watching their kids launch themselves into foam pits. If yours forces you to join in, God forbid you should ever land in the foam pit, because it\u2019s the hardest place to get out of. You\u2019ll lose a sock trying and you\u2019ll flash your boob at someone. Sunday roast? Yes, with two Yorkshire puddings, and I\u2019m a purist. I don\u2019t want anything fancy, like pumpkin-spiced red cabbage or paprika cauliflower cheese. I want it to be proper. My partner\u2019s a brilliant cook so she\u2019ll make it or we\u2019ll go to a local carvery. Rainy afternoon? My daughter loves crafting. Recently, she wanted to make the characters from a song about speckled frogs, so we had to make frogs. Then she wanted a fly, too, which was a real stretch of my artistic skills. It\u2019s such a change from before I had her. When I was on BBC Breakfast, Sunday was about getting ready for work the next day and often that meant catching a train somewhere in the afternoon so I could interview someone. I used to hate Sundays. Now they\u2019re lovely. Evening entertainment? We\u2019ve got lights that give our kitchen a disco effect. We love Pink and Taylor Swift and my partner is into Belinda Carlisle. So we\u2019ll do that sometimes \u2013 have a dance \u2013 then read my little girl a story. When she\u2019s in bed, we\u2019ll open a bottle of red and watch a film or read. Listen to The Rest is Money wherever you get your podcasts",

People fear death because they cannot control its timing or form, and the medical profession can\u2019t help. People go to Switzerland to die earlier than they want, often alone.

Her law is only for those who are dying within six months.</p> <p>Throughout the world, up to 300 million<strong> </strong>people have assisted dying laws. Where those laws start with terminal-illness-only provisions, that is where they stick. There is no slippery slope. That slippery slope occurs where the law is an \u00adunbearable-suffering law, and what constitutes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/28/assisted-dying-inquiry-hears-people-in-uk-face-unbearable-suffering\">unbearable suffering</a> becomes a difficult line to draw. That is not this case. Our courts have made crystal clear that it is for our parliament to decide the ambit of an assisted dying law.</p> <p>Kim\u2019s law with pre-assistance safeguards is a safer, more compassionate law than the current one. Parliament should make the change.</p>    <p><strong>Sonia Sodha:</strong> You set out the case very powerfully and, like you, I\u2019m hugely sympathetic to those with terminal conditions who want medically assisted suicide to be legalised. I can think of situations where I\u2019d want it for myself. But parliament shouldn\u2019t legislate unless it\u2019s confident it can be done safely. I don\u2019t believe this bill achieves that.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure we can prevent people choosing assisted suicide because they feel they are a burden or would rather pass money on to their kids than spend it on care. Even more concerning, I don\u2019t think the bill\u2019s safeguards \u2013 approval by two doctors and a high court judge \u2013 would reliably detect if someone was being coerced, pressured or nudged into killing themselves. Coercive control can be extremely difficult to identify, including by victims.</p> <p>High court judgments show family judges sometimes fail to investigate coercive control even where it\u2019s alleged, which it may not always be in assisted-dying situations.

      "bodyText": "Charles Falconer: The current law has been abandoned. The director of public prosecutions (DPP) will not prosecute those motivated by compassion as long as they are not healthcare professionals, despite the fact they are committing a crime to which they have no defence, with a maximum of 14 years in prison. This half-law brings unnecessary suffering. People fear death because they cannot control its timing or form, and the medical profession can\u2019t help. People go to Switzerland to die earlier than they want, often alone. Those who cannot afford or do not have the energy to go to Switzerland take steps like hoarding pills to take their own lives, often alone to protect their loved ones. People can suffer horribly in their final illness because the doctor cannot provide help for them to end the agony, when it is conspicuously the compassionate course. Those who love them who do help often face an investigation and then an agonising wait as the DPP decides whether they are to be prosecuted. The terminally ill should have a choice. If they want help they should be given it. Most won\u2019t. There need to be safeguards to ensure that there is no pressure to have an unwanted assisted death. Kim Leadbeater\u2019s terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, published on Tuesday, contains robust safeguards \u2013 better than anywhere else in the world: two doctors and a high court judge have to be satisfied that the choice is freely made by someone with capacity to make that choice. Countries where there are assisted dying laws for the terminally ill show that these laws do not lead to cases of coercion. The safeguards work. The inadequacy of palliative care in some parts of those countries does not lead to reluctant early deaths. Rather it leads to less fear and suffering. And to an improvement in palliative care. Kim\u2019s law does not extend to people who are suffering unbearably through some chronic condition but are not terminally ill. Her law is only for those who are dying within six months. Throughout the world, up to 300 million people have assisted dying laws. Where those laws start with terminal-illness-only provisions, that is where they stick. There is no slippery slope. That slippery slope occurs where the law is an unbearable-suffering law, and what constitutes unbearable suffering becomes a difficult line to draw. That is not this case. Our courts have made crystal clear that it is for our parliament to decide the ambit of an assisted dying law. Kim\u2019s law with pre-assistance safeguards is a safer, more compassionate law than the current one. Parliament should make the change. Sonia Sodha: You set out the case very powerfully and, like you, I\u2019m hugely sympathetic to those with terminal conditions who want medically assisted suicide to be legalised. I can think of situations where I\u2019d want it for myself. But parliament shouldn\u2019t legislate unless it\u2019s confident it can be done safely. I don\u2019t believe this bill achieves that. I\u2019m not sure we can prevent people choosing assisted suicide because they feel they are a burden or would rather pass money on to their kids than spend it on care. Even more concerning, I don\u2019t think the bill\u2019s safeguards \u2013 approval by two doctors and a high court judge \u2013 would reliably detect if someone was being coerced, pressured or nudged into killing themselves. Coercive control can be extremely difficult to identify, including by victims. High court judgments show family judges sometimes fail to investigate coercive control even where it\u2019s alleged, which it may not always be in assisted-dying situations. It\u2019s difficult to prove coercive behaviour in the criminal courts. Busy doctors aren\u2019t well placed to detect coercive control. If a doctor has no concerns, on what basis would a judge investigate? What if one adult child suspects their sick parent is in a coercive relationship with another adult child: how would they raise their concerns with the court, what resources would they need to do so, and what if they don\u2019t find out their parent has opted for assisted suicide until it\u2019s too late?

In Oregon, doctors who controversially regard anorexia as sometimes terminal have approved assisted dying for patients, to the horror of survivors who say doctors can give up too easily on them.

      "body": "<p><strong>Equilibriste Chenin Blanc, Loire, France 2023 (\u00a38.99, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a>) </strong>I\u2019m not sure if Rachel Reeves is a wine lover. And given the fuss she\u2019s made of the straitened circumstances of the public finances, I would in any case have been naive to think she might have cut the UK\u2019s famously high wine duty in her first Budget. But there is one aspect of the wine duty regime that I still hope she might fix: rethinking the introduction of a sliding scale where the duty increases with every 0.5% in the wine\u2019s abv. First cooked up by one of Reeves\u2019s wine-averse predecessors, Diet Coke-loving Rishi Sunak, the new system has been in place for more than a year now, with the transition from the previous regime initially smoothed by taxing all wines between 11.5% and 14.5% as if they were 12.5%. That \u201ceasement\u201d is due to come to an end in February, however, which would mean a 14.5% abv wine would incur a 67p premium over 11% bottles such as Waitrose\u2019s crisp, appley new Loire dry white.</p> <p><strong>Taste the Difference Ile de Beaut\u00e9 Ros\u00e9, Corsica, France 2023 (\u00a310, <a href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/\">Sainsbury\u2019s</a>) </strong>Under the new system, it makes sense for a producer looking to avoid incurring extra costs when they sell their wine in the UK to get their wines to as low an abv as possible. But that\u2019s not always conducive to quality. That\u2019s because, when winemakers pick their grapes, they are looking first and foremost for what is known as flavour ripeness: that moment when the compounds that give wine its complex flavours and textures have reached maturity. The longer the grapes take to get \u2018flavour ripe\u2019, the more sugar they accumulate, and the more sugar there is, the higher the alcohol after fermentation. But the ripening process is unpredictable, and changes according to the grape variety, location, vintage conditions (weather) and desired style. Some wines \u2013 such as the Waitrose chenin and the soft-pastel brushwork of Sainsbury\u2019s delicate 11% abv Corsican pink \u2013 hit their ripeness sweet spot with low levels of sugar (and alcohol). Others, however, will need far higher sugar (and therefore alcohol) if they\u2019re not to taste unripe (aka, in layman\u2019s terms, bad).</p> <p><strong>Cavit Cum Vineis Sclavis Schiava, Trentino, Italy 2022 (from \u00a313.99, <a href=\"http://allaboutwine.co.uk/\">allaboutwine.co.uk</a>) </strong>If picking with lower sugar before the grapes are properly \u201cflavour ripe\u201d is one way of getting lower alcohol levels, the other options are no more palatable.

      "bodyText": "Equilibriste Chenin Blanc, Loire, France 2023 (\u00a38.99, Waitrose) I\u2019m not sure if Rachel Reeves is a wine lover. And given the fuss she\u2019s made of the straitened circumstances of the public finances, I would in any case have been naive to think she might have cut the UK\u2019s famously high wine duty in her first Budget. But there is one aspect of the wine duty regime that I still hope she might fix: rethinking the introduction of a sliding scale where the duty increases with every 0.5% in the wine\u2019s abv. First cooked up by one of Reeves\u2019s wine-averse predecessors, Diet Coke-loving Rishi Sunak, the new system has been in place for more than a year now, with the transition from the previous regime initially smoothed by taxing all wines between 11.5% and 14.5% as if they were 12.5%. That \u201ceasement\u201d is due to come to an end in February, however, which would mean a 14.5% abv wine would incur a 67p premium over 11% bottles such as Waitrose\u2019s crisp, appley new Loire dry white. Taste the Difference Ile de Beaut\u00e9 Ros\u00e9, Corsica, France 2023 (\u00a310, Sainsbury\u2019s) Under the new system, it makes sense for a producer looking to avoid incurring extra costs when they sell their wine in the UK to get their wines to as low an abv as possible. But that\u2019s not always conducive to quality. That\u2019s because, when winemakers pick their grapes, they are looking first and foremost for what is known as flavour ripeness: that moment when the compounds that give wine its complex flavours and textures have reached maturity. The longer the grapes take to get \u2018flavour ripe\u2019, the more sugar they accumulate, and the more sugar there is, the higher the alcohol after fermentation. But the ripening process is unpredictable, and changes according to the grape variety, location, vintage conditions (weather) and desired style. Some wines \u2013 such as the Waitrose chenin and the soft-pastel brushwork of Sainsbury\u2019s delicate 11% abv Corsican pink \u2013 hit their ripeness sweet spot with low levels of sugar (and alcohol). Others, however, will need far higher sugar (and therefore alcohol) if they\u2019re not to taste unripe (aka, in layman\u2019s terms, bad). Cavit Cum Vineis Sclavis Schiava, Trentino, Italy 2022 (from \u00a313.99, allaboutwine.co.uk) If picking with lower sugar before the grapes are properly \u201cflavour ripe\u201d is one way of getting lower alcohol levels, the other options are no more palatable. Winemakers can choose not to ferment all the sugar to alcohol, they can dilute their vats of unfermented juice with water (permitted in Australia, the US and elsewhere, illegal but not uncommon in the EU), or they can use various techniques to \u201cde-alcoholise\u201d the wine, such as spinning cone vacuum steam distillation. The problem is that each of these methods tends to make wines which are either sweet or thin, or both \u2013 characteristics that are increasingly apparent in cheaper branded and supermarket own-label red wines made to beat the duty changes.

      "bodyText": "The final phase of the long-running inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has delved into the current operations and culture at the Post Office, as well as the issue of compensation payments to the hundreds of branch operators who were wrongly prosecuted. If the expectation was to find an organisation transformed \u2013 the reformation of a toxic culture, repair of the broken relations with staff and government and a well-oiled compensation process \u2013 testimony has shown that in many respects little, fundamentally, appears to have changed. Here are some of the key issues that have surfaced during the final two months of the judge-led inquiry. Operators still seen as \u2018guilty until proven innocent\u2019 The damning high court judgments handed down in 2019 \u2013 which paved the way for the eventual exoneration of 900 wrongful convictions linked to the Horizon IT scandal \u2013 was meant to provide the legal template for a reset of relations between the Post Office and branch owner-operators. However, former chair Henry Staunton, who was fired in January, claimed in evidence to the inquiry that many Post Office executives still view branch operators as \u201ccrooks\u201d who are \u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d. Saf Ismail and Elliott Jacobs, operators appointed to the state-owned company\u2019s board in 2021 as part of a plan to improve relations and oversight of the Post Office, gave scathing testimony. The pair, who were both later subjected to internal investigations, said Post Office executives did not want them on the board and that they were excluded from meetings. Ismail is still being investigated, for matters not relating to Horizon, and has said it would be inappropriate to comment while the process is under way. Post Office boss Nick Read has said that the investigation into shortfalls at branches owned by Jacobs, which found no wrongdoing, were \u201cheavy-handed\u201d. The inquiry also heard that cultural issues at the Post Office continue to extend well beyond relations and perceptions relating to branch operators. Former financial chief Alisdair Cameron, who officially left the company in June after a year of sick leave, said Read preferred to work with \u201cyounger, deferential, male\u201d colleagues, while very few senior and independent-minded colleagues, especially female, had \u201cthrived\u201d at the organisation. Read\u2019s multiple demands for his pay to be doubled overshadowed his pledge on appointment five years ago to \u201cright the wrongs of the past\u201d, with one former postal minister saying he was \u201cpaid lots whilst not doing a very good job\u201d. The inquiry also heard concerns about the ongoing employment of Post Office staff with links to the Horizon IT scandal, in particular those who continue to work in roles dealing with branch operators, such as in the investigations department. Read has said that no employee is \u201cabove the law\u201d and denied claims by several inquiry witnesses that he has said there are \u201cuntouchables\u201d in the organisation who will never face disciplinary action over the scandal. The Post Office is again looking at taking branch operators to court The Post Office stopped private prosecutions in 2015, after more than 900 operators were wrongly prosecuted over shortfalls resulting from the faulty Horizon IT system, a practice it has promised not to restart. However, the organisation continued to use the court system for the civil recovery of losses from branches until 2018. Following the judgments in 2019, it only pursues losses if there is an agreement with the branch owner, which has led to the organisation having to write off at least \u00a312m annually. The inquiry heard that the mounting losses have led to discussion within the Post Office of restarting court-led civil recovery, as well as other options, including deductions from operators\u2019 remuneration to recover losses over a period of time, another practice it used to implement. Another option the inquiry learned has been discussed is setting up a \u201closses pool\u201d to which all branch operators would contribute, to cover shortfalls across the 11,500-branch network. Alan Bates may take the Post Office to court again A key line of inquiry in the final phase has been to ascertain whether the Post Office has lived up to its commitment of \u201cfull and fair compensation\u201d for people affected. Approximately \u00a3363m has been paid to over 2,900 claimants across four schemes run by the government and the Post Office, according to the latest government figures to the end of September. Gareth Thomas, the postal minister, has admitted not all operators affected by the scandal will receive payouts by the March 2025 deadline called for by the campaigner Alan Bates. Bates, who leads the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance and has not yet resolved his own compensation claim, has said he is willing to launch legal action again if the process is not resolved more quickly. Former Post Office chair Staunton told the hearing that during his time in the role he had formed a view that the state-owned body had taken a bureaucratic, unsympathetic and adversarial approach primarily focused on saving taxpayers\u2019 money on payouts. At a government level, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservativer leader and former business secretary, provided damning evidence showing that it took the national frenzy sparked by the ITV drama on the Post Office scandal to get the Treasury to reverse a decision blocking funding for a plan to speed up compensation. The question of compensation looks set to rumble on: Thomas has said the government is looking at whether family members and employees of post office branch owners who have not been eligible to make claims may be allowed to apply. The Horizon IT system will be needed until the end of the decade The Post Office\u2019s relations with Fujitsu are at an all-time low and the inquiry was shown fiery emails between the two companies in a dispute over the use of data for criminal cases. However, its replacement system remains beset with bugs and faces ballooning costs. Paul Patterson, the chief executive of Fujitsu Europe, has said that Horizon is now so far beyond its planned end of life that \u201cwe have not turned off some of this equipment because it is so old [and might not start up again]\u201d. The New Branch IT system (NBIT) was meant to be deployed by March next year but is still only being tested in a handful of branches. Costs have soared from \u00a3180m to a reported \u00a31bn-plus and there are doubts about it ever being rolled out. As a result, the Post Office has been forced to extend its contract with Fujitsu, with the inquiry told that the two companies are likely to be forced to still be working together until March 2030. Patterson has said that any reluctant further extension would only be agreed with the removal of historical contractual clauses relating to \u201ccourt case support services provisions\u201d, as Fujitsu looks to distance itself from any further role in the legal use of Horizon data in the future. When will the findings of the inquiry be made public? After more than 1,000 days, the inquiry, which started on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2022, has now finished gathering witness testimony and written statements. The chair, Sir Wyn Williams, and his team have a prodigious amount of evidence to distil into a final report: about two million pages amassed from oral and written testimony from well over 500 witnesses during 175 days of hearings. After hearing closing statements over two days in December, the inquiry will officially draw to an end. It is hoped the findings will be published in 2025, although the inquiry has also heard suggestions that some witnesses may be called back early next year.",

Your writing voice is your public voice; it\u2019s your private voice that is more interesting to her. Reading someone\u2019s writing might feel like being once removed from them for her and she may want to be closer than that. Your writing is a vital part of you, but its importance doesn\u2019t need to be validated by your closest family to remain meaningful.

      "body": "<p><strong>The Yellow Bittern, 20 Caledonian Road, London N1 9DU (020 3342 2162). Starters \u00a37 \u2013 \u00a38; mains \u00a320 \u2013 \u00a328; desserts \u00a38 \u2013 \u00a39. Wines from \u00a340</strong></p> <p>Chefs gather in tribes. There are the tweezer chefs and the dude food chefs and the live-fire chefs, wisps of smoke forever rising from their singed eyebrows. Then there are the chef poets. They cleave to texts by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/12/richard-olney-french-cooking-provence\">Richard Olney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/08/elizabeth-david-first-lady-of-food\">Elizabeth David</a>, like mothers to their newborns. They perv over ingredients. They work backwards from the experience at the table into the kitchen, rather than from the kitchen outwards. And they adore a well-turned phrase. They are romantics.</p> <p>Belfast-born Hugh Corcoran is very much a chef poet; one who has even published his own <a href=\"https://www.luncheonmagazine.com/products/two-dozen-eggs\">volume of writing</a>. He often keeps his trousers up with braces, wears metal-rimmed spectacles and has about him the mien of a 1930s small-town butcher who has a lovely piece of gammon put aside for you. He has cooked in the Basque country and Paris as well as at pop-ups in London, where his pared-down dishes have won him a following. Now comes the Yellow Bittern, which is less a restaurant than a declaration of intent via the medium of lunch. It opens only on weekdays for two sittings, at noon and 2pm, and not at all for dinner. Bookings can only be made by phone or \u201cpostcard\u201d and they accept only cash. There is no printed wine list because \u201cit is all in Hugh\u2019s head\u201d, but the offering is entirely natural and runs from \u00a340 a bottle (and \u00a310 a glass) to \u00a3300.</p>    <p>The Yellow Bittern, named after an 18th-century Irish <a href=\"https://allpoetry.com/The-Yellow-Bittern-\">poem</a> about a bird who couldn\u2019t crack the ice with his beak to get a drink, occupies the King\u2019s Cross home of <em><a href=\"https://www.luncheonmagazine.com/\">Luncheon</a></em>, a biannual cultural magazine edited by Lady Frances von Hofmannsthal. Accordingly, there is a bookshop on-site which occupies an institutional space in the basement that looks like the library of a TB sanatorium circa 1936. Here are works by Seamus Heaney and Samuel Beckett just as, upstairs, in the sparse, yellow-walled dining room, which seats only 18, there hangs a photograph of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2014/mar/20/from-the-archive-brendan-behan\">Brendan Behan</a>, alongside a portrait of Lenin.</p> <p>This, according to one of Corcoran\u2019s Instagram posts, is a prized possession that goes everywhere with him, for he is a lifelong communist, devoted to many causes, including anti-colonialism in general and a United Ireland in particular. A recent Corcoran <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hugh__corcoran/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> post celebrating the founder of the Soviet Union as the \u201cliberator of the slaves\u201d was met with comments detailing Vladimir Ilyich\u2019s complicity in the murderous Red Terror and the founding of the gulags, among other things. How you engage with his politics, which might stick in the throat of some, is entirely up to you. You can just go for lunch, as Fergus and Margot Henderson, the chef poets-in-chief, have already done, along with many other chefs from across London. The day we are there, for example, another table is occupied by a party of cooks from Noma in Copenhagen. The Yellow Bittern had been open for just six working days and was already a point of pilgrimage.</p>    <p>The tiny dining room with its paper-clothed tables has a small open kitchen boasting a single oven and an induction ring. Laid out across the bar when we arrive, alongside a barrel of warm ale, are many baked goods: bricks of cloud-grey soda bread, neatly tucked guinea fowl pies for \u00a340 to be shared between two, and a huge glossy, quilted disc of apple pie for dessert. The limited menu is scribbled up on a blackboard and its best is delightful. That nutty soda bread is served with generous wedges of yellow butter that can be spread so thickly you can set your teeth marks into it. The butter is unsalted, but there\u2019s a dish of the white stuff on the table so you can add your own hypertension. Among the platters on the bar were shiny leaves of simmered leek, which we are told by Lady Frances in a whisper, were pulled from her country garden \u201conly yesterday\u201d. They arrive topped with a nose-twitching grain mustard vinaigrette, chopped boiled eggs and fresh green herbs, a version of the recipe in Simon Hopkinson and Lindsay Bareham\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/roast-chicken-and-other-stories-9780091871000/\">Roast Chicken and Other Stories</a></em>.</p>    <p>While I am enjoying that, I see Corcoran heave from the oven a joint of crackling-bodiced pork; a fabulous piece of meat, sensitively cooked, which is sliced thickly and plonked on top of a heap of white beans for \u00a328. At the end comes a wedge of that apple pie, which has that all-important third interface layer where the sweet stewed apple has merged with the pastry\u2019s inner thigh to create a grand sugar, fruit and butter softness. We have cheeses, too, including <a href=\"https://www.nealsyarddairy.co.uk/products/st-tola\">St Tola</a> goat\u2019s and a blue called <a href=\"https://www.thecourtyarddairy.co.uk/shop/buy-cheese/blue-cheese/buy-young-buck-blue-cheese/#:~:text=Creamy%2C%20smooth%2C%20blue.&amp;text=An%20outstanding%2C%20recent%2C%20raw%2D,An%20impressive%20debut%20cheese.&amp;text=Made%20by%20Michael%20Thomson%20of%20Mike's%20Fancy%20Cheese%20Co.\">Young Buck</a>, which softens the funking glass of natural red my companion orders.

A dreary leek and potato soup, thick as wallpaper paste for \u00a37, is served tepid. For the main there\u2019s a bowl of sausages and potatoes in broth listed as Dublin Coddle, a mellifluous name that cannot disguise the fact it\u2019s two bought-in Cumberland sausages, some potatoes and broth for \u00a320. The sludgy baked rice pudding is served cold. In its oval dish on the bar, it looked rather cheering; on the plate it looks like something your elderly cat might have coughed up. There is a fine line between celebrating simplicity and just not putting your back into it. Impressively, the Yellow Bittern walked both sides of that line across one lunch. A few days later, Corcoran complained on Instagram that diners weren\u2019t ordering enough. \u201cRestaurants are not public benches,\u201d he moaned. \u201cYou are there to spend some money.\u201d Perhaps open for dinner then, when people are happier to drink.</p>    <p>The comic thing about the whole venture is that it sells itself as cool and radical.

In effect, though, it plays as the small-c conservatism of John Major\u2019s wistful speech about a fantasy England of \u201cwarm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and \u2013 as George Orwell said \u2013 old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Yellow Bittern, 20 Caledonian Road, London N1 9DU (020 3342 2162). Starters \u00a37 \u2013 \u00a38; mains \u00a320 \u2013 \u00a328; desserts \u00a38 \u2013 \u00a39. Wines from \u00a340 Chefs gather in tribes. There are the tweezer chefs and the dude food chefs and the live-fire chefs, wisps of smoke forever rising from their singed eyebrows. Then there are the chef poets. They cleave to texts by Richard Olney and Elizabeth David, like mothers to their newborns. They perv over ingredients. They work backwards from the experience at the table into the kitchen, rather than from the kitchen outwards. And they adore a well-turned phrase. They are romantics. Belfast-born Hugh Corcoran is very much a chef poet; one who has even published his own volume of writing. He often keeps his trousers up with braces, wears metal-rimmed spectacles and has about him the mien of a 1930s small-town butcher who has a lovely piece of gammon put aside for you. He has cooked in the Basque country and Paris as well as at pop-ups in London, where his pared-down dishes have won him a following. Now comes the Yellow Bittern, which is less a restaurant than a declaration of intent via the medium of lunch. It opens only on weekdays for two sittings, at noon and 2pm, and not at all for dinner. Bookings can only be made by phone or \u201cpostcard\u201d and they accept only cash. There is no printed wine list because \u201cit is all in Hugh\u2019s head\u201d, but the offering is entirely natural and runs from \u00a340 a bottle (and \u00a310 a glass) to \u00a3300. The Yellow Bittern, named after an 18th-century Irish poem about a bird who couldn\u2019t crack the ice with his beak to get a drink, occupies the King\u2019s Cross home of Luncheon, a biannual cultural magazine edited by Lady Frances von Hofmannsthal. Accordingly, there is a bookshop on-site which occupies an institutional space in the basement that looks like the library of a TB sanatorium circa 1936. Here are works by Seamus Heaney and Samuel Beckett just as, upstairs, in the sparse, yellow-walled dining room, which seats only 18, there hangs a photograph of Brendan Behan, alongside a portrait of Lenin. This, according to one of Corcoran\u2019s Instagram posts, is a prized possession that goes everywhere with him, for he is a lifelong communist, devoted to many causes, including anti-colonialism in general and a United Ireland in particular. A recent Corcoran Instagram post celebrating the founder of the Soviet Union as the \u201cliberator of the slaves\u201d was met with comments detailing Vladimir Ilyich\u2019s complicity in the murderous Red Terror and the founding of the gulags, among other things. How you engage with his politics, which might stick in the throat of some, is entirely up to you. You can just go for lunch, as Fergus and Margot Henderson, the chef poets-in-chief, have already done, along with many other chefs from across London. The day we are there, for example, another table is occupied by a party of cooks from Noma in Copenhagen. The Yellow Bittern had been open for just six working days and was already a point of pilgrimage. The tiny dining room with its paper-clothed tables has a small open kitchen boasting a single oven and an induction ring. Laid out across the bar when we arrive, alongside a barrel of warm ale, are many baked goods: bricks of cloud-grey soda bread, neatly tucked guinea fowl pies for \u00a340 to be shared between two, and a huge glossy, quilted disc of apple pie for dessert. The limited menu is scribbled up on a blackboard and its best is delightful. That nutty soda bread is served with generous wedges of yellow butter that can be spread so thickly you can set your teeth marks into it. The butter is unsalted, but there\u2019s a dish of the white stuff on the table so you can add your own hypertension. Among the platters on the bar were shiny leaves of simmered leek, which we are told by Lady Frances in a whisper, were pulled from her country garden \u201conly yesterday\u201d. They arrive topped with a nose-twitching grain mustard vinaigrette, chopped boiled eggs and fresh green herbs, a version of the recipe in Simon Hopkinson and Lindsay Bareham\u2019s Roast Chicken and Other Stories. While I am enjoying that, I see Corcoran heave from the oven a joint of crackling-bodiced pork; a fabulous piece of meat, sensitively cooked, which is sliced thickly and plonked on top of a heap of white beans for \u00a328. At the end comes a wedge of that apple pie, which has that all-important third interface layer where the sweet stewed apple has merged with the pastry\u2019s inner thigh to create a grand sugar, fruit and butter softness. We have cheeses, too, including St Tola goat\u2019s and a blue called Young Buck, which softens the funking glass of natural red my companion orders.

      "body": "<p>The reason Donald Trump won is because he exemplifies men who think only of themselves. Civic responsibility is about caring for others, for everyone, not just oneself, and the easiest way to defeat democracy is to limit access to civic education, which is what has happened in the US public schools over the last 40 years. </p> <p>The people who support Trump are not less smart, but they are truly less well educated in these basic principles. It is this that makes it possible for them to abandon the morality of civil society. As for the women who support Trump, I am dumbfounded. All his supporters have voted against their own interests. They will lose their health care and there will be inflation due to tariffs that will make it even harder for them to make the mortgage.<br><strong>Margot Miller</strong><br>Easton, Maryland, US</p> <p>Simon Tisdall has it right (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/09/contempt-human-rights-trashing-allies-donald-trump-election-populists\">Contempt for human rights, trashing allies: the world\u2019s populists are rubbing their hands with glee</a>\u201d, Comment). I\u2019m tired of reading how Trump\u2019s victory is due to the failure of the Democrats\u2019 campaign or that people voted for him because they felt ignored or because of rising prices.</p> <p>They voted for him because they didn\u2019t care that he was a mendacious, racist, misogynist, corrupt, ignorant, narcissistic conman and felon. They decided to ignore reality and live in a fantasy where all that was lies. Trump doesn\u2019t care about for those who voted for him, and he will seek vengeance on all those who didn\u2019t.

In his book, <em>Bullshit Jobs: A Theory</em>, US anthropologist David Graeber lays bare the absurdity and redundancy of most modern graduates\u2019 roles in the workplace. It makes the case that in the west we have bred a generation or two of people whose jobs do not produce anything tangible, nor meet any real need, and who are paid a fortune. </p> <p>It&nbsp;is no surprise that there\u2019s a backlash against this class of effectively useless, even parasitic, people.

Importantly, students also have a voice, via the National Student Survey and student organisations. Falling behind on any of these measures has serious consequences, particularly for the bottom line, and so there is real accountability in the system.</p> <p>What we can\u2019t do is solve graduate underemployment and the burden of the student loan system. Without more graduate jobs, university leavers will continue to find the job market over-competitive and disappointing. Without more public investment in further and higher education and an overhaul of the fees system, the burden of funding will continue to fall disproportionately on students.

Animal farming is one of the major sources of emissions, and so the increasing consumption of animal produce, encouraged by enormous subsidies, is part of the problem.

      "bodyText": "The reason Donald Trump won is because he exemplifies men who think only of themselves. Civic responsibility is about caring for others, for everyone, not just oneself, and the easiest way to defeat democracy is to limit access to civic education, which is what has happened in the US public schools over the last 40 years. The people who support Trump are not less smart, but they are truly less well educated in these basic principles. It is this that makes it possible for them to abandon the morality of civil society. As for the women who support Trump, I am dumbfounded. All his supporters have voted against their own interests. They will lose their health care and there will be inflation due to tariffs that will make it even harder for them to make the mortgage. Margot Miller Easton, Maryland, US Simon Tisdall has it right (\u201cContempt for human rights, trashing allies: the world\u2019s populists are rubbing their hands with glee\u201d, Comment). I\u2019m tired of reading how Trump\u2019s victory is due to the failure of the Democrats\u2019 campaign or that people voted for him because they felt ignored or because of rising prices. They voted for him because they didn\u2019t care that he was a mendacious, racist, misogynist, corrupt, ignorant, narcissistic conman and felon. They decided to ignore reality and live in a fantasy where all that was lies. Trump doesn\u2019t care about for those who voted for him, and he will seek vengeance on all those who didn\u2019t. Trump doesn\u2019t serve anybody but himself. Kevin Porter Wolverhampton Peter Hyman\u2019s piece about Trump\u2019s victory (\u201cWe can rage about Donald Trump. Or we can be curious about why he appealed to so many\u201d, Comment) raises important points for middle-class people working in white-collar jobs. Specifically, the laughable idea that those of us with degrees are somehow above working-class \u201cpeople who can actually change a flat tyre\u201d. In his book, Bullshit Jobs: A Theory, US anthropologist David Graeber lays bare the absurdity and redundancy of most modern graduates\u2019 roles in the workplace. It makes the case that in the west we have bred a generation or two of people whose jobs do not produce anything tangible, nor meet any real need, and who are paid a fortune. It is no surprise that there\u2019s a backlash against this class of effectively useless, even parasitic, people. I should know, I\u2019m describing myself and my work situation. Tom Cole London N13 Universities are accountable Far from universities being left to mark their own homework, Sonia Sodha can rest assured that there is no shortage of people to check our working (\u201cEngland\u2019s universities flex their muscles to hike fees, while students get a bum deal\u201d, Comment). As well as external examiners, accrediting bodies, the Office for Students and the Teaching Excellence Framework scrutinising teaching quality, we also have myriad league tables rating us on factors such as graduate employability. Importantly, students also have a voice, via the National Student Survey and student organisations. Falling behind on any of these measures has serious consequences, particularly for the bottom line, and so there is real accountability in the system. What we can\u2019t do is solve graduate underemployment and the burden of the student loan system. Without more graduate jobs, university leavers will continue to find the job market over-competitive and disappointing. Without more public investment in further and higher education and an overhaul of the fees system, the burden of funding will continue to fall disproportionately on students. Guaranteeing highly paid graduate jobs for all is impossible under current conditions and to pin the problem on \u201clow-quality courses\u201d is to let the government off the hook. Dr Phil Bull Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester Cop29 and farm emissions It is shocking and depressing that global greenhouse gas emissions are still rising after so many pledges to cut them (Global boiling, mass flooding and Trump: 10 big talking points for Cop29, News). Animal farming is one of the major sources of emissions, and so the increasing consumption of animal produce, encouraged by enormous subsidies, is part of the problem. At Cop29, the UK should be arguing the case for a worldwide ban on these subsidies, which could free up funding to subsidise the production of fruits, vegetables and pulses. A shift in consumption would benefit the climate, reduce the pressure on the rainforest and other natural spaces, reduce water pollution, improve our health and mean that fewer animals were forced to endure the misery of farming and slaughter. Iain Green, Director, Animal Aid Tonbridge, Kent Stamping out vaping Martha Gill offers a cautionary tale that Australia\u2019s 2021 prescription-only vapes policy saw low uptake of prescription vapes and a rise in smoking, citing 2022 data (\u201cIn the moral panic over vaping, we risk forgetting that cigarettes kill\u201d, Comment). The policy was gutted by a conservative backbench revolt, which allowed vapers to import vapes at will and homeopathic levels of prosecution for ex-pharmacy vape sales. Why buy from a pharmacy when every second convenience store sold vapes openly? In 2024, the Labor government banned all imports and introduced high fines for selling from 1 October. Illicit vapes prices have tripled, knocking out most teenage access. Simon Chapman, Emeritus Professor of Public Health, University of Sydney Moor money for royals Every owner of every boat moored on rivers in Cornwall and parts of Devon pays fundus; rental for the patch of riverbed owned by the Duchy of Cornwall over which the boats bob around (\u201cHow long will we stomach sermons from royals made rich by their own charities?\u201d, Comment). Pete Mitchell Ventnor, Isle of Wight Reinventing repairables It seems there really is nothing new under the sun (\u201cUK student invents repairable kettle that anyone can fix\u201d, News). I\u2019m sure older readers will remember that in the 1970s electric kettles were easily repairable and spare parts available. If the heating element failed, it was a simple matter to unscrew it and fit a new one. Fred Pickering Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire The bee\u2019s knees Anyone wanting to avoid adulterated honey needs only to come to my little village where our general store stocks four varieties of pure local honey, produced by bees kept in the village in the care of four resident beekeepers (\u201cNine in ten honey samples from UK retailers fail authenticity test, News). Can any other village match our ratio of one beekeeper to roughly 100 people? Nigel Melville Abbotsbury, Dorset Here come the Pipkins\u2026 Professor Dean should not be too disappointed that his name was not adopted by a pop star (\u201cElton who?\u201d, Letters). He can console himself in the knowledge that for a generation of children who grew up watching Pipkins, Hartley Hare was far more memorable. Michael Smith Artane, Dublin",

      "bodyText": "With that, we will wrap the blog for the afternoon. Rest assured, though \u2013 we\u2019ll be back first thing tomorrow for the second last sitting week of the year (yay). Here are today\u2019s major developments: The defence minister, Richard Marles, has announced closer military cooperation with Japan and the United States. Marles, who is acting prime minister, said Japan\u2019s amphibious rapid deployment brigade would now be regularly deployed to Darwin, where it would work with Australian and US forces. Bushfires have destroyed at least one home and killed livestock in Victoria\u2019s west. The state\u2019s emergency management commissioner said soaring temperatures and high winds on Saturday caused 80 fires, five considered significant. A 68-year-old man who went missing after diving into the Nepean River south of Penrith on Saturday has been found dead. A 20-year-old pilot and his two teenage passengers have been identified as the three people killed in a light plane crash in eastern Victoria on Saturday evening. The plane was seen circling in east Gippsland before crashing into a paddock and bursting into flames. And the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has hailed \u201cinclusive trade and investment\u201d at the Apec forum in Peru where leaders are attempting to push against the protectionist policies favoured by US president-elect Donald Trump. Wild weather continues to pummel NSW and Victoria A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for damaging winds and large hailstones over central parts of New South Wales. Communities in Parkes, Nyngan, Young, West Wyalong, Cobar and Brewarrina are being urged to move cars under cover, secure loose items, stay away from fallen power lines and remain indoors. Severe thunderstorms are no longer occurring in the Riverina district, where a warning has been cancelled. The Bureau of Meteorology said the storms would continue over the \u201cnext several hours\u201d. A surface trough ahead of a vigorous cold front is producing severe thunderstorms over southern NSW. This activity is expected to shift quickly towards the east this afternoon and evening. Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds with large hailstones possible in the warning area over the next several hours. In Victoria, heavy rainfall and damaging winds are hitting the north-east ranges, and damaging winds also possible for the south-west coast. Flash flooding is possible, with isolated fall totals expected to hit 80mm and peak gusts exceeding 100 km/h at Warrnambool, Portland, Corryong, Bright, Falls Creek and Omeo. Children rescued after multiple sail boats capsize in Victoria Dozens of children have been rescued after their sailing boats capsized in strong wind at Port Melbourne this morning. More than 60 people, mainly children, competing in a regatta set sail in boats from Williamstown when strong winds forced them overboard into rough waters. Police were called to assist the children, who were stranded in shipping channel waters just after 11.15am. The channel was swiftly closed while police on jetskis, a Life Saving Victoria rescue chopper and the St Kilda coast guard launched a rescue. The children, all wearing lifejackets, were safely brought back to land. PM \u2018very confident\u2019 Australian exporters won\u2019t be slugged with heavy US trade tariffs Anthony Albanese is seeking to reassure Australian exporters about the fate of their businesses under an incoming US Trump administration. He insists he is confident they will be spared up to 20% tariffs that the president-elect is threatening to impose. The prime minister told ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday that he did not expect any US move to slap tariffs on incoming goods to include imports from Australia. I\u2019m very confident. We will put forward Australia\u2019s national interest. I don\u2019t want to pre-empt those decisions, but we\u2019ll advocate for Australia\u2019s national interest. That\u2019s my job to do so, because one in four jobs in Australia is trade-dependent, and that\u2019s why we benefit from it. Homeless support workers forced to turn away people fleeing violence or living in cars due to cost-of-living crisis, report finds Homelessness services are being forced to turn people away and leave phone calls unanswered, according to a report outlining the impact of Australia\u2019s housing and cost-of-living crises. As AAP reports, a Homelessness Australia and Impact Economics report makes an \u201curgent\u201d call to the government to beef up support for frontline services. Here\u2019s how Homelessness Australia\u2019s chief executive, Kate Colvin, put it: The housing crisis has just become an absolute housing emergency and homelessness support services are just buckling under pressure. Colvin said they had been unable to identify how many people were being turned away because services were so under pressure. She said deciding who received a bed each night was a distressing situation for support workers: Do you say yes to the mum with two small kids who has no where to go that night, or to another mum who has a car? And then there\u2019s a young guy, only 20 years old, who has run away for a violent home, who do they say no to in that situation? US defence secretary says trilateral training with Australian and Japanese troops will strengthen each nation The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, says Japan\u2019s decision to join \u201cannual trilateral amphibious training\u201d with Australia and the US in Darwin will further strengthen the capabilities of all three nations. Here\u2019s what Austin said at a press conference in Darwin earlier today: Today, more than ever, we\u2019re taking concrete actions that will deepen our trilateral cooperation. The three of us are here to see the results first-hand. Darwin is a focal point for our expanding trilateral relationship, and our bond is delivering real security, deterrence and interoperability. We will continue to grow our trilateral intelligence sharing and to increase our surveillance and reconnaissance activities. \u2018Violent altercation\u2019 broke out on Newcastle nightlife strip before man, 22, stabbed to death, police allege NSW Police will investigate an alleged altercation that broke out before a 22-year-old man died from \u201csignificant stab wounds\u201d in Newcastle in the early hours of Sunday morning. Officers were called to Beaumont Street in Hamilton, a suburb of Newcastle, about 2.40am after reports of a stabbing. NSW police superintendent Kylie Endemi said the man was a Newcastle resident: We know so far that a violent altercation did occur between this young man and a group of people on Beaumont Street at Hamilton. The circumstances leading up to that altercation and what transpired during that incident are still very much under investigation. So far, no one has been charged. Endemi called for anyone who saw the altercation on a busy nightlife strip to contact police or crime stoppers. Officers have been working extremely hard throughout the day, obtaining evidence and information to assist us in identifying what led to this young man\u2019s death. Please come forward and help our investigators find out who is responsible for this terrible incident. David Crisafulli stares down LNP division on abortion and nuclear power The Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, has told Liberal National party members the party \u201cdoes not exist for culture wars\u201d in an address seeking to stare down potential division about his positions on abortion rights and nuclear power. Crisafulli\u2019s speech to the LNP state council meeting in Rockhampton on Sunday was his first opportunity to speak directly to the organisational wing and party members since last month\u2019s state election victory. Despite the election success, LNP sources say there remains consternation in the ranks about the way the party handled divisive issues, including abortion and nuclear power, where the views of the grassroots membership \u2013 and the private views of many MPs \u2013 are at odds with Crisafulli\u2019s promises not to change existing laws. The premier did not directly mention either issue. But his speech to members hinted at \u201cscare campaigns\u201d by Labor during the election and said these would not work in four years if the party kept its word. One thing I can guarantee you about me \u2026 that is my word counts for something and I value a culture when you say you\u2019re going to do something you do it, and when you say you won\u2019t do something, you won\u2019t do it. That\u2019s how we keep faith. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do in the next four years. A 20-year-old pilot and his two teenage passengers have been identified as the three people killed in a light plane crash in eastern Victoria. The plane was seen circling at Tinamba West in east Gippsland before crashing into a paddock and bursting into flames at about 5.45pm on Saturday, Victoria Police said. The three people onboard were boys aged 15 and 16 from Tongala in central Victoria and the pilot from Tinamba West, police said. Edge Aviation founder and chief flying instructor Lorraine MacGillivray said the pilot worked as a flight instructor. She spoke to AAP: I saw a couple of the family members and like you\u2019d expect, with any families, they are devastated and trying to come to terms with what\u2019s occurred. In communities in regional areas like this, there are a lot of people that know each other and stuff like that, so there\u2019s a significant ripple effect, I understand going through those communities. MacGillivray said it would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the crash and the tragedy had also affected the aviation community. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the crash, describing the plane as an \u201camateur-built light aircraft\u201d. \u2013 AAP The defence minister, Richard Marles, is holding a press conference in Darwin, where he is announcing closer military cooperation with Japan and the United States. Marles, who is acting prime minister while Anthony Albanese is in South America for international summits, said Japan\u2019s amphibious rapid deployment brigade will now be regularly deployed to Darwin, where it will work with Australian and US forces. This is a very important statement to the region, and to the world, about the commitment that our three countries have in working with each other. This is going to build interoperability between our three countries. Marles said the increased cooperation between the three nations would \u201cprovide an assertion of the global rules-based order, which all of our countries are so deeply committed to\u201d. \u2018Watch and act\u2019 fire warnings for residents in Chetwynd and Kadnook Two out-of-control bushfires in Victoria have forced townships to evacuate and destroyed at least one home as parts of Australia\u2019s east remain on alert for fires, wild winds and storms. Firefighters were on Sunday morning working to contain the fires in Victoria\u2019s west, with flash flooding and heavy rainfall possible in the state\u2019s north-east, south-east New South Wales and north-east Tasmania. Residents of the Australian Capital Territory and potentially parts of Sydney are expected to be battered over the next 48 hours. In Victoria, \u201cwatch and act\u201d fire warnings were in place for residents at Chetwynd and Kadnook near the Grampians and 10 communities in the Otway ranges at the start of the Great Ocean Road, including Lavers Hill, where it remained unsafe to return. Victoria\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Rick Nugget, said it was an \u201cincredibly challenging day\u201d for the state, particularly in the west and south-west. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has provided an update on this weekend\u2019s bushfires across the state, urging households to prepare their fire plan ahead of summer. Posting to X, she thanked everyone involved in protecting Victorians through \u201cchallenging conditions\u201d. A Total Fire Ban has been declared for the Wimmera until midnight tonight. The Great Ocean Road has reopened this morning after being closed in both directions. Multiple \u2018watch and act\u2019 warnings remain in place across the state and today, and a \u2018severe weather warning\u2019 is also in place for heavy rainfall and damaging winds in north east. Allan warned if Victorians hadn\u2019t prepared for summer \u2013 \u201cnow is the time to do so\u201d. I implore you to make a fire plan today. Yesterday we saw conditions uncommon for November - you never know when you may need it. Injuries during first weekend of schoolies at Surfers Paradise Thousands of teenagers celebrating schoolies on the Gold Coast are as \u201csafe as they can be\u201d, Queensland\u2019s police minister says, as the marathon of parties and excessive drinking gets under way. But there have been some injuries during the first weekend of festivities at Surfers Paradise. Gold Coast Safety Response was visited by almost 10,000 school leavers picking up a wristband for events on Saturday, the first day of celebrations. Queensland Ambulance Service said 16 patients have been assessed so far at an emergency treatment centre, one of whom was taken to hospital. Police minister Dan Purdie told the media there was \u201cno safer place for our young people to be in Surfers Paradise\u201d while at the celebrations on Saturday evening. School leavers will also flock to the Sunshine Coast, Airlie Beach and Byron Bay during the nationwide celebrations, which run until 1 December. Pill testing will go ahead at the Gold Coast event after the Liberal National government backtracked on plans to dump the service. \u2013AAP. A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for southern New South Wales, including damaging winds and large hailstones as a \u201cvigorous cold front\u201d moves east. The Bureau of Meteorology: A surface trough ahead of a vigorous cold front is producing severe thunderstorms over southern NSW. This activity is expected to shift quickly towards the east this afternoon and evening. Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds and large hailstones in the warning area over the next several hours. Locations which may be affected include Griffith, Narrandera, Lake Cargelligo, Lockhart and Darlington Point. The State Emergency Service has advised residents to secure loose items, move cars away from trees and stay indoors and away from windows. A 68-year-old man who went missing after diving into the Nepean River south of Penrith on Saturday has been found dead. Police were called to Nortons Basin at Mulgoa, about 20km south of Penrith, about 11am on Saturday. They were told the man had jumped into the river to retrieve his fishing rod but didn\u2019t resurface. A search was launched on Saturday before being called off at 5.30pm. The search, including police divers, resumed at 9am on Sunday. The man\u2019s body was discovered at 10.40am. A report will be prepared for the coroner. Man in his 20s dead after stabbing in Newcastle A man has died after being stabbed in Newcastle this morning. NSW Police say they were called to Beaumont Street in Hamilton about 2.40am and found a man in his 20s with stab wounds. NSW Ambulance paramedics treated the man before he was taken to hospital, where he later died. The man is yet to be formally identified. Police have established a crime scene and commenced an investigation, with the assistance of the State Crime Command\u2019s homicide squad. Police have asked anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Outer-suburb university students to get new study hubs to boost participation University students living in fast-growing Australian outer suburbs will have greater access to campuses after the federal government unveiled the first 10 suburban study hubs. The Universities Accord recommended the hubs to boost participation among underrepresented groups outside major capital cities by providing support and campus-style resources closer to home. Currently, 41 are operating regionally, supporting about 4,500 students, with five more expected to open by the first semester of 2025. Victoria will have new hubs in Broadmeadows, Epping and Melton, while NSW will welcome centres in Macquarie Fields and Kurri Kurri. Elizabeth in South Australia, Strathpine in Queensland, Sorrell in Tasmania and Western Australia\u2019s Armadale, Ellenbrook and Mandurah will also have hubs. All 10 are expected to welcome students by mid-2025. The minister for education, Jason Clare, said almost one in two young people in their 20s and 30s had a university degree but not in Australia\u2019s outer suburbs or regions. That\u2019s why we are doubling the number of University Study Hubs, to bring universities closer to them. We know they work. The evidence is they increase the number of people going to uni and finishing a uni degree. Now for the first time, we are putting these University Study Hubs in the outer suburbs. Measles alert after infectious case visits Sydney service station, pub and medical centre NSW Health has urged people in Sydney\u2019s inner west to be alert for symptoms of measles after a confirmed case visited several locations while infectious. The acting director of public health at the Sydney local health district, Dr Isabel Hess, said people who had been to the below destinations should be aware of symptoms. Metro Petroleum Enmore Road, 379 Enmore Rd, Enmore, on Thursday 7 November 2024 between 6.15am and 7am. Philter Brewing Public Bar, 92-98 Sydenham Rd, Marrickville, on Thursday 7 November 2024 between 6.30pm and 10pm. Marrickville Medical Centre, 5/296 Marrickville Rd, Marrickville, on Sunday 10 November 2024 between 9.15am and 11am. Hess said people who had visited these locations should watch for \u201cfever, sore eyes and a cough, usually followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the head and face to the rest of the body\u201d: It can take up to 18 days for symptoms to appear after an exposure, so it\u2019s important for people who visited these locations to look out for symptoms up until 28 November 2024. Anyone who develops symptoms should call ahead to their GP or emergency department and say that they may have measles to ensure they do not spend time in the waiting room with other patients. Liberals concede defeat in Black byelection in Adelaide\u2019s south Labor has won South Australia\u2019s Black byelection after a massive swing against the Liberals, which were trying to hold the Adelaide seat after former opposition leader David Speirs\u2019 resignation. The result adds to the majority of Peter Malinauskas\u2019 government. It is a blow to the Liberals and new opposition leader, Vincent Tarzia, after the party suffered a byelection loss in Dunstan earlier in 2024. Labor\u2019s Alex Dighton had received 60% of the two-candidate preferred vote against the Liberals\u2019 Amanda Wilson at the close of counting on Saturday night. Tarzia conceded defeat, telling the party faithful that \u201cunfortunately, it hasn\u2019t been our night\u201d after Labor\u2019s \u201ceffective, short, hard\u201d campaign. We\u2019ve got to be better, we\u2019ve got to be united, we\u2019ve got to be focused, we\u2019ve got to be disciplined and we\u2019ve got 16 months to turn it around. Japanese forces to train with Australian and US troops in NT Japanese troops will join US Marine rotations in the Northern Territory as the three nations deepen defence ties in a bid to counter China\u2019s military strength. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, will on Sunday host the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Japanese defence minister, Nakatani Gen, for the trilateral ministers\u2019 meeting in Darwin \u2013 the first to be held in Australia. Marles, also defence minister, said after annual \u201c2+2\u201d talks with his Japanese counterpart in September, both nations looked to how they could build greater familiarity between their defence forces: We have spoken to Japan about having their amphibious rapid deployment brigade doing training with our own defence force, with our own army, and with the US Marines. Having a more forward-leaning opportunity for greater training with Japan and the US together is a really fantastic opportunity. AAP Hundreds of Victorians call for help as storms lash state Wild weather has led to more than 70 requests for help from the Victorian State Emergency Service in Shepparton, in the state\u2019s north-east. The state\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Rick Nugent, has just provided details at a press conference: Storms with hail and lightning have started to impact across the state. 70 requests for assistance have been received in Shepparton alone and that relates to building damage, fallen trees and downed power lines. Over 200 requests for assistance have been received over the last 24 hours right across the state. A severe weather warning is in place for the state\u2019s north-east. Keris Arndt, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said conditions could worsen. We have seen significant storm activity through parts of central Victoria and Shepparton in particular. These storms are moving eastwards and a band of rain is starting to impact the ranges. We are expecting that rain to increase this morning and become quite heavy. Bushfire in Victoria\u2019s west to turn \u2018dynamic\u2019 as winds increase, warns CFA A bushfire near Kadnook in Victoria\u2019s west will be difficult to extinguish, says the Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer, Jason Heffernan. Hundreds of firefighters remain on the ground across Victoria seeking to suppress those fires that started yesterday. Heffernan said the Kadnook fire was burning in blue gum plantations with undulating terrain, making it challenging for firefighters to contain. It is not safe to return. Firefighters are conducting assessments, particularly around dangerous trees. So we do ask the community to refrain from getting into that area. It will be dynamic this afternoon when those winds continue to pick up. Heffernan said he expects the blaze near Chapple Vale, which has burnt more than 700 hectares, to continue to burn for \u201cquite some time\u201d. Bushfires have destroyed at least one home and killed livestock in Victoria\u2019s west, authorities have confirmed. The state\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Rick Nugent, said soaring temperatures and high winds on Saturday caused 80 fires, five of which are considered significant. We still have two fires that are not yet under control. Watch and act warnings remain in place for those two fires. In Chapple Vale, over 700 hectares has been burnt. In Kadnook, where 1250 hectares has been burnt. Nugent confirmed one home had been destroyed in the Kadnook fire. We also believe possibly two more homes have been lost and we will continue to do assessments and confirm in due course. There are stock and agricultural losses in those areas and our teams will continue to make assessments of the impact throughout the day. A community fire refuge is also activated for our community in the Lavers Hill area. The Great Ocean Road was closed from around 10:30pm until 4am, due to the risk of fire and smoke impacting on people travelling in that area. Greens lash PM for not guaranteeing 2035 emission target release before election The Greens have criticised the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for not guaranteeing the release of the government\u2019s 2035 emission reduction target at a major climate summit and before the next federal election. In an interview with ABC\u2019s Insiders this morning, Albanese was asked whether his government could match the UK\u2019s 2035 commitment to cut emissions by 81% on 1990 levels. He replied: I\u2019ll leave each nation state to do their [nationally determined contribution] and to put forward their targets. We have got a target that we introduced when we came into office. As part of the Paris Agreement, Australia is due to submit its 2035 target at some stage next year. When asked whether the target would be revealed before the next federal election, which is due by late May, Albanese said: Our focus is on achieving the 2030 target. 2030 comes before 2035. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has issued a statement calling on the government to reveal the 2035 target at the COP29 summit in Azerbaijan: With Donald Trump now US [president-elect] and Peter Dutton spruiking nuclear here, Labor must stop lifting emissions and join the UK in pushing for strong action by 2035, otherwise we won\u2019t stop global warming. The only 2035 target consistent with a safe climate is net zero. At the climate summit, Labor must match and raise the UK\u2019s climate ambition and give voters peace of mind that this government takes climate change seriously. NSW emergency services are continuing search for a man who disappeared after jumping into the Nepean River, south of Penrith. Police were called to the Nortons Basin at Mulgoa, about 20km south of Penrith, about 11am on Saturday. They were told the 68-year-old man jumped into the river to retrieve his fishing rod but didn\u2019t resurface. The search was suspended about 5.30pm on Saturday and resumed at 9am today. So far, the search involves police, the state emergency service, fire and rescue and paramedics. Police divers are expected to assist later today. Billionaire mining magnate backs fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty as \u2018only solution\u2019 to climate crisis and rising energy costs The Australian billionaire mining magnate, Andrew Forrest, has backed a global push for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty, declaring the perpetrators of the climate crisis will be \u201cmore and more exposed to the wrath of society\u201d. The push for a treaty to end fossil fuel development has slowly gained momentum, with support from 14 countries, including Colombia and several vulnerable island states, the European parliament, the World Health Organization, 25 banks and more than 3,000 scientists. Forrest announced he was backing the treaty while attending the Cop29 UN climate summit in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku. He has become a vocal investor in and advocate for clean energy and called for countries and businesses to aim for \u201creal zero\u201d greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating fossil fuels, Forrest said global emissions continued to rise despite nearly 200 countries supporting a transition away from fossil fuels at last year\u2019s Cop28 summit in Dubai. I stand in solidarity with the Pacific Island nations and pledge my support to them, both as a business leader and philanthropist. Devastating hurricanes and flooding across the world are causing unprecedented economic damage and mortality, all due to our warming oceans \u2026The only solution that can bring our energy costs down and decarbonise the planet at the same time is to stop burning fossil fuels. The fortnight-long UN climate summit is due to finish on Friday. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, is attending the second week.

Six-hourly rainfall totals of 30 to 60mm are likely, with isolated totals up to 80mm possible. 24-hourly rainfall totals of 60 to 80mm are likely, with isolated falls of 100mm possible. A separate severe thunderstorm warning will be issued if very dangerous thunderstorms with intense rainfall are detected. In the alpine region, 131 km/h wind gusts were recorded at Mount Hotham and Mount Buller this morning. Falls Creek recorded a 104km/h gust at 7.20am. It\u2019s a different story in the state\u2019s west, where bushfire \u201cwatch and act\u201d warnings are in place. Rudd\u2019s US appointment \u2018sign of how seriously we take this relationship\u2019, PM says The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has now repeated his declaration that Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Kevin Rudd, won\u2019t be going anywhere. On Sky News, Albanese agreed that Rudd would still be in the job a year from now. On ABC\u2019s Insiders, Albanese went further: He\u2019s Australia\u2019s appointment. It says something about the importance of the United States that we have appointed a former prime minister. That\u2019s a sign of how seriously we take this relationship, which is a relationship between our peoples, based upon our common values. Anthony Albanese says Kevin Rudd will remain Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington and is doing \u201ca very good job\u201d. Asked on Sunday if Rudd would still be in the job a year from now, Albanese responded: \u201cYes.\u201d The work that he did with Aukus was a difficult task to get that through the Congress and the Senate. But when I was there, one of the things that struck me was just how extensive the links that Kevin Rudd had developed \u2026 at the US Congress and the Senate. He said Rudd had been \u201ca very good ambassador\u201d and \u201ccontinues to do the job\u201d: He has developed relationships across the political spectrum in the United States, as I expect any ambassador to do, and that\u2019s why he received praise from people such as Tony Abbott, as well as Malcolm Turnbull, as well as Peter Dutton, for the job that he\u2019s been doing. Trump promises PM \u2018perfect friendship\u2019 but tariff exemption for Australia not discussed The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says he didn\u2019t directly ask the incoming US president, Donald Trump, to exempt Australia from a new tariffs regime. Trump has flagged tariffs of between 10 and 20% on imports to the US and up to 60% on Chinese goods. Here\u2019s the exchange on ABC\u2019s Insiders with host David Speers a short time ago: David Speers: \u201cDid you ask Donald Trump in your phone call to give Australia an exemption from any tariffs?\u201d Anthony Albanese: \u201cNo, I pointed out, though, to [president-elect] Trump, that the United States has a trade surplus with Australia. It\u2019s had that trade surplus since Truman was president. So both the United States and Australia benefit from the trade between our two countries.\u201d Speers: \u201cWould it be a perfect relationship, as he called it, if he slapped tariffs on Australia?\u201d Albanese: \u201cHe said we\u2019re going to have a perfect friendship. I\u2019m very confident that the relationship with the United States will stay strong.\u201d Free trade and climate action push not aimed at Trump, says PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says his comments in support of free trade and taking action to address climate change were not directed at the US president-elect, Donald Trump. Here\u2019s what Albanese told ABC Insider\u2019s host, David Speers, a short time ago: [My comments were] squarely aimed at one thing \u2013 Australia\u2019s national interest. We\u2019re a trading nation and I support free and fair trade. One-in-four Australian jobs depends on trade. 75% of our trade occurs with Apec nations. Climate change is something that we have to deal with. It\u2019s in Australia\u2019s national interests [to do so]. I see climate change as not just a challenge, which it is, but also an opportunity and a particular opportunity for Australians. Anthony Albanese has renewed election-timing speculation with an off-the-cuff remark declaring it would occur in May next year. In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, Albanese was asked about media reports that he had spoken to the West Australian premier, Roger Cook, about shifting WA\u2019s election date,now fixed for 8 March. Describing it as \u201ca completely nothing story\u201d, Albanese initially gave an unclear response, saying the government would \u201cgo to an election sometime between [then and] May\u201d. He then became definitive: We have a budget scheduled for March and the election will be in May. Pressed to confirm the May date, he returned to more generic language. Well, that\u2019s when it\u2019s due. Or it could be beforehand. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has hailed \u201cinclusive trade and investment\u201d at the Apec forum in Peru where leaders are attempting to push against the protectionist policies favoured by US president-elect Donald Trump. We\u2019ll hear from the PM on ABC Insiders shortly. When speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders summit, which assembles 21 of the world\u2019s largest economies, Albanese said Apec leaders consistently \u201cspoke about the importance of free and fair trade between our economies to lift up the living standards of people throughout this region\u201d. Albanese also said he had a \u201cfriendly\u201d private discussion with the US president, Joe Biden, at the meeting, who he described as \u201cin good form\u201d. Albanese confirmed he did not speak to China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. Asked about work to lift trade tariffs with China, Albanese said: I\u2019m not a commentator \u2026 but what I\u2019ve done with China is work in the way that we said we would before the election. Whether it\u2019s coal, barley, wine, other products, including seafood and others, people are in employment in Australia today because of our trade. There are several emergency fire warnings in Victoria\u2019s western district this morning after soaring temperatures in the mid-30s on Saturday. A \u201cwatch and act\u201d alert has been issued for those living in Chapple Vale, Crowes, Gellibrand Lower, Johanna, Johanna Heights, Lavers Hill, Stalker, Wangerrip, Wattle Hill, Yuulong and Wattle Hill to the Great Ocean Walk. Here\u2019s the guidance emergency services issued just after midnight: Don\u2019t wait, leaving now is the safest option \u2013 conditions may change and get worse very quickly. Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay. By choosing to stay, you and your family may be at risk of serious injury or death. A watch and act message has also been issued for the towns of Chetwynd, Connewirricoo, Kadnook: If you left Chetwynd, Connewirricoo or Kadnook it is Not Safe to Return. Be aware of potential dangerous bushfire and tree hazards. A pilot and two passengers have died after a light plane crashed into a paddock and caught alight, AAP reports. Emergency services were called to the crash in Tinamba West in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland on Saturday afternoon. Police were told the aircraft was circling the area before it crashed and set on fire. The pilot and two passengers, who were the only occupants onboard, died at the scene. They are yet to be formally identified The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the crash of the \u201camateur-built light aircraft\u201d and is calling for witnesses or anyone with photos or video of it to come forward. Hello and welcome to another day of the Australia news live blog. Pour yourself a cup of strong coffee, and let\u2019s get into it. Much of the world\u2019s attention today is in Peru, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) is hosting leaders from around the world. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is there pushing back against protectionist policies. He\u2019ll speak with ABC Insiders this morning. We\u2019re also keeping a close eye on active bushfire warnings across Victoria\u2019s west after soaring temperatures on Saturday. We\u2019re also watching another big international forum: the Cop29 UN climate summit in Azerbaijan. Our environment editor, Adam Morton, is there, and we will have updates from him this morning.",

The street dance collective Flawless seem a million miles from De Keersmaeker\u2019s dance quest, yet they were one of the groups that introduced hip-hop dance into the mainstream when in 2009 they reached the final of Britain\u2019s Got Talent. It was their misfortune that their competitors included another dance troupe, Diversity, who won the overall competition. Diversity have splintered now but Flawless are still performing, and celebrated their 20th anniversary with Past, Present, Future, a showcase that featured their founder, Marlon \u201cSwoosh\u201d Wallen, and seven of the original all-male crew, alongside the new company, full of women and a lot of child lockers and poppers. The tone was mixed \u2013 from the sharp-edged unison of the original to the good-humoured exuberance of the kids, but it was fun to be reminded of Flawless\u2019s part in making hip-hop dance so popular. Founded by Cassa Pancho in 2001, Ballet Black continues to play a crucial role in creating space for black and brown dancers in ballet. It has helped to reshape the landscape, and the fact that the nine-strong company has five new dancers in its new programme, Heroes, is a sign of the strength in depth it has helped to foster. The programme itself features a new work by Sophie Laplane, If at First, and Mthuthuzeli November\u2019s The Waiting Game, which both in different ways celebrate the heroism of simple endurance. If at First is restless and disjointed, as different dancers are gifted a white crown while the soundtrack swerves from Beethoven to electronica. The Waiting Game builds its effects more patiently and is held together by detailed performances from Ebony Thomas as a man in the grip of a crisis, and Isabela Coracy as the voice in his head. Both works are beautifully performed by a company that is always a pleasure to watch. Star ratings (out of five) Exit Above \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Past, Present, Future \u2605\u2605\u2605 Heroes \u2605\u2605\u2605 Exit Above tours Europe, 2 December to 25 May 2025 Heroes is at the Lowry, Manchester, 20-21 November",

The demolitions in al-Bustan \u201ccould serve as a portent of what is to come\u201d, Ir Amim said.</p> <p>Also last week, a Bedouin village in the Negev desert was demolished to make way for a new Orthodox Jewish community on the orders of Itamar Ben Gvir, the far-right national security minister, and 25 Palestinian structures in the West Bank were knocked down, according to the <a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiY2NjMTVhOTgtNDZlOS00Y2RkLWFkNzAtZjUyYjRlZTZiZTBjIiwidCI6IjBmOWUzNWRiLTU0NGYtNGY2MC1iZGNjLTVlYTQxNmU2ZGM3MCIsImMiOjh9\">UN</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s picks have surprised even hardliners.

During a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/03/politics/huckabee-west-bank-settlements/index.html\">visit to Israel in 2017</a>, Huckabee said: \u201cThere is no such thing as a West Bank.

There\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d</p> <p>Pete Hegseth, the likely defence secretary, is another evangelical Christian who has tattoos of<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5191413/peter-hegseths-tattoos-are-raising-some-eyebrows\"> Christian symbols and slogans</a> often associated with the Crusades and the far right.</p> <p>\u201cIsrael could never have asked for anything more than this,\u201d said Daniel Luria, a director who speaks for Ateret Cohanim \u2013 an NGO which describes its aims as reclaiming and rebuilding a united Jerusalem for the Jewish people, and is behind a number of controversial projects in the city.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an Arab country on the land of Israel. The fact that there\u2019s been many attempts over the years to do something different is irrelevant,\u201d Luria said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got a very unique situation now \u2026 to really have literally a new Middle East, and readjust everything.\u201d</p> <p>Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/23/cyrus-prophecy-evangelical-support-donald-trump\">rightwing radicals have compared Trump</a> to the Persian king Cyrus the Great, who conquered Babylon in 539BC<strong>,</strong> allowing exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem.</p> <p>Pro-settler parties hold key posts in Israel\u2019s coalition government, the most rightwing the country has known.

      "bodyText": "Rightwing settlers and extremist nationalist Zionists in Israel have described top officials in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration as a \u201cdream team\u201d which will offer a \u201cunique and special opportunity\u201d to expand Israel\u2019s hold on occupied territory and permanently end any prospect of a Palestinian state. Palestinian groups and leftwing NGOs in Israel have been shocked by Trump\u2019s appointment of outspoken supporters of the projects of far-right Israeli activists and say the government of Benjamin Netanyahu has been emboldened by Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cThe series of appointments announced by US president-elect Donald Trump should worry everyone who cares about Israel\u2019s future,\u201d an editorial in the leftwing newspaper Haaretz warned. Since the US election, authorities have pushed ahead with demolishing Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which were occupied in 1967. Last week, Palestinian residents of al-Bustan in East Jerusalem were sifting through debris caused by the recent demolition of nine houses by municipal authorities after an Israeli court ruled their construction illegal. Fakhri Abu Diab, a veteran activist who for years has led resistance to efforts to demolish the homes of Palestinian families in al-Bustan, said bulldozers had returned on the day of the US elections to destroy the part of his house left standing by municipal demolition teams earlier this year. Abu Diab, 62, said 40 people, including children, had been left homeless and that 115 homes were now threatened. \u201cIsrael has wanted to demolish here for 20 years and are now seizing the opportunity. This is just a way to punish us and make us leave. I am here, where my parents and grandparents were, and will stay here,\u201d Abu Diab said. His wife, Amina, said that with Trump in power there was \u201cnothing to restrain Israel\u201d. The Jerusalem municipality said the buildings were located on land designated as an open public area. The Israeli rights group Ir Amim argued that the true aim of the demolitions was to connect Israeli settler pockets implanted in Palestinian neighbourhoods to west Jerusalem and said local authorities had been emboldened by Trump\u2019s win. The demolitions in al-Bustan \u201ccould serve as a portent of what is to come\u201d, Ir Amim said. Also last week, a Bedouin village in the Negev desert was demolished to make way for a new Orthodox Jewish community on the orders of Itamar Ben Gvir, the far-right national security minister, and 25 Palestinian structures in the West Bank were knocked down, according to the UN. Trump\u2019s picks have surprised even hardliners. The nominee for secretary of state, Republican senator Marco Rubio, has said he opposes a ceasefire in Gaza and believes Israel should destroy \u201cevery element\u201d of Hamas, whom he described as \u201cvicious animals\u201d, while Elise Stefanik, proposed as ambassador to the United Nations, has called the UN a \u201ccesspool of antisemitism\u201d for its condemnation of deaths in Gaza. The new US ambassador to Israel is set to be Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian who backs the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and has called a two-state solution in Palestine \u201cunworkable\u201d. During a visit to Israel in 2017, Huckabee said: \u201cThere is no such thing as a West Bank. There\u2019s no such thing as a settlement \u2013 they are communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities. There\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d Pete Hegseth, the likely defence secretary, is another evangelical Christian who has tattoos of Christian symbols and slogans often associated with the Crusades and the far right. \u201cIsrael could never have asked for anything more than this,\u201d said Daniel Luria, a director who speaks for Ateret Cohanim \u2013 an NGO which describes its aims as reclaiming and rebuilding a united Jerusalem for the Jewish people, and is behind a number of controversial projects in the city. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an Arab country on the land of Israel. The fact that there\u2019s been many attempts over the years to do something different is irrelevant,\u201d Luria said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got a very unique situation now \u2026 to really have literally a new Middle East, and readjust everything.\u201d Some rightwing radicals have compared Trump to the Persian king Cyrus the Great, who conquered Babylon in 539BC, allowing exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem. Pro-settler parties hold key posts in Israel\u2019s coalition government, the most rightwing the country has known. Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister and an outspoken advocate of expanded settlements, last week said that 2025 would be \u201cthe year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria\u201d, referring to the West Bank in the biblical terms used by rightwing Israelis and their US supporters, and signalling a hope of annexing the occupied territories. Expansion of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem has surged throughout the war that followed the Hamas attacks into Israel on 7 October, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. More than 43,000 have died in Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, also mostly civilians. Several Israeli ministers, including Smotrich, were present at a conference last month which called for the return of Jewish settlements in Gaza. Huckabee, who has refused to use any terms other than Judea and Samaria to describe the West Bank, is an enthusiastic supporter of the City of David Foundation, a government-funded archeological park in a Palestinian neighbourhood in Jerusalem. It is run by Elad, an Israeli settler group accused of displacing Palestinian families from Jerusalem by buying Palestinian houses and using controversial laws that let the state take over Palestinian property. An EU report in 2018 said Elad\u2019s projects in parts of East Jerusalem were being used \u201cas a political tool to modify the historical narrative and to support, legitimise and expand settlements\u201d. The foundation refused to discuss the projects\u2019 support from the Israeli government and overseas. Last week, tourists sat under the olive trees and heard lectures at the City of David information centre, just outside Jerusalem\u2019s Old City walls. Jack Holford, a 62-year-old retired software engineer visiting Jerusalem with his wife, Debbie, said: \u201cWe believe that \u2026 God has a plan for Israel and that God said they own the land. We consider ourselves believers and we are part of God\u2019s plan revealed through Israel for the whole world. There are Arabs, Palestinians and Jews and they are all Israelis.\u201d Trump\u2019s first term saw unprecedented steps to support Israel\u2019s territorial claims, including recognising Jerusalem as its capital and moving the US embassy there, and recognising Israel\u2019s annexation of the Golan Heights. Pro-settlement activists believe Trump\u2019s picks mean the new administration will go much further. \u201cThey\u2019ve spoken about Jews having the right to live everywhere, that it\u2019s impossible to divide [Jerusalem] into two, that you can\u2019t allow hatred and evil on your back doorstep and terror \u2026 and that comes from a biblical background \u2026 Just like I see King David and Abraham, they see them also,\u201d Luria said.",

For all their enthusiastic words, analysts and diplomats say, Europe\u2019s mini-Trumps will probably not get much \u2013 and may even find themselves worse off. What\u2019s more, some appear to realise it.</p> <p>Certainly, there may be some political upside to basking in reflected Trumpian glory. \u201cThe coming Trump presidency will most probably embolden Europe\u2019s far right and illiberal actors,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cer.org.uk/insights/can-europe-navigate-trump-2\">concluded experts at the Centre for European Reform</a> thinktank.</p> <p>\u201cTrump will strengthen far-right parties not just by normalising and amplifying their ideas, but by boosting their electability.\u201d His win legitimises their grievances and rubber-stamps their sovereigntist vision; history seems to be moving their way.</p> <p>Besides Orb\u00e1n, Meloni, Wilders and Weidel, Europe\u2019s longstanding Trump admirers include Marine Le Pen of France\u2019s National Rally (RN), Slovakia\u2019s prime minister Robert Fico, Austrian far right leader Herbert Kickl and Serbia\u2019s Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107.</p> <p>They may well be joined after elections next year by Andrej Babi\u0161 in the Czech Republic, and \u2013 with both France and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/german-government-on-brink-of-collapse-after-olaf-scholz-sacks-finance-minister\">Germany</a>, the EU\u2019s traditional powerhouse, weakened by domestic political crises \u2013 their influence is plainly on the rise.</p> <p>Some experts argue selected European far-right leaders could be strengthened personally by Trump\u2019s win: Meloni, for example, has put in the groundwork, praising his brand of politics as a model for Italy and regularly travelling to his rallies.</p> <p>Common views on issues ranging from immigration to abortion, and her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/23/elon-musk-to-present-atlantic-council-global-citizen-award-to-giorgia-meloni\">flourishing rapport with Elon Musk</a>, could see her become Trump\u2019s \u201cmain interlocutor in Europe\u201d, said Lorenzo Castellani of Rome\u2019s Luiss University.</p> <p>Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, expressed much the same ambition for Orb\u00e1n. \u201cWe can have a good hope that Hungarian-American political cooperation will return to its peak form,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/szijjarto.peter.official/posts/pfbid026tCEcdboGime5Y9ZEZdrJUsCUKnCiETVmF6p1qdjMgR85AHsGSL5sEitCNm4xW2Yl\">he said</a>: Orb\u00e1n and Trump have \u201csimilar thoughts\u201d.</p> <p>But the dynamics are a lot more complicated than that.

Those words \u201ccaution against any guarantee of deeper [US-Hungary] collaboration\u201d, <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2024/11/orbans-rebellion-against-europe-gains-momentum?lang=en\">foreign policy expert Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi said</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s promised America first trade policies could also prove complicated to negotiate for Europe\u2019s far-right parties. As members of the EU\u2019s single market, they could not respond individually to US-imposed tariffs and a likely trade war.</p> <p>Le Pen\u2019s lukewarm response to Trump\u2019s second triumph \u2013 in marked contrast to her joy at his first in 2016, which <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/fr/20161109-marine-le-pen-felicite-donald-trump-front-national-reactions-politique\">she hailed even before he had officially won</a> \u2013 reflects widespread concern over the consequences of Trump 2.0 for EU industry and jobs.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans have freely chosen their president,\u201d Le Pen said. \u201cThis new political era should contribute to the strengthening of bilateral relations and the pursuit of constructive dialogue and cooperation on the international stage.\u201d</p> <p>Her protege, Jordan Bardella, even echoed French president Emmanuel Macron, saying that for \u201cus French and Europeans, this US election should be a wake-up call \u2026 an opportunity to rethink our relationship with power and strategic autonomy\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/01/western-europeans-even-some-on-far-right-want-harris-victory-poll-finds\">Far-right voters in Europe are far from uncritical of Trump\u2019s brand of politics</a>, polls suggest: a pre-election YouGov poll found, for example, that people who backed Le Pen would rather have Kamala Harris in the White House than Trump.</p>    <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s attitude towards Europe \u2026 will be harmful to far-right parties\u2019 core electorate \u2013 think inflation, de-industrialisation, job losses,\u201d said Catherine Fieschi of the European University Institute. \u201cTrump is bad news for them.\u201d</p> <p>The idea that Trump himself \u201cgives a damn about building relationships with these people strikes me as very very unlikely\u201d, Fieschi added. \u201cHe will think about them on a case-by-case basis, and see whether he can extract something.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/07/why-donald-trumps-return-is-a-disaster-for-europe\">concrete threats to the continent posed by a second Trump presidency</a> that promises to be even more radical than the first, the EU that Europe\u2019s far-right parties have so long reviled may start to look a little less unattractive.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n may be strong at home, said <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2024/11/orbans-rebellion-against-europe-gains-momentum?lang=en\">Szel\u00e9nyi</a>, \u201cbut Hungary is small, deeply integrated in the EU, and its people like being Europeans. The country\u2019s progress and success is far more dependent on the success of the EU than on anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Like other far-right leaders, said Catherine de Vries of Bocconi University in Milan, Orb\u00e1n has \u201ctried to play both sides, be strategically ambiguous. The thing about Trump is, he\u2019s not going to let you do that. He\u2019ll force you to make a choice.\u201d</p> <p>Europe\u2019s populists will continue to \u201csay Trumpian things, especially if they have an election coming up\u201d, De Vries said. \u201cBut when push really comes to shove \u2013 Europe\u2019s security in Trump\u2019s hands, Nato not guaranteed \u2013 then maybe quite a few are going to say, maybe we need to work on this in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Far from uniting Europe\u2019s far right in triumph, Trump\u2019s return could actually deepen the conflicts between them. Ultimately, concluded Fieschi, Trump \u201cis going to make the lives of Europe\u2019s far-right leaders, as Eurosceptics, a lot harder. They\u2019re going to be caught between staying Eurosceptic, lining up with Trump and hurting their base \u2013 or lining up with the EU, shedding their specificity and losing voters. They\u2019ve been \u2018out-populist-ed.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Angela Giuffrida in Rome</em></p>",

Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, commended a \u201chistoric friendship\u201d which \u201cwill now grow even stronger\u201d, while Alice Weidel of Alternative for Germany (AfD) hailed a defeat for \u201cwoke Hollywood\u201d, adding that Trump \u201cis a model for us\u201d. Europe\u2019s fast-advancing far-right parties, in power in eight EU member states and knocking at the doors in more, have long seen in Trump a powerful ally who shares their populist, nation-first, conservative, Eurosceptic and immigration-hostile views. But what can they actually expect to gain from Trump 2.0? For all their enthusiastic words, analysts and diplomats say, Europe\u2019s mini-Trumps will probably not get much \u2013 and may even find themselves worse off. What\u2019s more, some appear to realise it. Certainly, there may be some political upside to basking in reflected Trumpian glory. \u201cThe coming Trump presidency will most probably embolden Europe\u2019s far right and illiberal actors,\u201d concluded experts at the Centre for European Reform thinktank. \u201cTrump will strengthen far-right parties not just by normalising and amplifying their ideas, but by boosting their electability.\u201d His win legitimises their grievances and rubber-stamps their sovereigntist vision; history seems to be moving their way. Besides Orb\u00e1n, Meloni, Wilders and Weidel, Europe\u2019s longstanding Trump admirers include Marine Le Pen of France\u2019s National Rally (RN), Slovakia\u2019s prime minister Robert Fico, Austrian far right leader Herbert Kickl and Serbia\u2019s Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107. They may well be joined after elections next year by Andrej Babi\u0161 in the Czech Republic, and \u2013 with both France and Germany, the EU\u2019s traditional powerhouse, weakened by domestic political crises \u2013 their influence is plainly on the rise. Some experts argue selected European far-right leaders could be strengthened personally by Trump\u2019s win: Meloni, for example, has put in the groundwork, praising his brand of politics as a model for Italy and regularly travelling to his rallies. Common views on issues ranging from immigration to abortion, and her flourishing rapport with Elon Musk, could see her become Trump\u2019s \u201cmain interlocutor in Europe\u201d, said Lorenzo Castellani of Rome\u2019s Luiss University. Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, expressed much the same ambition for Orb\u00e1n. \u201cWe can have a good hope that Hungarian-American political cooperation will return to its peak form,\u201d he said: Orb\u00e1n and Trump have \u201csimilar thoughts\u201d. But the dynamics are a lot more complicated than that. While Europe\u2019s far-right leaders may align comfortably with Trump in their hostility to immigration and international institutions, there are also significant differences. Meloni\u2019s staunch support for Nato and continued international aid to Ukraine in its struggle against Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, for example, will not be greeted with enthusiasm by the more isolationist voices in the incoming US administration. Similarly, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s cosy \u201call-weather comprehensive strategic partnership\u201d with China, which Hungary has welcomed with open arms as a key economic partner and foreign investor, is a long way from Trump\u2019s aggressively hardline approach to Beijing. As US Republican Mitch McConnell put it, \u201cwhen Chinese state enterprise says jump, Hungarian officials ask how high\u201d. Those words \u201ccaution against any guarantee of deeper [US-Hungary] collaboration\u201d, foreign policy expert Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi said. Trump\u2019s promised America first trade policies could also prove complicated to negotiate for Europe\u2019s far-right parties. As members of the EU\u2019s single market, they could not respond individually to US-imposed tariffs and a likely trade war. Le Pen\u2019s lukewarm response to Trump\u2019s second triumph \u2013 in marked contrast to her joy at his first in 2016, which she hailed even before he had officially won \u2013 reflects widespread concern over the consequences of Trump 2.0 for EU industry and jobs. \u201cAmericans have freely chosen their president,\u201d Le Pen said. \u201cThis new political era should contribute to the strengthening of bilateral relations and the pursuit of constructive dialogue and cooperation on the international stage.\u201d Her protege, Jordan Bardella, even echoed French president Emmanuel Macron, saying that for \u201cus French and Europeans, this US election should be a wake-up call \u2026 an opportunity to rethink our relationship with power and strategic autonomy\u201d. Far-right voters in Europe are far from uncritical of Trump\u2019s brand of politics, polls suggest: a pre-election YouGov poll found, for example, that people who backed Le Pen would rather have Kamala Harris in the White House than Trump. \u201cTrump\u2019s attitude towards Europe \u2026 will be harmful to far-right parties\u2019 core electorate \u2013 think inflation, de-industrialisation, job losses,\u201d said Catherine Fieschi of the European University Institute. \u201cTrump is bad news for them.\u201d The idea that Trump himself \u201cgives a damn about building relationships with these people strikes me as very very unlikely\u201d, Fieschi added. \u201cHe will think about them on a case-by-case basis, and see whether he can extract something.\u201d Faced with the concrete threats to the continent posed by a second Trump presidency that promises to be even more radical than the first, the EU that Europe\u2019s far-right parties have so long reviled may start to look a little less unattractive. Orb\u00e1n may be strong at home, said Szel\u00e9nyi, \u201cbut Hungary is small, deeply integrated in the EU, and its people like being Europeans. The country\u2019s progress and success is far more dependent on the success of the EU than on anything else.\u201d Like other far-right leaders, said Catherine de Vries of Bocconi University in Milan, Orb\u00e1n has \u201ctried to play both sides, be strategically ambiguous. The thing about Trump is, he\u2019s not going to let you do that. He\u2019ll force you to make a choice.\u201d Europe\u2019s populists will continue to \u201csay Trumpian things, especially if they have an election coming up\u201d, De Vries said. \u201cBut when push really comes to shove \u2013 Europe\u2019s security in Trump\u2019s hands, Nato not guaranteed \u2013 then maybe quite a few are going to say, maybe we need to work on this in Europe.\u201d Far from uniting Europe\u2019s far right in triumph, Trump\u2019s return could actually deepen the conflicts between them. Ultimately, concluded Fieschi, Trump \u201cis going to make the lives of Europe\u2019s far-right leaders, as Eurosceptics, a lot harder. They\u2019re going to be caught between staying Eurosceptic, lining up with Trump and hurting their base \u2013 or lining up with the EU, shedding their specificity and losing voters. They\u2019ve been \u2018out-populist-ed.\u2019\u201d Additional reporting by Angela Giuffrida in Rome",

It won\u2019t, it can\u2019t. \u201cIn four years\u2019 time \u2026 when we have not done the things we said we wouldn\u2019t do \u2026 Queenslanders will see what it\u2019s like to have a government where a word counts for something.\u201d Crisafulli warned members \u201cwe won\u2019t get everything we want\u201d and said winning a second term would require compromise. \u201cWe don\u2019t exist for culture wars,\u201d he said. We don\u2019t exist to be the strongest in opposition. We exist to bring good government to Queenslanders. \u201cWe won\u2019t get everything we want. There will be times where \u2026 you have to compromise. Where things are a little bit imperfect. But overall, when you govern, you can embed the kind of things that you want to see for a state.\u201d Crisafulli spoke about the federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and roused party members to \u201cdo it one more time\u201d at a federal election, due in the first half of next year. \u201cThe more people know about Peter Dutton, the more they like,\u201d Crisafulli said. \u201cThere is a reason why he has managed to hold a seat, that on the pendulum shouldn\u2019t be a Liberal National seat. He keeps winning it because people who know him like him. And I like him.\u201d \u2022 This story was amended on 18 November 2024. A previous version incorrectly stated that no conservative government in Queensland had won a second term in government since 1960.",

Announcing that Japan would join joint Australia-US military exercises during US troop rotations in Australia\u2019s top end, the defence minister and acting prime minister, Richard Marles, said a leading US role in world affairs was a matter of \u201cAmerican leadership\u201d. \u201cThe point here really is American leadership is what the world needs to see, and we are confident we will see American leadership under the next Trump administration,\u201d Marles said. \u201cThat\u2019s very much part of how President Trump has articulated his message, and that\u2019s what we will expect to see from that.\u201d Marles said he looked forward to building a relationship with the incoming US defence secretary, the Fox News presenter Pete Hegseth. \u201cOur message will be that American leadership matters and the rules based order around the world is really important,\u201d Marles said, adding that having those rules is what gave agency to a country the size of Australia. \u201cI mean, if there is a world which is only determined by power and might, that doesn\u2019t leave a lot of space for most countries in the world \u2013 and countries like Australia,\u201d Marles said, in the leadl-up talks with his US and Japanese counterparts in Darwin.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much sense,\u201d says Cook, chewing over the result, \u201cto play Overton when he can\u2019t bowl. Pepper is a better batter and a better fielder when Overton can\u2019t bowl.\u201d A mystery indeed. Maybe we will find out tomorrow in the final match of series, which rolls along at 8pm GMT. We suspect there will be at least one change after Liam Livingstone hurt his knee in the field taking that spectacular catch \u2013 what an unlucky run of injuries he has had. And so, with West Indies breathing life into the series with that spectacular chase, I will say goodnight. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow in time for the toss. Thanks for your company \u2013 bye! Powell: \u201cIt has been a series where if you win the toss, you seem to win the game. But the guys put in a good performance today. We decided that maybe five bowlers isn\u2019t our best suit. Alzarri Joseph is very important for us, we just need the other bowlers to keep getting close to his standards. To be honest we don\u2019t have a lot of bowlers, it is an opportunity for bowlers in the Caribbean to keep putting in good performances. It\u2019s been tough for the bowling group this series but they are trying. There\u2019s still a lot to play for tomorrow.\u201d Jos Buttler: \u201cWrist spinners are like gold dust, I thought Rehan was very brave today , got us back in the game, a young guy full of confidence.\u201d \u201cThe main thing was to work out the best remedy to getting a good score.\u201d .Any change from ODI cricket? \u201cNo just doing what the team requires.\u201d Where do you prefer batting. \u201cTo be fair I prefer batting in the middle but I\u2019m a batter, I just like being out in the middle.\u201d \u201cWhat a game of cricket,\u201d says Cook. \u201cGreat entertainment, great ball-striking. They looked at one stage as if they were going to cruise it, a slight wobble, but that total took some chasing.\u201d \u201cI completely agree with Butch,\u201d agrees Jason Roy, \u201cthat Shai Hope should be in that side, amazing to watch, a calm head amongst the ball strikers.\u201d They agreed that England did well to keep their heads, and that the wicket was a belter. 19th over: West Indies 221-5 (Rutherford 29, Chase 9) Mousley with the penultimate over. Chase dabs at the first and it runs away to deep backward square but is cut off on the rope. A single down the ground before the umpires change the too-wet-with-dew ball. Rutherford waits patiently. Another big hit down the ground saved by a diving Overton \u201cthey should have run more than one!\u201d says Ian Bishop wringing his hands. Another single, and then BANG! Rutherford swings SIX. He polishes the match off with another SIX next ball \u2013 crunched with style over midwicket. That\u2019s the most highest successful run-chase at this venue and a smashing win for West Indies. 18th over: West Indies 204-5 (Rutherford 16, Chase 2) Chase fires Curran into the sky \u2013 someone\u2019s surely? but no \u2013 the ball falls slap in the middle of four approaching fielders. West Indies have tensed up, Buttler cleverly places his fielders, West Indies need 15 runs off 12 balls. 17th over: West Indies 198-5 (Rutherford 14, Chase 1) Turner gets a tricky casting call. But he does well, dismissing Powell and leaking only three runs. West Indies\u2019 target inches once more above a run-a-ball, with two new batters in. West Indies need 21 runs from 18 balls. Powell reviews optimistically but duly is sent on his way, the ball hitting the back pad to give Turner his first international T20 wicket. 16th over: West Indies 195-4 (Rutherford 11, Powell 38) Saqib Mahmood with his final over. West Indies content to knock him for the odd single. Excellent from Mahmood, who finishes with 0-24 and a Caribbean trip to remember. West Indies need 24 runs from 24 balls. 15th over: West Indies 191-4 (Rutherford 10, Powell 36) Mousley whistles through with his usual efficiency, West Indies try nothing fancy but dab him for a single a ball. West Indies need 28 runs from 30 balls. 14th over: West Indies 185-4 (Rutherford 7, Powell 33) Rutherford picks up SIX immediately but by the skin of his teeth, the ball flying mostly into the stratosphere but finding the length to drop just inside the rope. But the effort involved has hurt Rutherford too \u2013 and he\u2019s on his back, legs being stretched by the physio. He recovers to jog a single and Powell polishes off the over with a monstrous SIX over deep mdwicket West Indies need 34 runs from 36 balls. A brilliant over his head catch by Livingstone sprinting forwards from mid-on but looking backwards watching the ball, but he lands awkwardly and cries out in pain. The physios run on immediately and do some kneading \u2013 and he goes off the field, poor guy. 13th over: West Indies 172-3 (Hetmyer 7, Powell 27 ) Do West Indies just try and survive Saqib Mahmood? They\u2019ve probably got enough runs in the bag with 58 needed off 48. They\u2019re duly watchful \u2013 three singles, a dot, a wide, a dot, another wide and then Powell polishes off the over with a come-to-bed SIX over cover. 12th over: West Indies 161-3 (Hetmyer 5, Powell 20 ) Powell, in hat pulled down low over his brow, bingoes an inviting ball from Rehan over long on for SIX. Four is dinked to fine leg. Finishes with a dot but still 14 from it. 11th over: West Indies 147-3 (Hetmyer 4, Powell 7 ) With the mood of the game suddenly changed, Buttler brings on Turner who had a tricky first two overs. Powell zings him immediately through the covers for four. A careless bit of fielding by Overton leaks two. Just the one boundary \u2013 goes for nine. 10th over: West Indies 138-3 (Hetmyer 1, Powell 1) Well that was a party-pooper of an over. Three in a row! In the space of two balls, Pooran is involved in a run-out and then gets an inside edge onto his stumps. He throws his arms in frustration. Someone has turned off the music midway through the party. What a doughnut of a mix-up. Pooran starts running, then changes his mind and Hope is stranded. On the dot of drinks! Lewis, who seemed unstoppable, is done by the googly, well taken by Mousley. Can England stop this runaway train? Just 83 runs needed with over half the overs left. 9th over: West Indies 136-0 (Lewis 68, Hope 54) Curran drifts legside and Lewis helps it on its way to collect his first fifty of the series off just 26 balls. The target falls below a hundred as he side-steps and swipes four more just past the diving Mousley sprinting round the boundary. SIX follows, drilled straight like a bolt through plasterboard. Curran tries again, and somehow Lewis mis-hits a one-armed leading-edge for SIX more. Curran, arms gleaming with sweat, shakes his head. He tries a bouncer, which sails over Lewis and is given as a wide. The last ball is hit down the ground and a sterling effort from Buttler who sprints and launches himself into the air \u2013 hands nowhere near the catch but stopping the ball with his neck I think. Saves the boundary. 8th over: West Indies 113-0 (Lewis 47, Hope 53) Livingstone comes on and takes a pounding. Starts with five wides, then Lewis slams SIX, FOUR, SIX \u2013 the final one, with barely a flick of the wrist, out into the night. Then a wide, before Lewis finishes with a third and final SIX \u2013 a one-handed biff that just clears Bethell hovering near the midwicket boundary. Tasty! 7th over: West Indies 83-0 (Lewis 23, Hope 53) Rehan Ahmed has the ball, tossing it from hand to hand, chewing on his gum. Hope swings at a shorter offering and the ball sails joyously over deep midwicket. Finishes the over with another four through midwicket past the fielder who was in position but didn\u2019t have time even to scratch his head. That\u2019s Hope\u2019s fifth fifty in IT20s \u2013 in just 23 balls. 6th over: West Indies 69-0 (Lewis 21, Hope 41) Off the field some kind of crazy acrobatics, on the field Hope smashes Mousley\u2019s first ball for SIX! An appeal for a stumping against Lewis \u2013 not out says the umpire, but Salt is convinced. They go through it frame for frame but Lewis\u2019s boot is jsut quick enough to get down. He retorts by thunder-clapping Mousley\u2019s next ball for SIX. 5th over: West Indies 56-0 (Lewis 15, Hope 34) Buttler trusts Curran to stop the flow. A well run two, is followed by a glorious off drive that just out-runs the fielder. A wide. A full-throated dive by Mousley on the boundary saves a couple. Twelve from it. 4th over: West Indies 44-0 (Lewis 11, Hope 27) Mahmood retorts straight away by hitting Lewis high on the thigh/into the bread basket. Saqib, thick black towelling wristband on his left forearm, chats to Jofra ARcher on the boundary as Lewis is attended to. But what is this? Hope picks up four leg byes and then four more, struck with feeling over backward point. Then four more from a bottom out-fancy table-tennis dab which sings away to the rope. Game on? 3rd over: West Indies 30-0 (Lewis 11, Hope 18) Lewis picks up Turner at hip level on the legside and swings for a meaty six. IS that the jump-leads this innings needs? Perhaps! Hope joins in with four screamed through the covers for four and an inside edge that squeezes past the stumps and down to the rope. Followed by SIX swung mightily over long on and four whipped up into the off side. That\u2019s the most expensive over England have had during the power play this series \u2013 25 from it. 2nd over: West Indies 5-0 (Lewis 4, Hope 0) Saqib Mahmood at the other end \u2013 who has been such a joy to watch this white-ball series. While both dog and human snooze next to me on the sofa, Hope is bamboozled. We are told that the West Indies top five have all averaged under 12 this series \u2013 and as if to prove a point Hope swings wildly and misses. An immaculate maiden from Mahmood. 1st over: West Indies 5-0 (Lewis 4, Hope 0) Debutant Turner starts with a wide but is soon hitting his straps, 85mph and upwards. Hope flies at the final delivery and collects a boundary up and over the slips That was a pretty huge performance by England after losing the toss. A tasty pitch but some huge hitting. \u201cWhat we do know now is that West Indies didn\u2019t bowl particularly well but there is very little margin for error for the bowlers.\u201d says Alastair Cook \u201cWest Indies are so reliant on the spinners to do the holding role and we saw today how easy it was to hit through the line of it.\u201d \u201cBethell in particular I though was great \u2013 his ability to clear the ropes, he\u2019s got the ability \u2013 its not just destructive power but intelligent power.\u201d \u201cHe was very smart with his innings,\u201d agrees Jason Roy. \u201cFor a twenty year old to do that is very impressive.\u201d 20th over: England 218-5 (Bethell 62) McCoy keeps things quiet for the first five balls, then Curran opes the car boot and throws everything at a short ball which sails over long on for six. Curran is run-out scampering for a second off the last ball and England will be very happy with that! And England have equalled the record T20 score here in St Lucia. 19th over: England 206-4 ( Bethell 59, Curran 16) Joseph\u2019s first ball is a low full toss yee-hahed for six by Curran \u2013 he and Bethell are very similar looking at the crease \u2013 slight but full of flamboyance. Joseph polishes things off with a couple of yorkers. 18th over: England 194-4 ( Bethell 59, Curran 6) Left-armer McCoy returns in his spray-on trousers. He varies his pace cleverly and third-ball wide apart it is a miserly over until the final ball which Bethell sprays high and long for six over midwicket. 17th over: England 183-4 ( Bethell 51, Curran 4) A long-hop from Chase is hoiked for six by Bethell. A repeat next ball. His 50 (off 22 balls) arrives from the third six in a row \u2013 this time smashed down the ground. Chase\u2019s four overs go for a chastening 47. Bethell is shining brightly. 16th over: England 164-4 ( Bethell 32, Curran 4) Joseph returns. Bethell angles him, postcard through the letterbox, between the slips. But that\u2019s the only boundary of the over \u2013 a relatively respectable nine from it. 15th over: England 155-4 ( Bethell 27, Curran 0) The Bethell bus is accelerating: four straight, six on one knee, front knee flying off the ground in the moment. Livi is itching to join in but it isn\u2019t his day, he miscues a full-toss and the catch is calmly taken by Hetmyer. 14th over: England 142-3 ( Bethell 16, Livingstone 2) Chase, with a skip and a spring. A first four for the baby-faced Bethell who sends him through third man, and a second with the most delicate of flicks through fine leg. 13th over: England 131-3 ( Bethell 6, Livingstone 1) Can West Indies haul this back? Time for one more six before Buttler reverse-sweeps straight to short third who collapses in a heap while taking the catch. He departs with a rueful smile, but opens a promising window for Livingstone. 12th over: England 123-2 ( Buttler 32, Bethell 5) The shadows are now stretching horizontally over the pitch as the clock moves to five pm St Lucian time. Bethell sweeps but only behind his head, but the next ball Buttler spatulates for six then scoops the next for four. 11th over: England 110-2 ( Buttler 20, Bethell 4) Motie returns, and actually manages to maintain composed control over England. Just five from the over as the horns blare at the ground. 10th over: England 105-2 ( Buttler 18, Bethell 2) Bethell the next man in \u2013 one of the coming men and getting rave reviews for his fielding as well as his other skills. From nowhere, Salt is suddenly hauling his boots of the field after getting out to an unlikely long-hop which he snitches round to the keeper. A fabulous 55 off just 35 balls \u2013 five fours, four sixes. And they take DRINKS. 9th over: England 101-1 (Salt 55, Buttler 16) Hosein again, with his Mr Whippy hair. Nearly gets his man as Salt flays and McCoy at long off dives with purpose, but not quite with the ball. Time for a seasoning of Buttler: he leans back deeply and drives Hosein up and over extra cover for four, and next ball punches him brutally over long-on for six. West Indies looking a bit forlorn here. 8th over: England 88-1 (Salt 54, Buttler 4 ) Choo-choo! All aboard the Phil Salt train \u2013 he celebrates yet another fifty with an unshowy waft of the bat. Powell the man to suffer this over as Salt kisses him straight for four, and then shimmies him through backward point for four more. 7th over: England 77-1 (Salt 45, Buttler 2 ) Carnage! Time for Motie to get the treatment. The ball belted way over long on and long off for two huge sixes \u2013 Salt on the money, Buttler content to hand him the glory. I\u2019ve just noticed that my email address is wrong on the link above. Will change but I\u2019m on tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com if you have something to say. 6th over: England 63-1 (Salt 32, Buttler 1 ) Hosein is switched back into action, and things go more calmly than the first over until the penultimat ball \u2013 which Salt griddle-pans for six over long off. 5th over: England 54-1 (Salt 24) Joseph returns, after an impressive first over, but initally even he can\u2019t slow the train. Jacks immediately lofts another six, 89 metres, bouncing off a plastic seat and nuzzling to a halt amongst the crowd. A no ball, brings a free hit\u2026 and no runs. Rovman Powell, say the commentators, is experimenting with mixing it up in the power play \u2013 it hasn\u2019t worked hugely well so far. But I speak too soon \u2013 Jacks goes at Joseph once too many times and is beaten for pace and aggression and top-edges \u2013 Pooran runs gently round to collect. Fifty still elusive for Jacks. 4th over: England 43-0 (Salt 23, Jacks 16) McCoy has switched ends, but still finds himself dispatched. Jacks eyes up a wide one and lofts him over extra-cover like a man who knows he is going to get extra gravy. England continue to gather runs with ease. 3rd over: England 33-0 (Salt 21, Jacks 8) McCoy is removed for now and replaced by Hosein \u2013 but Salt is in hungry mood and unfortunately Hosein isn\u2019t yet on point. His second ball is a warm and welcoming pie which Salt sends through the covers for four, the next is dragged down and Salt tucks in with six. Jacks finishes the over by dancing down and pinging another six \u2013 to make it 18 from the over. 2nd over: England 15-0 (Salt 10, Jacks 1) The poker-faced Joseph at the other end, aiming very straight and leaking just three runs \u2013 one of them from a terrible bit of lackadaisical fielding. Not huge numbers of spectators in yet on a perfect November afternoon. 1st over: England 12-0 (Salt 8, Jacks 0) Obed McCoy, built like a mighty mountain, with the first over. Salt rockets his second ball through midwicket for four. An early fielding mishap as Rutherford, in a moment of madness, flings a dead ball above the wicket-keeper and it rolls merrily over the rope for four overthrows. Another delivery gets blasted straight back into the blue, blue, St Lucian sky for four more. In betweeen all that, McCoy beats Salt twice. The players are out \u2013 let\u2019s see what West Indies can do in the power play. We get up close and personal with the St Lucia pitch alongside Carlos Brathwaite. Looks pretty tasty. Dry, dry, dry with the wind blowing across the ground. If you spot Jos Buttler, Jamie Overton and Marcus Trescothick in black armbands and wonder why, it is in memory of long-time Somerset supporter and fundraiser Mary Elworthy, who died yesterday aged 90. RIP Mary. West Indies: Shai Hope, Evin Lewis, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Rovman Powell (c), Shimron Hetmyer, Sherfane Rutherford, Roston Chase, Gudakesh Motie, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Obed McCoy. Rutherford and McCoy replace Shepherd and Hinds. England XI: Phil Salt (wk), Will Jacks, Jos Buttler (c), Jacob Bethell, Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Jamie Overton, Dan Mousley, Rehan Ahmed, Saqib Mahamood, John Turner. Turner for Archer. Jos Buttler says it will be a different challenge today \u2013 let\u2019s see if they can win batting first. Turner replaces Jofra Archer to make his T20 debut. At last! Powell grins. \u201cWe know how important it is to bowl and get that good start. From a personal standpoint players have to stand up and be counted, the players are ready and upbeat for the challenge today. I think the guys can\u2019t keep losing wickets in clusters, we need to show good technical skills, this provides and opportunity for guys to show that.\u201d Jason Roy is the new face in the TNT studio and, in his cuddly blue jumper, picks out Liam Livingstone as his man of the series. Alastair Cook is his foil ,with a box-fresh white T-shirt under his quarter zip. West Indies have one obvious failure to fix from the last match, where they crucially dropped Liam Livingstone three times. As Rovman Powell put it bluntly afterwards: \u201cGuys have to take more catches.\u201d England, footloose and fancy free ( even if they didn\u2019t exactly cruise past West Indies\u2019 145) may take the opportunity to make a few team tweaks. And an interview with media-shy outgoing Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley: While we wait, this was the Guardian\u2019s editorial eye on the future of cricket: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/15/the-guardian-view-on-testing-times-crickets-traditions-are-being-clean-bowled-by-cash Hello! While pert geraniums wither in the frost back home, England have been having a fine old time in the Caribbean. ODI woes forgotten, England have already won the five-match T20 series, last weekend\u2019s two victories topped off by a three-wicket victory yesterday in St Lucia. It is England\u2019s first series win away from home since October 2022, and only their second series victory in the last six series played. Today they return to the same pitch they played on yesterday, with the weather dreamy hot and the winds strong. The toss is due in about 20 minutes.",
