      "bodyText": "Football fans in Queensland and Victoria will miss out on seeing Mary Fowler in coming friendlies against Brazil and Taiwan after the Matildas forward withdrew from the Australian squad citing mental and physical fatigue. The side is already without striker Sam Kerr as she continues her rehabilitation after a serious knee injury, as well as winger Cortnee Vine who has taken a mental health break from football. Fowler has been an important player this season for Manchester City \u2013 who sit second in the Women\u2019s Premier League behind early leaders Chelsea \u2013 and played four matches in 14 days earlier this month. The 21-year-old said she doesn\u2019t take playing for the Matildas for granted, and it is an honour to put on the gold jersey. \u201cI have, however, through past experiences, come to realise that my mind and my body are also things that I should also never take for granted,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to take this time to prioritise recovery in order to refresh both mentally and physically, so that I can continue to put my best self forward for both club and country.\u201d Fowler will still travel to Australia from Manchester during the international window, but will instead spend time with family. Thanks to her prominent contribution during the Matildas\u2019 run to the semi-finals at last year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup, and supported by a relationship with NRL star Nathan Cleary, Fowler has emerged as the face of Australian football, particularly during the long-term absence of Kerr. But she has had to be at her best to secure a place in City\u2019s first XI after coming off the bench to start the season at the club which has ambitions for silverware in the domestic competition and the Champions League. \u201cOver the past few months, playing with an increasingly demanding schedule has been both exciting but at times also challenging,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI love being able to play at the top level of my sport, but recognising that sometimes my mind and body also need to rest has been an invaluable lesson for me.\u201d Fowler said she appreciated everyone\u2019s support and understanding, \u201cand I hope to see you all soon\u201d. Vine made herself unavailable for the past two international windows, and issued a statement two weeks ago saying her life has dramatically changed over the past two years. She said she has \u201cdiscovered that identifying, managing and prioritising my mental health has become something I have needed to work very hard on\u201d.

Travel disruption continued into Sunday and the ferry operator DFDS cancelled services on some routes until Monday, including its Newhaven to Dieppe sailings. More than 300 flights from UK airports were cancelled during Storm Bert, aviation analytics firm Cirium said. Road closures on Sunday included the M48 Severn Bridge in Gloucestershire, while a stretch of the A66 in North Yorkshire and Cumbria was closed to high-sided and vulnerable vehicles. Rail operators cancelled services on some routes all day on Saturday and urged passengers to check their routes before making journeys. Great Western Railway, which runs trains between London Paddington and south-west England told passengers not to travel on long-distance journeys on Sunday. Avanti West Coast advised passengers to only travel if necessary on Sunday evening, with speed restrictions put in place on part of the west coast main line between Rugby and Milton Keynes due to rainfall and flooding.

It\u2019s time to show the character and we will keep fighting as we always have done \u2013 right until the end.\u201d",

About 10,000 hospitality workers will be trained in preventing and dealing with incidents of spiking by spring next year, Downing Street said before a meeting with police and hospitality leaders. The prime minister will host senior police officers, transport bosses and hospitality industry executives in No 10 on Monday to urge a coordinated response to violence against women. Labour committed in its manifesto to making spiking a specific criminal offence, though ministers have yet to clarify what form this will take and when a bill could be introduced. Ministers have vowed to improve the police\u2019s response to spiking incidents, with a plan to train thousands of bar staff expanding on a scheme piloted by the Conservative government last December. Spiking typically involves putting alcohol or drugs into someone\u2019s drink without their knowledge or permission.

It looks like the Christmas ruining of the TV schedules has already begun. Seems to come round earlier every year, does it not?</p> <p>Anyway. To business. Posh folk alongside less posh biographers and journalists assemble to talk about Camilla\u2019s \u201cremarkable rise\u201d to queendom. We begin with her childhood. She was born in a Nottinghamshire mining town and ate nothing but mice and boot blacking until she was four, when she followed her father down t\u2019pit and got to share his midday break and a cup of pneumoconiosis every Thursday.</p> <p>I\u2019m kidding, of course. She was born to Major Bruce Shand and Rosalind Cubitt, daughter of the 3rd Baron Ashcombe. They split their time between a country house in East Sussex and a townhouse in South Kensington, London. She had siblings and horses. Or siblings who were horses, I forget. It matters not.</p> <p>Then she got older, an O-level and a reputation as an efficient dispatcher of injured pheasants during shooting season. \u201cShe was great fun,\u201d says everyone. She liked dancing, smoking and having a good time, especially with Andrew Parker Bowles, until she was introduced to the then terrifically eligible bachelor Prince Charles and became his girlfriend for a year and a half. Then Prince Charles\u2019s beloved great-uncle Lord Mountbatten stuck his patrician nose in and put the kibosh on a relationship that seems to have been going swimmingly and probably would have saved a lot of people a lot of bother if it had been allowed to continue. Camilla Shand was \u201cclearly not\u201d a virgin, you see, and so 19-year-old Lady Diana Spencer was hauled in instead, and \u2019Mills married Parker Bowles instead.</p> <p>You\u2019ll never guess what happened next. Except, of course, you know because even the most uninterested of us have absorbed the basics by osmosis over the years. But here they are, trotted out by people of varying vowel-sounds, all over again. Charles and Camilla reignite their affair, Diana is miserable, Diana tells Andrew Morton everything, Camilla is hated by the public (or at least by the tabloids as their supposed proxy), the Queen is worried about the monarchy, then Diana dies and an opportunity to forge a different future presents itself. PR supremo Mark Bolland is brought in to rehabilitate her reputation and it works because no rational person in the country really gave a pearl-sized crap about who in the royal family did what to whom \u2013 nor who became queen when Charles became king because none of it mattered in the slightest. Charles and Camilla marry in 2005, Charles looks a tiny bit happier, and the world does not end.</p> <p>Much is made in the last 20 minutes or so of Harry\u2019s animus towards his stepmother and the claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/spare-by-prince-harry-review-dry-your-eyes-mate\">in his memoir</a>, various television interviews, his Netflix series \u2013 and, for all I know, a series of heartfelt scrawls in Oprah\u2019s sandpit \u2013 of the palace conspiring against him and his new wife, Meghan, until they were forced to defect to the US.

Many have joined units such as the International Legion, known as the most selective of the foreign groups and operating as part of a military unit within the Ukrainian ground forces. Yuri Podolyaka, a popular pro-Kremlin military blogger, wrote on Telegram that Anderson was captured near the village of Plekhovo in Russia\u2019s Kursk region. Russia usually claims that the foreign fighters it has captured are mercenaries and are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war under international law. The UK Foreign Office said it was \u201csupporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention\u201d. The Ministry of Defence has declined to comment at this stage. Russian forces have been battling Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region since 6 August, when Kyiv surprised Moscow with the biggest foreign attack on Russian soil since the second world war and subsequently seized 100 villages over an area of more than 1,300 sq km. On Sunday, Reuters reported that Ukraine had lost more than 40% of the territory it initially captured in the Kursk region after Russian forces, bolstered by 11,000 North Korean troops, launched a wave of counter-offensives. In the summer of 2022, two Britons captured while fighting in Mariupol as members of Ukraine\u2019s marines were sentenced to death following a show trial in a court in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine. The men were later released as part of a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine that was brokered by Saudi Arabia.",

Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma predicted lawmakers in the upper chamber would have tough questions in particular for the former Democratic congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, who was chosen by the president-elect as director of national security for his second administration. When asked on CNN on Sunday morning if he will vote for all of Trump\u2019s cabinet nominations, Lankford did not answer directly, pointing to the Senate process of holding public hearings for nominees, beginning on 3 January, ahead of Trump\u2019s confirmation on 20 January. \u201cEveryone is going to get a fair shake,\u201d he said of the president-elect\u2019s list of preferred nominees. Gabbard faces a potentially rough ride during her Senate confirmation over a number of questionable incidents from her career. These include spreading Russian propaganda over the war in Ukraine, prompting critics to ask if she might be a \u201cRussian asset\u201d, as well as her making a clandestine visit to Syria to meet the country\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, who has been accused of war crimes, a trip that drew Republican criticism as a shame and a disgrace. \u201cWe\u2019ll have lots of questions,\u201d Lankford, the newly-elected vice-chair of the Senate policy committee, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union show. \u201cShe met with Bashar al-Assad, we\u2019ll want to know what the purpose was and what the direction for that was as a member of Congress.

Other Trump choices under scrutiny include the Fox TV host Pete Hegseth, the nominee for defense secretary who was the subject of a sexual assault investigation in 2017, and Robert F Kennedy Jr, a conspiracy theorist and vaccine skeptic tapped for health secretary. Lankford also suggested that Pam Bondi, Florida\u2019s former attorney general chosen by the president-elect this week in place of Gaetz, should put aside her promise to seek legal retribution on Trump\u2019s political foes, if she is confirmed. Of the role, Lankford said: \u201cIt\u2019s America\u2019s lawyer. It\u2019s not the president\u2019s lawyer.

If there\u2019s only one clown in 81,634 that\u2019s not bad. I\u2019m disappointed with the result but it\u2019s always good to come to the home of rugby. There was a fantastic atmosphere. He said something, but I\u2019m not going to repeat it here because I\u2019ll get into trouble. Do you want me to get into trouble again?\u201d The RFU responded by saying that \u201cno coaches, players or match officials should be abused for doing their job\u201d. Before the match, Jamie George had said he expected supporters to show Jones \u2013 who by win percentage is England\u2019s most successful ever head coach and guided them to three Six Nations titles as well as the 2019 World Cup final \u2013 the respect he deserves. Jones has made headlines of late following claims by Care in his autobiography that he oversaw a toxic environment, ran a \u201cdictatorship\u201d and acted like a \u201cdespot who disappeared people\u201d by bullying staff members and players. Jones, who released two books during his seven-year tenure as England head coach, was asked whether he recognised those accusations. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you mate, I\u2019ve got a new book deal,\u201d he added. \u201cI just signed it today. It\u2019s going to be called \u2018Caring about Care\u2019 and you\u2019ll get all the details in there. I\u2019ve got pre-order forms up here, you can come up and get pre-order forms. Get them hot. I\u2019m serious, mate. I\u2019m very serious. If you want to read about it, read it in my book. That\u2019s how you get headlines, so I\u2019ll put a whole chapter in there \u201cCaring about Care\u201d, just for you.\u201d England ran out 59-14 victors to end their five-match losing streak and ensure Borthwick\u2019s side avoided slipping to a fourth straight defeat at Twickenham after narrow losses to New Zealand, Australia and South Africa this month. Borthwick said: \u201cThe obvious overriding feeling will be one of frustration to have come so close to getting results but not actually been able to convert them in the first three weeks. That will be one emotion. The other aspect of it was real positivity around how the team plays. I want the team to be brave with the ball. I want them to play fast. I think we\u2019ve seen growth in that area over the last four weeks.\u201d",

On this evidence, she\u2019ll be a fixture on the main show from now on.</p> <p>She formed a firecracker partnership with <strong>Jamie Borthwick</strong>. Born just 10 months apart, the pair hit it off immediately and clearly got on like a house on fire, laughing their way through training. He always had potential but Michelle taught him well, with Jamie becoming equally proficient in both ballroom and Latin. They deserved to dance onwards but getting to week 10 in her first full series was a fine achievement. We hope to see more of Michelle next year.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-24T20:19:30.158Z\">at 8.19pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-674386838f086501868e8d96\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-24T20:04:23.056Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pete is this year\u2019s escapologist</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He keeps on doing it. <strong>Pete Wicks</strong> has finished bottom of the judges\u2019 scoreboard for three of the past four weeks. Yet miraculously, he\u2019s still to appear in a dance-off. Week after week, the TOWIE alumnus gets hauled clear of danger by public votes. At least he has the decency to looked shocked each week when he escapes the red light of doom.</p> <p>Judging by scores, he should have departed four weeks ago. Pete averages fully five points fewer than <strong>Jamie Borthwick</strong>, who he\u2019s now outlasted. Pete is a hugely likeable contestant. Hs dry, dark humour provides a nice counterpoint to the gushing elsewhere, but he\u2019s barely in this year\u2019s top 10 hoofers, let alone quarter-finalist material.</p> <p>Is the whole of Essex hitting the phones? Does his pro partner <strong>Jowita Przystal</strong> have a low-key large fanbase? Or do viewers just love to see an unlikely dance journey from a total novice?

In my opinion, yes. Jamie had a busy week filming on the shouty Albert Square soap, so his training time was reduced this week. However, his foxtrot was still better than the 32 points it received. Being knocked out second from the samba-thon also appeared tough.</p> <p>Week after week, the judges seemed to critique and mark him harshly, especially compared to the likes of <strong>Pete Wicks </strong>or <strong>Wynne Evans</strong>. They\u2019d be praised for effort, characterisation or even their outfits, while Jamie bore the brunt of the technical nit-picking. Was the panel frustrated that he wasn\u2019t fulfilling his potential? Trying to dispel any whiff of in-house BBC bias? Overcompensating so he wasn\u2019t seen as a ringer after winning last year\u2019s Christmas special? Either way, it often seemed unfair but Jamie always took it on the chin.</p> <p>Perhaps his problem was that he peaked mid-series and never quite hit those heights again. He was \u201cpaso-bleeding-tastic\u201d (copyright Craig) in week five and wowed with his Addams Family American smooth, jointly topping the leaderboard in consecutive weeks with 39 and 39 points respectively. Jamie\u2019s other highlights were his slinky rumba, his holiday rep salsa, his Elton John quickstep, his Argentine tango to the Arctic Monkeys - and, of course, flying into Blackpool Tower Ballroom astride a giant sparkly ketchup bottle. Saucy.</p> <p>He deserved a week or two more - especially considering he was still to do a crowd-pleasing Charleston or Couple\u2019s Choice. Showman Jamie surely would have excelled in Musicals Week. Instead he follows his bromance buddy Wynn<strong>e </strong>out of the contest. At least they can console each other over a pint at the Queen Vic.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-24T20:20:59.802Z\">at 8.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-674385bd8f086501868e8d91\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-24T20:01:38.335Z\">8.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jamie and Michelle\u2019s last dance</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the departing pair hug tightly and take trip the light fantastic to End Of The Road by Boyz II Men, the credits roll and their castmates lift them shoulder high.</p> <p>Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674385918f08849211a43e27\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-24T19:59:56.150Z\">7.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Michelle\u2019s sweet exit speech</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>His pro partner <strong>Michelle Tsiakkas </strong>returns the compliment: \u201cIt goes without saying Jamie is an amazing dancer.

Tasha Ghouri has topped the leaderboard six times and been one point away from perfection three times. Can she achieve that extra point and notch the first maximum of the series? After last week\u2019s paso, she\u2019s going from serious to smooth. A song full of feeling and a dance to match. Ballroom boy Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec\u2019s favourite dance is the foxtrot, so he\u2019s in his element. Emotionally connecting and full of romance. Smooth, dreamy and floaty. She\u2019s equally at ease in and out of hold. Precise with lovely long limbs. Expressive, an impressive standing leg-flex and spinning lift. Tasha looked like a pro. Cute as hell. Enough Hollywood-style wow factor for 10s? Quite possibly.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi. The Glaswegian troubadour\u2019s 2018 chart-topper was written in response to the death of his grandmother. He performed it right here in the ballroom the following year. The single\u2019s video starred his distant relative, actor Peter Capaldi of Doctor Who/sweary spin doctor Malcolm Tucker fame.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T21:06:13.719Z\">at 9.06pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-674234fb8f087ff7bcc44242\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T20:04:20.814Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: </strong>8, 10, 9, 10 for a total of 37 points.

The song lyrics seem all too apt. Can Montell Douglas forget her troubles and dance her cares away? Fast dances tend to suit the former sprinter. As she flies across the floor, she needs to keep her feet light and her frame strong. Jazzy opening, then into a smooth, elegant and energetic quickstep. Charleston flicks and kicks, lovely leaps, up on the toes and balls of her feet. Big smiles, bags of style. Joyous.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Get Happy by Ella Fitzgerald. The jazz queen\u2019s version of the song written in 1930 and made famous by Judy Garland. Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga performed it in recent film Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.

However, Chris admits he\u2019s been having trouble with the paso all week in training.

He\u2019s also been finding the paso\u2019s curved body positions and unnatural posture tough to master. Traditional red outfits.

Good knee-walks and aggressive stamps but lacking Spanish line. Improved as it went on and strong finish but for me, not his best. Raucous reception in the studio.

It\u2019s been four weeks since Jamie Borthwick did ballroom and he\u2019s enjoyed being back in hold with Michelle Tsiakkas in training this week. The storytelling for this classic foxtrot is a tribute to the couple\u2019s support from their nearest and dearest, hence the song choice. The judges will be picky about details (and they tend to be tough on his anyway), so he needs to keep the footwork clean with heel leads on the slow steps. Vintage cinema styling. Nice posture and long neck. A bit safe, maybe. Did I detect a couple of balance wobbles and a mid-routine footwork fluff? Graceful glide around the floor and otherwise gaw-jus.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Stand By Me by Ben E. King.

This Roaring Twenties-style Charleston is ideal to bounce back. With dapper art deco-style styling, it\u2019s pretty traditional Charleston fare, packed with content. Fast and physical, with bags of musicality and characterisation. Entertaining lifts and tricks. High-energy and keeping up the pace well. Nice pendulum swing of the arms and plenty of that all-important swivel. A clunky lift but solid synchronisation. Swagger and style. He looks understandably shattered by the end.

She has now scored six 10s during the contest. Can she add to that? A rumba is a technically tricky dance to do it. She needs to rein in her trademark bouncy energy for the slow, sensual dance of seduction. Moody solo works to start. Nice romantic mood and connection. Sarah showing control from feet to fingers. The keys to the rumba are rhythm and hip action. Sarah\u2019s seem pretty good to me. Spins, floor slides, turns and drops. Lots of poise, perhaps lacking a little sizzling passion but otherwise truly terrific.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Chains by Tina Arena. The 1994 power ballad reached number six on the UK chart.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for watching along with me, glittery gang. Our Strictly six now dance into the quarter-final, the last themed show of the series, with routines inspired by West End and Broadway hits. Fancy dress and jazz hands pretty much compulsory. I don\u2019t make the rules. It airs next Saturday at 7.05pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to decide who\u2019s a long-running hit and who\u2019s a box office bomb. In the meantime, it\u2019s our fridge magnet motto: keeeeep dancing! Thank you and a glittery goodnight. joanieloves says: \u201cJamie is really sweet. He did well but Montell was in a different league. Brilliant quickstep. Going to be tactical voting next week. If Pete doesn\u2019t go I\u2019ll be fuming.\u201d Dunntalkin says: \u201cSugababes, eh? Let\u2019s hope they make it all the way through the performance without having a massive row and breaking up.\u201d Finally, Inspissatedman adds: \u201cPete? Is that you?? I\u2019ve a John Sergeant on line 2. Can you take his call right now, please?\u201d girlpanic says: \u201cIt\u2019s such a shame that after such a great show last night, the dance-off has left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth tonight. Neither couple deserved to be there and the person who should have been there inexplicably got through on the public vote. I\u2019m very sad to see Jamie &amp; Michelle go this week.\u201d acanthe says: \u201cI actually feel quite sorry for Pete. He\u2019s probably got a real case of survivor\u2019s guilt.\u201d DancingMom says: \u201cI have loved Jamie\u2019s \u2018journey\u2019 this season. He is such a lovely lad. Michelle is a sweetie. Too soon for them to exit. Seriously. Wow.\u201d MartGray adds: \u201cIs that the first time this year a celeb has been lifted? Jamie deserves it.\u201d EmmyHarb says: \u201cI can\u2019t see Chris or Tasha being in a dance-off so fear it could be Montell again next week unfortunately.\u201d jagadox says: \u201cWhat we seem to have in the quarter final are two real dancers in Sarah and Tasha. One sort-of-dancer in JB, and three non-dancer actual journey-ists in Chris, Pete and Montell. Whatever the ins and outs of who people think should or shouldn\u2019t still be there, it\u2019s interesting.\u201d A rapidfire vox pop of your choreographic comments. Rufusonly says: \u201cNeither were the worst in the competition and I actually preferred Jamie\u2019s rather sweet foxtrot. Michelle is a gorgeous dancer and gave an emotional farewell speech. I don\u2019t know who is keeping Pete in but they have no appreciation of dance.\u201d MikeMoonlight says: \u201cJamie really should have just handed his partner Michelle some divorce papers and said \u2018Happy Christmas, my sweet!\u2019, before walking off the dancefloor whilst Dave Arch and his wunnerful orchestra played some \u2018Doof Doof Doofs\u2019.\u201d TV viewers can now stay on BBC One for Antiques Roadshow from Belfast\u2019s Botanic Gardens, flip to ITV1 for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? or to Channel 4 for All Aboard! Scotland\u2019s Poshest Train. At 9pm, choose from Wolf Hall: The Mirror &amp; The Light on BBC One, I\u2019m A Celebrity on ITV1 or Queen Camilla: The Wicked Stepmother? on Channel 4. If you\u2019re feeling filmic, there\u2019s Last Christmas (9pm on BBC Three), Raging Bull (10pm on BBC Two) or Boxcar Bertha (10pm on Sky Arts). We started the series with a 9-6 men-to-women split, which pundits put down to problems recruiting female celebrities in the wake of Strictly\u2019s summer of scandal. Well, 10 weeks later, we\u2019ve finally got ballroom parity. Our surviving six comprises three male celebrities and three females. The ballroom battle of the sexes is on. We said it last week. We\u2019ll say it again. Montell Douglas didn\u2019t deserve another dance-off. Judging by the scoreboard alone, this should have been an all-male affair with Pete Wicks or even Chris McCauasland facing Jamie in the dance-off. However, once again Montell tumbled from the top half of the leaderboard into the bottom two. She\u2019s prevailed over Sam Quek, Wynne Evans and now Jamie Borthwick in the dance-off, showing admirable fighting spirit. Thank her sporting background and Gladiatorial fire. Judge Motsi Mabuse hailed her as \u201cthe comeback queen\u201d After three appearances in four weeks, Montell looks doomed to be in the dance-off every week until she\u2019s finally beaten. Undeservedly, considering she\u2019s the contest\u2019s third highest scorer and by rights a potential finalist. All Montell can do is keep working, keep dancing and hope the viewer votes come. At least she\u2019s got the gorgeous Jojo Radebe as her chief cheerleader. Cypriot-Sri Lankan professional Michelle Tsiakkas has spent three years as part of the Strictly troupe but this was her first series with a celebrity partner. On this evidence, she\u2019ll be a fixture on the main show from now on. She formed a firecracker partnership with Jamie Borthwick. Born just 10 months apart, the pair hit it off immediately and clearly got on like a house on fire, laughing their way through training. He always had potential but Michelle taught him well, with Jamie becoming equally proficient in both ballroom and Latin. They deserved to dance onwards but getting to week 10 in her first full series was a fine achievement. We hope to see more of Michelle next year. He keeps on doing it. Pete Wicks has finished bottom of the judges\u2019 scoreboard for three of the past four weeks. Yet miraculously, he\u2019s still to appear in a dance-off. Week after week, the TOWIE alumnus gets hauled clear of danger by public votes. At least he has the decency to looked shocked each week when he escapes the red light of doom. Judging by scores, he should have departed four weeks ago. Pete averages fully five points fewer than Jamie Borthwick, who he\u2019s now outlasted. Pete is a hugely likeable contestant. Hs dry, dark humour provides a nice counterpoint to the gushing elsewhere, but he\u2019s barely in this year\u2019s top 10 hoofers, let alone quarter-finalist material. Is the whole of Essex hitting the phones? Does his pro partner Jowita Przystal have a low-key large fanbase? Or do viewers just love to see an unlikely dance journey from a total novice? Whisper it but Pete couldn\u2019t make it all the way to the final\u2026 Could he? The doof-doofs have sounded on EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick\u2019s secondment to BBC stablemate Strictly - but has he departed too soon? In my opinion, yes. Jamie had a busy week filming on the shouty Albert Square soap, so his training time was reduced this week. However, his foxtrot was still better than the 32 points it received. Being knocked out second from the samba-thon also appeared tough. Week after week, the judges seemed to critique and mark him harshly, especially compared to the likes of Pete Wicks or Wynne Evans. They\u2019d be praised for effort, characterisation or even their outfits, while Jamie bore the brunt of the technical nit-picking. Was the panel frustrated that he wasn\u2019t fulfilling his potential? Trying to dispel any whiff of in-house BBC bias? Overcompensating so he wasn\u2019t seen as a ringer after winning last year\u2019s Christmas special? Either way, it often seemed unfair but Jamie always took it on the chin. Perhaps his problem was that he peaked mid-series and never quite hit those heights again. He was \u201cpaso-bleeding-tastic\u201d (copyright Craig) in week five and wowed with his Addams Family American smooth, jointly topping the leaderboard in consecutive weeks with 39 and 39 points respectively. Jamie\u2019s other highlights were his slinky rumba, his holiday rep salsa, his Elton John quickstep, his Argentine tango to the Arctic Monkeys - and, of course, flying into Blackpool Tower Ballroom astride a giant sparkly ketchup bottle. Saucy. He deserved a week or two more - especially considering he was still to do a crowd-pleasing Charleston or Couple\u2019s Choice. Showman Jamie surely would have excelled in Musicals Week. Instead he follows his bromance buddy Wynne out of the contest. At least they can console each other over a pint at the Queen Vic. As the departing pair hug tightly and take trip the light fantastic to End Of The Road by Boyz II Men, the credits roll and their castmates lift them shoulder high. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. His pro partner Michelle Tsiakkas returns the compliment: \u201cIt goes without saying Jamie is an amazing dancer. He\u2019s improved so much week by week. He\u2019s worked so hard to get to where he is. \u201cIt\u2019s my first year with a partner and I\u2019ve realised that it\u2019s so much more than just the dancing and technique. It\u2019s the bonds and the friendships that you make. I waited two years for a partner and I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way.\u201d Her voice wobbles too. Well said again. In his farewell speech, an emotional Jamie Borthwick tells Tess: \u201cStrictly is magic, that\u2019s all I can say. Not just everyone who you see in front of the camera, these four here [the judges], but everyone who works on this show. I have such a good bond and relationship with them. What made me want to do this show is the people, not what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve had the best time. \u201cI could ramble on all day about Michelle. She\u2019s a new pro and she\u2019s absolutely been the most amazing teacher. We have laughed like you wouldn\u2019t believe. I have nothing but the utmost respect for everyone on the show, so thank you.\u201d Well said, sir. It\u2019s unanimous. Twirley Shirley says she\u2019d have decided the same. There we have it. The majority vote means that Jamie Borthwick and Michelle Tsiakkas become the ninth couple to depart the Strictly 2024 dancefloor. Montell and Jojo, saying \u201cboth couples could have been winners\u201d. Montell and Jojo, saying \u201ctoughest dance-off in a long time but based on details\u201d. Montell and Jojo, saying \u201cboth fantastic but purely for technique and performance\u201d. Tight. Neither deserves to go in my book but let\u2019s hear from the quartet whose decisions count. Shirley and Motsi both scored Montell two points more than Jamie last night, FYI. Anton scored her one point more. Craig gave them both an eight. Montell Douglas and her dance partner Johannes Radebe reprise their quickstep to Get Happy by Ella Fitzgerald. The judges said last night that light and bright with bags of personality and much improved body connection, although Craig picked up on a slightly stiff beginning and iffy head position. She scored 37 points, five more than Jamie, so surely just needs to maintain the standard and she\u2019ll be fine. Jamie Borthwick and his pro partner Michelle Tsiakkas have another go at their foxtrot to Stand By Me by Ben E. King. The judges said last night that his right arm was lacking and his neck too stiff. They said Jamie needs to go to the next level, be more free and show more feeling because it was a bit monotone. It scored 32 points, five fewer than Montell, so he needs to show serious improvement here. Choreographic accompaniment comes from the two Ns, Nancy Xu and Neil Jones. Time for this week\u2019s musical interlude and it\u2019s another poptastic one. Sugababes - back to their original and best line-up of Mutya Buena, Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy and Keisha Buchanan - perform a medley of their hits. There\u2019s a bit of Overload, Freak Like Me and Push The Button all thrown in there. Live vocals and everything. Pete Wicks is reeling that he\u2019s through to Musicals Week and will be waltzing to West Side Story next week. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks. He\u2019ll learn. More banter with the duos returning next week. Chris thinks musicals are \u201cpointless, grow up\u201d but is delighted that the Buswells\u2019 arrival in the UK hasn\u2019t proved \u201ca jinx\u201d. Dianne Buswell recalls her dad Mark booing her eight-year-old rivals at a childhood dance contest. Attaboy. Which means that despite their stunning quickstep taking them to third spot on the scoreboard, Montell Douglas and Johannes Radebe are in the dance-off again. That\u2019s a shame. Blimey. He was rock bottom of the scoreboard but has been saved by the public again. Rightly so but it must have been his nerviest wait yet. That pesky crimson spotlight is back to reveal who\u2019ll face Jamie in the dreaded dance-off. Anton hails Montell Douglas\u2019 quickstep. Motsi bigs up the feeling and quality of Tasha Ghouri\u2019s American smooth and praises Craig for \u201cfinding the courage\u201d to touch his 10 paddle. Brave boy. Shirley says Sarah\u2019s rumba \u201cwas the most difficult choreography for a lady that we\u2019ve ever seen on Strictly\u201d. Big talk, La Ballas. Huge. Craig explains his \u201cbeef\u201d with Sarah Hadland. Plant-based alternatives are available. It\u2019s never too early for a flouncy sleeve detail from Shirley. The famous foursome Riverdance over to Claudia\u2019s teal banquette for a closer look at last night\u2019s routines. When worlds collide, it can be beautiful. What a gorgeous celebration of dance in all its forms. Breathing in each other\u2019s styles. Sharing the same language of movement. Lovely. (And surely we need a celebrity in a wheelchair in the Strictly line-up next year?) It\u2019s a passionate and sultry performance, set to Robyn\u2019s 2007 banger With Every Heartbeat. Tune. Something different for this week\u2019s group number. Five Strictly pros - namely Nadiya Bychkova, Nikita Kuzmin, Karen Hauer, Carlos Gu and Kai Widdrington - partner five dancers of different styles, including a wheelchair dancer. Claudia\u2019s latest gem of a link: \u201cTess will be wearing a technicolour dreamcoat. I\u2019ll be haunting an opera house. On a totally separate note, it\u2019s Musicals Week.\u201d Wowser indeed, Winklevoss. Aljaz and Tasha will be performing an Argentine tango (yay!) to the musical Six (oh). JB and Lauren are flying a kite with Mary Poppins next week. Chim-chim-cheroo. Up in the Clauditorium, the relieved couples chit-chat with La Winkle. I think that\u2019s what Vito was saying, anyway. Jamie really is jolly nice. He professes to be secretly pleased he\u2019s in the dance-off, since he can perform that foxtrot again. Well, he was joint second bottom of the scoreboard so perhaps that\u2019s no surprise. Viewer votes haven\u2019t saved the EastEnders actor, meaning he must foxtrot again for survival with pro partner Michelle Tsiakkas. After a mid-table finish, she\u2019ll be breathing a big sigh of relief but deservedly progresses. No surprise after her perfect 40. Justice is done. JB was the star of last night, alongside Tasha. He\u2019s the first quarter-finalist. The dreaded scarlet spotlight of doom is here. Time to find out who\u2019s qualified for the quarter-final and who\u2019s dancing again for survival. The judging panel take their floor-side seats. Craig presumably gave himself a stern talking-to after awarding that 10. Our seven pro-celebrity pairs anxiously await the results. At least they\u2019re doing so in relatively sensible clothing, unlike last week. *pink trousers squeak* A reminder of Saturday night\u2019s live show on-screen now. Chris McCausland\u2019s fight with a bull (and the paso doble dance moves)! Dianne Buswell\u2019s adorable dad Mark! JB Gill\u2019s cheeky Charleston! Sarah Hadland\u2019s romantic rumba! Tasha Ghouri\u2019s stunning American smooth! Craig\u2019s lesser-spotted 10 paddle! Samba-thon silliness! Here are our hostesses with the mostest, so let\u2019s run the rule over their finery. Tess Daly is a gold halterneck with black trews. Claudia Winkleman in all-white. Claud wins, making it one-all this weekend. Roll clap-along credits. Which of these couples will soon be sent home in a sparkly minicab? Quick, clutch Storm Bert in ballroom hold and steer him around the dancefloor. We\u2019re about to be beamed back to Elstree Studios\u2026 Pete Wicks versus Montell Douglas. That was many viewers\u2019 predictions for tonight\u2019s dance-off. As always, though, the public vote throws in a fascinatingly random factor. A mere five minutes to wait now\u2026 These pandas get a perfect 10 from me. The latest instalment of awe-inspiring, David Attenborough-narrated wildlife epic Asia just drawing to a close on BBC1. Tonight we\u2019re in the continent\u2019s untameable forests, with Bengal tigers trying to feed their cubs and greater one-horned rhinos fighting for territory. A bit like Craig and Anton. It\u2019s a mere 10 minutes until glittery go-time\u2026 Tonight\u2019s group number sees five Strictly professionals teaming up with five dancers of different styles. Should be an intriguing mash-up. Expect tricks, surprises and high impact. Fasten your sparkly belts and prepare for twinkle-toed take-off. It\u2019s 15 minutes until the clock strikes sequins\u2026 Not only did the consistently excellent Tasha Ghouri top the leaderboard for the seventh time in 10 weeks - but she scored the first maximum of the series. Her American smooth with pro partner Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec left the judges lost for words. After eight 39-point scores, three of which Tasha\u2019s, hard-to-please judge Craig Revel Horwood finally dusted off his 10 paddle. Now the floodgates have been opened, will we see a flurry of 10s over the next three weeks? It\u2019s 20 minutes until showtime\u2026 Tonight\u2019s musical guests are the Noughties girl group with the ever-changing personnel - but now restored to its original and best line-up. The mighty Sugababes will be performing a medley of their hits, rather like the Pet Shop Boys in Blackpool last weekend. It\u2019s 25 minutes until the glitterball starts spinning round, round, baby, round, round, spinning out on me\u2026 Coming into this weekend, Pete Wicks was odds-on favourite for elimination. After a tepid tango, he duly finished bottom of the scoreboard for the second week running. Normally this would be elimination form but will voting viewers ride to his rescue again? Might we see a dance-off shocker? Half an hour until we get our first clues\u2026 Somebody is about to be axed from the all-singing, all-dancing Strictly cast. Good evening and welcome to the latest elimination from Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your cyber-dance partner for tonight\u2019s results show. Please watch along with me as the ninth celebrity bows out, falling agonisingly short of the musical theatre-themed quarter-final. Of our magnificent seven surviving pro-celebrity pairs, only six will progress to next Saturday\u2019s Musicals Week. The judges\u2019 scores have been combined with the public vote and tonight the bottom two will be consigned to the dreaded eliminator. So who might not dance into December? Last night saw the first perfect 40-point score of the series as Tasha Ghouri left the judges speechless with her pro-standard American smooth. After JB Gill won the inaugural samba-thon, he joined Tasha at the top of the leaderboard. Way down the bottom was Pete Wicks, with Chris McCausland and Jamie Borthwick just above. But will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Montell Douglas and even Sarah Hadland could come into the reckoning. It\u2019s results showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and mild-to-medium snark. So get cosy on this wet \u2019n\u2019 windy Sunday evening and see you on the sofa. As ever, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for glittery gossip. I\u2019ll foxtrot down there every now and again, showing off my Rolls Royce footwork, to see what you\u2019re all saying. The West End and Broadway beckon for all but one pair. It\u2019s nearly time to staaaaaart quarter-final qualifying! That concludes Saturday\u2019s liveblog-athon but please feel free to carry on commenting, my sequin-spangled pals. Meet you right back here for the results show, which airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1. I\u2019ll reboot the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so please rejoin me then. In the meantime, I\u2019m @michaelhogan on so-called X and @michaelhogan100 on Bluesky/Threads, so feel free to promenade run past and say hi. Thanks, as always, for watching along with me. Truly one of the happiest corners of cyberspace each weekend. See you tomorrow but in the meantime, you know very well what to do: keeeeeep dancing! Goodnight and stay safe. Dance-off predictions? It should be Pete Wicks and he would surely go, regardless of who he\u2019s up against. Jamie Borthwick? Montell Douglas again would be unjust. Finally, MikeMoonlight says: \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on this week? We\u2019ve had mostly traditional dances in nice, flattering costumes with appropriate music and fairly sensible comments from the judges. I DEMAND the show ends with the judges climbing on the desk and shrieking \u2018tens all round\u2019 whilst someone performs a street commercial workout routine in a panda onesie to the Wurzels\u2019 I Am A Cider Drinker.\u201d Emasl2023 adds: \u201cNote to producers: could you please take Neil out of the Clauditorium and hide him behind a pillar?\u201d On the samba-thon, emilyscatnaps says: \u201cJamie out second? That\u2019s a surprise. Pete? Not so much, but a great response to run!\u201d diamondcat says: \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t want to be crashing into another couple.\u2019 Well, no. That\u2019s probably a given.\u201d Dunntalkin adds: \u201cThe samba-thon. At last a proper bit of competition - with no grans or \u2018journey\u2019 to distract from the dance.\u201d LekisP says: \u201cThat was sensational from Tasha and Aljaz. Perfect music too. She\u2019s not my favourite but fair play.\u201d fihema says: \u201cThis is quite sublime from Tasha and Aljaz. The music was momentarily distracting, but the dancing was wonderful. Just beautiful. It\u2019s a shame they don\u2019t give her enough air-time to build her presence on the show.\u201d girlpanic adds: |That was just beautiful from Tasha and Alija\u017e. The lifts were incredible and it was just mesmerising to watch. I love her skirt too.\u201d On Montell Douglas\u2019 quickstep, MollyintheFolly says: \u201cLovely frock and great colour on Montell, lovely dance and one of my favourite songs. She\u2019s one of the few celebs who doesn\u2019t look like she has to gallop across the floor!\u201d Phoebe adds: \u201cHuge improvement from MoJo this week. That was such a delightful contrast to the stompyness of last week. They both have stunning costumes and looked so light and joyful floating round the dancefloor.\u201d On Chris McCasuland\u2019s paso, VictoriasSecret says: \u201cJust noticed Dianne moving her skirt so Chris doesn\u2019t stand on it. One of the fascinating things about this partnership is all the small adjustments that have to be made and are done so unobtrusively.\u201d Heroica says: \u201cI knew this wouldn\u2019t be the dance for Chris. How could it be? He is still amazing, Dianne is out of this world as a teacher, but Chris cannot dance every dance well, it\u2019s just not possible.\u201d JoMK73 adds: \u201cI love the intelligence in that choreography for Chris\u2019 paso. Enormous amount of effort has gone into that . What a tremendously difficult feat to dance that when you cannot see any modelling. I love Chris and everything he is doing on this show.\u201d On Jamie Borthwick, whistledownthewind says: \u201cI thought that was quite an elegant and classy foxtrot from Jamie but it was such an unshowy dance that I fear for him this week.\u201d KabinBoy says: \u201cThese are harsh, I say again, harsh comments.\u201d Heartticker says: \u201cWonderful traditional foxtrot from Jamie. No silly gimmicks, just pure dancing. I\u2019m not sure why the judges are always so hard on him.\u201d ReclinedPotato adds: \u201cYou got to hand it to Jamie. All these weeks and he\u2019s yet to see the inside of the spray tanner\u2019s booth.\u201d On JB and Lauren\u2019s lovely number, ABH2018 says: \u201cNice trad Charleston with good swivel and characterisation. The odd hesitation?\u201d MarkRoche says: \u201cNo disrespect to Amy, but JB being partnered with Lauren has been the making of him. Proper Charleston to proper music. Loved that.\u201d Phoebe adds: \u201cHoorah! A proper Charleston to proper music with proper costumes. Heaven!. The Charleston dearth is overcome!\u201d Aine183 says of Sarah Hadland: \u201cVery powerful and fast for a rumba. I didn\u2018t even know that was an option.\u201d LazyMillennial (nice handle!) says: \u201cI like Sarah but the rumba still looks like Sexy Yoga to me.\u201d Somersetlass adds: \u201cAnother very weird song choice, and not my favourite of Sarah and Vito\u2019s dances - it didn\u2019t have their usual chemistry. However, it did have beautiful lines and the bonus of Vicky Gill running out of buttons.\u201d A rapid-fire round-up of your comments. Puddingspoons says: \u201cPete\u2019s got the rescue dogs out, might get my vote for that alone.\u201d KarimaKat says: \u201cDog rescue? I have two as well but this is just corny emotional tosh. Desperate.\u201d Louylou99 says: \u201cThat tango never really started for me. Difficult music to tango to as well.\u201d Acanthe adds: \u201cWell, if Pete goes out this week at least he\u2019s going out looking good rather than ridiculous. Though tangoing to Easy Lover is in itself, ridiculous!\u201d TV viewers can now flip to BBC Two for Take That At The BBC. At 9pm, choose from I\u2019m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here on ITV1 (go, Oti!) or Norwegian drama State Of Happiness returns to BBC Four. At 9.25pm, there\u2019s Boybands Forever on BBC Two or Moonflower Murders on BBC One. If you fancy a film, tonight\u2019s picks are Shirley Valentine (9pm on 5Star), Superbad (9pm on Comedy Central) or Knives Out (10.25pm on Channel 4). Bonus points if you guess whodunit and can impersonate Daniel Craig\u2019s preposto-accent. Let\u2019s open some gold lam\u00e9 envelopes. Here are this week\u2019s receipents of our coveted liveblog gongs\u2026 Best dance: Can\u2019t be anything other than Tasha\u2019s American smooth, Even Craig could only find a little finger to fault. Worst dance: Pete Wicks\u2019 tango. He fared better in the samba-thon but it could be time to go. Best music choice: JB and Lauren\u2019s Dixieland Charleston. Yes sir, that\u2019s my decision. Get Happy as runner-up. Worst music choice: The ropy version of Easy Lover which opened the show. Maybe the band hadn\u2019t warmed up yet. Best outfit: A tie between Tasha\u2019s lilac dress and Montell\u2019s hot pink one. Worst outfit: A non-specific gripe: too much grey. Best judges\u2019 comment: Motsi was on funny form but the prize goes to Anton\u2019s heartfelt paean to the beauty of dance after Tasha\u2019s American smooth. Best VT: Dianne\u2019s parents or Pete at the Dogs Trust. I\u2019m biased on the latter, since there\u2019s a Dogs Trust pooch snoozing beside me as I speak. Worst VT: JB on the farm. Too many animals. They\u2019re the new nannas. Best Claudia quip: Poking fun at the judgely chaos the last time we did a dance-athon. Also, nice \u201cshrobing\u201d with Carlos Gu\u2019s jacket. It seemed inevitable that Tasha Ghouri would be awarded the first perfect 40 of the series. She and Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec are the only remaining couple who\u2019ve never scored below 30 points and had notched 39 on three occasions before tonight. That American smooth was flawless. Worth the wait. With their usual scores and their samba-thon bonus points added together, JB Gill and Tasha Ghouri jointly top the standings. Pete Wicks is way down the bottom again, with Chris McCausland and Jamie Borthwick just above. As always, the viewer vote helps decide the dance-off duos. Sarah Hadland and Montell Douglas might also be in for a nervous wait. Tess and Claud tell us to \u201cKeeeeeep dancing!\u201d and we shall obey. As the samba rolls are scoffed, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. We rewind the night\u2019s seven dances on-screen. Surprisingly fuss-free samba-thon, wasn\u2019t it? Well, they\u2019ve had six years to practise. Voting lines are declared open for democratic business. Claudia\u2019s down on the dancefloor for a change, so no balcony bonkers-ness. Prop action restricted to the judging panel. Which twinkle-toed twosome are you voting for? Which two left-footed doofuses are you definitely not? Less head-scratching at iPads and deciphering of scrawled notes this time. thankfully. We have our result. JB Gill wins and scores the full seven points. Tasha Ghouri is runner-up with six points. It\u2019s JB vs Tasha as the final two, deservedly so. But who will be declared winner? Montell Douglas and Jojo Radebe are next off the floor, coming third. Sarah Hadland is next out. Bear with. Montell and Jojo looking like a two-person party here. Pete Wicks is next out and carries Jowita off the floor. Jamie Borthwick next out. Harsh. Justice for gingers. Booty-shaking from Pete Wicks. Jamie Borthwick looking great and confident. JB Gill looking great. Chris McCausland a bit slow and stilted. They\u2019re first out. Each couple wears colour-coded outfits, upcycled from the launch show. All seven have already danced the samba, so they should remember the moves. Now they\u2019ll try to add flourishes and tricks to catch the judges\u2019 eyes. Voltas, reverse rolls and botafogos ahoy. Who\u2019s got the requisite Rio bounce? Claudia suggests hiding in a dark corner to go under the radar. Craig makes reference to 2018. Drink! Some padding here, while we wait for Tasha and Alja\u017e to get changed. JB Gill and Tasha Ghouri both scored 37 points for their sambas earlier in the series, so they could be the ones to beat here. In fact, the only remaining celebrities to score sub-30 were Pete Wicks and Chris McCausland, both with 26 points. Right, this should be entertainingly chaotic. All seven couples will take to the floor at the same time and bust out their best samba moves. The judges will eliminate the pairings one-by-one until there\u2019s a winner, with them scoring between one point and seven points, depending on their position. This will be added to their main dance score before the public votes open. Clear as mud? Alja\u017e is crying, Pete Wicks is crying. I\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying. Judges\u2019 scores for Tasha and Alja\u017e: 10, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 40 points. Top of the pops and the first perfect score of the series. Celebratory chaos in the Clauditorium. Judges\u2019 comments for Tasha and Alja\u017e: Motsi says \u201cstunning, wow, perfection\u201d. Shirley says \u201cRolls Royce foxtrot, fantastic, Anton was actually crying\u201d. Anton says \u201cthis is why we dance, it made us feel joy\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cyour right little finger\u2026 one word, darling: fab-u-lous\u201d. Could we be about to see our first 40 or will Craig poop the party? Last dance before the samba-thon insanity. Tasha Ghouri has topped the leaderboard six times and been one point away from perfection three times. Can she achieve that extra point and notch the first maximum of the series? After last week\u2019s paso, she\u2019s going from serious to smooth. A song full of feeling and a dance to match. Ballroom boy Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec\u2019s favourite dance is the foxtrot, so he\u2019s in his element. Emotionally connecting and full of romance. Smooth, dreamy and floaty. She\u2019s equally at ease in and out of hold. Precise with lovely long limbs. Expressive, an impressive standing leg-flex and spinning lift. Tasha looked like a pro. Cute as hell. Enough Hollywood-style wow factor for 10s? Quite possibly. Song: Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi. The Glaswegian troubadour\u2019s 2018 chart-topper was written in response to the death of his grandmother. He performed it right here in the ballroom the following year. The single\u2019s video starred his distant relative, actor Peter Capaldi of Doctor Who/sweary spin doctor Malcolm Tucker fame. Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: 8, 10, 9, 10 for a total of 37 points. Second place with one dance to go. Judges\u2019 comments for Montell and Jojo: Shirley says \u201cpersonality-plus, bright and much better body connection, quite delightful\u201d. Anton says \u201cimproved, your best since that Couple\u2019s Choice, absolutely brilliant\u201d. Craig says \u201cstiff beginning, head position a bit Death Becomes Her, dynamic and great breakouts\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201csparkle and shine, you sold the product to me\u201d. An eight and three nines, do we predict? The double dance-off survivors go back to ballroom for the first time in three weeks, since that Whitney waltz in Icons Week. The song lyrics seem all too apt. Can Montell Douglas forget her troubles and dance her cares away? Fast dances tend to suit the former sprinter. As she flies across the floor, she needs to keep her feet light and her frame strong. Jazzy opening, then into a smooth, elegant and energetic quickstep. Charleston flicks and kicks, lovely leaps, up on the toes and balls of her feet. Big smiles, bags of style. Joyous. Song: Get Happy by Ella Fitzgerald. The jazz queen\u2019s version of the song written in 1930 and made famous by Judy Garland. Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga performed it in recent film Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux. It has soundtracked Strictly quicksteps by Kimberley Walsh and Pasha Kovalev in 2012, and Nicola Adams and Katya Jones in 2020 - as well as Frankie Bridge and Kevin Clifton\u2019s showdance in the 2014 final. Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: 7, 8, 9, 9 for a total of 33 points. Mid-table. Judges\u2019 comments for Chris and Dianne: Chris butters up Craig with some praise for his album. Craig says \u201cwonderful but lacked smooth Spanish flair, knees too high, solid and strong\u201d. Motsi says \u201cyou put Dianne first which is beautiful, loved the intention and commitment but uncertain in places\u201d. Shirley says \u201cimpressive steps and separations, nothing out of place, Dianne deserves her own little trophy\u201d. Anton concludes \u201ca Blackpool paso, loved it\u201d. Eights and the odd nine en route? Dianne Buswell\u2019s jet-lagged parents have arrived in the UK from Bunbury, Perth and are in the studio tonight, giving her an adorable intro. She\u2019ll want to wow them. It\u2019s off with the Blackpool tailcoat and on with the bull-fighting bolero jacket for her partner Chris McCausland. However, Chris admits he\u2019s been having trouble with the paso all week in training. He needs to play the powerful and serious matador but says \u201cThat\u2019s not me, I\u2019m a child in a man\u2019s body\u201d. He\u2019s also been finding the paso\u2019s curved body positions and unnatural posture tough to master. Traditional red outfits. Dramatic and intense attitude but not sure he\u2019s got the footwork and frame. Straining at times, visibly counting and hurrying to keep up. Good knee-walks and aggressive stamps but lacking Spanish line. Improved as it went on and strong finish but for me, not his best. Raucous reception in the studio. Ol\u00e9! Song: El Gato Montes by Manuel Panella. A song from the Spanish opera whose title translates as \u201cThe Wild Cat\u201d. A big favourite of tenor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. It has soundtracked previous Strictly pasos by Caroline Quentin and Natalie Gumede. Judges\u2019 scores for Jamie and Michelle: 8, 8, 7, 9 for a total of 32 points. Second from bottom as it stands. Judges\u2019 comments for Jamie and Michelle: Anton says \u201cI\u2019ve rubbed off on you, right arm lacking, beautiful but need to go to the next level and show more feeling\u201d. Craig says \u201clooked like you were wearing a neck brace, need to be freer and cheekier, bring more personality, swing and sway\u201d. Motsi says \u201cgreat job, your eyes sparkle, nostalgic vibe, showed your love of dance\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cone of the male frontrunners, nice but a bit monotone\u201d. They always seem extra harsh on Jamie, perhaps because he has so much potential. Eights incoming? What no giant sparkly ketchup bottle? It\u2019s been four weeks since Jamie Borthwick did ballroom and he\u2019s enjoyed being back in hold with Michelle Tsiakkas in training this week. The storytelling for this classic foxtrot is a tribute to the couple\u2019s support from their nearest and dearest, hence the song choice. The judges will be picky about details (and they tend to be tough on his anyway), so he needs to keep the footwork clean with heel leads on the slow steps. Vintage cinema styling. Nice posture and long neck. A bit safe, maybe. Did I detect a couple of balance wobbles and a mid-routine footwork fluff? Graceful glide around the floor and otherwise gaw-jus. Song: Stand By Me by Ben E. King. The gospel-influenced 60s soul song became a hit again in the 80s when it featured in the coming-of-age film of the same title and soundtracked a Levi\u2019s black denim ad - the one where handsome stuntman Eddie Kidd beat the bouncers by getting into a nightclub with a \u201cNo blue jeans\u201d policy. Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Lauren: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Top so far but when is that 40 coming? Judges\u2019 comments for JB and Lauren: Craig says \u201cpure class\u201d. Motsi says \u201cloosened up, very entertaining, loved it\u201d. Shirley says \u201cyou brought so much joy, amazing\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cthat was the best of you, brilliant\u201d. A 39-pointer? JB Gill\u2019s form dipped slightly with the last week\u2019s Blackpool quickstep, falling to mid-table after two weeks of being joint top. This Roaring Twenties-style Charleston is ideal to bounce back. With dapper art deco-style styling, it\u2019s pretty traditional Charleston fare, packed with content. Fast and physical, with bags of musicality and characterisation. Entertaining lifts and tricks. High-energy and keeping up the pace well. Nice pendulum swing of the arms and plenty of that all-important swivel. A clunky lift but solid synchronisation. Swagger and style. He looks understandably shattered by the end. Did it well. Song: Yes Sir! That\u2019s My Baby by Firehouse Five Plus Two. The 1950s Dixieland version of the 1925 standard. The band comprised members of Disney\u2019s animation department who discovered a love of jazz and began jamming during their lunch break. Judges\u2019 scores for Sarah and Vito: 8, 8, 10, 10 for a total of 36 points. Highest scoring rumba of the series. Judges\u2019 comments for Sarah and Vito: Shirley says \u201cthat choreography belonged in a major championship, full-on routine, flexible and sensual, best rumba of the series so far\u201d. Anton says \u201cone of your best dances, worked your legs so well, a complex routine but you nailed it\u201d. Craig says \u201ctechnically very good but lacked chemistry and real connection\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201ca Cuban rumba, impressive but needed more ooziness, soften your back and breathe\u201d. Two eights and two nines, do we think? Sarah Hadland notched her highest score with her Fosse-esque Couple\u2019s Choice in Blackpool, a near-perfect 39 points. She has now scored six 10s during the contest. Can she add to that? A rumba is a technically tricky dance to do it. She needs to rein in her trademark bouncy energy for the slow, sensual dance of seduction. Moody solo works to start. Nice romantic mood and connection. Sarah showing control from feet to fingers. The keys to the rumba are rhythm and hip action. Sarah\u2019s seem pretty good to me. Spins, floor slides, turns and drops. Lots of poise, perhaps lacking a little sizzling passion but otherwise truly terrific. Song: Chains by Tina Arena. The 1994 power ballad reached number six on the UK chart. The Melbourne diva also made it to the final of Australia\u2019s version of Strictly in 2013. Back to the balcony this weekend, after Blackpool\u2019s \u201ccommandeer a corner and pin up a glittery curtain\u201d improvised Clauditorium. La Winkle welcomes the new Radio 2 breakfast DJ as this week\u2019s VIP guest to read out the voting smallprint. Lobster hands ahoy. Judges\u2019 scores for Pete and Jowita: 6, 7, 8, 8 for a total of 29 points. Early to call it but dance-off danger. Judges\u2019 comments for Pete and Jowita: Motsi says \u201csuits you, stunning, brilliant open work but hesitant in hold\u201d. Shirley says \u201cyou had focus and improved your frame, fierce, did well\u201d. Anton says \u201ccredit where it\u2019s due, super posture, settle into your knees but keep improving\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cnot difficult to improive on last week (boo!), unsteady footwork , lacked timing and drive but loved the sharpness\u201d. Eights? Pete Wicks has peeled off his pink pleather trousers (presumably with the aid of talcum powder and Vaseline) and donned a sharp suit. He\u2019s the bookies\u2019 favourite for elimination but he prefers ballroom, loves this song and looks far more comfortable than he did in Blackpool. The characterisation of the tango should suit him, too. Monochrome styling. Sexy and passionate dance with stalking promenades and snapping turns. Some gapping in the close hold. Lacking a little cleanness and staccato action. Decent synchronisation and lifts but perhaps a little robotic and he\u2019s walking about too much rather than dancing. Song: Easy Lover by Philip Bailey &amp; Phil Collins. The pop-soul duet, co-written and performed by the singers from Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and Genesis respectively, topped the UK charts for four weeks in 1985. Craig Kelly and Flavia Cacace danced a cha-cha to it 15 years ago and were eliminated. An omen? Our magnificent seven pro-celebrity pairs are introduced. Not much fancy dress. Smart suits, lots of grey, matador jackets and Montell Douglas looking fab-ew-lous in pink. The judgely quartet sashay into view, having removed their sparkly seaside stetsons. Motsi Mabuse in a Pucci-style disco minidress. Shirley Ballas has a massive corsage thingy. And possibly some tiny dance shoes beneath her desk. Here come our autocue queens, so time for the traditional couture comparison. Tess Daly is in a red tuxedo suit. Claudia Winkleman is in black Chanel-style chic with white trim. Tess wins but only just. More than half these couples have now departed the dancefloor. Remember Toyah and Tom? Halcyon days, my friends. Roll the industry standard dramatic montage. Cooking doesn\u2019t get tougher than this! Oops, sorry, wrong show. Tug on your pink PVC trousers and wiggle your hips with excitement. We\u2019re about to go live to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 We\u2019re into double figures week-wise, with just three live shows left after tonight. This is very much the business end of the contest, with a spot in next week\u2019s quarter-final - a musicals-themed show - at stake. That glitterball trophy is beginning to glint temptingly on the horizon. Only five minutes until showtime now\u2026 The last episode of Alan Carr\u2019s Numberwang just wrapping up on BBC1. We won\u2019t miss it much when it\u2019s gone. Mere minutes to wait now\u2026 As well as Strictly\u2019s first ever samba-thon, we\u2019ll see seven different dance styles tonight, including four classic ballroom routines. We\u2019ll also be treated to a rumba, a paso doble and a Charleston. It\u2019s just 10 minutes until the choreographic kick-off\u2026 Stir up your plum duff in preparation because all six celebrity contestants are now confirmed for the Strictly Christmas Special. We can look forward to festive footwork from comedian Josh Widdicombe, drag artist Tayce, presenter Vogue Williams, Nitro from Gladiators (aka Olympic sprinter Harry Aikines-Aryeetey), actress Tamzin Outhwaite and racing driver Billy Monger. Any early predictions for the 2024 winner of the seasonal Strictly star? It\u2019s just 15 minutes until that ba-ba-da theme tune\u2026 Cross them off as you spot them on-screen! Take a drink for each! End up dancing around your living room in your own personal samba-thon! Here\u2019s your 10-point spotter\u2019s guide for tonight\u2019s proceedings: Reference to Pete Wicks having peeled off his pink pleather Blackpool trousers Craig Revel Horwood is consulted as the oracle of Charleston swivel Topical Bert-based reference to \u201cdancing up a storm\u201d Misty-eyed reference to Blackpool\u2019s \u201cspecial atmosphere\u201d, \u201csprung floor\u201d or \u201ciconic\u201d Tower Ballroom Anton du Beke crowbars in mention of his own Strictly saaarm-bas Motsi says Craig is \u201cobsessed\u201d with her Newly eliminated pro Katya Jones compensates by elbowing to the front of the Clauditorium Shot of Dianne Buswell\u2019s parents in the studio audience and they wave awkwardly at the camera Shirley says it\u2019s week 10, so she needs to clamp down on technical fundamentals Claudia makes a knowing gag about the lindyhop-athon meltdown six years ago For the first time this series - and not before time, in terms of scores - pink slack enthusiast Pete Wicks is bookies\u2019 odds-on tip for elimination this weekend. Montell Douglas is second favourite, with JB Gill in third. Can they defy the odds? Twenty minutes until the glittery curtain comes up\u2026 They\u2019ve made it past the towering Blackpool landmark. The bright lights of the pleasure beach are behind them. Still scrubbing sand from between their toes, our couples now return to the familiar Elstree Studios ballroom. No extra dancers or sprung floor. Nowhere to hide from the judges. Not long until the clock strikes sequins\u2026 The last time Strictly attempted a dance-athon in 2018, the judges got confused by all the simultaneous lindy-hopping and announced the wrong results. Claudia Winkleman had to intervene like an exasperated school teacher and untangle the hot mess, before recommending a stiff drink. Having taken six years to recover from the trauma, they\u2019re now trying it again. After they\u2019ve all performed their main routines tonight, our seven couples will take on their first competition-style floor dance. They will all perform a spicy samba at the same time, raising the tantalising prospect of collisions. The judges will confer and eliminate them pair-by-pair until there\u2019s a winner. They\u2019ll be awarded between one and seven points apiece, depending on their position, which will be added to their main score. It means each couple has practised two dance styles this week for the first time - their full routine, plus the samba - which could change the leaderboard considerably before the public vote opens. Who can deliver when it counts? We\u2019ll get our first clues in 25 minutes\u2026 Having danced back down the M6 from the Tower Ballroom, it\u2019s a homecoming show for our hoofers - but one pair will fall short of the quarter-final. Good evening and welcome to week 10 of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your speed-typing dance partner for tonight\u2019s live show. I\u2019d love you to watch along with me as our magnificent seven trip the light fantastic once again. They will also tackle Strictly\u2019s first ever samba-thon, bidding to make it through to next week\u2019s musicals-themed quarter-final. Last weekend\u2019s annual trip to Blackpool Tower Ballroom saw spectacular routines and even more spectacular trousers. Wynne Evans and Katya Jones were eliminated but what a stage to bow out on. Our seven surviving pro-celebrity pairings now return to the familiar surroundings of Elstree Studios - with extra points up for grabs in the climactic (and possibly chaotic) samba-thon. More on that in a moment. As always, tonight\u2019s scores will be combined with the public vote and the bottom two duos will hoof again for survival on Sunday night. Pete Wicks and Montell Douglas most at risk but the two Js, Jamie Borthwick and JB Gill, could also be in jeopardy. It\u2019s showtime at 7.05pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.35pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and glitter-dusted gags. So draw the curtains against Storm Bert and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As ever, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is at your dance disposal. I\u2019ll samba-walk down there intermittently to see what you\u2019re all saying and report on your reactions. Will Tasha Ghouri top the scoring yet again? Will Craig Revel Horwood finally dust off his 10 paddle? Will the sambathon give the judges a nervous breakdown? And will anyone be sporting an unwise tattoo from Blackpool seafront? It\u2019s nearly time to staaaart double dancing!",

      "bodyText": "Democratic US Senator Tammy Duckworth, who lost both her legs after the army Black Hawk attack helicopter she was piloting was shot down during the US war in Iraq, on Sunday ramped up criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for defense secretary who argues women shouldn\u2019t be on the front line. Pete Hegseth is the former Fox News host and soldier tapped by the president-elect to lead the Pentagon and oversee the largest military force in the world, but he is steeped in controversy. Hegseth vociferously opposes the recent hard-won right of US women to be officially allowed into combat. And he is tangled in past allegations of sexual misconduct \u2013 while the Pentagon has been struggling for years with how to prevent, deal with and punish sexual assault and harassment in the armed forces. Duckworth called Hegseth \u201cflat-out wrong\u201d on women in combat roles when she appeared on the CBS show Face the Nation on Sunday, and called him \u201cinordinately unqualified\u201d for the job of defense secretary. \u201cFrankly, America\u2019s daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons,\u201d she said. Hegseth made remarks in a podcast earlier this month arguing for turning back time on equality in the military, saying: \u201cI\u2019m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn\u2019t made us more effective. Hasn\u2019t made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated.\u201d The final barriers to women in combat were removed in 2015 when the military was ordered to open all jobs to anyone who met standards. But in reality, women had been in combat in substantial numbers, fighting on the front line, winning medals and losing their lives throughout the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Duckworth was shot down with a rocket-propelled grenade over Iraq in 2004. She was elected to the Senate to represent Illinois in 2016. She told CBS: \u201cWomen in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal. He\u2019s been out there saying women are not as strong [but] the ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing. So he\u2019s just flat out wrong.\u201d Duckworth is a member of the senate armed services committee. She noted that these days women serve in the infantry and special forces, such as the Navy Seals. She also appeared in the CNN studio earlier on Sunday, using her wheelchair, and said: \u201cOur military could not go to war without its 223,000 women who serve in uniform.\u201d She said that Hegseth served at a low level in the military and did not command any group larger than a platoon. \u201cMr Hegseth is not qualified for the position because he doesn\u2019t understand, apparently even after having served, that women are actually vitally important to an effective military.\u201d Hegseth, among the most controversial of Trump\u2019s already contentious cabinet choices was the subject of a sexual assault investigation in 2017 and he reportedly made a payment to a woman at the heart of the case in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement. Hegseth has denied all the allegations and said the encounter in question was consensual. Duckworth said that she hoped the Senate committee would speak to the woman during the confirmation process next year, although she suspected it would \u201croll over for Mr Trump\u201d and not do that once it has a Republican chair when the GOP assumes the senate majority. \u201cRemember we have just fought over a decade of fights and overhauled the military in its treatment of sexual trauma, it\u2019s frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr Trump would nominate someone who has admitted he paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not someone who you want to lead the department of defense,\u201d she said.",

Ministers will begin a public consultation on Tuesday seeking views on the proposals, which they say are designed to eradicate a \u201cculture of cover-up\u201d in the NHS. It follows a series of scandals over the last decade at trusts including Morecambe Bay, East Kent and Shrewsbury and Telford. A statutory duty of candour making NHS managers legally accountable for responding to concerns about patient safety could also be introduced as part of the government\u2019s plans. Measures being considered include \u201cstatutory barring mechanisms\u201d, similar to systems used for teachers, which could see health bosses who have been deemed to be unfit to practise appearing on a centrally held list. Tens of thousands of clinical and non-clinical managers work in the NHS but there is no single framework to regulate them in the same way as there is for doctors and nurses. The consultation will run for 12 weeks, after which ministers will consider responses and set out the next steps. Karin Smyth, a minister in the Department of Health and Social Care, said the proposals formed part of the government\u2019s plans to end the \u201crevolving door\u201d that allows failing bosses to continue working in the NHS. \u201cTo turn around our NHS we need the best and brightest managing the health service, a culture of transparency that keeps patients safe, and an end to the revolving door that allows failed managers to pick up in a new NHS organisation,\u201d she said. Regulation would prevent the loophole that allows managers with a record of poor performance or misconduct to continue to work in the health service, government sources said. Options being considered by the consultation include a voluntary accreditation register, statutory barring mechanisms and full statutory registration. Patients, health and care staff and professional bodies are also being asked for their views on whether to introduce a statutory duty of candour which would make NHS managers legally accountable for responding to concerns about patient safety. At a minimum, all board-level directors in NHS organisations in England, arm\u2019s length body board level directors and integrated care board members will be regulated under the new system, government sources said. Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England, said it was right that managers faced the same level of accountability as other staff, but it was critical that regulation came alongside the necessary support to \u201cenable all managers to meet the high quality standards that we expect\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of new areas of northern Gaza, setting off a fresh wave of civilian displacements on Sunday as intense airstrikes continued across much of the territory.</p> <p>In Jerusalem, a senior minister said the war in Gaza was far from over and that Israel would stay \u201cfor years\u201d in the territory.</p> <p>\u201cGaza will never be a threat to the state of Israel, no matter how long it is going to take \u2026 I think that we are going to stay in Gaza for a long time \u2026 I think most people understand that that will be years, \u201csaid Avi Dichter, a member of Israel\u2019s security cabinet.</p> <p>The Israel Defense Forces said the evacuation orders for the Shujaiya neighbourhood were issued after Palestinian militants fired rockets at Israel on Saturday from a location within the densely populated district. Hamas\u2019s armed wing said it had targeted an army base over the border.</p> <p>The IDF routinely circulates warnings by social media, pamphlets and phone calls, telling people to leave areas that will be attacked. \u201cFor your safety, you must evacuate immediately to the south,\u201d an IDF post on X said.</p> <p>Families living in the targeted areas began fleeing their homes after nightfall on Saturday and into Sunday\u2019s early hours, witnesses and Palestinian media said. Images on social media showed hundreds leaving Shujaiya on donkey carts and rickshaws, with others, including children carrying backpacks, walking.</p> <p>The humanitarian situation in northern Gaza has been described as apocalyptic by humanitarian officials, with tens of thousands suffering acute lack of water, sanitation, food and medical supplies.</p> <p>The IDF has blockaded three north Gaza towns \u2013 Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun \u2013 since launching a major offensive early last month which it says is aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping there.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do \u2026 They [Hamas] have new people \u2026 They still have infrastructure because we haven\u2019t reached every single place in all Gaza,\u201d Dichter told reporters.</p> <p>Israeli leaders have repeatedly said that one major aim of the military offensive in Gaza is to free hostages seized during the Hamas attacks into Israel in October last year. About 100 hostages are believed to remain in the territory, though half are thought to be dead.</p>    <p>On Saturday, a spokesperson for the armed wing of Hamas said a female Israeli hostage in the group\u2019s custody had been killed in an unspecified northern area where the Israeli army had been operating.</p> <p>Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, said contact had been restored with the woman\u2019s captors after a break of several weeks and it was established that the hostage was dead, but did not identify the hostage or say how or when she was killed.</p> <p>The IDF said it was investigating the Hamas report. \u201cHamas continues to engage in psychological terrorism and act in a cruel manner,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p> <p>During their attack into Israel last year, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 250 hostages back to Gaza. About half of those abducted were released in a short-lived ceasefire in November.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 people, mostly civilians. Nearly all the enclave\u2019s 2.3 million population have been displaced at least once, and swathes of the narrow coastal territory have been reduced to rubble.</p> <p>People in northern Gaza say they fear the goal is to permanently depopulate a strip of territory as a buffer zone, which Israel denies, and say Israeli forces have blown up hundreds of houses since beginning the new offensive.</p> <p>Dichter, a security veteran recently appointed to the food security portfolio, said that once there was \u201can agreement or end of the war\u201d displaced people would be able to return home.</p> <p>In central Gaza, health officials said at least 10 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli airstrikes on the urban refugee camps of al-Maghazi and al-Bureij since Saturday night. </p> <p>The new strikes come after a bloody few days, with Palestinian medics saying Israeli military strikes across Gaza killed at least 120 Palestinians on Friday and Saturday. </p> <p>Other attacks were reported to have targeted the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, injuring its director.</p>    <p>Hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel also intensified against the background of continuing negotiations. Analysts say both sides are seeking to better their negotiating position.</p> <p>Hezbollah claimed in a statement on Sunday that it attacked the Ashdod naval base in south Israel with a squadron of drones. The Israeli military said it was unaware of the incident, which would be the first time a base so deep in Israel was targeted by Hezbollah in 13 months of fighting.</p> <p>The Lebanon-based Islamist militant organisation, which is supported by Iran, also launched successive waves of rockets into northern and central Israel. Almost all were intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence systems though seven injuries were reported.</p> <p>Israeli soldiers continued to advance on the ground in south Lebanon over the weekend, with clashes reported between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters in the coastal town of al-Bayada. </p> <p>Hezbollah-affiliated media claimed its fighters were engaged in close-quarters fighting with Israeli forces who were cutting off roads to key villages in south Lebanon. Residents of Deir Mimas, a Christian village in the south, said Israeli soldiers installed a checkpoint on the road outside the village and instructed the 30 or so residents who remained in the town to stay in their homes until further notice.</p> <p>An Israeli strike on an army centre killed a Lebanese soldier and wounded 18 others in the south-west between Tyre and Naqoura, Lebanon\u2019s military said. The Israeli military expressed regret, saying the strike occurred in an area of combat against Hezbollah and that the military\u2019s operations were directed solely against the militants.<br><br>Israeli strikes have killed more than 40 Lebanese troops since the start of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, even as Lebanon\u2019s military has largely kept to the sidelines.<br><br>Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, condemned the latest strike as an assault on the US-led ceasefire efforts, calling it a \u201cdirect, bloody message rejecting all efforts and ongoing contacts\u201d to end the war.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of new areas of northern Gaza, setting off a fresh wave of civilian displacements on Sunday as intense airstrikes continued across much of the territory. In Jerusalem, a senior minister said the war in Gaza was far from over and that Israel would stay \u201cfor years\u201d in the territory. \u201cGaza will never be a threat to the state of Israel, no matter how long it is going to take \u2026 I think that we are going to stay in Gaza for a long time \u2026 I think most people understand that that will be years, \u201csaid Avi Dichter, a member of Israel\u2019s security cabinet. The Israel Defense Forces said the evacuation orders for the Shujaiya neighbourhood were issued after Palestinian militants fired rockets at Israel on Saturday from a location within the densely populated district. Hamas\u2019s armed wing said it had targeted an army base over the border. The IDF routinely circulates warnings by social media, pamphlets and phone calls, telling people to leave areas that will be attacked. \u201cFor your safety, you must evacuate immediately to the south,\u201d an IDF post on X said. Families living in the targeted areas began fleeing their homes after nightfall on Saturday and into Sunday\u2019s early hours, witnesses and Palestinian media said. Images on social media showed hundreds leaving Shujaiya on donkey carts and rickshaws, with others, including children carrying backpacks, walking. The humanitarian situation in northern Gaza has been described as apocalyptic by humanitarian officials, with tens of thousands suffering acute lack of water, sanitation, food and medical supplies. The IDF has blockaded three north Gaza towns \u2013 Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun \u2013 since launching a major offensive early last month which it says is aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping there. \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do \u2026 They [Hamas] have new people \u2026 They still have infrastructure because we haven\u2019t reached every single place in all Gaza,\u201d Dichter told reporters. Israeli leaders have repeatedly said that one major aim of the military offensive in Gaza is to free hostages seized during the Hamas attacks into Israel in October last year. About 100 hostages are believed to remain in the territory, though half are thought to be dead. On Saturday, a spokesperson for the armed wing of Hamas said a female Israeli hostage in the group\u2019s custody had been killed in an unspecified northern area where the Israeli army had been operating. Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, said contact had been restored with the woman\u2019s captors after a break of several weeks and it was established that the hostage was dead, but did not identify the hostage or say how or when she was killed. The IDF said it was investigating the Hamas report. \u201cHamas continues to engage in psychological terrorism and act in a cruel manner,\u201d a spokesperson said. During their attack into Israel last year, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 250 hostages back to Gaza. About half of those abducted were released in a short-lived ceasefire in November. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 people, mostly civilians. Nearly all the enclave\u2019s 2.3 million population have been displaced at least once, and swathes of the narrow coastal territory have been reduced to rubble. People in northern Gaza say they fear the goal is to permanently depopulate a strip of territory as a buffer zone, which Israel denies, and say Israeli forces have blown up hundreds of houses since beginning the new offensive. Dichter, a security veteran recently appointed to the food security portfolio, said that once there was \u201can agreement or end of the war\u201d displaced people would be able to return home. In central Gaza, health officials said at least 10 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli airstrikes on the urban refugee camps of al-Maghazi and al-Bureij since Saturday night. The new strikes come after a bloody few days, with Palestinian medics saying Israeli military strikes across Gaza killed at least 120 Palestinians on Friday and Saturday. Other attacks were reported to have targeted the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, injuring its director. Hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel also intensified against the background of continuing negotiations. Analysts say both sides are seeking to better their negotiating position. Hezbollah claimed in a statement on Sunday that it attacked the Ashdod naval base in south Israel with a squadron of drones. The Israeli military said it was unaware of the incident, which would be the first time a base so deep in Israel was targeted by Hezbollah in 13 months of fighting. The Lebanon-based Islamist militant organisation, which is supported by Iran, also launched successive waves of rockets into northern and central Israel. Almost all were intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence systems though seven injuries were reported. Israeli soldiers continued to advance on the ground in south Lebanon over the weekend, with clashes reported between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters in the coastal town of al-Bayada. Hezbollah-affiliated media claimed its fighters were engaged in close-quarters fighting with Israeli forces who were cutting off roads to key villages in south Lebanon. Residents of Deir Mimas, a Christian village in the south, said Israeli soldiers installed a checkpoint on the road outside the village and instructed the 30 or so residents who remained in the town to stay in their homes until further notice. An Israeli strike on an army centre killed a Lebanese soldier and wounded 18 others in the south-west between Tyre and Naqoura, Lebanon\u2019s military said. The Israeli military expressed regret, saying the strike occurred in an area of combat against Hezbollah and that the military\u2019s operations were directed solely against the militants. Israeli strikes have killed more than 40 Lebanese troops since the start of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, even as Lebanon\u2019s military has largely kept to the sidelines. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, condemned the latest strike as an assault on the US-led ceasefire efforts, calling it a \u201cdirect, bloody message rejecting all efforts and ongoing contacts\u201d to end the war.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019ll be all from me, with David Hytner\u2019s report in. Thanks for joining! Ruben Amorim comes over to speak to the Sky pundits, including Roy Keane. He\u2019s a very clear, direct talker. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough league. \u201cI think my players were thinking too much during the game. You can feel it. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough match. We lost some balls without pressure and when you start a game like this, you score one goal, you have to control the ball, you have to control the tempo of the game. We cannot do it at the moment. \u201cBut they tried, they really, really tried. They want this.\u201d Oh, and Ed Sheeran interrupts the conversation to get pally with Jamie Redknapp. Just a normal day in the Barclays. It wasn\u2019t the most memorable game, United\u2019s most lively moment saved for the second minute. Amorim is calling his players together, getting them to go an applaud the visiting supporters. Ipswich could well have had the win, denied by some excellent saves from Andr\u00e9 Onana. Not the dream start for Ruben Amorim, but no disaster either. 90+4 min: Muric holds on to Fernandes\u2019 delivery. That should be that. 90+3 min: Amad bursts into life on the right, driving into the box, launching his stepovers before cutting in for a shot that is blocked away. United win a corner. 90+1 min: We have four minutes added on. Clarke hooks the ball from the centre circle to the right wing but sends it out, unable to cope with the pressure of the onrushing Mazraoui. 90 min: Hutchinson\u2019s cross from the right causes little damage. 88 min: The home support bursts into noise, recognising one last push is required. 87 min: The free-kick is played short and eventually sees the subs work together with Clarke finding Chaplin inside the area, his shot from around 10 yards not finding the power or precision to trouble Onana. 86 min: Clarke is bundled down in midfield to win a free-kick from 30 yards or so. Mason Mount is on for Garnacho. 85 min: It\u2019s not really clicking for either side, genuine chances a rarity. Garnacho\u2019s cross from the left fails to find H\u00f8jlund. 81 min: Liam Delap, after a very lively display, is off, as is Wes Burns. Conor Chaplin and Ali Al-Hamadi are on. 80 min: Mazraoui is down on the ground to prompt a pause in the game. 79 min: Fernandes lines it up, Amad next to him. The captain lets loose and is inches away \u2026 a dipping effort just wide of the post as Muric moved to his right. 78 min: Fernandes wins United a free-kick by the D, opening up a decent chance \u2026 77 min: United work it patiently before Zirkzee, outside the area, on the right, launches a shot into Ipswich city centre. 75 min: Muric cleans up at the back after Zirkzee wins the ball off Davis on United\u2019s right. The keeper\u2019s clearance meets the body of the linesman, who deals with the blow gracefully. 73 min: Fernandes finds Garnacho on the left, the winger launching the stepovers before firing a cross in \u2026 there\u2019s no red shirt on the end of it. 71 min: Delap, again, somehow carves out space in the middle with a neat flick and sets off before launching a hit over the bar. He\u2019s a good watch, feisty to go with obvious talent. 69 min: Ipswich escape from the danger of the corner before Mazraoui silkily plays out from the back, leading to H\u00f8jlund shaping up to shoot from the edge of the box \u2026 a wayward pass is the result when he should probably have had a crack. 67 min: Fernandes plays a cracking first-time ball down the left for Rashford to hop on to \u2026 he wins a corner. Amorim sees McKenna\u2019s bet and raises, H\u00f8jlund and Zirkzee on for Eriksen and Rashford. 65 min: Ipswich makes their first changes: Szmodics and Cajuste are replaced by Jack Clarke and Jack Taylor. 64 min: United fans chant Amorim\u2019s name, bathing in the excitement of a new relationship. 62 min: It\u2019s all a bit quiet again after the more enticing action in the first few minutes of the half. United are struggling to break into the Ipswich half and keep the ball there. 59 min: Amad is working hard from a defensive point of view, tracking a run into the United box to cut out the long ball. It\u2019s a proper shift, being a wing-back. 57 min: Shaw is the left-sided centre-half, with Dalot continuing at left wing-back. 56 min: Time for a couple of tweaks. Luke Shaw returns after a long lay-off, replacing Jonny Evans. Casemiro is off for Ugarte. 55 min: O\u2019Shea makes a fine block as Fernandes hits inside the area after playing a one-two with Rashford. 54 min: Cajuste saves Ipswich as United launch a counter, nailing a sliding challenge inside the area to deny Garnacho from letting loose. 52 min: Excellent from Delap who bats away pressure in the centre circle to turn and push forward before finding Burns the right. A cross comes in, Delap tries a back-flick at the near post but he can\u2019t seem to beat Onana tonight. The United goalkeeper is big again, unable to be beaten, saving his side again. 50 min: Casemiro and Eriksen aren\u2019t pleading for the ball when United\u2019s backline have it; it\u2019s hard to see how the visitors cut through Ipswich\u2019s shape at the moment. 48 min: Ipswich get their passing game going as the crowd rediscovers its voice. 46 min: Casemiro plays a nice diagonal ball for Dalot to pick up on to before Fernandes slides in Garnacho inside the area \u2026 his ball in from the left is palmed away by Muric. United begin brightly. United get us going in the second half, no changes at the break. In comes an email with the subject line: \u201821 day cooling off period in contract.\u2019 \u201cWhen the next flight to Lisbon?\u201d writes Aidan Adair. Tom Hopkins writes in on VAR\u2019s little break from action: \u201cGreat to see that minor emergency dealt with so efficiently. Good process.\u201d It\u2019s Ipswich who look the better, more well-drilled side, their equaliser thoroughly merited. Welcome to Manchester (yes, I know this is at Portman Road), Ruben. 45+3 min: Delap bundles down Mazraoui on Ipswich\u2019s left wing and there\u2019s a bit of squaring up between the two. 45+2 min: Watching the replays of Hutchinson\u2019s strike \u2026 there may have been a deflection off Mazraoui\u2019s head that gave the ball an extra lift to beat the reach of Onana. 45+1 min: Ouch. Jonny Evans is down on the ground after Delap flies into him to try and win a header. 45 min: VAR\u2019s back, and we\u2019ve got three minutes added on. Ipswich are threatening \u2026 and here comes a stunner! Burns passes to Hutchinson outside the area, the 21-year-old\u2019s back to goal. He turns and lets fly with his left foot, curling into the top left corner from 20-something yards. It\u2019s well deserved for the hosts. 40 min: A stunning save from Onana! A long ball down the left is seized upon by Davis, who lays off to Delap in the middle, just the keeper to beat from a few yards \u2013 he opts for power over accuracy and the keeper makes himself big to deny an equaliser, the right arm flung out. 38 min: Tuanzebe v Garnacho is a good battle to watch at the moment, the former United defender refusing to let the winger out of his sight. 37 min: According to the TV comms, there\u2019s a fire alarm at Stockley Park so VAR is not currently operational. The ref lets the captains know. 36 min: Ipswich look more dangerous than United \u2026 before Fernandes plays a zipping through ball for Garnacho to run on to. He can\u2019t break free and shoot though. 33 min: Leif Davis, Ipswich\u2019s left-back, is down with his right leg being seen to. He seems OK though. 32 min: It\u2019s time for another Ipswich corner, Davis to swing in: he goes to the far post, it\u2019s headed across goal, cleared to Hutchinson for a stinging strike inside the area. But the wall of red shirts cannot be broken. 30 min: Fernandes pulls off a fine self-nutmeg dummy to break free in midfield but the move ends with Dalot\u2019s cross, cutting in from the left, finding Muric. 29 min: Hutchinson looks ready to hit it \u2026 and does with some venom \u2026 but it\u2019s too central, straight into the hands of Onana. 28 min: Hutchinson turns in the middle of the park to get Ipswich flying forward and Delap wins a free-kick on the edge of the box after Evans gets in the way \u2026 25 min: United do seem quite conservative on the ball at the back, trying to play around Ipswich rather than through them. They\u2019re not finding any gaps to carve through the hosts. 24 min: Davis swings in an Ipswich corner from the right \u2026 Onana stands firm to collect. 22 min: Amad is back on his feet and heads away a cross before Ipswich\u2019s Morsy takes down Garnacho in the middle of the park. 20 min: We\u2019ve got time to take in the replays of the first goal: it was a stellar run from Amad down the right after playing a one-two. Rashford\u2019s anticipation was important, too, getting on the end of a slightly scuffed cross. 19 min: Amad is on the floor, wriggling around in quite a bit of pain after feeling some Ipswich studs. 18 min: Garnacho beats Tuanzebe to the ball out on the left wing, feeds Fernandes who rolls it back to the Argentinian: a low, curling effort is sent wide. 15 min: Garnacho switches the ball to Amad who dinks the ball into Fernandes\u2019 path before danger is snuffed out by Ipswich. Dalot seems to have a playmaking role out on the left, inviting pressure before playing a cutting pass into the middle. 14 min: Dalot takes a few years for a throw-in, inviting whistles from the home support. 12 min: Ipswich sit off as United play it around at the back. 11 min: Onana is forced into action for the first time in the game, getting low to his right to make a fine stop, denying Szmodics who went first-time from outside the area, the ball rolled in perfectly from the right wing. Ipswich look alive, despite their early misstep. 8 min: United play out from the back with De Ligt at the centre of the back three in this new formation. Evans pushes forward into the Ipswich half as part of United\u2019s press but the hosts beat it and Burns fires in a teasing cross from the right that no-one can get on the end of. 6 min: Dalot skips down the left before finding Bruno in the middle with a fine pass. The lively Diallo then locates Eriken, who has a crack from the edge of the D \u2026 he shoots wide. 5 min: Ipswich have a corner headed away strongly by Casemiro. Well, that was quick. Amad Diallo, in at right wing-back, launches a rampaging run down the wing, dinks a cross to the near post and Marcus Rashford beats Arijanet Muric to the ball to slot in comfortably from close range. Amorim plays it cool with the celebrations. 1 min: United\u2019s 3-4-3 has Dalot at left wing-back, with Mazraoui at right centre-back. Ruben Amorim\u2019s Manchester United are underway. Ipswich kick things off. Touchline fashion watch: Ruben Amorim has the puffer parka zipped up. Let\u2019s go! Before we get going, here\u2019s Rick Harris: \u201cIt takes time to turn around the fortunes of any large underachieving business, so Ineos should be cut some slack surely?

That\u2019s what I want and I want my players to win the game, and they\u2019re capable to do that.\u201d Regular contributor krishnamoorthy v is ready for chaos: \u201cWhile Amorim could not have asked for a better first match, I am wondering what would be the state of Man U fans should United manage to blow this.\u201d \u201cYeah I\u2019ve got hope, first impressions have gone down well with me,\u201d writes Neil Carter. \u201cPerforms well in front of the press, looks very much at ease and smiles, this is a huge part of football these days. Along with keeping the talent engaged and happy. \u201cThe style of play seems set in stone and I\u2019m interested to see how it goes, but the premier league being what it is (the hardest) I fear he may need a plan B or C if he\u2019s gonna succeed. \u201cFor now I\u2019ll be watching and won\u2019t be getting carried away one way or another.\u201d Ipswich make one change from the team that beat Spurs, Wes Burns replacing Ben Johnson. Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Alejandro Garnacho are in for United \u2013 I presume Marcus Rashford will play centrally as Rasmus H\u00f8jlund is on the bench. Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia, all making their way back from injuries, could be called upon too. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re looking: Ipswich: Muric, Tuanzebe, O\u2019Shea, Burgess, Davis, Morsy, Cajuste, Burns, Hutchinson, Szmodics, Delap Subs: Walton, Harry Clarke, Woolfenden, Chaplin, Taylor, Al Hamadi, Townsend, Luongo, Jack Clarke Manchester United: Onana, Dalot, Evans, de Ligt, Diallo, Casemiro, Eriksen, Mazraoui, Fernandes, Garnacho, Rashford Subs: Bayindir, Mount, H\u00f8jlund, Zirkzee, Malacia, Antony, Shaw, Ugarte, Mainoo Which was the one where you thought it was all going to be OK again? I thought it with Louis van Gaal, just after he\u2019d taken the Netherlands to bronze at the World Cup. I guess I thought it with Mourinho, too. And then Solskj\u00e6r when he had his honeymoon phase. Oh well. Desperate for that sweet, sweet \u2018Rise of Ruben Amorim\u2019 content? Here you go: Right then, United fans, are you feeling it again? You know it, that dangerous thing that pops up every couple of years with the appointment of a new manager. Hope. This guy\u2019s the real deal, you say and genuinely believe. Before you know it you\u2019re 3-0 down at Brighton, the camera pans to Ferguson in the stands and the veterans are raging once again on The Overlap, inviting one of their old mates back to talk about the good times. Will Ruben Amorim change the story and somehow avoid all his hair growing grey by January? The answer begins at Portman Road against an Ipswich side that finally has a win on the board after beating Spurs before the international break. Kieran McKenna, linked with the United job in the summer, could well play the villain. Feel free to share your thoughts, queries, wisdom, reviews of Gladiator II, whatever you fancy.",

      "body": "<p>It was plainly too good to be true. Or to last. There were 82 seconds on the stadium clock when the Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United was jumpstarted. The new manager had put his faith in Marcus Rashford in the No 9 role and it was United\u2019s great enigma who put them in front. Rashford charged about in the early running, a point to prove.</p> \n<p>And yet it was the prompt for a slow retreat by United for the remainder of the first half. The structure was different, United set up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/22/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-vortex\">Amorim\u2019s trademark 3-4-2-1</a>, but the players were the same, along with plenty of the frustrations and faultlines from Erik ten Hag\u2019s tenure. Control proved elusive. As it did so often under Ten Hag.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out\">Ruben Amorim says Manchester United will \u2018suffer\u2019 after fast start fizzles out</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ipswich were the better team before the interval and the excellent Omari Hutchinson got the goal they deserved before the end of it with a shot from distance that took a deflection off Noussair Mazraoui. Ipswich had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/tottenham-ipswich-premier-league-match-report\">won for the first time</a> this season at Tottenham before the international break. This was in point-gained territory for them.</p> \n<p>Not so for United. After all of the talking and, goodness gracious, there has been some talking, Amorim\u2019s arrival feeling like the coming of the messiah, it was time for United to fire some optimism. They could not do it. They were a bit better in the second period but not hugely and it looked as though the players had too much to process in terms of instructions. It all became stilted. Then again, as everyone knows, least of all Amorim, it will take time. He has only had two training sessions with the full squad.</p> \n<p>United had risen one place in the table on Saturday without playing \u2013 evidence, the club\u2019s support hoped, of Amorim\u2019s magic \u2013 and there was always going to be a spotlight on his first starting XI. Amorim talked on Friday about the need to \u201cadapt some players\u201d because he did not have the right profiles for his three-at-the-back system and there were a few square pegs in round holes, especially the left-footed attacking midfielder Amad Diallo at right wing-back.</p> \n<p>Amorim did not have three fit specialist centre-halves \u2013 there were four out with injuries \u2013 and so it was the full-back, Mazraoui, on the right of the back three. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in central midfield did not scream revolution. Or pace and intensity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bb83d3e5-70e2-46fc-b9d1-0ba9ec342ff7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Roy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports\u2019 punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as \u2018a better pundit than manager\u2019. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should \u2018discuss it in the car park\u2019.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Talk about the dream start, an element of vindication, because it was Diallo who made the goal. He moved smartly through the gears up the right wing and, having slipped a tackle from Jens Cajuste, his low cross was made to measure for Rashford. The travelling United fans had chorused Amorim\u2019s name after 30 seconds. They belted it out on loop for the next couple of minutes.</p> \n<p>Ipswich stabilised. It was clear that Hutchinson had the beating of Casemiro and Jonny Evans, who played on the left of United\u2019s back three. Hutchinson, in the right-sided No 10 role, was sharp with his turns and very quick.</p> \n<p>Amorim was a presence at the edge of his technical area. This is what coaching on the hoof looks like and it had to alarm him that United sank deeper. They looked to hurt Ipswich with long diagonal passes but it was the home team that took a grip on the midfield.</p> \n<p>The equaliser had been advertised, Andr\u00e9 Onana busy in the United goal. He had pushed away a first-time hit from Sammie Szmodics in the 11th minute but the big save came in the countdown to half-time. Leif Davis stepped inside Diallo and he waited for the move of Liam Delap, putting the ball on a plate for him. Eight yards out, Delap put his foot through it only for Onana to throw out a big right hand, Peter Schmeichel-style, to block.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions\">Manchester United\u2019s joyless incoherence will destroy any illusions</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>United\u2019s reprieve did not last long. Inevitably, it was Hutchinson, checking away from Casemiro on the right-hand edge of the area, quick feet to the fore. His curler flicked off Mazraoui\u2019s head to deceive Onana on its way in.</p> \n<p>United pressed more on to the front foot after the restart, although they might have conceded when Delap tricked away from Matthijs de Ligt and surged through the middle. De Ligt looked awfully slow. Delap went right to Wes Burns and sprinted to meet the cross, his spectacular flick kept out by Onana.</p> \n<p>Alejandro Garnacho had worked Arijanet Muric from a tight angle at the start of the second half. And there was the moment on 54 minutes when he led a break with Rashford available inside for the pass, Cajuste the only Ipswich defender. Garnacho looked for Rashford; Cajuste made the crucial interception.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3ec1fdbe-d67c-40f0-9c58-2204eda52a4a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gt1GyBzBuQg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Amorim searched for the solution. He got Luke Shaw on at left centre-half for his first football of the season, ordering him to stay close to Hutchinson. Manuel Ugarte replaced Casemiro. It was Rasmus H\u00f8jlund for Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee was introduced in the right-sided No 10 role, Bruno Fernandes dropping back into midfield. There was a late sighting of Mason Mount, who came on for Garnacho.</p> \n<p>United could not make it happen. Fernandes curled a free-kick inches wide and it might have been worse for them if the Ipswich substitute, Conor Chaplin, had shot either side of Onana from a cross by another replacement, Jack Clarke. Not for the first time, Onana stood tall.</p>",

The structure was different, United set up in Amorim\u2019s trademark 3-4-2-1, but the players were the same, along with plenty of the frustrations and faultlines from Erik ten Hag\u2019s tenure. Control proved elusive. As it did so often under Ten Hag. Ipswich were the better team before the interval and the excellent Omari Hutchinson got the goal they deserved before the end of it with a shot from distance that took a deflection off Noussair Mazraoui. Ipswich had won for the first time this season at Tottenham before the international break. This was in point-gained territory for them. Not so for United. After all of the talking and, goodness gracious, there has been some talking, Amorim\u2019s arrival feeling like the coming of the messiah, it was time for United to fire some optimism. They could not do it. They were a bit better in the second period but not hugely and it looked as though the players had too much to process in terms of instructions. It all became stilted. Then again, as everyone knows, least of all Amorim, it will take time. He has only had two training sessions with the full squad. United had risen one place in the table on Saturday without playing \u2013 evidence, the club\u2019s support hoped, of Amorim\u2019s magic \u2013 and there was always going to be a spotlight on his first starting XI. Amorim talked on Friday about the need to \u201cadapt some players\u201d because he did not have the right profiles for his three-at-the-back system and there were a few square pegs in round holes, especially the left-footed attacking midfielder Amad Diallo at right wing-back. Amorim did not have three fit specialist centre-halves \u2013 there were four out with injuries \u2013 and so it was the full-back, Mazraoui, on the right of the back three. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in central midfield did not scream revolution. Or pace and intensity. Talk about the dream start, an element of vindication, because it was Diallo who made the goal. He moved smartly through the gears up the right wing and, having slipped a tackle from Jens Cajuste, his low cross was made to measure for Rashford. The travelling United fans had chorused Amorim\u2019s name after 30 seconds. They belted it out on loop for the next couple of minutes. Ipswich stabilised. It was clear that Hutchinson had the beating of Casemiro and Jonny Evans, who played on the left of United\u2019s back three. Hutchinson, in the right-sided No 10 role, was sharp with his turns and very quick. Amorim was a presence at the edge of his technical area. This is what coaching on the hoof looks like and it had to alarm him that United sank deeper. They looked to hurt Ipswich with long diagonal passes but it was the home team that took a grip on the midfield. The equaliser had been advertised, Andr\u00e9 Onana busy in the United goal. He had pushed away a first-time hit from Sammie Szmodics in the 11th minute but the big save came in the countdown to half-time. Leif Davis stepped inside Diallo and he waited for the move of Liam Delap, putting the ball on a plate for him. Eight yards out, Delap put his foot through it only for Onana to throw out a big right hand, Peter Schmeichel-style, to block. United\u2019s reprieve did not last long. Inevitably, it was Hutchinson, checking away from Casemiro on the right-hand edge of the area, quick feet to the fore. His curler flicked off Mazraoui\u2019s head to deceive Onana on its way in. United pressed more on to the front foot after the restart, although they might have conceded when Delap tricked away from Matthijs de Ligt and surged through the middle. De Ligt looked awfully slow. Delap went right to Wes Burns and sprinted to meet the cross, his spectacular flick kept out by Onana. Alejandro Garnacho had worked Arijanet Muric from a tight angle at the start of the second half. And there was the moment on 54 minutes when he led a break with Rashford available inside for the pass, Cajuste the only Ipswich defender. Garnacho looked for Rashford; Cajuste made the crucial interception. Amorim searched for the solution. He got Luke Shaw on at left centre-half for his first football of the season, ordering him to stay close to Hutchinson. Manuel Ugarte replaced Casemiro. It was Rasmus H\u00f8jlund for Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee was introduced in the right-sided No 10 role, Bruno Fernandes dropping back into midfield. There was a late sighting of Mason Mount, who came on for Garnacho. United could not make it happen. Fernandes curled a free-kick inches wide and it might have been worse for them if the Ipswich substitute, Conor Chaplin, had shot either side of Onana from a cross by another replacement, Jack Clarke. Not for the first time, Onana stood tall.",

Nearly half of Scotland\u2019s local councils are considering a mandatory levy on overnight stays, known as a tourist tax, to help cope with a surge in visitors that has overwhelmed places such as Skye, the Callanish stones on Lewis and Orkney\u2019s neolithic sites. Highland council, home to some of the most under-pressure hotspots such as the fairy pools on Skye and Glenfinnan viaduct, has started consulting local businesses and residents about a 5% levy on all overnight stays which could come into effect in late 2026. On Monday, the Welsh government will announce proposals for a visitor levy mirroring powers introduced in law by the Scottish parliament this year, and similar taxes in major European cities such as Berlin and Barcelona. Ministers in Cardiff say it will raise extra money for councils to invest in tourism and amenities, particularly in the areas most popular with visitors such as Gwynedd in the north, Pembrokeshire in the south-west and Cardiff. Edinburgh is due to become the first place in the UK where a mandatory levy is in force, in July 2026, after council leaders rebelled after an upsurge in Airbnb rentals, congested and soiled streets, and with global hotel companies profiting from visitors. The city expects to raise up to \u00a350m a year from a 5% surcharge on overnight stays.

The costs of over-tourism in Scotland were highlighted this month when the travel guide Fodors added the North Coast 500 road route which circles the west coast and Highlands to its \u201cNo list\u201d due to its \u201cuntenable popularity\u201d. The route\u2019s fame, particularly among British holidaymakers, has led to tensions with local people. Motor homes choke its often narrow single track roads and dump waste on rural verges; sports car drivers have used it for races and campsites have been overwhelmed. Highland council expects it could raise \u00a310m a year from the levy, which could be invested in French-style aires, or motorhome camping areas, if locals call for those in a consultation it launched last week. Ken Gowans, the council\u2019s economy and infrastructure chair, said: \u201cRight now we don\u2019t have a sustainable tourism offer in the Highlands. The cause of the wear and tear isn\u2019t local people, but they\u2019re having to pay for it through their council tax. \u201cIf we have this money, not only will we be able to maintain services and infrastructure, we can improve them. We welcome tourists openly but if we want people coming back, we should improve the experience.\u201d A survey by the Guardian of mainly rural councils in Scotland found that 13 are considering the levy, including Orkney, Shetland and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles), which are carrying out a joint review. Cities such as Aberdeen and Stirling are also looking at it. Hoteliers and tourism businesses in some of those areas, and in Wales, have said it could deter visitors, reduce spending and increase red tape. One hotelier in Inveraray in Argyll and Bute described it as \u201cfinancial suicide\u201d. Rob Dickson, the director of industry and events at VisitScotland, which supports the levy, said many tourism businesses realised during the Covid crisis that the sector needed to invest in the places they worked in to make it sustainable. A well-written policy would allow tourism firms to help design the scheme. \u201cTourism should be good for everybody. It should be good for the visitor, it should be good for the businesses and it should be good for the places they visit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis type of long term investment [from the levy] should help grow the value of the visitor economy.\u201d Meanwhile, visitors to the Lake District could be charged for bringing a car or staying overnight in order to preserve the future of the national park, a charity has suggested, after a report found tourism was placing an \u201cinvisible burden\u201d on the area. The report, Who Pays for the Lake District?, by the sustainable tourism expert Dr Davina Stanford and the landscape charity Friends of the Lake District, considered the impact of the industry on the natural environment and local communities. Michael Hill, the chief executive of Friends of the Lake District, said: \u201cThere\u2019s 18 million visitors a year, and there\u2019s only about 40,000 residents in the Lake District. So that\u2019s 450 visitors for every resident. And of course, infrastructure like wastewater treatment plants, for example, sewage plants, are usually scaled to deliver the needs of the local population.\u201d The report looked at how places across the world, and particularly in Europe, including the Balearic Islands and Venice, deal with mass tourism and manage its effects. \u201cI think there are still tensions in the Balearics, as we\u2019ve seen recently, between local people and the number of visitors,\u201d Stanford said, \u201cbut nevertheless, I think it is a good example of how a visitor tax can be used to raise income for initiatives that might not otherwise be funded.\u201d \u201cWe are not anti-tourist,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying, let\u2019s tax tourists to keep them away, absolutely not. Quite the opposite; in most of the places around the world that we\u2019ve looked at that have brought in some sort of tourism levy, tourism numbers have actually increased, because the place gets better.\u201d",

Wes Streeting has argued it could lead to coercion and ordered his department to carry out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/13/assisted-dying-law-nhs-cuts-wes-streeting\">a review of its potential costs</a>.</p> <p>Lord Falconer, an ally of Keir Starmer who served in his shadow cabinet until 2021, told the Guardian that the arguments from Mahmood and Streeting were giving the \u201cfalse impression that their departments are against it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe awfulness of them breaking the rules is that it gives the impression that their departments are against it when they most certainly are not,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asked about the absence of a vocal proponent for the change within the government, Falconer said: \u201cNobody in the government can do it, because all the people in favour are playing by the rules. The rule-breakers are getting more coverage because they\u2019re breaking the rules so spectacularly. And so they\u2019re getting a platform.\u201d</p> <p>Falconer added that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/shabana-mahmood-should-not-impose-her-religious-beliefs-on-others-says-peer\">ministers\u2019 religious views</a> should not \u201cdetermine the choices that people have in their death\u201d. \u201cGenerally, the people who are opposed to it are opposed to it on spiritual grounds \u2026 There\u2019s nothing wrong with religion \u2013 but that obviously colours their view and is not an objective stance on things like safeguards.\u201d</p> <p>Three former directors of public prosecutions have backed the bill, which Falconer said was evidence that it was an improvement on the current law. Starmer, himself a former director of public prosecutions, has declined to state his position but voted in favour of assisted dying in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cKeir is playing by the rules \u2013 rightly so,\u201d Falconer said. \u201cIt would be incredibly interesting to hear his views as the ex-DPP, particularly to counter the views of Shabana.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street sources said neither the prime minister nor Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, planned to set out their views before the vote on Friday.</p> <p>Proponents of the bill, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/assisted-dying-bill-parliament-kim-leadbeater-labour-mp\">put forward by Kim Leadbeater</a>, a Labour backbencher, say they are confident they have the numbers for it to pass its first parliamentary hurdle.</p> <p>Opponents say a number of MPs are planning to vote in favour of the bill in the first instance without necessarily supporting it, on the assumption there will be meaningful scrutiny and chances to amend it in later stages.</p> <p>Labour MPs who are not attached to either camp say that although proponents of the change have been better organised than its opponents, many MPs harbour reservations about it privately. The fact that MPs have a free vote and that Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats are all divided on the issue make the result difficult to predict.</p> <p>Leadbeater told Sky News she welcomed \u201crobust debate\u201d and that she did not have \u201cany doubts whatsoever\u201d about the bill.</p> <p>Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/14/liz-kendall-first-cabinet-minister-back-assisted-dying-bill\">who is in favour of the change</a>, told the BBC that \u201cit is really important as a society we talk about what makes for a good death\u201d. The justice minister Heidi Alexander and health ministers Karin Smyth and Stephen Kinnock are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/18/how-are-are-cabinet-ministers-likely-to-vote-on-assisted-dying\">among those who support legalising assisted dying</a>.</p> <p>A source close to Streeting said: \u201cWes has approached this issue in a genuine, thoughtful and considerate way, setting out his own view while respecting others\u2019 views.

      "bodyText": "Senior ministers who have spoken out against assisted dying are giving voters a \u201cfalse impression\u201d about the government\u2019s position, a leading proponent of changing the law has said. Charlie Falconer, a Labour peer and former justice secretary, said opponents to the change were \u201cgetting more coverage\u201d because ministers in favour of legalising assisted dying were \u201cplaying by the rules\u201d. MPs are preparing to vote on a bill to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill people in England and Wales later this week. Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, told a constituent she was \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d the bill would initiate a \u201cslippery slope towards death on demand\u201d and that \u201cthe state should never offer death as a service\u201d. Mahmood\u2019s letter, which was published on social media over the weekend and reported by the Observer, warned the bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales lacked appropriate safeguards. Mahmood, who is Britain\u2019s most senior Muslim politician, wrote that while she believed in the sanctity of life and that was the starting point for her position, she was opposed to the bill for legal and political reasons. Her intervention has triggered questions about how a change in the law would be implemented with the health secretary and the justice secretary opposed to it. Wes Streeting has argued it could lead to coercion and ordered his department to carry out a review of its potential costs. Lord Falconer, an ally of Keir Starmer who served in his shadow cabinet until 2021, told the Guardian that the arguments from Mahmood and Streeting were giving the \u201cfalse impression that their departments are against it\u201d. \u201cThe awfulness of them breaking the rules is that it gives the impression that their departments are against it when they most certainly are not,\u201d he said. Asked about the absence of a vocal proponent for the change within the government, Falconer said: \u201cNobody in the government can do it, because all the people in favour are playing by the rules. The rule-breakers are getting more coverage because they\u2019re breaking the rules so spectacularly. And so they\u2019re getting a platform.\u201d Falconer added that ministers\u2019 religious views should not \u201cdetermine the choices that people have in their death\u201d. \u201cGenerally, the people who are opposed to it are opposed to it on spiritual grounds \u2026 There\u2019s nothing wrong with religion \u2013 but that obviously colours their view and is not an objective stance on things like safeguards.\u201d Three former directors of public prosecutions have backed the bill, which Falconer said was evidence that it was an improvement on the current law. Starmer, himself a former director of public prosecutions, has declined to state his position but voted in favour of assisted dying in 2015. \u201cKeir is playing by the rules \u2013 rightly so,\u201d Falconer said. \u201cIt would be incredibly interesting to hear his views as the ex-DPP, particularly to counter the views of Shabana.\u201d Downing Street sources said neither the prime minister nor Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, planned to set out their views before the vote on Friday. Proponents of the bill, which was put forward by Kim Leadbeater, a Labour backbencher, say they are confident they have the numbers for it to pass its first parliamentary hurdle. Opponents say a number of MPs are planning to vote in favour of the bill in the first instance without necessarily supporting it, on the assumption there will be meaningful scrutiny and chances to amend it in later stages. Labour MPs who are not attached to either camp say that although proponents of the change have been better organised than its opponents, many MPs harbour reservations about it privately. The fact that MPs have a free vote and that Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats are all divided on the issue make the result difficult to predict. Leadbeater told Sky News she welcomed \u201crobust debate\u201d and that she did not have \u201cany doubts whatsoever\u201d about the bill. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary who is in favour of the change, told the BBC that \u201cit is really important as a society we talk about what makes for a good death\u201d. The justice minister Heidi Alexander and health ministers Karin Smyth and Stephen Kinnock are also among those who support legalising assisted dying. A source close to Streeting said: \u201cWes has approached this issue in a genuine, thoughtful and considerate way, setting out his own view while respecting others\u2019 views. He has always played the ball, not the man.\u201d",

A third-century Roman silver plate, decorated with a depiction of a river god, is lot 62 of the 5 December auction and is estimated to sell for between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000.

As Steel pointed out, there are other areas of the social-legal landscape that are almost unrecognisable from that of the middle of the last century. \u201cFor a young person reaching adulthood today, the idea that the state could wield its power to prohibit them from marrying the person they love, dissolving a marriage when love is absent, or choosing when and whether to have children would be viewed as not just alien but irrational,\u201d he wrote. Those putting forward the \u201cslippery slope\u201d argument on assisted dying often point to other countries \u2013 principally Canada \u2013 that have legalised it. Canada\u2019s medical assistance in dying (Maid) laws, crafted in response to a supreme court decision, initially covered only terminally ill Canadians. However, in 2019 a judge ruled that restricting access to those who had a \u201creasonably foreseeable death\u201d was unconstitutional, forcing federal lawmakers to expand the law. Now, a person must have a \u201cgrievous and irremediable medical condition\u201d to be eligible. They must meet all the criteria of having a serious illness, disease or disability; being in an advanced state of decline that cannot be reversed; and experiencing unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be relieved. The Canadian government has shelved an expansion of the law to include people with mental illnesses. The US state of Oregon, which legalised assisted dying in 1997 and whose law has been used as a model for many other jurisdictions, has not changed its criteria for eligibility in the past 27 years. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has put forward the assisted dying bill to the Westminster parliament, has said there is a misconception that the scope of the law has been broadened in other countries. Of her bill, she said this weekend: \u201cThe strict eligibility criteria make it very clear that we are only talking about people who are already dying. That is why the bill is called the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill; its scope cannot be changed and clearly does not include any other group of people.\u201d",

But it was not a gamechanger in what has become a cruel, relentless war of attrition. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-war.html\">potential</a> withdrawal of American aid by an isolationist Donald Trump next year, in order to force an unjust peace on Ukraine, certainly would be. European nations urgently require a strategy to respond to that prospect.</p> <p>Forging one, however, will require political clarity and leadership given multiple challenges. A sense of <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/eastern-europe-and-former-soviet-union/europes-emerging-war-fatigue\">war weariness</a> has become more widespread in Europe following the failed Ukrainian counter-offensive of 2023, the subsequent outbreak of war in the Middle East, and an ongoing cost of living crisis. Ahead of a snap election in February, Germany\u2019s beleaguered chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-campaign-germany-election-long-range-missiles-war-in-ukraine/\">campaigning</a> on his refusal to send long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Moscow\u2019s apparent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/what-is-ballistic-missile-russia-ukraine-war-irbm-icbm\">launch</a> on 21 November of a newly developed <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-hypersonic-missile-strike-ukraine-was-warning-west-2024-11-22/\">hypersonic</a> ballistic missile at&nbsp;the Ukrainian city of Dnipro \u2013 albeit one armed with a&nbsp;conventional warhead \u2013 was also aimed at European voters fearful of further escalation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;conflict.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the Polish prime minister,&nbsp;Donald Tusk, is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-pm-meet-french-uk-nato-leaders-discuss-ukraine-2024-11-09/\">seeking</a> to forge an alliance, including Britain, France and the Nordic and Baltic states, to resist the imposition of a fait accompli on Kyiv. There are no known peace negotiations under way between Moscow and Kyiv at present. Reclaiming all lost Ukrainian territory since 2014 might be overly <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n22/james-meek/nobody-wants-to-hear-this\">ambitious</a>. However, Europe must ensure Ukraine retains leverage in any future talks. In the event of an American U-turn on aid, Europe should provide the muscle \u2013 both military and financial \u2013 to compensate and strengthen the hand of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, if any talks occur, and make its own voice heard. </p> <p>Mr Trump has a history of transactional diplomacy. His approach to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/if-trump-wins-the-election-nato-can-expect-more-turbulence-ahead\">Nato</a> allies is worrying. The continent, however, must challenge any attempt by the incoming US president to legitimise the dismemberment of a sovereign European state. Diplomatically, Mr Zelenskyy has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-praises-trumps-impressive-election-win-2024-11-06/\">expressed</a> approval for the US president-elect\u2019s \u201cpeace through strength\u201d approach to foreign policy. But it is likely to fall to European nations to keep Ukraine strong following Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration. In a volatile world, supporting Kyiv is crucial for Europe\u2019s security. It must rise to the challenge by securing Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty,&nbsp;deterring future Russian aggression and paving the way for lasting&nbsp;peace and&nbsp;reconstruction.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The potential withdrawal of American aid by an isolationist Donald Trump next year, in order to force an unjust peace on Ukraine, certainly would be. European nations urgently require a strategy to respond to that prospect. Forging one, however, will require political clarity and leadership given multiple challenges. A sense of war weariness has become more widespread in Europe following the failed Ukrainian counter-offensive of 2023, the subsequent outbreak of war in the Middle East, and an ongoing cost of living crisis. Ahead of a snap election in February, Germany\u2019s beleaguered chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is campaigning on his refusal to send long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Moscow\u2019s apparent launch on 21 November of a newly developed hypersonic ballistic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro \u2013 albeit one armed with a conventional warhead \u2013 was also aimed at European voters fearful of further escalation of the conflict. Against that backdrop, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, is seeking to forge an alliance, including Britain, France and the Nordic and Baltic states, to resist the imposition of a fait accompli on Kyiv. There are no known peace negotiations under way between Moscow and Kyiv at present. Reclaiming all lost Ukrainian territory since 2014 might be overly ambitious. However, Europe must ensure Ukraine retains leverage in any future talks. In the event of an American U-turn on aid, Europe should provide the muscle \u2013 both military and financial \u2013 to compensate and strengthen the hand of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, if any talks occur, and make its own voice heard. Mr Trump has a history of transactional diplomacy. His approach to Nato allies is worrying. The continent, however, must challenge any attempt by the incoming US president to legitimise the dismemberment of a sovereign European state. Diplomatically, Mr Zelenskyy has expressed approval for the US president-elect\u2019s \u201cpeace through strength\u201d approach to foreign policy. But it is likely to fall to European nations to keep Ukraine strong following Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration. In a volatile world, supporting Kyiv is crucial for Europe\u2019s security. It must rise to the challenge by securing Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, deterring future Russian aggression and paving the way for lasting peace and reconstruction.

It is a crisis of affordability, not supply, brought about by the over-financialisation of the stock through a decade and a half of interest rates close to zero.</p> <p>Prices rose from three or four times average earnings to more than nine times as investors shifted cash from deposits to bricks and mortar. No arbitrary housing targets will ever correct that because simple arithmetic is against it, never mind that developers won\u2019t increase supply to the point where they have to drop prices. And the threat of rescinding unbuilt planning consents would see material starts, so that forfeiture would leave a mess for early buyers to live with, and someone else to sort out.</p> <p>Before automatic sacrifice of green space, shorter-term measures are needed, such as requiring holiday lets to have planning consent, to counter the commandeering of dwellings to turn into private profit streams \u2013 something that has decimated the rental market in some areas. Inherited property wealth, which has snowballed with market bloating and widened social division, should be a separate tax category.

      "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee\u2019s piece misses the central point about the housing crisis (In Kent, Labour has a fight on its hands \u2013 and a make-or-break test for its housing revolution, 19 November). It is a crisis of affordability, not supply, brought about by the over-financialisation of the stock through a decade and a half of interest rates close to zero. Prices rose from three or four times average earnings to more than nine times as investors shifted cash from deposits to bricks and mortar. No arbitrary housing targets will ever correct that because simple arithmetic is against it, never mind that developers won\u2019t increase supply to the point where they have to drop prices. And the threat of rescinding unbuilt planning consents would see material starts, so that forfeiture would leave a mess for early buyers to live with, and someone else to sort out. Before automatic sacrifice of green space, shorter-term measures are needed, such as requiring holiday lets to have planning consent, to counter the commandeering of dwellings to turn into private profit streams \u2013 something that has decimated the rental market in some areas. Inherited property wealth, which has snowballed with market bloating and widened social division, should be a separate tax category. And, although higher council tax rates on non-principal residences have begun to bite, long\u2011term empty property should attract accelerated rates. New-builds, meanwhile \u2013 and Toynbee doesn\u2019t mention this \u2013 should focus on social housing. John Worrall Cromer, Norfolk \u2022 The irrefutable evidence of the past 30 or more years is that the price of a home goes up and up regardless of the amount supplied \u2013 the housing market that responds to supply by reducing prices is a myth. The MP Kevin McKenna is quoted as saying that developers \u201cwill only get permission to build if they raise the percentage of affordable housing and keep their community pledges\u201d. The government may be able to extract such a pledge in exchange for granting permission, but no planning condition can prevent a developer from subsequently claiming looming impoverishment and applying for its social or affordable housing contribution to be reduced or removed altogether. This will continue to be the case until the government abolishes the viability test, which is the rotten core of the current system. The test virtually guarantees a 20% profit margin on every development, regardless of what is sacrificed in order to achieve it. In the meantime, unneeded executive homes will continue to be the majority of what\u2019s built, despite being unaffordable, and the country\u2019s shrinking carbon budget for getting to net zero by 2050 will continue to be frittered away to maintain the flow of money from developers to the main political parties. Ian Tysh Green party councillor with planning and environment portfolio at Wealden district council \u2022 Reading Polly Toynbee\u2019s article, I was struck by the delightful artist\u2019s impression online of the proposed Highsted Park development in Swale, Kent.

      "body": "<p>At the Almeida theatre in Islington, in 2000, Eileen Diss, the Bafta award-winning television and stage designer, who has died aged 93, conjured a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/03/screen-queens-funny-fearless-women-who-revolutionised-tv\">double bill</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/dec/27/harold-pinter-obituary-playwright-politics\">Harold Pinter</a> plays \u2013 an early one, The Room, set in an ordinary large house, and a new piece, Celebration, set in a swanky metropolitan restaurant, not unlike the Ivy.</p> <p>It was one of many collaborations she had with Pinter, and it exemplified her meticulous, poetically imagined but still naturalistic talent for reproducing the writer\u2019s imagination in concrete terms. She was never abstract or surreal in her designs, but specialised, in her theatre work, in evocative interiors.</p> <p>Having started in BBC television in 1952 \u2013 designing Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School; The Grove Family (often called the first TV soap); David Attenborough\u2019s groundbreaking Zoo Quest (capturing animals in the wild for zoos); and the brilliant Maigret series, in grainy, cinematic black and white, starring Rupert Davies and Ewen Solon (\u201cYou can smell the Pernod,\u201d said one critic) \u2013 she branched out into film and theatre.</p>    <p>She had success with Joseph Losey\u2019s film version of Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House (1973) with Jane Fonda; Pinter\u2019s Betrayal (1983), directed on film by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/23/theatre.television\">David Jones</a>; and Evelyn Waugh\u2019s luscious A Handful of Dust (1988), directed by Charles Sturridge.</p> <p>On film, stage and television, she collaborated with Pinter, as either writer or director, or both, at least two dozen times, starting with Tea Party on BBC television in 1965, developed from a short story, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/24/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Leo McKern</a> and Pinter\u2019s then wife, Vivien Merchant, for a European Broadcasting Union commission in 12 countries.</p> <p>By then, she had left the BBC design team and made her first theatre design for Pinter at the Mermaid theatre in Puddle Dock. He directed Exiles, James Joyce\u2019s only play, in 1970, and the experience came as a shock: the BBC, she said, had a 24-hour workshop serving 12 studios, while the Mermaid had little money and less back-up: \u201cIt was one bloke and a hammer.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/03/screen-queens-funny-fearless-women-who-revolutionised-tv\">As Zoe Williams said in this newspaper</a> in 2019, her influence on BBC design work, \u201ca slightly crazy mix of boarding-school perfectionism and free-spirited iconoclasm\u201d, was baked in. As for the values of TV production in the 60s and 70s, \u201cYou can\u2019t watch Diss\u2019s Cider With Rosie [a beautiful 1971 film directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/10/television.culture\">Claude Whatham</a>] or Moll Flanders [1975, another triumph, directed by Donald McWhinnie] without seeing the <em>values</em>.\u201d</p> <p>The first of her four (similar) designs for Pinter\u2019s The Caretaker was spectacularly cluttered, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/oct/08/the-caretaker-everyman-liverpool\">her fourth, starring Jonathan Pryce as Davies</a> (he had been Mick at the National Theatre in 1980), in Bath and Liverpool in 2009 and London in 2010, would take a fortnight to inventory: a tumultuous tip of a room decked out with iron bed, gas stove, bucket for a leaky ceiling, a chubby Buddha in a sea of newspapers, planks of wood, kitchen accessories.</p>    <p>On film, her obsessive attention to detail made life challenging for even the most experienced of crews. On set in the 80s, soon after trainers with reflector pads on their heels became de rigueur, one harassed props man affectionately requested that Eileen should have her reflectors on the front \u201cso that we can see her coming\u201d.</p> <p>Eileen was born in Leytonstone, east London, the only child of Thomas Diss, a dentist, and his wife, Winifred (nee Irvine), and was educated at Ilford county high school for girls \u2013 a school outing to see Laurence Olivier\u2019s film of Henry V in 1945 made an indelible, influential impression on her \u2013 and the Central School of Arts and Crafts (now Central Saint Martins, part of the University of the Arts London).

      "bodyText": "At the Almeida theatre in Islington, in 2000, Eileen Diss, the Bafta award-winning television and stage designer, who has died aged 93, conjured a double bill of Harold Pinter plays \u2013 an early one, The Room, set in an ordinary large house, and a new piece, Celebration, set in a swanky metropolitan restaurant, not unlike the Ivy. It was one of many collaborations she had with Pinter, and it exemplified her meticulous, poetically imagined but still naturalistic talent for reproducing the writer\u2019s imagination in concrete terms. She was never abstract or surreal in her designs, but specialised, in her theatre work, in evocative interiors. Having started in BBC television in 1952 \u2013 designing Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School; The Grove Family (often called the first TV soap); David Attenborough\u2019s groundbreaking Zoo Quest (capturing animals in the wild for zoos); and the brilliant Maigret series, in grainy, cinematic black and white, starring Rupert Davies and Ewen Solon (\u201cYou can smell the Pernod,\u201d said one critic) \u2013 she branched out into film and theatre. She had success with Joseph Losey\u2019s film version of Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House (1973) with Jane Fonda; Pinter\u2019s Betrayal (1983), directed on film by David Jones; and Evelyn Waugh\u2019s luscious A Handful of Dust (1988), directed by Charles Sturridge. On film, stage and television, she collaborated with Pinter, as either writer or director, or both, at least two dozen times, starting with Tea Party on BBC television in 1965, developed from a short story, with Leo McKern and Pinter\u2019s then wife, Vivien Merchant, for a European Broadcasting Union commission in 12 countries. By then, she had left the BBC design team and made her first theatre design for Pinter at the Mermaid theatre in Puddle Dock. He directed Exiles, James Joyce\u2019s only play, in 1970, and the experience came as a shock: the BBC, she said, had a 24-hour workshop serving 12 studios, while the Mermaid had little money and less back-up: \u201cIt was one bloke and a hammer.\u201d As Zoe Williams said in this newspaper in 2019, her influence on BBC design work, \u201ca slightly crazy mix of boarding-school perfectionism and free-spirited iconoclasm\u201d, was baked in. As for the values of TV production in the 60s and 70s, \u201cYou can\u2019t watch Diss\u2019s Cider With Rosie [a beautiful 1971 film directed by Claude Whatham] or Moll Flanders [1975, another triumph, directed by Donald McWhinnie] without seeing the values.\u201d The first of her four (similar) designs for Pinter\u2019s The Caretaker was spectacularly cluttered, while her fourth, starring Jonathan Pryce as Davies (he had been Mick at the National Theatre in 1980), in Bath and Liverpool in 2009 and London in 2010, would take a fortnight to inventory: a tumultuous tip of a room decked out with iron bed, gas stove, bucket for a leaky ceiling, a chubby Buddha in a sea of newspapers, planks of wood, kitchen accessories. On film, her obsessive attention to detail made life challenging for even the most experienced of crews. On set in the 80s, soon after trainers with reflector pads on their heels became de rigueur, one harassed props man affectionately requested that Eileen should have her reflectors on the front \u201cso that we can see her coming\u201d. Eileen was born in Leytonstone, east London, the only child of Thomas Diss, a dentist, and his wife, Winifred (nee Irvine), and was educated at Ilford county high school for girls \u2013 a school outing to see Laurence Olivier\u2019s film of Henry V in 1945 made an indelible, influential impression on her \u2013 and the Central School of Arts and Crafts (now Central Saint Martins, part of the University of the Arts London). She met her future husband, Raymond Everett, an aviator with the RAF and BOAC, at a school dance and married him in 1953. As well as with Pinter, she had close collaborations with Simon Gray, whose plays \u2013 Butley (1971) and Otherwise Engaged (1975), both starring Alan Bates, The Rear Column (1978), Quartermaine\u2019s Terms (1981) and The Late Middle Classes (1999) \u2013 she designed alongside Pinter as director, all pitch perfect in tone and presentation, the last skilfully containing a 50s childhood within an 80s framework. The two also worked together on David Mamet\u2019s exploration of sexual harassment, Oleanna, when it came to the Royal Court in 1993, transferring to the Duke of York\u2019s the following year. Over six years from the end of the 60s, she designed several televised opera productions, including The Merry Widow and The Yeoman of the Guard; and her classy TV series included Tom Sharpe\u2019s Porterhouse Blue (1988), adapted for Channel 4 by Malcolm Bradbury; Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie as Jeeves and Wooster (1990-93) for ITV, for which she won a Bafta in 1992; and Anthony Powell\u2019s A Dance to the Music of Time (1997), adapted by Hugh Whitemore and produced for Channel 4 by Alvin Rakoff, who also co-directed with Christopher Morahan. Diss had known Rakoff since early days, each starting out at the BBC. She kept in touch and designed the television version of Whitemore\u2019s The Best of Friends (1991), with John Gielgud, which Rakoff directed, and reunited with him at the Mill at Sonning, Berkshire, a cosy dinner theatre run by the actor Sally Hughes who was Rakoff\u2019s partner and, later, second wife. Their collaborations included Too Marvellous for Words (2002), about the life and songs of Johnny Mercer, on an ingeniously arranged set of four moving blocks; a similar tribute show to Doris Day, A Sentimental Journey (2009), with Sally as Doris, written by Sally\u2019s film-maker son, Adam Rolston; and a version of Raymond Chandler\u2019s The Big Sleep (2011), in which Diss cleverly used back projections made in pen and ink to create a suitably film noir edge. She loved working with the Sonning stage crew, as she did with Pinter and Gray, the playwright Brian Friel (on two plays of his at Hampstead theatre in the 1980s, Translations, and its farcical riposte, The Communication Cord), the lighting designer Mick Hughes and her own daughter, Dany, a costume designer. In all, she won six Baftas, and a Bafta lifetime achievement award in 2006, and was honoured in 1975 by the Royal Society of Arts as a Royal Designer for Industry, the highest accolade for designers in all disciplines in the UK. Her husband Raymond predeceased her in 1994, but she stayed on in the Kensington home they had shared for 40 years, and is survived by Dany, her sons Tim and Matthew, and by six grandchildren. \u2022 Eileen Winifred Diss, stage, television and film designer, born 13 May 1931; died 5 November 2024",

More than once the visitors turned down kickable penalties only to cough up possession after nudging the ball into the corner. The scrum too struggled and regularly creaked and conceded penalties.

In truth Australia simply weren\u2019t good enough. Perhaps this was a consequence of their psyche heading into the contest. It\u2019s hard to imagine Schmidt was talking his boys up in private, telling them that they\u2019re world beaters, but they\u2019d not be human if they didn\u2019t start the match with some wind in their sails, buoyed by the feelgood energy that has surrounded the camp after two statement wins.</p> <p>Scotland doused those flames early with some hard hits and an ultra-aggressive approach at the breakdown. It almost worked against the South African Springboks. Here it made a mess of Schmidt-ball and soon enough several Australians got themselves in unnecessary scraps.

In addition, three-quarters of recruiters said they had seen candidates turn down new roles that did not offer hybrid working, according to the survey of 500 in-house and agency recruiters, conducted in November for the flexible workspace provider International Workspace Group (IWG). Similarly, 72% of surveyed recruiters said companies that do not offer hybrid working are becoming less competitive in the job market. The research comes amid the latest battle between employers and office-based employees over where they carry out their work after the explosion in home working caused by the Covid pandemic. A range of large employers have tightened up their rules on remote working in recent months. Underlining the unpopularity of some of these measures, in one of the more extreme employee reactions, the Guardian revealed last week that staff at the online lender Starling Bank had resigned after its new chief executive called thousands of workers back to their desks. All hybrid staff, many of whom previously attended for one or two days a week, were told by the boss, Raman Bhatia, to be at their desks for a minimum of 10 days each month, despite not having enough space to accommodate them all. Starling is joined by the grocery chain Asda, the accountant PwC, and the Spanish-owned bank Santander in clamping down on remote working. The strictest mandates have been issued by the online retail company, Amazon, which has called its staff back to the office full-time from January. The US technology company Dell has also ordered all its global sales team members to work permanently in the office. The IWG study did not specify which companies the employees hope to depart owing to stricter remote working policies. Many organisational leaders have praised the collaboration and creativity sparked by bringing employees together in offices, whereas many employees appear to have grown accustomed to being able to choose where they carry out their work. More than a third (36%) of white collar workers in roles requiring five-day office attendance said their employer was risking losing its best talent, according to separate research by IWG. Almost half (46%) of these 1,000 workers, surveyed in September, said they were actively looking for a new job that did not require a long daily commute. Mark Dixon, the chief executive of IWG, said: \u201cFlexible working offers further benefits to businesses beyond employee retention. The hybrid model is proven to boost workforce productivity and job satisfaction while also cutting costs significantly.\u201d The requirement for more office attendance comes despite warnings from some economists, including Stanford University professor, Nicholas Bloom, that it could unleash a wave of staff departures. Bloom has predicted that some return to office mandates will be repealed next year, if there is an exodus of talent.",

      "bodyText": "Mohamed Salah, the match-winner, also spoke to Sky: \u201cEach game is different. They had a game plan and played very well. We managed to come back and win the game. I think we have a good game plan, we played our game and I was confident we would create chances. On facing Manchester City next week: \u201cIt\u2019s great. Hopefully, we keep going in that direction. We have a game against them so hopefully, we win it and go 11 points clear. Man City is Man City. They have a bad time now but they have great players.\u201d Liverpool have won 10 from 12, Southampton have lost 10 from 12. There wasn\u2019t that much between them for much of the game, but Saints\u2019 errors were more serious. And there is the sense Russell Martin is asking too much of his players in risky situations. Here\u2019s Ben Fisher\u2019s report from St Mary\u2019s. Dominik Szoboszlai held a flash interview with Sky Sports: \u201c They scored two quick goals but the most important thing was the reaction. We showed it very well and happy with the three points. \u201cEveryone knows Mo. He just has to keep going and I hope I play with him for as long as I can. It is a great feeling but it is the beginning of the season. We just need to continue and not think where the other teams are.\u201d In other, slightly bonkers news Liverpool go eight points clear at the top of the Premier League after a topsy-turvy game at St Mary\u2019s. They led 1-0, trailed 2-1 and won 3-2 after two goals from the inevitable Mo Salah. Southampton contributed plenty to an enjoyable if error-strewn game, with the outstanding teenager Tyler Dibling playing a big part in both goals. They remain four points adrift and lost two more players to injury, but the performance will give Russell Martin hope. 90+8 min Stephens is booked for booting Salah. 90+5 min Endo fouls Aribo 35 yards from goal, which allows Southampton to load the penalty area. Fernandes\u2019s free-kick is headed over from about 12 yards by Stephens. Tough to score from there. 90+3 min Southampton have struggled to generate any momentum since going behind. Dibling looks the likeliest source of a chance, as he has all afternoon. 90 min Eight minutes of added time. 89 min: Liverpool substitution Wataru Endo replaces Darwin Nunez. 88 min: Salah hits the post! So close to his hat-trick. Liverpool broke at pace, with Diaz eventually trying to find Salah at the far post. His pass was headed up in the air by a defender and dropped invitingly for Salah, who cracked a close-range volley off the inside of the near post. 86 min Sugawara crosses low towards Archer, who goes over after a challenge from Konate. Not enough pressure for a penalty. 84 min Salah was booked for that big reveal. He\u2019s also just missed a pretty good chance to complete his hat-trick, spanking over the bar from 15 yards after a very quick break. 83 min Salah whips his top off in celebration, revealing a six-pack that would put us all to shame. Mo Salah has had a very quiet game. He\u2019s also just scored his second goal, curling an emphatic penalty high into the net. McCarthy went the right way, to his right, but he couldn\u2019t reach it. PENALTY TO LIVERPOOL! Salah\u2019s deep cross skids off the pitch and hits the outstretched hand of Sugawara. Actually he chested it onto his arm, but the decision stands. 80 min Diaz, who has looked really sharp since coming on, has a shot blocked on the edge of the area. 79 min Walker-Peters puts hands on Nunez in the area \u2013 not enough for a penalty but a risky challenge nonetheless. Southampton have been penned in for the last 10-15 minutes. 77 min: Double substitution for Southampton Cameron Archer and Yukinari Sugawara replace Adam Armstrong and Ryan Fraser. 75 min Diaz scurries past Fraser and crosses dangerously towards the far post. Walker-Peters, unsure what\u2019s behind him, chests behind for a corner. 73 min Armstrong is booked for a foul on Van Dijk. 71 min Harwood-Bellis makes a terrific sliding block from Diaz\u2019s shot, then Stephens charges out to smother Bradley\u2019s follow-up. Liverpool have finally woken up. 69 min That goal has changed the mood completely. It\u2019s all Liverpool now, and Mac Allister has just whistled a drive over the bar from 25 yards. 68 min McCarthy comes for the next corner, misses it completely and is extremely relieved to see Gravenberch lob the ball over the bar from eight yards. That was a great chance. 67 min: Good save by McCarthy! Robertson\u2019s corner is met at the near post by Diaz, whose header is tipped over acrobatically by McCarthy. Good stop. Gravenberch, on the halfway line, clipped a straight pass over the Southampton defence towards Salah. McCarthy thought Salah, wasn\u2019t going to reach the ball and ran diagonally to his left, leaving the goal wide open. Salah did get to the ball, stretching to cushion a volley into the net from about 18 yards. It\u2019s a fine, improvised finish, but a horrible moment from McCarthy. Mo Salah equalises after another defensive calamity! 62 min: Chance for Liverpool! Diaz almost scores with his first touch. Salah played a ball over the top for Nunez, who scorched away from the defence in the inside-right channel. He could have had a shot but instead tried to slide the ball across to give Diaz an open goal. The pass was slightly behind Diaz, who couldn\u2019t slow down quickly enough to screw the ball into the net. 62 min: Double substitution for Liverpool Luis Diaz and Alexis Mac Allister replace Curtis Jones and Cody Gakpo. 61 min Fernandes scoops a clever little through pass to Armstrong, who is penalised for a challenge on Kelleher. Kelleher actually slid past the ball, at which point he and Armstrong collided. I\u2019d like to see that again. 60 min Liverpool have been unusually sloppy today. You\u2019d still fancy them to get at least a draw but they\u2019ll need to up their game quicksmart. It was a terrific counter-attacking goal. Tyler Dibling \u2013 what a player he looks \u2013 turned Szoboszlai neatly and pinged a brilliant crossfield pass to release Adam Armstrong in the inside-left channel. Armstrong left the ball behind on the edge of the area but then composed himself to pick out Mateus Fernandes near the penalty spot. The weight on the pass was perfect, allowing Fernandes to open his body and slide a precise left-foot shot back across Kelleher. Lovely goal. Southampton take the lead against the leaders! 55 min Gravenberch steals possession high up the field, keeps going and tees up Nunez, whose snapshot is deflected behind for a corner. 53 min The Southampton keeper Alex McCarthy gets a big cheer when he kicks the ball long for possibly the first time today. 53 min Lovely play from the teenager Tyler Dibling. He scurries past three Liverpool players, using little Sensible Soccer touches the whole way, then swerves to the left and shoots not far over from 25 yards. 52 min: Southampton substitution Lesley Ugochukwu replaces the limping Paul Onuachu, who gets a fine hand from the home supporters. 51 min Another injury for Southampton. Onuachu must have fallen awkwardly after that challenge from Gakpo because he needs to go off. 49 min Gakpo is booked for tripping Onuachu, who has held the ball up really well for Southampton. 49 min A corner is headed as far away from Jones, whose shot from 25 yards is blocked by the outrushing Fraser. 48 min Salah\u2019s outside-of-the-boot cross is volleyed back across goal by Robertson and cleared crucially by Stephens. Lots of early pressure from Liverpool. 46 min Peep peep! Southampton begin the second half. The consensus of the Sky Sports panel is that Lallana was lucky not to be sent off for that tackle on Gravenberch. \u201cI\u2019d have been sent off for that,\u201d says Roy Keane. \u201cI would! The more I look at it, the worse it is.\u201d Half-time reading Yes, it really, really, really did happen. A lively, error-strewn half ends with the scores level. Southampton gave a goal to Dominik Szoboszlai with a clumsy attempt to play out from the back; Virgil van Dijk\u2019s indulgent backheel led to a borderline penalty when Andy Robertson fouled Tyler Dibling. Adam Armstrong scored at the second attempt after Caoimhin Kelleher saved his penalty. 45+3 min Onuachu almost brings the house down with a winding run past three or four players. That was a bit like Clodoaldo in the 1970 World Cup final, albeit not quite as elegant and without the same end result. 45+2 min Stephens mocks Nunez by putting his hands over his face as if he\u2019s been it. Nunez was suckered into a red card on his home debut so he could probably do with the half-time break to cool off. 45+1 min Nunez goes down in the area after being pushed just below the neck by Stephens. The referee has a word with both players, who were pushing each other repeatedly off the ball as they jockeyed for position. 45 min Six minutes of added time. 44 min Southampton almost give the lead straight back to Liverpool. McCarthy\u2019s jittery pass goes straight to Gakpo on the left side of the area; thankfully for Southampton, there are enough defenders around to block Gakpo\u2019s shot. Armstrong\u2019s penalty is saved by Kelleher, diving to his right, but the ball rebounds perfectly for him to score at the second attempt. 41 min This is a nightmare for Michael Oliver in the VAR bunker. But the penalty stands! There was no clear evidence to overturn it. PENALTY TO SOUTHAMPTON! Dibling is tripped right on the edge of the area by Robertson. Was he inside? The referee thought so. It\u2019s really tight and because the penalty was given on the field I think the decision will stand. It stemmed from an absurd, indulgent backheel by Van Dijk that went astray. Dibling ran straight at the heart of the defence, poked the ball past Robertson and was tripped. 39 min Walker-Peters finds Aribo, who slips Gravenberch in the area and fires a low cross that is cleared by the well-positioned Van Dijk. Walker-Peters switched to left wing-back about five minutes ago and has had a bit of joy going forward. 37 min: Southampton substitution Joe Aribo replaces Lallana. 36 min Ach, Adam Lallana has a hamstring injury. The poor guy has had no luck. A number of his ex-teammates go over to wish him well. 33 min: Fine save by Kelleher! Southampton made a mess of the corner but then got the ball back on the right wing. Lallana\u2019s neat dummy allowed a low cross to reach Downes, whose crisp shot on the turn from 10 yards was pushed round the post by the diving Kelleher. That\u2019s a really good reaction save. 32 min Walker-Peters, on the left for a moment, wins a corner for Southampton with a deflected cross. From which\u2026 Southampton made a horrible mess of playing out from the back. McCarthy rolled the ball out to Fernandes, who was challenged on the edge of the area. The ball ran back towards Downes, who mishit a nervous clearance straight at Szoboszlai on the edge of the area. He took a touch and curled a left-foot shot that went into the net via the inside of the far post. That\u2019s a majestic finish. And it all goes wrong, big-time. 28 min Now Jones has a long-range drive saved by the sprawling McCarthy. He\u2019s made at least five saves now, although the majority have been comfortable. 27 min The lively Gakpo cuts inside from the left and whacks a good shot that is turned round the near post by the diving McCarthy. It\u2019s coming\u2026 25 min Szoboszlai robs Fernandes on the edge of the area and drives a low shot that is comfortably saved by McCarthy. Liverpool are slowly starting to take control. 23 min Lallana overruns the ball, wipes out Gravenberch straight away and is booked. That didn\u2019t look great at all and he apologised straight away. He could have been sent off for that. 21 min: Good save by McCarthy! A very similar cross from Gakpo is missed by Fraser and reaches Salah beyond the far post. He controls the ball on his thigh and hits an early shot that is beaten away by McCarthy. The angle was pretty tight but McCarthy did well nonetheless. 19 min Gakpo\u2019s dangerous inswinging cross is really well defended by Fraser, who had Salah waiting behind him. 17 min Onuachu bulldozes past Konate, who shoves him over and is booked. The attack stemmed from Salah losing the ball cheaply in the Southampton half. \u201cLiverpool are not at the races here,\u201d says Jamie Carragher on Sky. 15 min Bradley makes an excellent underlapping run and clips a cross that is pushed away by the diving McCarthy. Szoboszlai wallops the loose ball over the bar from 25 yards. 13 min Bradley is booked for a cynical foul on Lallana, who turned him beautifully on the halfway line. He really is a lovely footballer. 12 min Onuachu gets a loud cheer after some nice hold-up play, only to flick a nonchalant pass out of play. Even so, he has started well, as has Adam Lallana in midfield. 10 min Southampton have done okay in the first 10 minutes. They have looked vulnerable on the counter-attack but are playing some decent, optimistic football. 9 min Robertson\u2019s deep, chipped cross is volleyed over by Salah, who couldn\u2019t sort his feet. The angle was really tight anyway. 7 min Southampton appeal for a penalty when Armstrong goes over after a clumsy challenge from Konate. The referee gives a corner. I think it probably was a foul \u2013 but it took place just outside the box. What I think is irrelevant: the VAR, Michael Oliver, has cleared it. 6 min Liverpool break four on three with Szoboszlai on the ball. He runs 40 yards and pushes the ball out to Salah, whose first-time shot takes a deflection and is pushed round the near post by McCarthy. Decent save. 5 min Southampton play out nicely from the back, with Harwood-Bellis finding Fernandes in a bit of space. He cuts across a shot from 25 yards that is comfortably held by Kelleher. 4 min Liverpool have made a relaxed, confident start, with the first few minutes taking place almost exclusively in the Southampton half. 2 min This is the revised Southampton formation. Southampton (5-2-3) McCarthy; Walker-Peters, Harwood-Bellis, Downes, Stephens, Fraser; Fernandes, Lallana; Dibling, Onuachu, Armstrong. 1 min Liverpool kick off from right to left as we watch. Southampton have started with a back five: Flynn Downes is playing at centre-half. The weather doesn\u2019t look too bad at St Mary\u2019s, certainly compared to some parts of the country. Even so, it\u2019s not exactly an idyllic winter\u2019s day. A reminder of the teams, who are about to take the field Southampton (possible 4-2-3-1) McCarthy; Walker-Peters, Harwood-Bellis, Stephens, Fraser; Downes, Lallana; Dibling, Armstrong, Fernandes; Onuachu. Substitutes: Lumley, Manning, Bree, Sugawara, Aribo, Sulemana, Ugochukwu, Brereton, Archer. Liverpool (4-3-3) Kelleher; Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson; Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Jones; Salah, Nunez, Gakpo. Substitutes: Jaros, Davies, Gomez, Quansah, Endo, Mac Allister, Elliott, Morton, Diaz. Referee Samuel Barrott. And read Arne Slot on Russell Martin If you\u2019re a manager, you have to believe in something and you have to stick to that plan. Russell has his own style and he believes in it. There is no one that knows for sure that if he or the club wants to change the playing style, that that would lead to much more points. He brought them back up and he makes it really hard for every team to play against them. Normally, these teams that go up, they need some time to adapt to the new league. If you then have a good idea about football and a good gameplan, then results will come. Read Jonathan Wilson on Russell Martin The way in which the relationship between players and coach maps on to religious language is itself significant, a means by which the discourse subtly shapes expectation. Modern managers are expected to have philosophies, and to evangelise them in their dealings with the media. Pep Guardiola, say, has spoken of how Johan Cruyff \u201cbuilt the cathedral\u201d at Barcelona and it being the job of subsequent coaches to maintain it. Both teams are without a number of first-choice players. Alex McCarthy replaces the injured Aaron Ramsdale in goal for Southampton, one of five changes from the defeat at Wolves a fortnight ago. Ryan Fraser, Tyler Dibling, Paul Onuachu and Flynn Downes replace Ryan Manning, Joe Aribo, Cameron Archer and the injured Jan Bednarek. Liverpool make three changes from the 2-0 win over Aston VIlla. Conor Bradley covers for the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back; Cody Gakpo and Dominik Szoboszlai are preferred to Luis Diaz and Alexis Mac Allister. Southampton (possible 4-2-3-1) McCarthy; Walker-Peters, Harwood-Bellis, Stephens, Fraser; Downes, Lallana; Dibling, Armstrong, Fernandes; Onuachu. Substitutes: Lumley, Manning, Bree, Sugawara, Aribo, Sulemana, Ugochukwu, Brereton, Archer. Liverpool (4-3-3) Kelleher; Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson; Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Jones; Salah, Nunez, Gakpo. Substitutes: Jaros, Davies, Gomez, Quansah, Endo, Mac Allister, Elliott, Morton, Diaz. Referee Samuel Barrott. Hello and welcome to live, minute-by-minute coverage of Southampton v Liverpool at St Mary\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "Taiwan\u2019s former president Tsai Ing-wen had been due to visit the UK between 16 and 18 October before the Foreign Office intervened, the Guardian can disclose. Tsai was scheduled to visit London for two days as part of her first international tour since leaving office and was in discussions about addressing the UK parliament, according to a leaked letter. But the trip, which had been due to coincide with David Lammy\u2019s visit to China, was pulled and Tsai was hosted by the French parliament on those dates instead. The leaked letter, sent to the Commons and Lords speakers in August, said Tsai \u201cwill visit London between 16th and 18th October\u201d and that the UK Taiwanese office wanted to explore the possibility of her being hosted by parliament. The letter said Tsai would \u201cgreatly value\u201d an invitation to address parliamentarians and attend a reception in the Commons speaker\u2019s house. It said: \u201cA significant number of MPs and peers would wish to hear her views on the years ahead in Taiwan.\u201d A source involved in the discussions said the trip was cancelled after the Foreign Office indicated to Taiwanese officials that it was not a good time for it. The source told the Guardian last month: \u201cWe got a note from the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] via the Taiwanese representative to the UK. It said: \u2018Please can you defer this for a while because the foreign secretary is about to make a \u2018goodwill visit\u2019 to China and this would absolutely put the kibosh on it.\u2019\u201d This message will not have been relayed by ministers because the UK does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s representative in London can only meet civil servants. An FCDO spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not recognise this characterisation of events. Parliamentarians are independent of government and are free to invite whoever they wish.\u201d When asked about the postponed visit by the Guardian at an event in parliament last week, the director of Taiwan\u2019s political division in London said he was not authorised to discuss it. Tsai\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. China often does not differentiate between government and parliamentary meetings. Beijing has reacted angrily to Tsai\u2019s meetings with political figures in Brussels, Paris and Prague. The French parliamentarians who hosted Tsai said China had tried to dissuade them from doing so. China\u2019s foreign ministry described Tsai as a \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d figure last month and warned European countries that assisting her could \u201charm bilateral relations with China\u201d. China views Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually come under Beijing\u2019s control, and there are fears it will eventually try to annex the island by force. Taiwan, which has never been ruled by the People\u2019s Republic of China, sees itself as distinct and has its own constitution and democratically elected leaders. The Taiwanese population has grown increasingly opposed to China\u2019s claims of sovereignty over it. The prospect of Tsai visiting the UK parliament next spring has been floated but the government will want this not to clash with Rachel Reeves\u2019s planned visit to China early next year. Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said that \u201cLabour has subdued Britain\u2019s voice on the geopolitical threats that China poses\u201d. Meanwhile, ministers are grappling with a controversial application to build a huge new Chinese embassy near Tower Bridge in east London, which has become a top issue in bilateral relations between London and Beijing. After it was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 following local opposition, the planning application was resubmitted this summer and has been called in by central government. In a letter published on the council\u2019s website this weekend, Jon Savell, a deputy assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan police, raised concerns about the proposal and warned it would have a \u201csignificant\u201d impact on local policing and resources in the area. The Guardian reported last month that China has refused to allow the UK to rebuild its embassy in Beijing while the status of its own embassy proposal in London is pending. Keir Starmer raised the issue with Xi Jinping in the first bilateral meeting between a UK prime minister and the Chinese president in more than six years. \u201cYou raised the Chinese embassy building in London when we spoke on the telephone and we have since taken action by calling in that application. Now we have to follow the legal process and timeline,\u201d Starmer told Xi in recorded remarks on the margins of the G20 summit in Brazil.",

The theme featured in every subsequent Bond film, though with many versions besides Flick\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m proud of it,\u201d said Flick, \u201cand I\u2019m proud to be associated with it and I\u2019m proud of all the things that developed from it. But at the time I had no idea that it was going to be like that.\u201d</p> <p>Flick was a member of the John Barry Seven when the piece was composed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/31/john-barry-obituary\">John Barry</a> had been brought on board by the film\u2019s producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R Broccoli, because they were unhappy with the theme written for the film by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/11/monty-norman-obituary#:~:text=Monty%20Norman%2C%20who%20has%20died,and%20Make%20Me%20an%20Offer.\">Monty Norman</a>. They wanted something similar to Barry\u2019s soundtrack for Beat Girl (1960), which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/10/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Adam Faith</a>\u2019s first film and Barry\u2019s first soundtrack, and on which Flick had also played.</p> <p>As Flick recalled: \u201cJohn Barry was asked to do it, but Norman had been contracted to write the music so it had to be Monty\u2019s music. Monty came up with a theme, and Barry said let\u2019s do it like this.\u201d</p> <p>It was Flick\u2019s idea to take the theme down an octave to give it a gutsier tone. He played it on his Clifford Essex Paragon, a hollow-bodied guitar, because his Fender Stratocaster had been stolen, and used his favourite Vox AC15 amplifier. He pushed the guitar\u2019s pickup closer to the strings by wedging a crushed cigarette packet under it. \u201cAlso important was the way the guitar was recorded,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was picked up by the mics for the orchestra, and it gave the guitar a mysterious, powerful sound.\u201d </p> <p>The theme became integral to the Bond mythology. \u201cBond\u2019s sexiness, his mystery, his ruthlessness \u2013 it\u2019s all there in a few notes,\u201d said Flick. He later noted ruefully that, \u201cMonty Norman made hundreds of thousands of pounds, John Barry made millions from the spin-off, I got seven pounds 10 shillings for playing on it.\u201d In 2008, the original Barry recording of the theme with Flick\u2019s playing was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.</p> <p>Born in Worcester Park, Surrey, he was the son of Mabel (nee Curry), an amateur opera singer, and Harold Flick, a music teacher. When Vic was 14, his father started a band with himself on piano, Vic\u2019s elder brother, Alan, on bass and a couple of neighbours on drums and saxophone. Vic had been studying piano since he was seven, but since that instrument was taken, he decided to try the guitar. Having obtained a Gibson Kalamazoo, he began practising assiduously, devising a crude amplification system by attaching a tank commander\u2019s microphone to the guitar and plugging it into his father\u2019s radio.</p> <p>After leaving school in 1953, Flick worked as a heating and ventilation technician while continuing to play music. He first dipped a toe into professional musicianship by playing with Les Clarke and his Musical Maniacs at Butlin\u2019s in Skegness, but bookings were scarce. He then formed the Vic Alan Quintet with his brother. They were hired for a summer season at Butlin\u2019s in Clacton, where Flick\u2019s playing caught the ear of the resident bandleader Eric Winstone. Flick sat in with Winstone\u2019s band as well as his own, and Winstone subsequently recruited him for gigs and BBC radio work. </p> <p>In 1957 he was invited to replace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/24/radio.obituaries\">Ken Sykora</a> as guitarist in the Bob Cort Skiffle Group (who performed the theme tune for the BBC\u2019s primitive attempt at a rock\u2019n\u2019roll TV show, Six-Five Special), just before their tour with Paul Anka and the John Barry Seven. A few months later, Barry invited Flick to join his band. Barry was particularly keen to recruit him because he was a rarity among guitarists in being able to read music. Flick was given a sheaf of pieces to learn for an imminent high-profile performance at the Metropolitan theatre in London\u2019s Edgware Road, attended by numerous music business luminaries. A few days later he made his TV debut on Oh Boy! with Barry\u2019s band.</p>    <p>He would spend five years with the group, and for two of them he led the band while Barry concentrated on film work. Singles such as Hit and Miss (used as the theme to TV\u2019s Juke Box Jury), Walk Don\u2019t Run (1960), with its trademark tremolo effect, and The Magnificent Seven (1961) were all showcases for Flick\u2019s guitar. Their album Stringbeat (1961) was especially significant for Flick, since it was built around his solo guitar with a backing of strings and prompted a surge in demand for him to play on sessions for other artists. It also contained his composing debut, Zapata, a piece evocative of cowboy movies.</p> <p>As a session musician, Flick appeared on a huge list of high-profile hits, including Jones\u2019s It\u2019s Not Unusual and What\u2019s New Pussycat?, Clark\u2019s Downtown, Bacharach\u2019s Trains And Boats and Planes, Sandie Shaw\u2019s Puppet On A String, and Peter &amp; Gordon\u2019s A World Without Love (on which he played 12-string guitar, and which topped the US and UK charts). He was featured on Paul McCartney\u2019s 1977 album Thrillington, and frequently worked with the Beatles producer George Martin, who brought him in to play on Ringo\u2019s Theme (This Boy) for the 1964 Beatles film, A Hard Day\u2019s Night.</p> <p>Flick played on several more Bond soundtracks, including From Russia With Love and Goldfinger. He recalled how, when recording Bassey\u2019s title song for the latter, Barry told Bassey she wasn\u2019t holding the final note long enough and had to do it again. \u201cSo Shirley slipped behind a studio partition, took her bra off and threw it over the top of the partition. She said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s take this last note again.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the 1970s and 80s Flick worked as composer and arranger on several Merchant Ivory films, including Autobiography of a Princess (1975) and Heat And Dust (19983). </p> <p>In 1989 he teamed up with Eric Clapton to record Michael Kamen\u2019s theme from Licence to Kill (starring Timothy Dalton as Bond), but the piece was eventually dropped in favour of a title song sung by Gladys Knight. In 1999 he reprised the Bond theme on the album Bond Back in Action, and the following year did it again on his own album James Bond Now, a collection of Bond themes in new guitar-orientated arrangements. Also in 2000 he published the memoir Vic Flick, Guitarman: from James Bond to the Beatles and Beyond. In 2005 he performed on the soundtrack of the computer game From Russia With Love (which also featured the voice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/31/sir-sean-connery-obituary\">Sean Connery</a>).</p> <p>In 2013 Flick received the lifetime achievement award from the National Guitar Museum.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Judith (nee Reavil), whom he married in 1960, his son, Kevin, and a grandson, Tyler.

The Southampton manager has been wrestling to find a winning formula to avert an immediate return to the Championship and made five changes, handing the 6ft 7in striker Paul Onuachu his first league start in 18 months, since Saints were relegated last year, while Ryan Fraser was given the daunting task of shackling Salah from left wing-back. Alex McCarthy had a nervy game after replacing the injured Aaron Ramsdale in goal. The accusation levelled at Martin since he began life in the dugout at MK Dons in League One has been his teams\u2019 tendency to overplay and the slapstick if not comical manner of Liverpool\u2019s goal on the half-hour only served to add another log to the raging fire of debate.</p> \n<p>Martin does not wish for Saints to self-sabotage. McCarthy rolled the ball to Fernandes and pointed upfield, seemingly not accounting for the traffic on the midfielder\u2019s radar. Fernandes, hounded by Curtis Jones, passed the ball to Flynn Downes, standing on his goalline. He panicked in possession and hurried a half-baked clearance straight to Szoboszlai, who took a touch to compose himself before lining up a majestic finish. Martin shook his head and winced after Szoboszlai caressed an unerring left-foot shot in off a post. Downes almost immediately made amends, drawing a fine save from Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher.</p> \n<p>\u201cI ask them to play quickly so I take responsibility for that,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI think the players who were in the Premier League [with Southampton] last time feel very differently about this season. We have to eradicate those moments to give ourselves a chance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Onuachu had been a handful, earning <em>ol</em><em>\u00e9</em>s from the home support, and Liverpool will have welcomed his premature exit with a hamstring problem after colliding with Cody Gakpo six minutes into the second half. The only problem for Liverpool was that Southampton still had Tyler Dibling on the pitch. The 18-year-old, who made his England Under-21 debut last week, has been Saints\u2019 beacon of light during a draining few months. Dibling excelled on his Premier League debut against Manchester United in September, his direct running causing havoc and he won a penalty which Cameron Archer failed to convert.</p> \n<p>Dibling won another spot-kick here, haring forward after seizing on a rare lapse by Virgil van Dijk and drawing a crunch from Andy Robertson. The referee, Samuel Barrott, pointed to the spot. This time, after the VAR, Michael Oliver, in a hoodie at Stockley Park, concluded the foul occurred on the edge of the 18-yard box \u2013 some angles appeared to show first contact happened just outside the area \u2013 Armstrong stepped up. His penalty was poor and allowed Kelleher, diving to his right, to repel his effort, but the striker sent the rebound through the goalkeeper\u2019s legs to level.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Dibling was at the forefront of every Saints attack and the catalyst for the superb counter that culminated in Kelleher fishing the ball out of his net 11 minutes after the interval. A move that inadvertently began with McCarthy fumbling a Liverpool corner ended with Fernandes neatly side-footing home Armstrong\u2019s cross. Fraser had released Dibling, who on the touchline exquisitely checked back to eliminate Szoboszlai. Dibling then freed Armstrong, who lured Robertson, Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 \u2013 who struggled all game \u2013 and Conor Bradley with him, then kept his cool to locate Fernandes, who calmly did the rest. The Portuguese has been another big plus.</p> \n<p>However Southampton, enterprising going forward but vulnerable at the back, have a habit of leaking points. Liverpool\u2019s equaliser was another sickener. Ryan Gravenberch sent a routine pass down the right channel, over the top of Kyle Walker-Peters, and McCarthy rushed from his goal to meet it. By the time it dawned on McCarthy that it may not have been the best move, it was too late as Salah cutely zipped the ball past him and into a gaping net.</p> \n<p>McCarthy, to his credit, helped Southampton survive a few more hairy episodes but then the substitute Yuki Sugawara gifted the visitors another chance, handling Salah\u2019s cross at the back post. The man himself buried his spot-kick.</p>",

Martin does not wish for Saints to self-sabotage. McCarthy rolled the ball to Fernandes and pointed upfield, seemingly not accounting for the traffic on the midfielder\u2019s radar. Fernandes, hounded by Curtis Jones, passed the ball to Flynn Downes, standing on his goalline. He panicked in possession and hurried a half-baked clearance straight to Szoboszlai, who took a touch to compose himself before lining up a majestic finish. Martin shook his head and winced after Szoboszlai caressed an unerring left-foot shot in off a post. Downes almost immediately made amends, drawing a fine save from Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher. \u201cI ask them to play quickly so I take responsibility for that,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI think the players who were in the Premier League [with Southampton] last time feel very differently about this season. We have to eradicate those moments to give ourselves a chance.\u201d Onuachu had been a handful, earning ol\u00e9s from the home support, and Liverpool will have welcomed his premature exit with a hamstring problem after colliding with Cody Gakpo six minutes into the second half. The only problem for Liverpool was that Southampton still had Tyler Dibling on the pitch. The 18-year-old, who made his England Under-21 debut last week, has been Saints\u2019 beacon of light during a draining few months. Dibling excelled on his Premier League debut against Manchester United in September, his direct running causing havoc and he won a penalty which Cameron Archer failed to convert. Dibling won another spot-kick here, haring forward after seizing on a rare lapse by Virgil van Dijk and drawing a crunch from Andy Robertson. The referee, Samuel Barrott, pointed to the spot. This time, after the VAR, Michael Oliver, in a hoodie at Stockley Park, concluded the foul occurred on the edge of the 18-yard box \u2013 some angles appeared to show first contact happened just outside the area \u2013 Armstrong stepped up. His penalty was poor and allowed Kelleher, diving to his right, to repel his effort, but the striker sent the rebound through the goalkeeper\u2019s legs to level. Dibling was at the forefront of every Saints attack and the catalyst for the superb counter that culminated in Kelleher fishing the ball out of his net 11 minutes after the interval. A move that inadvertently began with McCarthy fumbling a Liverpool corner ended with Fernandes neatly side-footing home Armstrong\u2019s cross. Fraser had released Dibling, who on the touchline exquisitely checked back to eliminate Szoboszlai. Dibling then freed Armstrong, who lured Robertson, Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 \u2013 who struggled all game \u2013 and Conor Bradley with him, then kept his cool to locate Fernandes, who calmly did the rest. The Portuguese has been another big plus. However Southampton, enterprising going forward but vulnerable at the back, have a habit of leaking points. Liverpool\u2019s equaliser was another sickener. Ryan Gravenberch sent a routine pass down the right channel, over the top of Kyle Walker-Peters, and McCarthy rushed from his goal to meet it. By the time it dawned on McCarthy that it may not have been the best move, it was too late as Salah cutely zipped the ball past him and into a gaping net. McCarthy, to his credit, helped Southampton survive a few more hairy episodes but then the substitute Yuki Sugawara gifted the visitors another chance, handling Salah\u2019s cross at the back post. The man himself buried his spot-kick.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump Jr has emerged as the family\u2019s most influential adviser of the moment as his father builds the most controversial cabinet in modern US history, sources close to Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son say. Trump Jr has in some cases promoted inexperienced loyalists over more qualified candidates for top positions in president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration. During Trump\u2019s first administration, as the 45th president, his elder daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, were top-level political advisers, while his sons Don Jr and Eric were assigned mainly to run the family business. Ivanka and her husband took a big step back from politics after Trump lost to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and during Trump\u2019s subsequent descent into a tangle of civil and criminal cases against him, though they have been more present since his victory in the election earlier this month. Now sources have told Reuters that Don Jr is currently the leading offspring voice in his father\u2019s ear and the president-elect has become particularly reliant on his son for advice on White House strategy. But at least two of the more controversial choices championed by Don Jr face tough Senate confirmation challenges \u2013 vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr of the chiefly Democratic Kennedy political dynasty for health secretary, and former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, who faces bipartisan concern over her Russian interests and lack of experience in the intelligence community. Appointments planning continued on Sunday, the Washington Post reported, with the likely elevation of Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford-trained physician and economist, as the next director of the National Institutes of Health. Reuters spoke to half a dozen sources, including donors, political allies and friends, who confirmed Don Jr\u2019s influence in pitching names for appointments, including inexperienced loyalists. Don Jr was credited with making JD Vance his father\u2019s vice-presidential pick, helping cabinet contenders sink or rise to the fore and blocking former secretary of state Mike Pompeo from joining the cabinet. \u201cThe reality this time is we actually know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Don Jr told Fox News earlier this month. \u201cAnd it\u2019s about surrounding my father with people who are both competent and loyal.\u201d Kushner, formerly Trump\u2019s senior adviser who focused on the Middle East, told Reuters that he is briefing real estate investor Steve Witkoff on his new job as special envoy to the region. \u201cI have been working with Witkoff to get him up to speed on Trump\u2019s past efforts,\u201d Kushner said through a spokesperson. One source close to the transition said Trump does not appear to need his family for advice as much as in the past because of aides like Susie Wiles, who helped to run the most disciplined of his election campaigns to date and will be his chief of staff. \u201cStuff is really buttoned down,\u201d the source said of Trump\u2019s current team. \u201cHe may not need the family this time like he used to.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This is at once a wise and wonderfully enjoyable book. <a href=\"https://marklilla.com/\">Mark Lilla</a> treats weighty matters with a light touch, in an elegant prose style that crackles with dry wit.

I\u2019m just happy she gets to have that moment.\u201d</p> <p>In a fierce, niggly encounter Tuipulotu scored the opening try and also, unintentionally but significantly, took Australia\u2019s Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii out with a rampaging carry. It became a comfortable victory but there was inaccuracy and frustration too, especially in the first half.</p> <p>\u201cToday was slightly off,\u201d Townsend said of his side\u2019s early struggles. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t knock us off our stride. That was pleasing and there is more to come from this group.\u201d</p> <p>Storm Bert had caused havoc in the buildup but the players awoke to blue skies and mercifully warmer weather. \u201cThere was a fair few of us who hadn\u2019t seen it snowing before,\u201d the Wallabies captain, Harry Wilson, said of the midweek cold snap. \u201cWe were all pretty excited about it.\u201d As if that had not been enough to deal with, Schmidt was forced to make two late changes before the early loss of Suaalii became a further blow.</p> <p>This was the first time since last year\u2019s Rugby World Cup match against Ireland that Townsend could select his preferred back three of Kinghorn, Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe and there was excitement about a rapier-like attack meeting a skilful, improving Wallabies, but the early highlight was Graham\u2019s exceptional winning of a breakdown penalty. A direct carry by the 21-year-old Suaalii helped to earn field position for Noah Lolesio to open the scoring off the tee, before Finn Russell fluffed a chance to level with his own kick.</p> <p>When Ewan Ashman threw a lineout to Tuipulotu there was no stopping the home captain from close quarters. He ran straight through Len Ikitau, having brushed off Andrew Kellaway, after which Scotland raised the tempo. Tuipulotu cut in from the left, fed by Graham, and crunched into contact with Suaalii, who was taken off after exchanging a few words with his adversary.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the festival of rugby we had hoped for.

      "bodyText": "Scotland\u2019s autumn report card reads three wins out of four. That will do nicely, but Gregor Townsend\u2019s team felt obliged to defeat a resurgent Australia to regard this campaign as a success. The hosts eventually scored four tries in overwhelming Joe Schmidt\u2019s young side \u2013 there will be no Wallabies grand slam, no emulation of the heroes of 1984 \u2013 but the tourists stayed in the battle until the final quarter. Player of the match, Blair Kinghorn, produced in an imperious display from full-back while the Scots captain, Sione Tuipulotu \u2013 born in Melbourne, raised between Australia and Tonga \u2013 led by example. His Greenock-born grandmother, Jaqueline Thomson, even flew over for the occasion. \u201cIt felt weird,\u201d Tuipulotu said of seeing her up on the stadium\u2019s big screen. \u201cI\u2019m happy and a bit emotional that her life has gone full circle and she\u2019s back here watching me play for Scotland. I\u2019m just happy she gets to have that moment.\u201d In a fierce, niggly encounter Tuipulotu scored the opening try and also, unintentionally but significantly, took Australia\u2019s Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii out with a rampaging carry. It became a comfortable victory but there was inaccuracy and frustration too, especially in the first half. \u201cToday was slightly off,\u201d Townsend said of his side\u2019s early struggles. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t knock us off our stride. That was pleasing and there is more to come from this group.\u201d Storm Bert had caused havoc in the buildup but the players awoke to blue skies and mercifully warmer weather. \u201cThere was a fair few of us who hadn\u2019t seen it snowing before,\u201d the Wallabies captain, Harry Wilson, said of the midweek cold snap. \u201cWe were all pretty excited about it.\u201d As if that had not been enough to deal with, Schmidt was forced to make two late changes before the early loss of Suaalii became a further blow. This was the first time since last year\u2019s Rugby World Cup match against Ireland that Townsend could select his preferred back three of Kinghorn, Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe and there was excitement about a rapier-like attack meeting a skilful, improving Wallabies, but the early highlight was Graham\u2019s exceptional winning of a breakdown penalty. A direct carry by the 21-year-old Suaalii helped to earn field position for Noah Lolesio to open the scoring off the tee, before Finn Russell fluffed a chance to level with his own kick. When Ewan Ashman threw a lineout to Tuipulotu there was no stopping the home captain from close quarters. He ran straight through Len Ikitau, having brushed off Andrew Kellaway, after which Scotland raised the tempo. Tuipulotu cut in from the left, fed by Graham, and crunched into contact with Suaalii, who was taken off after exchanging a few words with his adversary. It wasn\u2019t the festival of rugby we had hoped for. Australia\u2019s Carlo Tizzano was penalised soon after half-time, allowing Russell to pass 400 Scotland points with a penalty, only for Australia to answer immediately. The scoreboard was worryingly close for a campaign-defining fixture. Home fans wailed when Tom Wright, the Australia full-back, appeared to block Ben White after the scrum-half chipped over the top. \u201cDid he stand his ground, or did he put his shoulder in?\u201d Townsend later wondered. The TMO decided the former, but that was all forgotten when Russell and the electrifying Kinghorn combined to send Van der Merwe darting over. Another quicksilver attack saw Graham breaking the line and looping a pass to Bath\u2019s Josh Bayliss, fresh off the bench. The back-rower had defenders to beat and applied a stunning finish. Russell\u2019s conversion made it 22-6, Australia\u2019s grand slam hope truly gone.

      "bodyText": "An Israeli airstrike on a Lebanese army centre has killed one soldier and injured 18 others. The Israeli military said the airstrike, which occurred in southwestern Lebanon, was under review. Iran is preparing to \u201crespond\u201d to Israel, Ali Larijani, a senior adviser to the country\u2019s supreme leader, said in an interview. At least 44,211 Palestinian people have been killed and 104,567, injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in an update.Of those, 35 Palestinians were killed and 94 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. In north Gaza, where the Israeli military\u2019s siege continues, health officials said an Israeli drone dropped bombs on Kamal Adwan hospital, injuring its director Hussam Abu Safiya. The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders to residents in areas of an eastern Gaza City suburb, setting off a new wave of displacement on Sunday. Hezbollah fired around 160 rockets and other projectiles into northern and central Israel on Sunday, reportedly injuring around 10 people. A gunman was killed and three policemen were injured after a shooting incident near the Israeli embassy in Jordan ended, a security source told Reuters. Police shot a gunman who had fired at a police patrol in the affluent Rabiah neighbourhood of the Jordanian capital, the state news agency Petra reported. Iran is preparing to \u201crespond\u201d to Israel, Ali Larijani, a senior adviser to the country\u2019s supreme leader, said in an interview published by Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency. On 26 October, Israeli fighter jets carried out three waves of attacks on Iranian military targets, a few weeks after Iran fired a barrage of about 200 ballistic missiles against Israel. Iran has previously vowed to respond to Isarel\u2019s attacks. A gunman was killed and three policemen injured after a shooting near the Israeli embassy in Jordan, a security source and state media said on Sunday. Police shot a gunman who had fired at a police patrol in the Rabiah neighbourhood of Amman, state news agency Petra reported, citing public security, adding investigations were ongoing. Jordan\u2019s government communications minister, Mohamed Momani, described the shooting as a terror attack that targeted public security forces in the country. He said in a statement that investigations into the attack were under way. Jordanian police had earlier cordoned off an area near the heavily policed embassy after gunshots were heard, witnesses said. Two witnesses said police and ambulances rushed to the Rabiah neighbourhood, where the embassy is located. You can read the full story here: Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinian people in Gaza are experiencing even more dire conditions as heavy rain damages makeshift shelters in refugee camps, with reports of tents being flooded as Israeli airstrikes continue to wreak devastation on the territory. Two Israeli airstrikes were reported on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on Sunday, about an hour after the Israeli military posted evacuation calls online. \u201cIsraeli warplanes launched two violent strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in the Kafaat area,\u201d the official National News Agency said, reportedly causing significant damage \u201cover a large geographical area\u201d. Earlier on Sunday, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned on X that the military would strike \u201cHezbollah facilities and interests\u201d in the Hadath and Burj al-Barajneh districts. As we have mentioned in the blog, the Israeli military said today that over 160 rockets have been fired at Israel from Lebanon since this morning. It is unclear how many people have been injured in the attacks but Al Jazeera is reporting that 10 Israelis are estimated to have been wounded. The outlet reports: There have been six direct impact incidents in five different locations, including two military installations, and this has covered a very large area. So it\u2019s not just the northern communities. We\u2019ve seen impact in the Tel Aviv area, in Haifa and in other areas. All in all, about 10 Israelis have been injured. Most of the injuries are light, but one is described as a severe injury. Speaking at the news conference in Beirut, Josep Borell also urged Lebanese leaders to pick a president to end a two-year power vacuum in the country, and he pledged \u20ac200m (\u00a3166m) in support for Lebanon\u2019s armed forces. The EU\u2019s outgoing foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has called for pressure to be exerted on both the Israeli government and on Hezbollah to accept a US ceasefire proposal. \u201cWe see only one possible way ahead: an immediate ceasefire and the full implementation of United Nations security council Resolution 1701,\u201d he said after meeting Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who has Hezbollah\u2019s support to negotiate. Borrell also met with Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, earlier. So what stage are the Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire talks at? This is an extract from a story my colleagues William Christou and Bethan McKernan filed on Wednesday: Over the past week, Lebanese, Israeli and US officials have said that a ceasefire was increasingly possible \u2013 though the details of what that would entail are not yet clear. Central to ceasefire negotiations is the presence of Hezbollah in Lebanon\u2019s south and its sway over the country in general, the politics of which it has dominated for the past decade. Israel has said it wants Hezbollah to be pushed back beyond the Litani River, 20 miles away from its border, as a form of security guarantee for people in northern Israel, tens of thousands of whom have been displaced by Hezbollah rocket fire over the past year. It had previously also said it wanted the power to unilaterally enforce a ceasefire agreement, which would give it de facto permission to carry out airstrikes in Lebanon at will. The Lebanese speaker of the house, Nabih Berri, said last Tuesday that \u201cno sane person\u201d would agree to such a condition. An Israeli airstrike on a Lebanese army centre on Sunday killed one soldier and injured 18 other people, the Lebanese military said. The deadly strike occurred in southwestern Lebanon on the coastal road between Tyre and Naqoura. The Israeli military claimed in a statement issued afterwards that its operations are directed solely against Hezbollah and not the Lebanese military, and that the strike was under review. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, however, condemned it as an assault on US-led ceasefire efforts, calling it a \u201cdirect, bloody message rejecting all efforts and ongoing contacts\u201d to end the war. \u201c(Israel is) again writing in Lebanese blood a brazen rejection of the solution that is being discussed,\u201d a statement from his office read. Israeli attacks have killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry. Israel\u2019s assault on the country has displaced about 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population. Iran will hold talks with France, Germany and Britain on 29 November about nuclear and regional issues, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei has said. He did not say where the talks would take place but Japan\u2019s Kyodo news agency earlier reported that representatives of the four countries would meet in Geneva. In 2018, the then-Donald Trump administration exited Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear pact with six major countries and reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to violate the pact\u2019s nuclear limits, with moves such as rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output. Indirect talks between the Biden administration and Tehran to try to revive the pact have failed, but Trump, the president-elect, said during his election campaign in September: \u201cWe have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal\u201d. You can read what exactly the Iran deal consisted of in this useful explainer. Yechiel Leiter, an American-born rightwing publicist and former government aide who immigrated to Israel four decades ago, was announced as Israel\u2019s next ambassador to Washington earlier this month. The Israeli government said earlier today that it had approved the nomination of Leiter, an ally of the country\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cThe government has unanimously approved the appointment of Dr Yechiel Leiter as ambassador to the United States,\u201d the foreign ministry said. A former adviser to Netanyahu, Leiter, 65, lives in a settlement in the occupied West Bank. Close to the US Republican Party, Leiter used to be one of the leaders of the Yesha Council, an umbrella group representing Israeli settlers in the West Bank in the 1990s, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. He is also a member of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party and currently works as a strategic adviser to Israeli think tanks. His son, Moshe Leiter, was killed in combat in November 2023 in the Gaza Strip. Leiter is a fierce critic of outgoing US president Joe Biden, condemning what he described in an interview as \u201cAmerican pressure\u201d during Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. He will take on the ambassador role after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration next January, succeeding Mike Herzog (president Isaac Herzog\u2019s brother) who was appointed in 2021. Israel\u2019s military said around 160 projectiles had been fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon into northern and central Israel Sunday, some of which were intercepted. \u201cAs of 15:00 (1300 GMT), approximately 160 projectiles that were fired by the Hezbollah terrorist organisation have crossed from Lebanon into Israel today,\u201d the army said. Medical agencies reported that several people had been injured, including a man in a \u201cmoderate to serious\u201d condition. We have not been able to independently verify this information yet. Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson, has said that eight rockets were fired towards Israel from Lebanon, adding that most of them were successfully intercepted. It comes as Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, said its fighters launched a drone attack on the Ashdod naval base in southern Israel for the first time. At least 44,211 Palestinian people have been killed and 104,567, injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Of those, 35 Palestinians were killed and 94 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. Gaza\u2019s health ministry has said in the past that thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory.. Meanwhile in north Gaza, health officials said an Israeli drone dropped bombs on Kamal Adwan hospital, injuring its director Hussam Abu Safiya. \u201cThis will not stop us from completing our humanitarian mission and we will continue to do this job at any cost,\u201d Abu Safiya said in a video statement circulated by the health ministry on Sunday. \u201cWe are being targeted daily. They targeted me a while ago but this will not deter us \u2026,\u201d he said from his hospital bed. Israeli forces say armed militants use civilian buildings including housing blocks, hospitals and schools for operational cover. Hamas denies this, accusing Israeli forces of indiscriminately targeting populated areas. A renewed Israeli assault was launched on the northern part of the Gaza Strip last month, with the Israeli military claiming it was to stop Hamas fighters regrouping there. The blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, however, have led to accusations that Israel is committing the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. The entirety of northern Gaza has been under Israeli evacuation orders but it is unclear how many people remain. The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders to residents in areas of an eastern Gaza City suburb, setting off a new wave of displacement on Sunday, and a Gaza hospital director was injured in an Israeli drone attack, Palestinian medics said. The new orders for the Shejaiya suburb posted by the Israeli army spokesperson on X on Saturday night were blamed on Palestinian militants firing rockets from that heavily built-up district in the north of the Gaza Strip. \u201cFor your safety, you must evacuate immediately to the south,\u201d the military\u2019s post said. The rocket volley on Saturday was claimed by Hamas\u2019 armed wing, which said it had targeted an Israeli army base over the border. Footage circulated on social and Palestinian media showed residents leaving Shejaia on donkey carts and rickshaws, with others, including children carrying backpacks, walking. Families living in the targeted areas began fleeing their homes after nightfall on Saturday and into Sunday\u2019s early hours, residents and Palestinian media said \u2013 the latest in multiple waves of displacement since the war began 13 months ago.",

It\u2019s very difficult to disturb me with anything. I\u2019m very focused on the racing side of things. I forget about everything, even positive, negative stuff. And I just focus on what\u2019s ahead of me.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/24/max-verstappen-fourth-consecutive-f1-world-title-las-vegas-gp-race-report\">Max Verstappen hits jackpot by winning fourth F1 world title in Las Vegas</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Horner called it the driver\u2019s most impressive title, and the Dutchman concurred, noting how pleased he had been at closing it out despite being outpaced for most of the year by McLaren. \u201cI would say for 70% of the season, we didn\u2019t have the fastest car,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cBut we extended our lead. So that is definitely something that I\u2019m very proud of.\u201d</p> \n<p>Verstappen took his fourth consecutive title with fifth place in a Las Vegas Grand Prix won by Mercedes\u2019 George Russell, the culmination of a season that opened with his Red Bull team in turmoil.</p> \n<p>Before their car had been launched Horner was accused of inappropriate behaviour by a female employee. The charge was subsequently dismissed by an independent enquiry, but it was followed by Verstappen\u2019s father, Jos, calling for Horner to step down and then by their enormously successful car designer Adrian Newey announcing he was to leave.</p> \n<p>Horner acknowledged the season had been the most demanding of Verstappen\u2019s career and that he had delivered superbly, especially given the circumstances.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis one is a very special victory because obviously there have been challenges this year,\u201d Horner said. \u201cBut Max has scored double the amount of race wins as any other driver. He has won it with two races to go. He has been head and shoulders the best driver on the grid. What he has done absolutely cements his position among the greats in the sport. Statistically, and the way he has driven, that is unquestionable now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Amid the adversity Verstappen kept his focus on scoring points and, after taking the title in Las Vegas, he observed he may yet challenge the seven championships won by Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher. His fourth title places him on a par with Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven with not the fastest car, we still won it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I always know that when I sit in the car, I\u2019m going to give it everything I have.

      "bodyText": "Max Verstappen hailed his fourth Formula One world championship as his best yet while his team principal, Christian Horner, said the title made Verstappen one of the greats of the sport. \u201cThe beginning was a bit messy,\u201d Verstappen said in Las Vegas of the furore that engulfed Red Bull before the season started. \u201cBut I\u2019m quite calm in those situations. It\u2019s very difficult to disturb me with anything. I\u2019m very focused on the racing side of things. I forget about everything, even positive, negative stuff. And I just focus on what\u2019s ahead of me.\u201d Horner called it the driver\u2019s most impressive title, and the Dutchman concurred, noting how pleased he had been at closing it out despite being outpaced for most of the year by McLaren. \u201cI would say for 70% of the season, we didn\u2019t have the fastest car,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cBut we extended our lead. So that is definitely something that I\u2019m very proud of.\u201d Verstappen took his fourth consecutive title with fifth place in a Las Vegas Grand Prix won by Mercedes\u2019 George Russell, the culmination of a season that opened with his Red Bull team in turmoil. Before their car had been launched Horner was accused of inappropriate behaviour by a female employee. The charge was subsequently dismissed by an independent enquiry, but it was followed by Verstappen\u2019s father, Jos, calling for Horner to step down and then by their enormously successful car designer Adrian Newey announcing he was to leave. Horner acknowledged the season had been the most demanding of Verstappen\u2019s career and that he had delivered superbly, especially given the circumstances. \u201cThis one is a very special victory because obviously there have been challenges this year,\u201d Horner said. \u201cBut Max has scored double the amount of race wins as any other driver. He has won it with two races to go. He has been head and shoulders the best driver on the grid. What he has done absolutely cements his position among the greats in the sport. Statistically, and the way he has driven, that is unquestionable now.\u201d Amid the adversity Verstappen kept his focus on scoring points and, after taking the title in Las Vegas, he observed he may yet challenge the seven championships won by Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher. His fourth title places him on a par with Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel. \u201cEven with not the fastest car, we still won it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I always know that when I sit in the car, I\u2019m going to give it everything I have. And of course, over the last few years, I also grew as a driver. So very excited to see what we can do next year.\u201d His future at Red Bull was also addressed. Verstappen was courted this year by the team principal of Mercedes, Toto Wolff, but the Dutchman, who has a contract until 2028 with Red Bull, insisted thatdespite the storm around the team, he was going nowhere. \u201cI\u2019m very loyal to the team,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen there are tough times, it\u2019s very easy to say goodbye or forget about it or ignore it. But I think it\u2019s actually way more important to actually face them and go through it together and deal with it.\u201d The achievement was also acknowledged by other drivers, including Hamilton, who finished second in Vegas. \u201cHe\u2019s done a fantastic job. He\u2019s not made any mistakes and he\u2019s delivered every time and every point he\u2019s supposed to,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cHim and his team have done the best job, again, fourth year in a row.\u201d Lando Norris, who relinquished his outside chance of the title, came in one place behind Verstappen. His team, McLaren, hold a 24-point lead over Ferrari and could yet win their first constructors\u2019 title since 1998. \u201cMax deserved to win it, because he drove a better season than I did,\u201d Norris said. \u201cMax just doesn\u2019t have a weakness.

There\u2019s always the hope, but I think you balance and you go, \u2018right, if we can get her back, we get her back\u2019. But we\u2019re just not going to rush her in this moment because it\u2019s a calf injury, it\u2019s your running mechanism. If we injure the running mechanism, it takes longer. So ideally we\u2019d like her back for those games afterwards. The projection is she misses this game [Chelsea], she misses the international window, probably misses the first game after that and then we\u2019ll see from there.

I think we had two fantastic chances that on another day would probably go in. I thought in the second half we actually played better against the wind. I think we can be proud of how we played in the second half.\u201d Women\u2019s League Cup results Durham 1-1 Sheffield United (4-3 penalties) (FT) Brighton 0-0 Leicester (HT) Crystal Palace 2-0 Charlton (HT) London City Lionesses 1-1 West Ham (HT) Newcastle 0-4 Liverpool (HT) Portsmouth 0-3 Southampton (HT) Sunderland 0-1 Blackburn (HT) Bristol City vs Birmingham (3pm KO) Chelsea captain Millie Bright tells Sky Sports: \u201cIt was intense, I think we knew that everything we faced we would face. Today was about mentality, the grit we have as a club and a team. To be honest I think we\u2019re disappointed it was only 1-0, I think we had some really good chances to punish them in the first half and especially the second. It\u2019s always difficult when you leave a team hanging in there.\u201d Sonia Bompastor adds: \u201cI think in terms of performance especially in possession I was hoping for us to be able to play a little more under pressure. But I think the weather and especially wind didn\u2019t help today. I think we created a lot of chances, we could have scored more and left the door a little open for Manchester United to come back. I think sometimes if you\u2019re not really pleased with the performance, you just have to take what is positive. Three points and now we\u2019re leading with five points ahead which is a very good thing.\u201d Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor tells Sky Sports: \u201cI\u2019m very very happy, today five points [clear], I\u2019m very happy.\u201d Discussing Sandy Baltimore\u2019s impact, she continued: \u201cI love her to get on the ball and when she\u2019s able to get on the ball she\u2019s able to take the one-v-one, dribbling and she has so much power. She runs all over the outside corridor, this is what I ask from her and this is what she does.\u201d Chelsea have won their last 11 games in the WSL - their longest winning streak in the league since the 2011/12 campaign. Manchester United manager Marc Skinner tells Sky Sports: \u201cChelsea are the best team in the country, they\u2019re the champions for a reason. We said we would give everything from the off and the players have given everything. Both teams had to play the conditions but the pride I feel for the team and their commitment to what we\u2019re doing and know we can do, I\u2019m proud of their performance.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of games that are this close. I think you need to have that commitment in every game you play against them and if you do you have a chance of beating them. We\u2019ll get closer, I\u2019ve no doubt about that.\u201d That result moves Chelsea five points clear at the top of the WSL table. Meanwhile, Manchester United remain fifth. That was an improved performance from Manchester United in the second half. They started well after the break but dropped off and invited some pressure from the hosts. Maya Le Tissier kept them in the game before a late charge where they came agonisingly close to an equaliser. It wasn\u2019t quite meant to be, however. Marc Skinner will take the positives from that display. Manchester United\u2019s unbeaten run comes to an end, while Chelsea\u2019s formidable winning streak continues! 90+7 min: Chelsea clear the danger and that should be time\u2026 90+7 min: Manchester United corner. Tullis-Joyce is up for it\u2026 90+6 min: The ball is sent into the box from the free kick but Chelsea can clear. It eventually runs back out to the left and Cuthbert gives away another foul for a challenge on Galton. Now THIS could be the final roll\u2026 90+5 min: Manchester United have a free kick in the centre of the pitch. This could be one final roll of the dice\u2026 90+3 min: We\u2019re into six minutes of added time. Manchester United have made one final change with Anna Sandberg replacing George in defence. 90+1 min: Malard rattles the crossbar! Geyse crosses the ball into the box and finds the striker, who does well to turn past Bright. She then unleashes a powerful strike which smashes the bar by the top-right corner! 89 min: Another substitution for Manchester United. Awujo is replaced by Hayley Ladd as we enter the final few minutes. 86 min: Huge chance for Chelsea to make it two! The ball is sent through to Kaneryd on the right, who is in plenty of space with George way out of position. The winger squares it to Ram\u00edrez in the centre of the box, but the striker fires her shot straight down the middle, making it easy for Tullis-Joyce to make the save! An uncharacteristic miss from the Colombia international. 83 min: Manchester United have a free kick on the left following a foul on Galton from Bronze. Clinton delivers the ball into the box, but it is cleared by Beever-Jones. 80 min: Ram\u00edrez goes to ground in the box after being caught in the face by Le Tissier. The referee immediately dismisses any claims of a penalty. Replays show it was purely accidental, not enough in it to warrant a foul. 78 min: Goalkeeper time-out as Tullis-Joyce goes to ground. Marc Skinner has gathered his team ahead of the final 10 minutes. 75 min: Macario drills the free kick into the box and Bronze goes for goal, but her shot takes a double deflection before falling back out to the edge of the box. Ram\u00edrez takes possession and tries to find a bit of space before shooting. However, her effort is easily saved by Tullis-Joyce. 74 min: Janssen is booked for a lazy challenge on Cuthbert and Chelsea have a free kick in a very dangerous position. 72 min: Chelsea look like they are in cruise control now. Surely it\u2019s only a matter of time before they score another. 69 min: Following their strong start to the second half, Manchester United have dropped off in the last 15 minutes and are now inviting more pressure from Chelsea. They are at risk of conceding a second here\u2026 66 min: Huge chance for Chelsea! Kaneryd receives the ball in acres of space just outside the box. She goes two-on-one against Le Tissier with Ram\u00edrez but decides to go solo. The Manchester United defender is quickly able to get across to block the shot. 63 min: Janssen gives away a free kick for a clumsy challenge on Ram\u00edrez. Macario steps up to take it and kicks-off a set-piece routine straight from the training ground. She passes the ball through to Baltimore, who is completely unmarked on the right. The full-back then crosses it in to Bj\u00f6rn and the defender goes for goal but her effort is deflected behind. Nothing comes from the subsequent corner. 60 min: Marc Skinner is next to make a double change. Melvine Malard replaces Williams, who was on a booking, up front. Leah Galton is also on for Bizet. 57 min: Chance for Chelsea now as Ram\u00edrez makes her way into the box. The striker goes for goal from a tight angle and forces a save from Tullis-Joyce. 56 min: Sonia Bompastor is first to make some substitutions. Catarina Macario is on to replace Hamano, while goalscorer Reiten makes way for Aggie Beever-Jones. 54 min: Manchester United go on the attack again as Geyse carries the ball forward. She lays it off to Bizet on the edge of the box, but the winger\u2019s first touch gets away from her. As she tries to win the ball back she catches Bronze and Chelsea are given a free kick. 51 min: Huge chance for United! Geyse wins the ball from Bronze on the left before cutting inside and shooting from distance. Her effort takes a huge deflection off N\u00fcsken and heads straight for the top-right corner, but Hampton gets across to make a fantastic save! 49 min: Manchester United have a free kick in midfield and Le Tissier sends the ball straight into the box. It is deflected off the head of Bj\u00f6rn before running behind, but the referee awards Chelsea a goal kick! Turner is furious! 47 min: Geyse does well to win the ball from Bj\u00f6rn in midfield before driving towards goal. She has Bizet to her right but decides to go solo and is eventually blocked by Bright. Manchester United get us back under way at Kingsmeadow! Manchester United failed to manage a single shot during that first half\u2026 While we wait for the second half, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to Moving the Goalposts. Our women\u2019s football newsletter \u2013 which includes all the latest talking points \u2013 will land in your inbox every week. And there\u2019s the whistle! Reiten\u2019s inch-perfect penalty is all that separates the two teams at the break. 45+3 min: Kaneryd receives the ball on the right and sends a cross into the box, but Manchester United do well to clear the danger. Just one minute to go in this half. 45+1 min: Four minutes have been added on. Manchester United have gradually been applying more pressure late in this half, but Chelsea are quick on the transition. 43 min: Clinton gets on the end of a looped pass and deflects the ball into Geyse\u2019s path. The striker goes for goal but Bright makes a sliding challenge before she can shoot. Manchester United have a corner, but they can\u2019t make the most of it. 41 min: N\u00fcsken wins a free kick in midfield following a challenge from Williams, but Clinton receives a yellow card for unnecessarily kicking the ball away. 39 min: Baltimore and Reiten combine on the left before the full-back puts the ball into the box. Turner heads it off the line to clear the danger. 37 min: Geyse wins the ball on the left before letting Williams take over possession. The striker sends a cross into Bizet, but the winger can\u2019t get a touch on it. 34 min: Chelsea have a free kick on the left following a foul on Ram\u00edrez. Reiten sends it straight into the box, but the ball runs straight behind for a goal kick. 31 min: Sonia Bompastor is furious following that challenge on Hampton and appears to have words with some staff members on the Manchester United bench. Meanwhile, Williams receives a booking, potentially for dissent. 30 min: And just like that, the Chelsea goalkeeper is finally called into action! Riviere sends a cross into the box and Hampton jumps to claim it, but she is clattered into by Williams. The 24-year-old is down and appears to be in quite a lot of pain. 28 min: You could probably count on one hand the amount of touches Hampton has had on the ball. The Chelsea goalkeeper has enjoyed a quiet afternoon so far. 25 min: Geyse goes down following a challenge from Hamano but touches the ball with her hand as she tries to get back up and the referee awards Chelsea a free kick. The Manchester United fans are furious. \u201cSame old Chelsea, always cheating\u201d is being sung by the travelling supporters. 22 min: Bright attempts to find Bronze with a lofted pass over to the right. Probably not the best decision given the strong winds as the ball flies out of play and into the press box. 19 min: It\u2019s been coming. Chelsea have completely dominated this match and it was only a matter of time before they broke the deadlock. Manchester United are yet to challenge at all. Reiten calmly slots the spot-kick into the bottom-left corner! Chelsea lead! Ram\u00edrez is brought down in the box by Tullis-Joyce and Chelsea have a penalty! The Manchester United goalkeeper is also booked for the foul. 15 min: Bright picks up the ball in defence and makes a run out from the back before sending it through to Baltimore. The full-back sends a cross in to Kaneryd, but the forward\u2019s strike is off-target. 12 min: Huge chance for Chelsea! A corner is sent into the box and it falls to N\u00fcsken at the back post. The midfielder lets it bounce before unleashing a powerful strike, but it runs across the face of goal and behind for a goal kick. 10 min: Geyse appears to have picked up a knock and play stops so she can receive treatment. Replays show she landed awkwardly on her hand. She is able to play on for now. 8 min: Chelsea have certainly been dominant so far. Manchester United are struggling to contain Reiten, Kaneryd and Ram\u00edrez especially. 5 min: N\u00fcsken picks out Baltimore on the left with a great pass. The full-back brings it down with a perfect touch before setting the ball to Reiten, who plays inside. Kaneryd goes for goal but Ram\u00edrez accidentally gets in the way. 3 min: Reiten receives the ball on the left and looks to play a low-driven cross inside, but Riviere deflects it behind. Bizarrely, a goal kick is given despite the obvious contact. 2 min: Bronze gives the ball away cheaply to Janssen in midfield, who plays it to Williams. The striker eventually passes back to George, who puts a cross in, but Hampton is there to claim. We\u2019re under way at Kingsmeadow! Tom has been in touch to give his take on this huge fixture\u2026 \u201cI was at the semi vs Chelsea last season which was one of the best matches and atmospheres I\u2019ve ever been to in men\u2019s or women\u2019s football. I was also at the absolute hammering that Chelsea gave Utd at Old Trafford in the last game of the season which was one of the worst matches I\u2019ve ever been too! \u201cUtd seem to really struggle to physically cope against Chelsea and I\u2019m honest in expecting more of the same today. Perhaps Grace Clinton can provide a bit of bite and physicality and I guess that\u2019s why Williams is starting too. Anyway, fingers crossed and enjoy the match!\u201d With just a few minutes to go until kick-off, Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor tells Sky Sports: \u201cIt\u2019ll be a big test again. We are going to face a team unbeaten in the league. They didn\u2019t concede a lot of goals, strong defensively, a lot of talent as well. There is an element, the wind will maybe cause issues to both teams. We are ready, confident and if we play the way we want to play we will probably have chances to win the game today.\u201d Chelsea striker Mayra Ramirez spoke to Suzanne Wrack last week about adjusting to life in England, the differences between the WSL and Liga F and playing under the management of Sonia Bompastor. Manchester United are yet to lose a WSL match this season, but many fans are still unhappy with manager Marc Skinner. Despite being unbeaten the reigning FA Cup champions currently sit fifth in the table having dropped points on three occasions so far this campaign. A goalless draw at home to Aston Villa earlier this month left supporters furious - and Skinner\u2019s post-match comments certainly didn\u2019t help the matter. The manager\u2019s suggestion that United are still a \u201cnew team\u201d baffled fans and pundits alike, especially considering he is in his fourth season with the club. The discontent with Skinner peaked last season before Manchester United won the FA Cup. If they continue dropping points, the pressure could be on. A win today could be crucial. This is the only WSL match taking place this weekend. Manchester City and Arsenal both have the weekend off while the remaining top-flight clubs compete in the Continental Cup group stage\u2026 Durham vs Sheffield United Brighton vs Leicester Crystal Palace vs Charlton London City Lionesses vs West Ham Newcastle vs Liverpool Portsmouth vs Southampton Sunderland vs Blackburn Bristol City vs Birmingham Tottenham faced Aston Villa in Group E yesterday. Eveliina Summanen scored the decisive goal as Spurs clinched a 1-0 win. I want to hear from you! Feel free to email me with any predictions, thoughts, feelings, plans for the day and all that jazz. Are you braving Storm Bert to head to a match this afternoon? Or will you be watching/reading from the sofa? Let me know! Manchester United are looking to avenge the 6-0 defeat they suffered to Chelsea at Old Trafford last season. Marc Skinner expects his team to use May\u2019s chastening loss as extra motivation this afternoon. In his pre-match press conference, he said: \u201cThe reality is, when we walked off that field, nobody felt good. You can have a choice, can\u2019t you? You can [have] fear from it, or you can do something about it. I think these players have now learnt from that. It\u2019s not about blame, it\u2019s about growth. We have to learn and grow from that game. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be concentrated, be physically present, mentally present for every one of these minutes. And if we can do that to the best of our ability then we can win the game.\u201d Elisabeth Terland is also unavailable this afternoon due to a muscular issue. The striker experienced groin tightness against Leicester City last week, Marc Skinner confirmed on Friday. She missed Wednesday\u2019s League Cup match against Everton and is now expected to return after the international break. Ella Toone is absent from the Manchester United squad today due to a calf injury. The midfielder missed last week\u2019s clash with Leicester and could now remain unavailable until 2025. Marc Skinner said: \u201cWe have three games [after the international break and before Christmas]. There\u2019s always the hope, but I think you balance and you go, \u2018right, if we can get her back, we get her back\u2019. But we\u2019re just not going to rush her in this moment because it\u2019s a calf injury, it\u2019s your running mechanism. If we injure the running mechanism, it takes longer. So ideally we\u2019d like her back for those games afterwards. The projection is she misses this game [Chelsea], she misses the international window, probably misses the first game after that and then we\u2019ll see from there. But because it is such a short block of only three games, we\u2019ll assess whether it\u2019s worth that or actually resetting to come back after Christmas.\u201d Chelsea starting XI: Hannah Hampton, Lucy Bronze, Nathalie Bj\u00f6rn, Millie Bright (C), Sandy Baltimore; Sjoeke N\u00fcsken, Erin Cuthbert, Guro Reiten; Maika Hamano, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, Mayra Ram\u00edrez. Substitutes: Ze\u0107ira Mu\u0161ovi\u0107, \u00c8ve P\u00e9risset, Alejandra Bernab\u00e9, Ashley Lawrence, Maelys Mpome, Oriane Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, Wieke Kaptein, Aggie Beever-Jones, Catarina Macario. Manchester United starting XI: Phallon Tullis-Joyce; Gabby George, Maya Le Tissier (C), Millie Turner, Jayde Riviere; Dominique Janssen, Simi Awujo, Grace Clinton; Geyse, Rachel Williams, Celin Bizet. Substitutes: Safia Middleton-Patel, Anna Sandberg, Jess Simpson, Leah Galton, Hayley Ladd, Hinata Miyazawa, Emma Watson, Melvine Malard. Hello and welcome to coverage of today\u2019s WSL clash between Chelsea and Manchester United. This match was originally scheduled to take place at the start of October but it was postponed with just a week\u2019s notice due to conflict with Chelsea\u2019s Champions League fixture list. We\u2019re now eight games into the domestic season and both sides remain undefeated. One team could see that run come to an end this afternoon. Kick-off is at 12pm GMT \u2013 join me!",

      "bodyText": "The River Taff raged through the centre of Pontypridd on Sunday, overflowing its banks and overwhelming homes and businesses. Sion Street, which runs parallel to the river in the centre of the Valleys town, was flooded, with the murky water breaching several terrace properties. Residents desperately tried to empty their front yards of water with plastic buckets, while others frantically stacked sandbags on their doorsteps. Firefighters arrived and pumped water in the shadow of the town\u2019s 18th-century stone Old Bridge, while members of the public brought food and drinks to the emergency workers. This is the second time in four years the street in Pontypridd has experienced major flooding. Ian Dewhurst leapt in his car about 100 miles away in Salisbury, Wiltshire, after receiving a phone call from his distressed daughter, who had moved into a property in Sion Street just two weeks ago. The flood water had yet to breach her home \u2013 but as Dewhurst gestured with his hand \u2013 the rising deluge came within inches of breaching the reinforced metal floodgate that protected the property. \u201cThe river level two weeks ago when she moved in was metres below that,\u201d Dewhurst said, pointing to the cascading river. \u201cFortunately, our daughter has friends \u2013 she works for Cardiff University at the hospital \u2013 who were able to come around and help and move furniture and whatever.

Rest centres were set up for affected residents at Pontypridd library, the Ystrad sports centre, Sobell leisure centre and Cynon Valley indoor bowls centre. Elsewhere in the town, homes in Berw Road and businesses in Mill Street were breached.

Over the previous week a total of 460 of the Iranian-designed drones were launched by Russia into Ukraine\u2019s airspace, he added.</p> \n<p>\u201cUkraine is not a testing ground for weapons. Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state. But Russia still continues its efforts to kill our people, spread fear and panic, and weaken us,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a statement on Sunday morning.</p> \n<p>Ukraine says Russia has set up two factories to make the distinctive delta-winged Shahed 136 drones, called Geran-2 by Moscow, in Tatarstan, about 800 \u2013 miles from the border in Ukraine. Production amounts to \u201chundreds per week\u201d said a government source in Kyiv.</p> \n<p>The drones are often fired into Ukraine as soon as they are ready, and while they remain easier to shoot down or neutralise compared to high-speed missiles, they tie up the country\u2019s air defence and can cause serious damage with a 50kg warhead when they reach their targets.</p> \n<p>In October, 2,023 Shahed drones were launched into Ukraine, a record according to Kyiv\u2019s military. Last week\u2019s figures suggest the rate of attacks continues to be similar with attacks on Kyiv and major cities a near nightly feature, tiring out civilian populations woken up by air raid alerts.</p> \n<p>Russia is continually modifying the drones to try to make them more deadly. Earlier this month, Ukraine\u2019s military posted a video of a thermobaric warhead, which creates a fire cloud of about 2,000C when detonated, and is considered particularly lethal if it explodes inside buildings.</p> \n<p>Efforts are also under way, Ukrainian military sources said, to implement artificial intelligence to try to create \u201cdrone swarms\u201d whereby Shaheds communicate and coordinate attacks in such a way as to overwhelm air defences. However, it is unclear how effective this technology may be.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4d86dd90-ef43-4dd8-8c04-2ba73133959b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GgTJoj0DVfE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Zelenskyy said \u201cUkraine needs more air defence systems\u201d to help counter the aerial threats. \u201cWe are working with our partners to do so. It is crucial to strengthen the defence of our skies,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Because Shahed 136 drones are relatively inexpensive, costing a few tens of thousands of dollars a time, it is not practical to use Patriot missiles to shoot them down as they cost about $4m (\u00a33.2m) each. Instead, specialist Ukrainian forces often use truck mounted machine guns to knock them out with small arms fire.</p> \n<p>Ukrainian specialists are also trying to develop cheap first person view (FPV) drones, costing less than $1,000, that are capable of knocking out Shaheds, although the task is made difficult because the turbulent airflow caused by Shahed in flight significantly affects the piloting of a smaller FPV drone.</p> \n<p>The most serious attack this month took place a week ago, when 120 missiles and 90 drones were unleashed against Ukraine\u2019s energy grid. Nationwide electricity rationing was introduced the next day, as Ukrainian officials tried to repair a grid that Greenpeace warned was at risk of catastrophic failure if the attacks continued.</p> \n<p>Hostilities escalated last week when first the US, followed by the UK and France, agreed to allow Atacms and Storm Shadow missiles to be used against targets inside Russia for the first time. That prompted Russia to respond by launching the Oreshnik missile at Ukraine, a nuclear-capable weapon, able to strike anywhere in Europe.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/18/ukraine-war-us-missile-atacms-joe-biden-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-latest-news\">Russia-Ukraine war: Russia vows \u2018palpable response\u2019 if Ukraine uses long-range missiles on its territory \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Oreshnik is not thought to have caused much damage, but its intention was demonstrative.

Though Russia\u2019s first ever use of the Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile on Dnipro on Thursday captured global attention, on Sunday Volodymyr Zelenskyy highlighted the increased level of Shahed drone attacks. Fifty drones were shot down on Saturday night, out of 73, the Ukrainian president said. Over the previous week a total of 460 of the Iranian-designed drones were launched by Russia into Ukraine\u2019s airspace, he added. \u201cUkraine is not a testing ground for weapons. Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state. But Russia still continues its efforts to kill our people, spread fear and panic, and weaken us,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a statement on Sunday morning. Ukraine says Russia has set up two factories to make the distinctive delta-winged Shahed 136 drones, called Geran-2 by Moscow, in Tatarstan, about 800 \u2013 miles from the border in Ukraine. Production amounts to \u201chundreds per week\u201d said a government source in Kyiv. The drones are often fired into Ukraine as soon as they are ready, and while they remain easier to shoot down or neutralise compared to high-speed missiles, they tie up the country\u2019s air defence and can cause serious damage with a 50kg warhead when they reach their targets. In October, 2,023 Shahed drones were launched into Ukraine, a record according to Kyiv\u2019s military. Last week\u2019s figures suggest the rate of attacks continues to be similar with attacks on Kyiv and major cities a near nightly feature, tiring out civilian populations woken up by air raid alerts. Russia is continually modifying the drones to try to make them more deadly. Earlier this month, Ukraine\u2019s military posted a video of a thermobaric warhead, which creates a fire cloud of about 2,000C when detonated, and is considered particularly lethal if it explodes inside buildings. Efforts are also under way, Ukrainian military sources said, to implement artificial intelligence to try to create \u201cdrone swarms\u201d whereby Shaheds communicate and coordinate attacks in such a way as to overwhelm air defences. However, it is unclear how effective this technology may be. Zelenskyy said \u201cUkraine needs more air defence systems\u201d to help counter the aerial threats. \u201cWe are working with our partners to do so. It is crucial to strengthen the defence of our skies,\u201d he added. Because Shahed 136 drones are relatively inexpensive, costing a few tens of thousands of dollars a time, it is not practical to use Patriot missiles to shoot them down as they cost about $4m (\u00a33.2m) each. Instead, specialist Ukrainian forces often use truck mounted machine guns to knock them out with small arms fire. Ukrainian specialists are also trying to develop cheap first person view (FPV) drones, costing less than $1,000, that are capable of knocking out Shaheds, although the task is made difficult because the turbulent airflow caused by Shahed in flight significantly affects the piloting of a smaller FPV drone. The most serious attack this month took place a week ago, when 120 missiles and 90 drones were unleashed against Ukraine\u2019s energy grid. Nationwide electricity rationing was introduced the next day, as Ukrainian officials tried to repair a grid that Greenpeace warned was at risk of catastrophic failure if the attacks continued. Hostilities escalated last week when first the US, followed by the UK and France, agreed to allow Atacms and Storm Shadow missiles to be used against targets inside Russia for the first time. That prompted Russia to respond by launching the Oreshnik missile at Ukraine, a nuclear-capable weapon, able to strike anywhere in Europe. The Oreshnik is not thought to have caused much damage, but its intention was demonstrative. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Friday that his country would use the missile again in \u201ccombat conditions\u201d \u2013 while a day before he had said Moscow \u201chad the right\u201d to use it against countries who have supplied Ukraine with weapons. France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, told the BBC on Sunday that Ukraine could fire French long-range missiles into Russia \u201cin the logics of self-defence\u201d and indicated that France was open to extending an invitation to Ukraine to join Nato. That, however, has been resisted by the outgoing president Joe Biden and is not thought likely to be supported by the incoming Donald Trump.",

David Oh, a Republican former candidate for mayor, said that made Trump and his pitch to \u201cstop wars\u201d all the more appealing to those groups. \u201cHowever they feel about the issues, their community sees a connection with Donald Trump, and they see an effort,\u201d Oh said. Many Democrats wonder if things might have been different had Harris more time to campaign. She took over as the Democratic nominee in July, after Biden exited the race following a disastrous debate performance against Trump. While the vice-president\u2019s ascension was greeted with a burst of enthusiasm from the party\u2019s base, the race quickly settled into what polls showed was a neck-in-neck slog. \u201cI do think that the switch of the candidate had an impact on a lot of people,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThat was kind of confusing to folks.\u201d Josh Novotney, a Republican strategist and consultant who worked with the Trump campaign in Philadelphia, credited its focus on two main issues for the inroads made across the city. \u201cTrump was for lower prices, and Kamala was for higher prices. And Trump was for closed borders, and Kamala was for open borders,\u201d Novotney said. Never before in Philadelphia had he seen \u201cthat many working-class minority voters not only going to vote for the Republican, but energized enough to take a bus across town to pick up a lawn sign and some palm cards and hand them out to their friends\u201d, Novotney said. \u201cI think, to Trump\u2019s credit, he really spoke to that crowd.\u201d",

Rejecting any push for an inquiry into the bill, and not correcting the record when Labor talked up its chances of bipartisan support, point to a likely government win here.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/21/labor-social-media-ban-under-16s-details-what-is-covered-which-platform\">under-16 social media age ban</a> is also a good bet to pass. A lightning-fast inquiry that gave stakeholders just one day to make submissions, and the Coalition claiming credit for having suggested it first, indicate this one is likely done and dusted.</p> \n<p>You\u2019d expect a bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/21/new-law-introduced-to-block-legal-challenge-to-an0m-organised-bust\">introduced by the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, on Thursday</a> to try to block legal challenges by people charged after an elaborate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-federal-police\">Australian federal police</a> sting using the encrypted An0m application would also find favour with hard-heads in the Coalition.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The Albanese government has introduced some extremely tough migration bills, one to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/07/labor-immigration-detention-bill-tony-burke-pay-countries-unlawful-citizens\">help it reimpose ankle bracelets and curfews</a> on people released from immigration detention and to authorise payments to third countries to take non-citizens, and the other to give it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/21/labor-to-confiscate-phones-from-non-citizens-in-immigration-detention-in-new-bill-ntwnfb\">more power to confiscate phones in detention</a>.</p> \n<p>If you think those sound like things Peter Dutton would do, you\u2019re right. And so it came as no surprise when the Coalition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/19/coalition-to-help-pass-bill-that-would-see-australia-pay-third-countries-to-take-unlawful-non-citizens-ntwnfb\">suggested it would support the first bill</a> subject to a one-week inquiry.</p> \n<p>The parties are in negotiations for a grand bargain on home affairs.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s understood the Coalition are seeking amendments to toughen things further, legislate unfinished recommendations from the Nixon review as well as reviving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/26/deportation-bill-australia-rushed-passes-lower-house-immigration-detention\">Labor\u2019s first deportation bill</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/07/coalition-urges-amendments-to-deportation-bill-as-labor-accused-of-trying-to-outflank-dutton-to-the-right\">stalled when the opposition sought amendments in May</a>.</p> \n<p>But you never can be too sure. After Dutton repeatedly called to cap international student numbers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/18/international-student-cap-coalition-sides-with-greens-and-independents\">Labor was red-faced when the Coalition joined the Greens</a> in opposing a bill to give the education minister power to do just that.</p> \n<p>If Dutton senses there is more advantage in adding to the government\u2019s problems rather than being part of the solution, he might just grab the opportunity.

It depends how badly the government wants it.</p> \n<p>But there\u2019ll be no Christmas miracle big enough to save the mis and disinformation bill. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, conceded defeat on Sunday, withdrawing it due to lack of support.</p> \n<p>Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the inquiry into gambling led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/28/ads-for-online-gambling-should-be-banned-in-australia-within-three-years-inquiry-recommends\">reported almost a year and a half ago</a>, calling for a three-year phase-in period for a total ban on gambling ads to begin from December 2023.</p> \n<p>All signs are there\u2019ll be no bill this week, meaning it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll get halfway through the intended phase-in period without the government having legislated.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/11/20/teen-social-media-ban-michelle-rowland-study-question-time/\">evidence base for the underage social media ban is poor</a> \u2013 and yet it\u2019s that bill being rushed through parliament, not the partial gambling ad ban, much less the full ban.</p> \n<p>As the final sitting week concentrates the mind, we\u2019ll learn a lot about the government by what it values highly enough to push through.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Paul Karp is Guardian Australia\u2019s chief political correspondent</p></li> \n</ul>",

Rejecting any push for an inquiry into the bill, and not correcting the record when Labor talked up its chances of bipartisan support, point to a likely government win here. The under-16 social media age ban is also a good bet to pass. A lightning-fast inquiry that gave stakeholders just one day to make submissions, and the Coalition claiming credit for having suggested it first, indicate this one is likely done and dusted. You\u2019d expect a bill introduced by the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, on Thursday to try to block legal challenges by people charged after an elaborate Australian federal police sting using the encrypted An0m application would also find favour with hard-heads in the Coalition. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The Albanese government has introduced some extremely tough migration bills, one to help it reimpose ankle bracelets and curfews on people released from immigration detention and to authorise payments to third countries to take non-citizens, and the other to give it more power to confiscate phones in detention. If you think those sound like things Peter Dutton would do, you\u2019re right. And so it came as no surprise when the Coalition suggested it would support the first bill subject to a one-week inquiry. The parties are in negotiations for a grand bargain on home affairs. It\u2019s understood the Coalition are seeking amendments to toughen things further, legislate unfinished recommendations from the Nixon review as well as reviving Labor\u2019s first deportation bill, which stalled when the opposition sought amendments in May. But you never can be too sure. After Dutton repeatedly called to cap international student numbers, Labor was red-faced when the Coalition joined the Greens in opposing a bill to give the education minister power to do just that. If Dutton senses there is more advantage in adding to the government\u2019s problems rather than being part of the solution, he might just grab the opportunity. That episode called to mind Donald Trump ordering Republicans to oppose the Democrats border bill. The Albanese government\u2019s other potential Senate pathway is the Greens\u2019 11 votes and then three more crossbench senators. The Greens say they have offered the government a pathway through the Senate for 20 bills, including a new offer to pass the Future Made in Australia legislation. A Greens strategist says deals with the minor party are a way for Labor to \u201cfinish parliament with a win\u201d, rather than allow Dutton to turn the final week into an \u201cend-of-year dumpster fire\u201d. For much of this term, Labor has labelled the minor party obstructionist for its insistence the government tackle housing tax concessions in return for support on housing bills, and adding a climate trigger in return for support on nature-positive laws. But last week the Greens radically revised down their demands on both bills \u2013 now asking for 25,000 new social and affordable homes and a few other bits and bobs in return for support on housing, and a ban on native forest logging in return for support on environment laws. Negotiations did not restart last week between Max Chandler-Mather and the housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, suggesting little has changed since Anthony Albanese declared in February that the Greens can simply vote for or against the Help to Buy scheme. Chandler-Mather will appear at the National Press Club on Tuesday alongside the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, just as the bill is going for a Senate vote. More progress seems to be being made on the environment legislation, with talks between Sarah Hanson-Young and Tanya Plibersek continuing. Things that seem stuck can get moving pretty quickly if the will is there. It depends how badly the government wants it. But there\u2019ll be no Christmas miracle big enough to save the mis and disinformation bill. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, conceded defeat on Sunday, withdrawing it due to lack of support. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the inquiry into gambling led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy reported almost a year and a half ago, calling for a three-year phase-in period for a total ban on gambling ads to begin from December 2023. All signs are there\u2019ll be no bill this week, meaning it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll get halfway through the intended phase-in period without the government having legislated. The evidence base for the underage social media ban is poor \u2013 and yet it\u2019s that bill being rushed through parliament, not the partial gambling ad ban, much less the full ban. As the final sitting week concentrates the mind, we\u2019ll learn a lot about the government by what it values highly enough to push through.

A friend jokes about me never truly finding \u201ccoffee nirvana\u201d \u2013 well, this comes pretty close. Freshly ground beans definitely make a big difference. And given coffee is now upward of $5 every time you buy one at a cafe, if it\u2019s not great, it\u2019s so disappointing (And a tip: if you can\u2019t get good coffee, ask for a mocha. The chocolate masks a lot.) The item I most regret losing A little brown beret. It fit just right. Its shape was perfection. A flattering shade that held and hid my often-unkempt mane. Easy to throw in a handbag, not too warm for summer. A good all-rounder hat. I remember where I left it \u2013 at a cinema in Brisbane after watching Wes Anderson\u2019s The Grand Budapest Hotel. I think that\u2019s why I forgot my beret. I loved the film and was talking too much as I walked out. I\u2019m sure it was tossed out with the popcorn box and rubbish at the end of the session but it served me well and I\u2019m yet to find a replacement that I love quite as much.

      "body": "<p>I was about 16 when I had my first bout of depression, but 29 when I sought help and received a diagnosis. In the intervening period, I thought I could weather my low moods alone, but the waves of hopelessness didn\u2019t lessen; they only gained momentum. I was left with a strong desire to evaporate, leaving no trace of my existence in the world.</p> <p>I am extremely lucky to have responded well to a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), but I can\u2019t help wondering how much pain I could have avoided if I\u2019d learned to manage my mental health better at a younger age, before my symptoms had even started to develop.</p> <p>This is the thinking behind new efforts to build people\u2019s mental resilience. The philosophy is simple and has been applied to physical health for decades: prevention is better than cure.</p> <p>\u201cThe opportunity to intervene when problems are first emerging could circumvent so many challenges down the line, and help people pivot towards a more adaptive direction,\u201d says Jessica Schleider, an associate professor at Northwestern University in Illinois.</p> <p>The benefits of early intervention apply across age groups, but they may be especially important for adolescents, a fact that the World Health Organization recently emphasised in its guidance to improve access to mental healthcare for young people. \u201cWith one-third of mental health conditions emerging before the age of 14 and half before the age of 18, early action is essential to enable children and young people to thrive and realise their full potential,\u201d it said. The challenge, however, is finding the appropriate means to deliver the support \u2013 and that may be easier said than done.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The team estimated that the course prevented five people from reaching a clinical level of distress for every 30 who enrolled</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The promise, and potential pitfalls, of resilience intervention may be found in the study of mindfulness training. This involves the non-judgmental awareness of mental and bodily states, without getting caught up in thoughts or feelings, which can help to break ruminative cycles of thinking. Drawing on these principles, psychologists designed an eight-week course called mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which has been shown to relieve the symptoms of people with depression and reduce the risk of a subsequent relapse.</p> <p>A few years ago, Dr Julieta Galante \u2013 then based at the University of Cambridge \u2013 and colleagues examined whether a modified version of the programme could increase the resilience of students facing exam stress. The experiment took the form of a randomised controlled trial \u2013 the gold standard of medical research \u2013 involving more than 600 participants. Half were assigned to the mindfulness course in the first or second term of the academic year, while the rest were placed on a waiting list, with the guarantee of a place on the course once the study was over. Galante and her colleagues then tracked their mental distress over the exam period in May and June.</p>    <p>As the team had hoped, the mindfulness programme <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(17)30231-1/fulltext?platform=hootsuite\">helped the participants to cope</a> with this difficult period. \u201cTheir distress stayed at around the same level that it had been before the beginning of their revision,\u201d says Galante, who is now deputy director of the Contemplative Studies Centre at Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences in Australia. \u201cBut the distress levels of the students who hadn\u2019t done the mindfulness course were going up and up.\u201d On average, the team estimated that it prevented five people from reaching a clinical level of distress for every 30 participants who enrolled in the course.</p> <p>Given such benefits, it might seem sensible to roll out mindfulness courses in all educational institutions \u2013 yet a more recent study should curb our enthusiasm. The My Resilience in Adolescence (Myriad) trial involved 85 schools with nearly 8,400 pupils aged 10 to 14. Forty two of the schools were asked to roll out a mindfulness training programme over 10 lessons, while the rest continued providing their typical support within standard personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE)<strong> </strong>lessons. At the end of the year, they tested the students\u2019 depression and general wellbeing \u2013 and found no differences between the two groups.</p> <p>Galante suggests the core difference lies in the ways the participants were recruited. In her study, the students volunteered for the research, and may, therefore, been more willing to engage with the course content. The participants of the Myriad study, in contrast, were being force-fed the material in their lessons \u2013 and might have paid little attention. Along these lines, the researchers behind the Myriad study found that fewer than 20% of the participants completed the mindfulness practice at home. \u201c[The Myriad study\u2019s] methods were impeccable, so I trust what they found,\u201d says Galante. \u201cBut making interventions compulsory may not for work something like mindfulness.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>A better option may be to offer a range of resources that allows people to select the options that best suit their needs and interests. \u201cNo one size fits all,\u201d says Galante. There are now many options available, including education on coping strategies and evidence-based techniques to improve emotional regulation; physical exercise regimes (which have been shown to improve mental health); and music or art programmes that encourage creative expression.</p> <p>Although success rates vary, a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735820301070\">recent meta-analysis</a> concluded that resilience interventions can boost people\u2019s wellbeing, and they are particularly effective at improving the trajectory of people who are already at a \u201cmoderate to high\u201d risk of developing a mental illness. \u201cResilience interventions do work for lots of people,\u201d says Jenny JW Liu, an adjunct research professor at Western University in London, Ontario, who was the first author of the paper.</p> <p>Many of the strategies teach the same skills that can be learned during therapies such as CBT. \u201cThe dichotomy between prevention and treatment is fuzzy,\u201d says Schleider. \u201cContent wise, there often isn\u2019t a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Self-compassion training, for instance, is focused on reducing the self-critical thinking that often dominates many people\u2019s inner dialogue. Instead, they are encouraged to treat themselves with kindness, while recognising the \u201ccommon humanity\u201d in their pain and suffering. This stops people from feeling so lonely and isolated when going through a difficult period.</p>    <p>We can measure this construct by asking people to rate statements such as: \u201cI try to see my failings as part of the human condition\u201d, or \u2018\u2018I try to be understanding and patient towards those aspects of my personality I don\u2019t like\u201d. Adolescents and young adults who endorse these views are less likely to develop anxiety or depression. Crucially, this kinder way of thinking about ourselves can be learned, and this seems to increase resilience to mental illness.</p> <p>A related strategy involves teaching people about the brain\u2019s malleability \u2013 our capacity to change our mental habits. This reduces people\u2019s sense of helplessness and aids them in recognising their capacity to overcome the difficulties they might be facing, without despairing that they will always feel this way.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702614548317\">effects can be impressive</a>. David Yeager of the University of Texas at Austin, and Adriana Sum Miu of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, asked students entering high school to take a short lesson on our capacity for change, including some basic information about the science behind our neuroplasticity \u2013 alongside personal anecdotes of other students who had overcome difficulties. Nine months later, they were about 40% less likely to have developed depression, compared with those who instead learned about the opportunity to grow their athletic ability.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re supporting more adaptive ways of understanding stress, such as seeing it as modifiable rather than inevitably damaging</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Finally, an intervention can attempt to change people\u2019s behaviour. Mental distress often prevents us from engaging in the things that matter to us, which further depresses our mood. A strategy called <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/behavioral-activation#how-it-works\">behavioural activation</a> attempts to break this vicious circle. To do this, you might first monitor the ways different events trigger changes in your mood across a week. You then try to schedule more of the activities to contribute to feelings of satisfaction and growth, whether that is nurturing meaningful relationships, exercising your body, playing music or learning a new skill. The intervention\u2019s resources may also give advice on the psychology of motivation and habit formation.</p> <p>\u201cIt follows the idea that what you do shapes how you feel,\u201d says Schleider. \u201cSo engaging in meaningful and valuable activities that are pleasurable, or help you reach a goal, can have an upward spiral effect on your thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>Education about these skills could be delivered in person, but Schleider has recently established an online resource \u2013 Project Yes (Youth Empowerment and Support) \u2013 that helps people to learn the tools to manage their mental health remotely. The available modules include Project Care, which teaches self-compassion; Project Personality, which examines the malleability of our minds; and Project ABC (Action Brings Change), which teaches behavioural activation.</p> <p>Each module only takes about 20-30 minutes to complete, but Schleider\u2019s research suggests that these \u201csingle-session interventions\u201d can have a noticeable effect on people\u2019s mental health in the short and medium term.

      "bodyText": "I was about 16 when I had my first bout of depression, but 29 when I sought help and received a diagnosis. In the intervening period, I thought I could weather my low moods alone, but the waves of hopelessness didn\u2019t lessen; they only gained momentum. I was left with a strong desire to evaporate, leaving no trace of my existence in the world. I am extremely lucky to have responded well to a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), but I can\u2019t help wondering how much pain I could have avoided if I\u2019d learned to manage my mental health better at a younger age, before my symptoms had even started to develop. This is the thinking behind new efforts to build people\u2019s mental resilience. The philosophy is simple and has been applied to physical health for decades: prevention is better than cure. \u201cThe opportunity to intervene when problems are first emerging could circumvent so many challenges down the line, and help people pivot towards a more adaptive direction,\u201d says Jessica Schleider, an associate professor at Northwestern University in Illinois. The benefits of early intervention apply across age groups, but they may be especially important for adolescents, a fact that the World Health Organization recently emphasised in its guidance to improve access to mental healthcare for young people. \u201cWith one-third of mental health conditions emerging before the age of 14 and half before the age of 18, early action is essential to enable children and young people to thrive and realise their full potential,\u201d it said. The challenge, however, is finding the appropriate means to deliver the support \u2013 and that may be easier said than done. The promise, and potential pitfalls, of resilience intervention may be found in the study of mindfulness training. This involves the non-judgmental awareness of mental and bodily states, without getting caught up in thoughts or feelings, which can help to break ruminative cycles of thinking. Drawing on these principles, psychologists designed an eight-week course called mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which has been shown to relieve the symptoms of people with depression and reduce the risk of a subsequent relapse. A few years ago, Dr Julieta Galante \u2013 then based at the University of Cambridge \u2013 and colleagues examined whether a modified version of the programme could increase the resilience of students facing exam stress. The experiment took the form of a randomised controlled trial \u2013 the gold standard of medical research \u2013 involving more than 600 participants. Half were assigned to the mindfulness course in the first or second term of the academic year, while the rest were placed on a waiting list, with the guarantee of a place on the course once the study was over. Galante and her colleagues then tracked their mental distress over the exam period in May and June. As the team had hoped, the mindfulness programme helped the participants to cope with this difficult period. \u201cTheir distress stayed at around the same level that it had been before the beginning of their revision,\u201d says Galante, who is now deputy director of the Contemplative Studies Centre at Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences in Australia. \u201cBut the distress levels of the students who hadn\u2019t done the mindfulness course were going up and up.\u201d On average, the team estimated that it prevented five people from reaching a clinical level of distress for every 30 participants who enrolled in the course. Given such benefits, it might seem sensible to roll out mindfulness courses in all educational institutions \u2013 yet a more recent study should curb our enthusiasm. The My Resilience in Adolescence (Myriad) trial involved 85 schools with nearly 8,400 pupils aged 10 to 14. Forty two of the schools were asked to roll out a mindfulness training programme over 10 lessons, while the rest continued providing their typical support within standard personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) lessons. At the end of the year, they tested the students\u2019 depression and general wellbeing \u2013 and found no differences between the two groups. Galante suggests the core difference lies in the ways the participants were recruited. In her study, the students volunteered for the research, and may, therefore, been more willing to engage with the course content. The participants of the Myriad study, in contrast, were being force-fed the material in their lessons \u2013 and might have paid little attention. Along these lines, the researchers behind the Myriad study found that fewer than 20% of the participants completed the mindfulness practice at home. \u201c[The Myriad study\u2019s] methods were impeccable, so I trust what they found,\u201d says Galante. \u201cBut making interventions compulsory may not for work something like mindfulness.\u201d * * * A better option may be to offer a range of resources that allows people to select the options that best suit their needs and interests. \u201cNo one size fits all,\u201d says Galante. There are now many options available, including education on coping strategies and evidence-based techniques to improve emotional regulation; physical exercise regimes (which have been shown to improve mental health); and music or art programmes that encourage creative expression. Although success rates vary, a recent meta-analysis concluded that resilience interventions can boost people\u2019s wellbeing, and they are particularly effective at improving the trajectory of people who are already at a \u201cmoderate to high\u201d risk of developing a mental illness. \u201cResilience interventions do work for lots of people,\u201d says Jenny JW Liu, an adjunct research professor at Western University in London, Ontario, who was the first author of the paper. Many of the strategies teach the same skills that can be learned during therapies such as CBT. \u201cThe dichotomy between prevention and treatment is fuzzy,\u201d says Schleider. \u201cContent wise, there often isn\u2019t a difference.\u201d Self-compassion training, for instance, is focused on reducing the self-critical thinking that often dominates many people\u2019s inner dialogue. Instead, they are encouraged to treat themselves with kindness, while recognising the \u201ccommon humanity\u201d in their pain and suffering. This stops people from feeling so lonely and isolated when going through a difficult period. We can measure this construct by asking people to rate statements such as: \u201cI try to see my failings as part of the human condition\u201d, or \u2018\u2018I try to be understanding and patient towards those aspects of my personality I don\u2019t like\u201d. Adolescents and young adults who endorse these views are less likely to develop anxiety or depression. Crucially, this kinder way of thinking about ourselves can be learned, and this seems to increase resilience to mental illness. A related strategy involves teaching people about the brain\u2019s malleability \u2013 our capacity to change our mental habits. This reduces people\u2019s sense of helplessness and aids them in recognising their capacity to overcome the difficulties they might be facing, without despairing that they will always feel this way. The effects can be impressive. David Yeager of the University of Texas at Austin, and Adriana Sum Miu of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, asked students entering high school to take a short lesson on our capacity for change, including some basic information about the science behind our neuroplasticity \u2013 alongside personal anecdotes of other students who had overcome difficulties. Nine months later, they were about 40% less likely to have developed depression, compared with those who instead learned about the opportunity to grow their athletic ability. Finally, an intervention can attempt to change people\u2019s behaviour. Mental distress often prevents us from engaging in the things that matter to us, which further depresses our mood. A strategy called behavioural activation attempts to break this vicious circle. To do this, you might first monitor the ways different events trigger changes in your mood across a week. You then try to schedule more of the activities to contribute to feelings of satisfaction and growth, whether that is nurturing meaningful relationships, exercising your body, playing music or learning a new skill. The intervention\u2019s resources may also give advice on the psychology of motivation and habit formation. \u201cIt follows the idea that what you do shapes how you feel,\u201d says Schleider. \u201cSo engaging in meaningful and valuable activities that are pleasurable, or help you reach a goal, can have an upward spiral effect on your thoughts.\u201d Education about these skills could be delivered in person, but Schleider has recently established an online resource \u2013 Project Yes (Youth Empowerment and Support) \u2013 that helps people to learn the tools to manage their mental health remotely. The available modules include Project Care, which teaches self-compassion; Project Personality, which examines the malleability of our minds; and Project ABC (Action Brings Change), which teaches behavioural activation. Each module only takes about 20-30 minutes to complete, but Schleider\u2019s research suggests that these \u201csingle-session interventions\u201d can have a noticeable effect on people\u2019s mental health in the short and medium term. She recruited 2,452 youths at the height of the Covid pandemic \u2013 a time of considerable uncertainty, stress and loneliness. The adolescents who took part in Project Yes reported lower levels of depressive symptoms and disordered eating at a three-month follow-up. The improvements are often linked to changes in the participants\u2019 perceptions of hope and personal control. \u201cWe\u2019re supporting more adaptive ways of understanding stress, such as seeing it as malleable and modifiable rather than inevitably damaging, and we\u2019re also giving them really concrete behaviours to try out,\u201d says Schleider. The sheer potential of these interventions is impressive. The aim is to complement other forms of support, providing an important first step for vulnerable people to build their mental health that is easily available when the person needs it. \u201cI want them to be as ubiquitous as fluoride in the water,\u201d says Schleider. Despite this enthusiasm, she emphasises the need to consider the many other factors that may influence someone\u2019s resilience, including their family circumstances and the broader systemic issues that are known to influence mental health, such as inequality and prejudice. Liu agrees that we should consider the broader context. \u201cResilience is not always an individual endeavour,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s also linked to the resources that we have available at our disposal, our environment and the geopolitical climate.\u201d Resolving those problems will be an even meatier task than the undeniably taxing challenge of addressing people\u2019s personal coping mechanisms. On the latter front, however, the recent scientific advances do offer some movements in the right direction. \u201cThe best we can do is equip people with the best possible tools that we know can potentially help to create a more positive overall trajectory,\u201d says Schleider.

      "bodyText": "The official definition of terrorism will face independent review for the first time since the September 11 attacks in 2001, amid debate over whether it covers the full range of ideologies that pose a threat to modern Australia. Concerns about the terrorism definition re-emerged this year after the fatal mass stabbings at the Bondi Junction Westfield shopping mall and the stabbing attack on a bishop of the Assyrian Christian Orthodox church in the western Sydney suburb of Wakeley. The independent national security legislation monitor, Jake Blight, has revealed he intends to open an inquiry next year into what should be considered a terrorist act. Blight told Guardian Australia that much had changed since the September 11 attacks on the US heralded a wave of anti-terrorism laws and powers for police and security agencies. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cAlmost quarter of a century since 9/11, it really is time that we turned our minds to the fundamental definition of terrorism that underpins so many police powers and underpins so many offences,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is signal that I think it\u2019s time as a nation that we looked again at the definition of a terrorist act, and I\u2019m open to considering a range of things in that.\u201d Blight said it was too early to say whether misogynist or stalking behaviours or other specific kinds of violent acts might be considered for inclusion. But he wanted to conduct a \u201cfirst principles\u201d review that examined the issue in a broad context. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a really significant review and the kind of thing that\u2019s critical for the office to do,\u201d Blight said. A terrorist act is defined in the criminal code as an action or threat made with the intention of \u201cadvancing a political, religious or ideological cause\u201d. The action must tick off a list of criteria including that it: causes death or serious physical harm; puts a life at risk; seriously jeopardises public health or safety, or causes serious damage to property; or seriously interferes with, disrupts or destroys a designated electronic system. Designated systems include telecommunications, essential government services, a public utility or a transport system. What constitutes an \u201cideological cause\u201d is a grey area. So, too, is determining if an alleged offender\u2019s actions were driven most by extreme religious or ideological influences or by the impact of past life experiences and personal trauma. In his annual threat assessment in 2021, Asio\u2019s director-general, Mike Burgess, queried the traditional terrorism definition, referring specifically to misogynists. \u201cWe are seeing a growing number of individuals and groups that don\u2019t fit on the left-right spectrum at all; instead, they\u2019re motivated by a fear of societal collapse or a specific social or economic grievance or conspiracy,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cFor example, the violent misogynists who adhere to the involuntary celibate or \u2018incel\u2019 ideology fit into this category. So we need to use language that can accommodate groups that are outside the traditional categories.\u201d In his 2023 assessment, Burgess emphasised the increasingly challenging nature of counter-terrorism, highlighting the ambush and murder of two police and a bystander on a property near Wieambilla in Queensland in which the three offenders also died. Burgess called that siege an act of politically motivated violence linked to Christian extremist ideology. In August the national terrorism threat level was raised from \u201cpossible\u201d to \u201cprobable\u201d. The independent monitor\u2019s plan to review the terrorism definition was flagged in his annual report, published last month, in which he noted that many offences were created after the September 11 attacks. \u201cThose offences, and many police and security agency powers, turn on the definition of a \u2018terrorist act\u2019,\u201d Blight wrote. \u201cMuch has changed in the last 25 years, including the nature of some of the threats faced by Australia. \u201cIt is time for an independent review to assess whether the current definition of a \u2018terrorist act\u2019 remains fit-for-purpose.\u201d Blight hopes to begin the review mid-2025. He is completing a review of espionage, sabotage and foreign interference offences. \u201cAt this time, it is my intention that the next own-motion review will be related to terrorism,\u201d he wrote in his report, \u201cand, in particular, the definition of a \u2018terrorist act\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As I stepped into my office and checked my client list for the day, I was surprised to see a name pop up that hadn\u2019t been there for a while. It was Kareem, a young father of two who had arrived to Australia from war-torn Iraq. During our session, he described that he thought his symptoms were under control and he was recovering well. But suddenly he was transported back to the blast that left him with a traumatic brain injury and months of rehabilitation. \u201cWhat was the thing that took you back there?\u201d I asked him. He said it was \u201chearing a song\u201d, the same song that was playing in his car just before the blast hit. In my work with survivors of war, it has become clear that an individual\u2019s sense of safety after a trauma seems particularly difficult to maintain when the trauma occurred during the most mundane tasks. This could be attending university before there was a siege or driving home from work before being stuck in a blockade with rapid fire ahead. Kareem was an ordinary person like you and me, doing ordinary things before being struck by the most extraordinary of circumstances. Trauma is defined as a distressing event, experienced or witnessed, that can overwhelm an individual\u2019s capacity to cope. These stressors can lead to symptoms including anxiety, sleep disturbance, flashbacks, mood fluctuation, isolation and withdrawal from things they used to enjoy. When these symptoms cluster together it can lead to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. It is not just individuals with first-hand experience of trauma like Kareem who might be susceptible to this distress response. It could also be us. Witnessing the trauma of others, we can experience secondary or vicarious trauma. Some of us are experiencing this trauma as a result of witnessing and hearing about the ongoing hardship of others, be it the global warming crisis or the atrocities occurring in many parts of the world including Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan. Exposure to the constant stream of distressing images, videos and first-hand accounts from survivors can result in symptoms of vicarious trauma that range from mild agitation to those resembling PTSD. We are drawn to feel the pain of others but identifying with these stories could be a double-edged sword: the more we identify with the people experiencing the trauma, the more we ourselves are likely to be traumatised. How can we begin to heal? To heal collectively we need to begin by acknowledging the human experience behind the stream of horrific images we are ingesting daily. This experience needs to be centred in our common humanity, not because we share the same colour, gender or creed. From there we need to face the struggle of reconciling the irreconcilable as these traumatic events might clash with our worldview, like our understanding of justice, equality or human rights. The bigger the gap between our values and the distressing events, the bigger the vicarious trauma. We can begin to bridge this gap by either adjusting our worldview, for example reassessing how we feel about what we see, or integrating the trauma into our current beliefs and views such as aligning it to our present notions of human rights. If we bridge this gap successfully then post-traumatic growth may occur.

He was looking for a pied-\u00e0-terre and also a showroom for the company, which specialises in stone for interiors. When he saw the first-floor space he was initially hesitant because of the cramped entryway. \u201cI called Piero Lissoni for advice and he said, \u2018Are you mad? Take it, you can make it beautiful.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When such a renowned architect advises you to rent in a building with potential, you do it. So Gabriele took the plunge and also rented the apartment above it. This looked out on to a busy square making it noisy at times. It was also dark because it was north-facing. The location in Milan\u2019s historic centre, however, was optimal, and in time Gabriele would move up another floor into what is now his home.</p>    <p>This new apartment is south-facing and has views of the 15th-century Sforza Castle. It was, however, in his words, \u201cUgly. You could see the potential, because there was tremendous light coming, but the previous owners had two children and had added partition walls everywhere for five bedrooms, it was a&nbsp;labyrinth.\u201d Also, the ceilings were low, but Gabriele knew the building and after further investigation discovered that there was a&nbsp;few feet of space hidden behind a&nbsp;false ceiling. \u201cWe uncovered these lovely wooden beams and removed all the partition walls,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAside from the natural light in the apartment, I also fell in love with the original floors which are from the 1800s,\u201d Gabriele says. The natural stone floors follow a wave-like pattern similar to those on the pavements in Copacabana or Ipanema beach. \u201cThe colours of these mosaics were so modern \u2013 and I love the landscape artist <a href=\"https://www.architectural-review.com/essays/reputations/roberto-burle-marx-1909-1994\">Roberto Burle Marx</a> who designed the Copacabana promenade they resemble.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriele\u2019s floors are slightly concave because the building is old and when you walk on them there\u2019s some movement. \u201cI called an engineer to ask whether I was going to die here,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThe engineer explained that the building is rather elastic, but that I should not have more than six people standing in one square metre of space at any one time.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriele did have a near-miss when he discovered an old fireplace. \u201cI was so excited and said let\u2019s use it, we nearly set everything alight as smoke entered the house \u2013 we hadn\u2019t checked the chimney and the smoke wasn\u2019t going out,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>While Gabriele wanted to preserve as much as he could, most of the beauty lay in the structure, high ceilings and bones of the building. He engaged interior designer <a href=\"https://www.elisaossino.it/\">Elisa Ossino</a> to help him.</p> <p>Knowing that Gabriele loved jazz, Elisa contacted her friend, former jazz singer Josephine Akvama Hoffmeyer, whose company, <a href=\"https://www.fileunderpop.com/\">File Under Pop</a>, specialises in surface design, including bespoke paint colours and she created paint colours named after famous jazz tunes. \u201cIn my bedroom, the colour is Blue in Green \u2013 named after a&nbsp;piece written by Miles Davis,\u201d he explains. \u201cEvery room has a different colour and we\u2019ve painted the wall a&nbsp;different colour to the ceiling.\u201d</p> <p>The bathroom was rather unappealing with cheap porcelain tiles that didn\u2019t complement the home. \u201cBut now it features tiles in very dark brown hues, which for me are masculine and elegant.

The soup was packed with turmeric noodles, vegetable gyozas, mushrooms, bean sprouts, pak choi, pickled ginger and sesame seeds, in a soy and miso broth. It was delicious. In fact, it was so delicious, I was suspicious. I checked out its <a href=\"https://www.wasabi.uk.com/menus/\">nutritional information online</a>. Only 342 calories, low in saturated fat \u2026 Aha! Salt: 5.07g a portion.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/salt-reduction\">World Health Organization recommends</a> that adults eat less than 5g of salt a day.

Well, as a one-off, it would be fine. But this wasn\u2019t a blowout, special occasion meal \u2013 it was a \u201chealthy\u201d lunch on a work day. And Wasabi is not unusual in using so much salt. This ramen illustrates how easy it is to exceed your recommended salt intake. In fact, it is nigh-impossible to stay within the limits.</p> <p>The average British adult eats 8.4g of salt every day. That\u2019s 40% above the UK\u2019s recommended maximum, and almost 70% above the WHO\u2019s recommendation. This matters. Excess salt consumption is linked to high blood pressure (hypertension), and hypertension is the leading cause of heart attack and stroke. \u201cThousands of people in the UK die needlessly each year due to high salt intake,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/\">Action on Salt</a> said in <a href=\"https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/media/action-on-salt/docs/2024-Budget-Representation_Action-on-Salt-and-Sugar.pdf\">its response</a> to the autumn budget. According to the group, if everyone in the UK ate 1g less salt a day, it would prevent more than 4,000 heart attacks and strokes every year.</p>    <p>The British Heart Foundation (BHF) <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/policy-and-public-affairs/creating-healthier-environments/reducing-the-uks-salt-intake\">has calculated</a> that, if every adult in the UK met the WHO salt-consumption guidelines by 2030, by 2035 there would be up to 1.4m fewer new cases of high blood pressure, up to 135,000 fewer new cases of coronary heart disease and up to 49,000 fewer new cases of stroke. The WHO has said: \u201cReducing sodium intake is one of the most cost-effective measures to improve health and reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases.\u201d</p> <p>Even people already taking medication for hypertension can significantly lower their blood pressure by halving their salt intake, according to <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.124.23382\">a report</a> published in September.</p> <p>Unlike, say, excess sugar, which can cause tooth decay, weight gain, skin problems and mood swings, the effects of too much salt are hidden. \u201cThere are no visible symptoms or side-effects,\u201d says Sonia Pombo, the campaign lead for Action on Salt and a research fellow at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cIt is thought that there are 5 million people with undiagnosed high blood pressure in the UK. It\u2019s a ticking timebomb.\u201d</p> <p>Heart attack and stroke are not the only things to worry about. Excess salt is also linked with stomach cancer, kidney disease and osteoporosis. \u201cWe should be doing all we can to reduce our salt intake,\u201d concludes Pombo.</p> <p>The dangers of too much salt have long been known. The UK\u2019s 6g limit \u2013 a level teaspoon \u2013 was set in 1991. In 2002, the Food Standards Agency committed to a nationwide salt-reduction initiative. \u201cBetween 2003 and 2011, we made huge strides. Population salt intakes were down by 15%, blood pressure was down, deaths from heart disease and stroke were down,\u201d says Pombo. The FSA set the first salt-reduction targets for 85 categories of food in 2006. These targets were voluntary but closely monitored, and manufacturers got on board. \u201cThe UK was world-leading, and helped countless other countries start salt-reduction programmes,\u201d says Pombo.</p>    <p>Since 2011, progress has plateaued. \u201cThere are still targets and a salt-reduction programme, but companies aren\u2019t being held accountable. Without monitoring, assessment and engagement, there\u2019s no incentive for business to make changes,\u201d says Pombo. \u201cThere have been no further reductions, salt intake is creeping up again, and blood pressure levels and rates of heart disease have stalled.\u201d While Argentina, South Africa and several European countries now have mandatory salt-reduction targets, the UK has been left behind.</p> <p>Experts are hopeful that Labour will kickstart the salt campaign again. Keir Starmer has appointed a new minister for public health and prevention, Andrew Gwynne. As Dr Swrajit Sarkar, a senior lecturer in nutrition at City, University of London, says: \u201cThe Labour government seems to understand that prevention is better than cure.\u201d Pombo welcomes the pledge in the budget to review \u2013 and hopefully expand \u2013 the successful sugar tax on soft drinks, as well as last month\u2019s House of Lords report, <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5901/ldselect/ldmfdo/19/19.pdf\">A Plan to Fix Our Broken Food System</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately, campaigners would like to see a salt levy and mandatory reduction targets to force manufacturers and caterers to reformulate their food. Thirty-five groups signed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/08/tax-unhealthy-foods-obesity-health-children\">an open letter</a> earlier this month. But it is a long process. \u201cSalt is one of the cheapest sources of preservation, and a traditional one. Reduction needs investment into new preservation techniques,\u201d says Sarkar. \u201cIf we banned salt overnight, prices would go up. Food would have a shorter shelf-life, waste would increase and carbon emissions would go up.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s thought there are 5 million people with undiagnosed high blood pressure in the UK. It\u2019s a ticking timebomb</p> <footer> <cite>Sonia Pombo, Action on Salt</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe are taking a range of actions to tackle unhealthy diets, including high salt intake, head on. Through the 10-year health plan [due to be published in spring 2025], we are shifting our focus from treatment to prevention to ease the strain on the NHS and help people to live well for longer. This includes restricting junk food advertising on TV and online, and limiting schoolchildren\u2019s access to fast food.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, what can individuals do to reduce their salt intake? \u201cUp to 85% of the salt we eat is already in our food, which makes it really hard to eat within the guidelines,\u201d says Kate Howard, the coordinator of the <a href=\"https://www.recipeforchange.org.uk/\">Recipe for Change</a> campaign. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise how much hidden salt is in certain foods,\u201d adds Sarkar. Pombo puts it more starkly: \u201cWe have been robbed of our choice to have a lower-salt diet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe best thing you can do is cook your own food from raw materials,\u201d say Sarkar. Since cooking from scratch 100% of the time is unlikely to be feasible for most of us, what are the other options? Knowing which foods are high in salt is a good start. \u201cThe main contributor of salt to UK diets, because most people eat it on a regular basis, often multiple times a day, is bread,\u201d says Pombo. \u201cIt is the biggest by far, contributing 15-20% of our total salt intake.\u201d Varying your carbs could help, then.</p> <p>The next <a href=\"https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/reformulation/salt-intake-in-the-uk/main-sources-of-salt-in-the-uk-diet/\">biggest sources of salt</a>, in order, are bacon, ready meals, cheddar-type cheeses, pizza, soup, ham/cured meats, salted butter/spread, sausages, baked beans, breakfast cereal, biscuits, potato crisps, pasta/cook-in sauces and stock. Some of those, such as bacon, are obviously salty; others, such as baked beans and biscuits, may be more surprising. \u201cHalf a gram here, a quarter there, it all adds up,\u201d says Pombo. Tracy Parker, a senior dietitian at the BHF, says other surprisingly salty foods are frozen prawns, tinned vegetables (many are in salted water) and packaged cakes. Plus, \u201cvegetable juices such as tomato juice often have added salt to ramp up the flavour\u201d.</p>    <p>\u201cRead the label to compare like-for-like products, and choose the ones that are low in salt,\u201d Parker advises. \u201cThe amount of salt in baked beans, breakfast cereals and bread can vary widely.\u201d Some brands have cut salt levels voluntarily \u2013 Pombo singles out the Goodfellas pizza range, which has been reformulated to reduce the content of salt, sugar and saturated fat. The traffic-light labels on the front of packs are a handy shortcut, although not every product displays them (they are neither mandatory nor standardised). The <a href=\"https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/foodswitch/\">FoodSwitch UK app</a> is a useful tool \u2013 you can scan the barcode to see if a product is high in salt, and if so, the app suggests alternatives.</p> <p>Other high-salt products Parker flags include: smoked food (meat, fish, cheese, tofu); sauces and condiments such as ketchup, soy sauce, salad dressings and gravy granules; anchovies and olives, especially those in brine; fermented and pickled food; and some meat substitutes, such as faux meat and fish. Some of these are healthy additions to the diet \u2013 olives, kimchi etc \u2013 as long as they are eaten in moderation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Our taste buds can adapt to less salt \u2013\u00a0the key is not to go cold turkey</p> <footer> <cite>Tracy Parker, British Heart Foundation</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The problem is, salty food is delicious. \u201cSalt is a natural flavour enhancer,\u201d says Sarkar. \u201cWe don\u2019t want bland or bitter food; we crave something salty or something sweet.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cthe more salt you have, the more you want \u2013 you become addicted to it\u201d.</p> <p>There is some good news. \u201cOur taste buds can adapt to less salt,\u201d says Parker. \u201cThe key is not to go cold turkey. If we slash salt levels too quickly, our palates can\u2019t take it. You have to retrain your taste buds gradually. Be patient, and give yourself three to five weeks to adjust.\u201d She suggests weaning yourself off salt in cooking water; experimenting with other flavourings, such as herbs, spices and citrus juice; and not having salt on the table. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/aug/27/salt-free-diet-reduce-risk-heart-problems-20-per-cent\">a study found</a> that people who never add salt to meals were 18% less likely to develop the heart condition atrial fibrillation. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve cut back, you really notice when a restaurant meal is salty,\u201d says Parker.</p> <p>Surely fancy salts aren\u2019t as bad as cheap table salt? My beloved Maldon sea salt sits on the kitchen counter by the hob, and my cupboards contain smoked salt, Himalayan pink salt and kala namak (black salt). \u201cHimalayan rock salt contains tiny levels of micronutrients but exactly the same level of sodium as table salt,\u201d says Pombo bluntly. \u201cThings like Maldon sea salt have much bigger salt crystals so they don\u2019t taste as salty, but they are \u2013 and you might end up adding more.\u201d </p> <p>Is it a good idea to switch to a salt substitute such as LoSalt? \u201cThese mix sodium chloride with potassium chloride, so they\u2019re lower in sodium and can be useful if you still want a salty flavour,\u201d says Parker. \u201cHowever, they don\u2019t help with kicking the salty habit \u2013 it\u2019s better to adjust your palate so you\u2019re not craving salt.\u201d Potassium-based substitutes are also not suitable for people with heart and kidney problems: if in doubt, check with your doctor.</p> <p>For me, salty snacks are the hardest habit to kick. \u201cGo for unsalted nuts, reduced-salt crisps, plain popcorn or breadsticks, and fruit. There are more low- and no-salt foods available now,\u201d says Parker. That sounds a bit dismal. Personally, I\u2019d rather cut out other sources of salt, and still treat myself to the odd bag of crisps.</p> <p>Shopping and cooking is one thing, but what about food on the go and in restaurants? \u201cIt\u2019s so much harder to keep track of salt when you\u2019re eating out of the home,\u201d Parker says. \u201cIf you know which foods are generally high in salt, you can avoid them in your lunchtime sandwich \u2013 cheese, processed meat and so on. With salads, be aware of the add-ons such as croutons and dressings.\u201d In hindsight, my ramen \u2013 which seemed so virtuous \u2013 had some salt flags: broth, condiments, pickles.</p> <p>\u201cRestaurant food and takeaways are absolutely covered in salt,\u201d says Pombo. She says chefs get used to the salty taste, and often end up adding more and more. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect sugar to be already added to our takeaway coffee \u2013 so why is salt added to everything?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/media/action-on-salt/surveys/Healthiness-in-UK-OOH.pdf\">A report in August</a> on the 10 bestselling items at the 20 biggest chains in the UK, including Costa, Pret a Manger, Pizza Express and Wetherspoon\u2019s, found that just 22% to 54% could be considered \u201chealthier\u201d. Optimistically, Parker says: \u201cSome restaurants have nutritional information online, so if you\u2019re really organised you can have a look before you go out. And always taste your meal before adding salt.\u201d She suggests choosing fresh meat over processed, and thinking about, say, which pizza toppings and pasta sauces might be high in salt. \u201cLittle changes go a really long way.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>People on lower incomes are more likely to eat excess salt due to the lack of available, affordable healthy food</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The effects of excess salt aren\u2019t felt equally. According to Action on Salt, many <a href=\"https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/salthealth/salt-and-ethnic-minorities/\">people from ethnic minorities</a>, including people of black African and South Asian descent, are particularly sensitive to salt and are at higher risk of associated health conditions. <a href=\"https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/salthealth/salt-and-the-older-population/\">Older people</a> are more at risk, too: over time we all become more sensitive to salt, and it has a greater effect on blood pressure, which increases with age anyway. And those on lower incomes are more likely to eat excess salt due to the lack of available, affordable healthy food. For example, says Pombo: \u201cThere are probably five or six varieties of the most popular brand of ketchup, including low- and no-salt, but the cheapest will always be the big bottle of standard high salt and sugar.\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible to eat too little salt? In a word, no. Sodium is naturally present in many foods, and we only need 1g of salt a day \u2013 about a pinch \u2013 for our bodies to function. Even if you do a lot of sweaty exercise, you\u2019re highly unlikely to need extra salt. \u201cBig sweaters do lose some sodium, but most of us are getting more than enough, so you don\u2019t need to compensate,\u201d says Parker. Just drink plenty of water. \u201cElite athletes lose sodium, potassium and other minerals, but they have sports drinks and rehydration tablets designed for them.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, preventing hypertension is not just about limiting salt. \u201cRegular exercise, cutting down on alcohol and watching your weight is beneficial to your blood pressure, too,\u201d says Parker. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really important to get it checked. The NHS is in crisis, and this is one of the ways to help.\u201d</p>",

The soup was packed with turmeric noodles, vegetable gyozas, mushrooms, bean sprouts, pak choi, pickled ginger and sesame seeds, in a soy and miso broth. It was delicious. In fact, it was so delicious, I was suspicious. I checked out its nutritional information online. Only 342 calories, low in saturated fat \u2026 Aha! Salt: 5.07g a portion. The World Health Organization recommends that adults eat less than 5g of salt a day. One noodle soup had exceeded my entire daily intake.

With salads, be aware of the add-ons such as croutons and dressings.\u201d In hindsight, my ramen \u2013 which seemed so virtuous \u2013 had some salt flags: broth, condiments, pickles. \u201cRestaurant food and takeaways are absolutely covered in salt,\u201d says Pombo. She says chefs get used to the salty taste, and often end up adding more and more. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect sugar to be already added to our takeaway coffee \u2013 so why is salt added to everything?\u201d A report in August on the 10 bestselling items at the 20 biggest chains in the UK, including Costa, Pret a Manger, Pizza Express and Wetherspoon\u2019s, found that just 22% to 54% could be considered \u201chealthier\u201d. Optimistically, Parker says: \u201cSome restaurants have nutritional information online, so if you\u2019re really organised you can have a look before you go out. And always taste your meal before adding salt.\u201d She suggests choosing fresh meat over processed, and thinking about, say, which pizza toppings and pasta sauces might be high in salt. \u201cLittle changes go a really long way.\u201d The effects of excess salt aren\u2019t felt equally. According to Action on Salt, many people from ethnic minorities, including people of black African and South Asian descent, are particularly sensitive to salt and are at higher risk of associated health conditions. Older people are more at risk, too: over time we all become more sensitive to salt, and it has a greater effect on blood pressure, which increases with age anyway. And those on lower incomes are more likely to eat excess salt due to the lack of available, affordable healthy food. For example, says Pombo: \u201cThere are probably five or six varieties of the most popular brand of ketchup, including low- and no-salt, but the cheapest will always be the big bottle of standard high salt and sugar.\u201d Is it possible to eat too little salt? In a word, no. Sodium is naturally present in many foods, and we only need 1g of salt a day \u2013 about a pinch \u2013 for our bodies to function. Even if you do a lot of sweaty exercise, you\u2019re highly unlikely to need extra salt. \u201cBig sweaters do lose some sodium, but most of us are getting more than enough, so you don\u2019t need to compensate,\u201d says Parker. Just drink plenty of water. \u201cElite athletes lose sodium, potassium and other minerals, but they have sports drinks and rehydration tablets designed for them.\u201d Of course, preventing hypertension is not just about limiting salt. \u201cRegular exercise, cutting down on alcohol and watching your weight is beneficial to your blood pressure, too,\u201d says Parker. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really important to get it checked. The NHS is in crisis, and this is one of the ways to help.\u201d",

At a time when the government is struggling to balance the budget \u2013 cutting funds for education, health and social security \u2013 opposition parties have described the deal, that will cost about \u20ac1bn (\u00a3830m) over five years, as a \u201cfinancial disaster\u201d. \u201cMission accomplished!\u201d said Riccardo Magi, the president of the leftwing opposition party Pi\u00f9 Europa (More Europe). \u201cThe government has succeeded in the effort to repatriate. Migrants? No, Italian operators sent to Albania, who will be returning home by the weekend. The government first wasted a huge sum of public funds, then with the centres emptied, brought back some police personnel to Italy, and now even social workers are returning home. This is an epochal failure.\u201d The scheme has led to a row between the government and judges, who have been accused by far-right parties of obstructing the project. Nicola Gratteri, the chief prosecutor of Naples and one of the most authoritative magistrates in Italy, said in a TV interview this week: \u201cWe must stop attacking magistrates just because we don\u2019t like a decision. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give a political judgment, but I say that at this moment in Albania there are 250 law enforcement officers who are hardly doing anything. It\u2019s a waste to keep 250 police officers on a mission in Albania, so I think they should be brought back to Italy where we are struggling with staffing shortages for thousands of policemen.\u201d The government has said the centres in Albania \u201cwill remain open and operational\u201d and that the transfers to Italy have been made according to staffing needs. However, the credibility of Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, is at stake after she made immigration a central campaigning issue. In the past she has criticised predecessors for spending public money on managing the migration crisis. The transport by sea on an Italian military ship of just eight men who arrived in Albania over a weekend in mid November cost \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3205,000) \u2013 more than \u20ac31,000 per asylum seeker onboard. Elisabetta Piccolotti, an MP for the Green and Left Alliance party, said: \u201cThe government has failed knowing it would fail. They have spent a mountain of money and played with people\u2019s rights. This will remain in history as a shameful page for our country.\u201d",

Vladimir Putin has signed a law granting debt forgiveness to new army recruits who enlist to fight in Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. According to Russian state news agency Interfax, the new legislation allows those signing up for a one-year contract to write off bad debts of up to 10 million rubles ($96,000; \u00a377,000). An air alert has been sounded \u2018almost daily\u2019 across Ukraine this week, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says as he pleads for more air defences. Zelenskyy has posted to Telegram saying that his country needs more air defences to protect itself against relentless Russian attacks. He said that Russia used more than 800 guided aerial bombs, about 460 attack drones, and more than 20 missiles over the past week. Russia prepared to launch cyber-attacks on UK, minister to warn. Russia is prepared to launch a series of cyber-attacks on Britain and other Nato members as it seeks to weaken support for Ukraine, a senior UK cabinet minister will warn in a speech on Monday.

Barrot\u2019s comments are significant, coming a few days after US and UK long-range missiles were used in that way for the first time.

According to Russian state news agency Interfax, the new legislation allows those signing up for a one-year contract to write off bad debts of up to 10 million rubles ($96,000; \u00a377,000). The law applies to debts for which a court order for collection was issued and enforcement proceedings had commenced before 1 December 2024. It also applies to the spouses of new recruits. Russia has increased military recruitment by offering increasing financial incentives, in some cases several times the average salary, to those willing to fight in Ukraine. The strategy has allowed the military to boost its ranks while avoiding another mobilisation order. A \u201cpartial mobilisation\u201d in September 2022 sparked an exodus of tens of thousands of Russian men, who fled the country to avoid enlistment. Former Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen has suggested that the US should prioritise helping Ukraine over Taiwan \u2013 in the immediate future \u2013 as Kyiv needs weapons more urgently than Taipei. Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, the former Taiwanese leader was quoted by Politico as saying: \u201cThey should do whatever they can to help the Ukrainians \u2026 We [Taiwan] still have time.\u201d Tsai, who left office in January, added: \u201cA Ukrainian victory will serve as the most effective deterrent to future aggression.\u201d This suggests Tsai believes that US military support for Kyiv \u2013 something that has come under threat with Donald Trump\u2019s election victory \u2013 would help deter China from a cross-strait attack. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a claim that Taiwan\u2019s government rejects. The US is Taiwan\u2019s most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic recognition. China has launched major military drills around Taiwan, simulating a full-scale attack on the island. Politico reports: Taiwanese officials have said that the island has boosted defence spending by 80 percent in the past eight years, hitting a record $19bn in 2024. But that hasn\u2019t been enough to placate president-elect Donald Trump, who has suggested that Taiwan \u201cshould pay\u201d and has also called for the island to boost defense spending to 10 percent of GDP. Tsai did not directly respond to whether Taipei should raise its budget to that level. \u201cWe would have some difficulty accepting an arbitrary figure,\u201d Tsai said. Nearly 22,000 residents have been evacuated from Kharkiv region since last May, the oblast\u2019s governor Oleh Syniehubov said yesterday. \u201cWe are continuing evacuation efforts, bringing both children and adults to safety,\u201d Syniehubo said. Russia is increasingly hitting the Kharkiv region with building-leveling glide bombs and swarms of drones and chipping away at territory there. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has posted to Telegram saying that his country needs more air defences to protect itself against relentless Russian attacks. He said that Russia used more than 800 guided aerial bombs, about 460 attack drones, and more than 20 missiles over the past week. Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram: An air alert has been sounded almost daily across Ukraine this week. Ukraine is not a testing ground for weapons. Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state. But Russia still continues its efforts to kill our people, spread fear and panic, and weaken us.

The Ukrainian military said air defence units had destroyed more than 10 Russian drones that were targeting Kyiv in an overnight attack. Zelenskyy has directed his defence minister, Rustem Umerov, to start talks with partners on acquiring advanced air defence systems. This is reportedly in reaction to Russia having launched an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile against a rocket factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro last week. As my colleague Andrew Roth notes in this story, US officials have decried Vladimir Putin\u2019s use of the nuclear-capable warhead but denied that it is a \u201cgamechanger\u201d in the war, adding that Russia possessed just a handful of the missiles, which its military has named Oreshnik, or Hazel. Miranda Bryant, the Guardian\u2019s Nordic correspondent, has spoken to Finnish women who are preparing for a potential Russian invasion or hybrid attack.

I saw that it is possible that we are next.\u201d The mother of two, who describes herself as a \u201crealist\u201d, was moved to join this weekend-long \u201csurviving without electricity\u201d course by her patriotic values, but she also wants to be more prepared with practical skills for day-to-day life. She is one of about 75 women taking part. While a power cut is a situation that could be brought on by a storm \u2013 as happened for tens of thousands across Finland last week \u2013 they are also skills that could prove crucial in a potential Russian invasion or hybrid attack. The training course, known as Nasta, is one of 40 put on by the Women\u2019s National Emergency Preparedness Association around Finland. Others include cybersecurity, mental resilience, wilderness skills, snowmobile driving and information influencing. After the invasion of Ukraine, applications for the courses soared. Not only does Finland have a history of war with its neighbour, but they also share a 830-mile land border. Russia is prepared to launch a series of cyber-attacks on Britain and other Nato members as it seeks to weaken support for Ukraine, a senior UK cabinet minister will warn in a speech on Monday. Moscow will \u201cnot think twice\u201d about exploiting defence gaps to target UK businesses, and allies must \u201cnot underestimate\u201d the threat it poses, Pat McFadden, a senior UK minister whose portfolio includes national security, will say. In a speech to the Nato cyber defence conference at Lancaster House, the minister is expected to say: Military hard-power is one thing. But cyberwar can be destabilising and debilitating. With a cyber-attack, Russia can turn the lights off for millions of people. It can shut down the power grids. This is the hidden war Russia is waging with Ukraine \u2026 Given the scale of that hostility, my message to members today is clear: no one should underestimate the Russian cyber threat to Nato. The threat is real. Russia is exceptionally aggressive and reckless in the cyber realm. McFadden is expected to specifically call out Unit 29155, a Russian military unit that the government says was previously found to have carried out a number of attacks in the UK and Europe. There are gangs of \u201cunofficial hacktivists\u201d and mercenaries not directly under the Kremlin\u2019s control \u201cbut who are allowed to act with impunity so long as they\u2019re not working against Putin\u2019s interests,\u201d he will say. The accusations come as tensions between Russia and the west have escalated dramatically, with Vladimir Putin warning that the war in Ukraine had the characteristics of a \u201cglobal\u201d conflict. The growing frictions have sparked fresh unease in London and other western capitals that Putin may step up cyber-attacks and other non-military measures. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. The French foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, has told the BBC in an interview that western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia, and \u201cnot set and express red lines\u201d. Barrot\u2019s comments are significant, coming a few days after US and UK long-range missiles were used in that way for the first time. Barrot said that Ukraine could fire French long-range missiles into Russia \u201cin the logics of self-defence\u201d, but would not confirm if French weapons had already been used. \u201cThe principle has been set \u2026 our messages to President Zelenskyy have been well received,\u201d he said. France has supplied Ukraine with the Scalp missile, which is identical to the British-supplied Storm Shadow that Ukraine has reportedly already used inside Russia. \u201cWe will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary. Why? Because it is our security that is at stake. Each time the Russian army progresses by one square kilometre, the threat gets one square kilometre closer to Europe,\u201d he said. When asked if \u201cno limit\u201d support could translate to French troops in combat, Barrot said: \u201cWe do not discard any option\u201d. Here are some of the other latest developments in the war: Ukraine\u2019s air defence units destroyed more than 10 Russia drones that were targeting Kyiv in an overnight drone attack, Ukraine\u2019s military said on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries as a result of the attack. \u201cThe UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were flying in different directions towards Kyiv,\u201d Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv\u2019s military administration, said. \u201cThe air raid alert in the city lasted for more than three hours.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s air defences downed 50 of 73 Russian drones launched overnight, the Ukrainian military said this morning. In a post on Telegram, the air force said it lost track of 19 drones and four more are still in the air. Russia\u2019s air defence systems destroyed 34 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said. Russian media is reporting that colonel general Gennady Anashkin, the commander of the southern grouping, had been removed from his command, for giving misleading reports about the progress of the war. There has been no official confirmation from the Russian ministry of defence. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan will discuss the latest developments in the war with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Monday during his visit to Ankara, a Turkish official. They are expected to discuss the removal of defence procurement obstacles between Nato allies and the military alliance\u2019s joint fight against terrorism. Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia\u2019s Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters. The source, who is on Ukraine\u2019s general staff, said Russia had deployed about 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv\u2019s forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cAt most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,\u201d the source said.",

The Eton-educated marquess also set up a \u201cGaiety Theatre\u201d on the grounds and treated neighbouring islanders to spectacular performances.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t known about the butterfly balls, but reading about them I felt a spark of that something I look out for \u2013 a moment in history that stands out,\u201d said Jones, who is also an actor and who has previously directed films including <em>The Vanishing</em> and <em>The Almond and the Seahorse</em> with his Mad As Birds film company.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have something extraordinary here in the performance of Callum,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The 25-year-old actor is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/10/frankie-goes-to-hollywood-biopic-relax-callum-scott-howells\">due to portray Holly Johnson in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/10/frankie-goes-to-hollywood-biopic-relax-callum-scott-howells\">Relax</a></em>, a film about Frankie Goes to Hollywood. In <em>Madfabulous</em>, Howells stars alongside Rupert Everett and <em>Bridgerton</em>\u2019s Ruby Stokes, and he is supported by a cast including Paul Rhys, Kevin Eldon and Louise Brealey, the <em>Sherlock</em> actor who recently appeared on screen with Jones in the British musical <em>Chuck Chuck Baby</em><em>.</em></p> <p>\u201cPaul Rhys is a genius, as all actors know, and he is a wonderful villain. The cast, in fact, is almost like a classic Ealing comedy cast from the 1950s,\u201d said Jones. The director believes that although Paget behaved irresponsibly, his openness to other people somehow combined with his apparent innocence to ensure he was largely forgiven by those around him. He routinely ignored class barriers as well as society\u2019s prevalent dismissive attitude to women.</p> <p>\u201cHe lived to the full. However, he eventually paid the price for it all,\u201d said the director. \u201cThe one thing we do know is that Henry ended his life penniless in the south of France.\u201d After being made a bankrupt, owing the equivalent of \u00a370m, Paget died of tuberculosis at the age of 29.</p> <p>\u201cThis film, I hope, is a kind of love story,\u201d said Jones, \u201cBut it is more about love in its various guises, from passion, to lust, to platonic love and unrequited love. And it is about love\u2019s&nbsp;casualties.\u201d</p>",

The 25-year-old actor is also due to portray Holly Johnson in Relax, a film about Frankie Goes to Hollywood. In Madfabulous, Howells stars alongside Rupert Everett and Bridgerton\u2019s Ruby Stokes, and he is supported by a cast including Paul Rhys, Kevin Eldon and Louise Brealey, the Sherlock actor who recently appeared on screen with Jones in the British musical Chuck Chuck Baby. \u201cPaul Rhys is a genius, as all actors know, and he is a wonderful villain. The cast, in fact, is almost like a classic Ealing comedy cast from the 1950s,\u201d said Jones. The director believes that although Paget behaved irresponsibly, his openness to other people somehow combined with his apparent innocence to ensure he was largely forgiven by those around him. He routinely ignored class barriers as well as society\u2019s prevalent dismissive attitude to women. \u201cHe lived to the full. However, he eventually paid the price for it all,\u201d said the director. \u201cThe one thing we do know is that Henry ended his life penniless in the south of France.\u201d After being made a bankrupt, owing the equivalent of \u00a370m, Paget died of tuberculosis at the age of 29. \u201cThis film, I hope, is a kind of love story,\u201d said Jones, \u201cBut it is more about love in its various guises, from passion, to lust, to platonic love and unrequited love. And it is about love\u2019s casualties.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>From 10 miles out, the tiny town of Nipton suddenly appears in the middle distance like a mirage: a huddle of lush<strong> </strong>eucalyptus trees in an otherwise impossibly vast, barren expanse of the California desert.</p> <p>From closer up, the place still feels dream-like. Old west-style buildings, including the Nipton Trading Post and a five-bed hotel built in the early 1900s, dot the community but are shuttered to the public. Other than the freight trains that regularly slice through the edge of town, Nipton is often completely silent. The unincorporated area is home to only about a dozen people, depending on the season, and spans just 80 acres. (\u201cBlink and you\u2019ll miss it,\u201d one of the town\u2019s caretakers says.)</p> <p>But recently, a rotating cast of unlikely characters has started showing up in this seemingly forgotten desert outpost.<strong> </strong>There were the six acrobats from Ukraine (and one from Russia), who came to practice death-defying stunts in matching uniforms. Then a posse of clowns arrived,<strong> </strong>staying for two weeks and taking over the historic hotel. A pair of contortionists followed, riding unicycles around in leather jackets and twisting their bodies into inhuman shapes.</p> <p>All of those performers came with the circus.</p>    <p>Spiegelworld, an entertainment and circus company based in Las Vegas, bought the entire town in 2022 for $2.5m.<strong> </strong>This isolated plot of land, roughly an hour\u2019s drive from Vegas and the same distance from the nearest grocery store, is now known as Spiegelworld\u2019s \u201cglobal headquarters\u201d or, more simply, the \u201ccircus town\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was totally bewitched by the whole thing,\u201d Ross Mollison, Spiegelworld\u2019s founder, said of his first visit to Nipton. \u201cIt was just gorgeous.\u201d</p> <p>Mollison, whose preferred job title is \u201cimpresario extraordinaire\u201d (an old-school show business term that underscores he\u2019s \u201cthe guy behind it all\u201d, he says), had characteristically grand plans for his new town. And in the nearly three years since its sale, Nipton has slowly started to transform into the circus haven of Mollison\u2019s dreams. Nipton now functions as both a retreat and a rehearsal space for Spiegelworld circus performers, who filter into the remote<strong> </strong>town on a regular basis to come up with new acts for Spiegelworld shows in Vegas \u2013 and to simply escape from the stage for a few days.</p> <p>In other words, Mollison says: \u201cWe\u2019re creating our own little Disneyland.\u201d</p>    <h2>\u2018Summer camp to make a show\u2019</h2> <p>Over the past century, Nipton has been forced to shape-shift many times to survive.</p> <p>The town first materialized just after the turn of the 20th century. Then called Nippeno Camp, it served as both a whistle stop on the railroad between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles and as a gold mining camp for prospectors trying their luck in the surrounding \u201cgolden triangle\u201d mining district. Clara Bow, a celebrated silent film actor, was a frequent guest at the sole Nipton hotel in the 1920s (the room where Bow stayed is still marked with a golden plaque).</p> <p>\u201cIt is, of course, unnecessary to state that Nippeno is the future metropolis of California,\u201d the now defunct Salt Lake Herald newspaper wrote confidently in 1905.</p> <p>But towards the middle of the century, Nipton languished, hovering on the brink of extinction. In more recent years, the town has changed hands several times; a <a href=\"https://www.desertsun.com/story/money/business/2017/09/26/nipton-california-marijuana-american-green/569319001/\">marijuana company bought Nipton</a> in 2017 with plans to turn it into a cannabis-themed tourist destination. Elsewhere in southern California, other small communities have sometimes been bought up by corporate interests, including <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-23/riverside-county-ghost-town-sells-for-22-6-million-to-mysterious-company\">the ghost town of Eagle Mountain</a> near Joshua Tree and a <a href=\"https://sundaylongread.com/2021/07/10/the-rise-fall-and-uncertain-future-of-desert-center/\">tiny settlement called Desert Center</a>.</p>    <p>When Mollison finally showed up in Nipton a few years ago, the place felt almost deserted. There was trash heaped everywhere, and the town\u2019s historic buildings were in disrepair.<strong> </strong>\u201cThis place is a dump,\u201d Mollison remembers thinking upon first setting foot there.<strong> </strong>But he was also thinking about his circus, and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/04/third-places-meet-new-people-pandemic/629468/\">the lack of community spaces</a> in modern American life.</p> <p>\u201cWith the diminution of religion for many people, there\u2019s nowhere where we go to sing together any more,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] the circus is a real community.

The show was to be completely created and rehearsed in Nipton over the span of two weeks, then performed in the town\u2019s trading post for a select audience, and finally showcased for one night only in Spiegelworld\u2019s restaurant and bar Superfrico within Vegas\u2019s Cosmopolitan hotel.</p> <p>Baumgarten quickly assembled a team of his \u201cclosest clown performer friends\u201d and the group trekked out to the desert.</p> <p>\u201cIt was kind of like summer camp to make a show,\u201d Baumgarten said.</p>    <p>Each night, the performers bunked together in Nipton\u2019s hotel, and each day they jumped between the town\u2019s different buildings to rehearse their new show.

Their costumes were inexpensive race car drivers\u2019 outfits from Amazon.

      "bodyText": "From 10 miles out, the tiny town of Nipton suddenly appears in the middle distance like a mirage: a huddle of lush eucalyptus trees in an otherwise impossibly vast, barren expanse of the California desert. From closer up, the place still feels dream-like. Old west-style buildings, including the Nipton Trading Post and a five-bed hotel built in the early 1900s, dot the community but are shuttered to the public. Other than the freight trains that regularly slice through the edge of town, Nipton is often completely silent. The unincorporated area is home to only about a dozen people, depending on the season, and spans just 80 acres. (\u201cBlink and you\u2019ll miss it,\u201d one of the town\u2019s caretakers says.) But recently, a rotating cast of unlikely characters has started showing up in this seemingly forgotten desert outpost. There were the six acrobats from Ukraine (and one from Russia), who came to practice death-defying stunts in matching uniforms. Then a posse of clowns arrived, staying for two weeks and taking over the historic hotel. A pair of contortionists followed, riding unicycles around in leather jackets and twisting their bodies into inhuman shapes. All of those performers came with the circus. Spiegelworld, an entertainment and circus company based in Las Vegas, bought the entire town in 2022 for $2.5m. This isolated plot of land, roughly an hour\u2019s drive from Vegas and the same distance from the nearest grocery store, is now known as Spiegelworld\u2019s \u201cglobal headquarters\u201d or, more simply, the \u201ccircus town\u201d. \u201cI was totally bewitched by the whole thing,\u201d Ross Mollison, Spiegelworld\u2019s founder, said of his first visit to Nipton. \u201cIt was just gorgeous.\u201d Mollison, whose preferred job title is \u201cimpresario extraordinaire\u201d (an old-school show business term that underscores he\u2019s \u201cthe guy behind it all\u201d, he says), had characteristically grand plans for his new town. And in the nearly three years since its sale, Nipton has slowly started to transform into the circus haven of Mollison\u2019s dreams. Nipton now functions as both a retreat and a rehearsal space for Spiegelworld circus performers, who filter into the remote town on a regular basis to come up with new acts for Spiegelworld shows in Vegas \u2013 and to simply escape from the stage for a few days. In other words, Mollison says: \u201cWe\u2019re creating our own little Disneyland.\u201d \u2018Summer camp to make a show\u2019 Over the past century, Nipton has been forced to shape-shift many times to survive. The town first materialized just after the turn of the 20th century. Then called Nippeno Camp, it served as both a whistle stop on the railroad between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles and as a gold mining camp for prospectors trying their luck in the surrounding \u201cgolden triangle\u201d mining district. Clara Bow, a celebrated silent film actor, was a frequent guest at the sole Nipton hotel in the 1920s (the room where Bow stayed is still marked with a golden plaque). \u201cIt is, of course, unnecessary to state that Nippeno is the future metropolis of California,\u201d the now defunct Salt Lake Herald newspaper wrote confidently in 1905. But towards the middle of the century, Nipton languished, hovering on the brink of extinction. In more recent years, the town has changed hands several times; a marijuana company bought Nipton in 2017 with plans to turn it into a cannabis-themed tourist destination. Elsewhere in southern California, other small communities have sometimes been bought up by corporate interests, including the ghost town of Eagle Mountain near Joshua Tree and a tiny settlement called Desert Center. When Mollison finally showed up in Nipton a few years ago, the place felt almost deserted. There was trash heaped everywhere, and the town\u2019s historic buildings were in disrepair. \u201cThis place is a dump,\u201d Mollison remembers thinking upon first setting foot there. But he was also thinking about his circus, and the lack of community spaces in modern American life. \u201cWith the diminution of religion for many people, there\u2019s nowhere where we go to sing together any more,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] the circus is a real community. We have brought families, or individuals in some cases, to Vegas 15 years ago, who have been there the whole time and have now bought homes and had kids, and their kids are coming and working in the circus.\u201d Many members of that circus community have since ventured out to Nipton, including Max Baumgarten, who describes himself as a comedic actor with \u201ca speciality within the world of clown\u201d. Mollison initially reached out to Baumgarten in the spring of 2023 with an unusual question: will you come up with a comedic performance based on Formula One racing? The show was to be completely created and rehearsed in Nipton over the span of two weeks, then performed in the town\u2019s trading post for a select audience, and finally showcased for one night only in Spiegelworld\u2019s restaurant and bar Superfrico within Vegas\u2019s Cosmopolitan hotel. Baumgarten quickly assembled a team of his \u201cclosest clown performer friends\u201d and the group trekked out to the desert. \u201cIt was kind of like summer camp to make a show,\u201d Baumgarten said. Each night, the performers bunked together in Nipton\u2019s hotel, and each day they jumped between the town\u2019s different buildings to rehearse their new show. An old schoolhouse built in the 1930s, an unassuming one-room space with a tin roof, was their favorite place to practice; the weathered wooden floor and high ceilings made the building feel like an upscale dance studio \u2013 just in the middle of nowhere. As for Formula One-themed props, the group rolled in real tires, brought in boxes of steering wheels and helmets, and built entire sets out of cardboard. Their costumes were inexpensive race car drivers\u2019 outfits from Amazon. For the group\u2019s two performances in Nipton, their invited guests included other circus performers, who drove out from Vegas, and also a handful of local miners, who work in the nearby rare earth mines and some of whom live on the Nipton property in RVs. \u201cBeing away from all the distractions, and having that be your only job, with people who are that skilled \u2013 you can make so much,\u201d Baumgarten said. Plumbing issues, trash and \u2018magic\u2019 But in between the clown shows and the acrobatics and the general glitz and glam that has drifted in from Vegas, Nipton has no shortage of mundane, real-world problems to contend with. Alex and Frank Strebel, a couple from Colorado who now mostly live in Nipton, were hired by Spiegelworld to deal with those issues. On one recent October afternoon, their most pressing matter was the town\u2019s 70-year-old plumbing system, which had suddenly sprung a leak. \u201cWe\u2019ve got water \u2013 oh no, turn it off, turn it off,\u201d Frank cautioned in a phone call to Alex that afternoon, who was stationed on the other side of the property, as a small geyser of water shot out from a broken pipe. \u201cGuess what: the pipe has a crack in it.

Or a hacker uses a deepfake imitation of your voice to dupe an unsuspecting customer service rep with your stolen information. Or a hacker uses open-source software to hoax users into revealing their pin as they try to log in to a site. It happens. More than you would like to know. Or your biometric information is stolen through malware and then \u2013 using advanced AI with high-resolution photos or 3D imaging \u2013 replicated. This already happens. Spoiler alert: even in a post-password universe, your company\u2019s data and your personal data are not safe. Tech companies will keep coming up with new ways to secure it, and hackers will find their way around. It\u2019s a war that will never end, supported by a multibillion-dollar industry that makes security tools and whose executives secretly salivate every time there\u2019s a new flaw because \u2026 hey, better not cancel that subscription, or else! It is depressing but it is not a reason to give up. As a business owner, you have a fiduciary responsibility over your cash and your company\u2019s data. So you must keep fighting. You make sure your employees are trained to notice potential scams (that\u2019s the No 1 cause of breaches). You pay an IT company to load the latest (and \u2013 another spoiler alert \u2013 immediately out-of-date) security software on all your company devices. You keep all your operating systems \u2013 Windows, iOS, etc \u2013 updated. You get cyber-insurance. You back up your data. You do all these things because you\u2019re supposed to. It will never guarantee the security of your data. But it will help minimize your risk. And it is all about risk. Life is about risk. You take risks when you cross a street, get on a plane, eat at a restaurant. You do this because there are rewards. At work, you risk data breaches because technology helps you do things faster, keep your overhead low, grow sales, make you and your people more productive. You enjoy the rewards of delivery services, mobile payment apps, social media and online betting. Are these rewards greater than the risks of a data breach? For most, the answer is yes. It\u2019s a choice. We know the costs. And we don\u2019t do enough to protect ourselves. We all choose to take that risk.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cHello! I said to myself today that if I do five handstands and flip over it will be an excellent year and I did!\u201d Thus, unceremoniously, began the 41-volume (and counting) story of my life. It was 1984 and I was 14, fumbling through adolescence in a scarlet beret. My likes, according to a list on the front page, included jacket potatoes and graveyards. My new year resolutions were to \u201csee how long I can go without cake\u201d and \u201cimprove my character.\u201d</p> <p>I haven\u2019t missed a day\u2019s entry since that 1 January. My past crams two bookshelves in rows of page-a-day journals. It\u2019s startling how little four decades seems when it\u2019s represented by slim, stacked spines.</p> <p>I have little idea of the tales they tell. Most of the entries have lain unread since I wrote them. Yet every morning, I hunt down my fountain pen (life must be recorded in a pen that takes itself seriously!) and write up the previous day. If ever I were to miss one, it would seem it had never happened; if my diaries were lost, I\u2019d feel my foundations had buckled. Journalling is a chore and a panacea, and yet I still can\u2019t fathom why I do it.</p> <p>There are many reasons, according to <a href=\"https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p9183-fiona-courage\">Fiona Courage</a>, director of the Mass Observation Archive that collects personal records of everyday life in the UK. \u201cSome people want to leave something of themselves to posterity,\u201d she says. \u201cSome find it therapeutic. Virginia Woolf\u2019s diaries were a way of practising her writing.\u201d Courage says that the habit soared during the Covid lockdowns as people realised that they were living through history. \u201cDiaries give you the ability to distil your experiences and make sense of them,\u201d she says. \u201cFor historians they are priceless as they record social trends, layers and details that wouldn\u2019t make it into the history books. They plug a gap in the everyday.\u201d</p>    <p>I had no inkling of what I\u2019d started when I recorded that first New Year\u2019s Day. My mother, a local historian, had nagged me for years to keep a diary so that future generations might learn what a 20th-century teen did for fun and ate for dinner. It was more an urge to write that motivated me to begin. I did not, I had sadly discovered, have a novel in me. There was a point, I like to think, when it dawned on me that life is its own story. A series of chapters, an evolving cast of characters, a thickening plot and an unguessed ending.</p> <p>Those future generations will have a very misleading idea of the 20th-century teen. Doris Day provided the soundtrack of my youth. My recreation was climbing trees. While classmates danced at discos, I was in bed with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jun/28/review-lucy-maud-montgomery-anne-of-green-gables\">Anne of Green Gables</a></em>. Adolescent passion passed me by entirely. My heart was broken by the deaths of prewar film stars, announced in lurid felt tip in the page margins, rather than boys.</p> <p>Over the years, the entries evolved from a record of school lessons and domestic routines to confessional and reportage. And I can chart my startled ageing: \u201cI\u2019m much too young to be so old so soon.\u201d I marvelled on my 21st birthday.</p> <p>On my 30th: \u201cMy face is lumpen, my body stale and my hair like tinned sardines. Feel every inch of 30.\u201d</p> <p>When 40 arrived: \u201cMy haemorrhoids are growing and my brain is shrinking. However, I am quite contented to be 40, if a little awed by my antiquity. I have always known that middle age would suit me and feel qualified now to march about in large hats berating miscreants.\u201d</p>    <p>Now, when I look back on them, those volumes do read like a story. A chronicled life seems more like a plot with a sense of direction than a puzzle of random events. The darkest times \u2013 the night my mother was run over and the long years of her recovery; two unexpected redundancies \u2013 are, reading back, no longer isolated intrusions, but part of a developing narrative. I can read the chapters with a God-like omniscience. I\u2019ll know, if I follow that misfit teenager through four years of school, how things turned out. Which hopes came good, which friendships lasted; how, now and then, foes became benefactors.</p> <p>I could trace how becoming a university sacristan at 20 to please a dishy chaplain began a chain of events that led, seven years later, to my husband. Or, further back, how a crush on my new German teacher at 14 inspired me to study German at university where I encountered that dishy chaplain. I know that the self that celebrated the arrival of 1996 as a sorry singleton (\u201cWhile the others waltzed, J and I washed up and reflected mournfully on our unloved state. It\u2019s a condition that has landed us the worst bedroom behind the wellington boot depot. No one brings us tea in bed and no one dances to the Pogues with us\u201d) would meet at a ceilidh, before the year was out, the man I was to marry: \u201cI found myself paired with a priest. I was instructed to \u2018grab his left\u2019 and do a Doozy Doo. He kept coming back for more, so we \u2018stripped the willow\u2019 successfully together and later I found myself contemplating the pros and cons of marriage to a curate.\u201d And I can confirm that five handstands and a flip ensured that 1984 was \u201cnot at all bad, despite Orwell\u2019s ominous predictions.\u201d</p> <p>You pay more attention to the world when you know you\u2019ll be writing it up. I pen character sketches of strangers I meet \u2013 a pony-tailed sheet metalworker from Avonmouth who revered Prokofiev, the substantial matron in a waiting room \u201cwho described to me her knicker situation\u201d. I want to do justice even to the dullest day because life is a privilege and the mundane of today will be tomorrow\u2019s history.</p> <p>I recorded my first sight of a mobile phone, wielded from a pulpit as a spiritual aid, in 1985: \u201c\u2018Can anyone tell me what this is?\u2019 asked Father R, holding up what looked like a bendy grey banana.\u201d In July 1996, I sent my first email \u201call on my own\u201d: \u201cThis,\u201d I marvelled, \u201ccould become an addictive device. [My colleague] and I spent the morning pinging simpering messages to each other across the desk like toddlers with toy phones, but they take up to an hour to arrive so I shall still prefer faxes.\u201d</p> <p>In the privacy of a diary, ego can take precedence over world events. Wars raged, governments came and went while I focused on domestic headlines. \u201cToday, I threw out the old Boden catalogue,\u201d began 20 January 2009. \u201cBarack Obama was inaugurated president also, so one had a vague sense of historic-ness as one flossed and hoovered, but the former event seemed to me more significant!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s never too late to start a journal and a life is never too dull to record. As the years pass and memory fades, I find it a comfort to know that I can dip at will into childhood or child-rearing and that milestones are preserved. I imagine my future self in a care home, faculties slipping, reliving my first property purchase: \u201cI examined my feelings at being a flat owner, but it didn\u2019t seem real. I must buy some hyacinths and cats.\u201d</p> <p>My first date: \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t said my beer tasted of pus; he must now think I suck boils!\u201d</p> <p>My first born: \u201cAll of a sudden E was holding a large, pink, alert baby of a size quite unfeasible given the manner of exit. It didn\u2019t seem remotely real that this was mine.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a point when it dawned on me that life is its own story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I feel that if I were to read from the first entry to the last, I might find an answer to a question I can\u2019t articulate. But time travel can become unhealthily consuming so I do it sparingly. The past still lives on in those pages and I can feel it closing over me if I linger there.</p> <p>In lockdown, I read every day of my university years. It was like reading a novel about someone else. I read in suspense of predicaments I no longer recalled and of dramas whose endings I\u2019d forgotten. Unremembered griefs were disinterred; dormant grievances rekindled. Long-lost friends jived to Abba in my student room and long-dead voices spoke again. When I closed the volumes, I emerged blinking into a different century, a different home and a different family and marvelled at the chain of successive days that had brought me here.</p> <p>But some things are constant. It\u2019s simultaneously reassuring and dispiriting that I remain recognisably the same me from 40 years ago. I continue to transcribe my likes at the front of each diary and jacket potatoes and graveyards reliably top the list. I remain faithful to Doris Day and still wear a red beret.</p> <p>It\u2019s a weighty business recording a life, yet it\u2019s taught me not to take myself too seriously. When painful moments are written down I can more easily let them go. Seeing life as a story with an unknown number of chapters left to write is both exciting and daunting. My children are already alarmed at the space my life will take up on their shelves when it\u2019s over, but I plan to chronicle the days until I can no longer hold a pen. The only part of the story I\u2019ll never get to write is the ending. </p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cHello! I said to myself today that if I do five handstands and flip over it will be an excellent year and I did!\u201d Thus, unceremoniously, began the 41-volume (and counting) story of my life. It was 1984 and I was 14, fumbling through adolescence in a scarlet beret. My likes, according to a list on the front page, included jacket potatoes and graveyards. My new year resolutions were to \u201csee how long I can go without cake\u201d and \u201cimprove my character.\u201d I haven\u2019t missed a day\u2019s entry since that 1 January. My past crams two bookshelves in rows of page-a-day journals. It\u2019s startling how little four decades seems when it\u2019s represented by slim, stacked spines. I have little idea of the tales they tell. Most of the entries have lain unread since I wrote them. Yet every morning, I hunt down my fountain pen (life must be recorded in a pen that takes itself seriously!) and write up the previous day. If ever I were to miss one, it would seem it had never happened; if my diaries were lost, I\u2019d feel my foundations had buckled. Journalling is a chore and a panacea, and yet I still can\u2019t fathom why I do it. There are many reasons, according to Fiona Courage, director of the Mass Observation Archive that collects personal records of everyday life in the UK. \u201cSome people want to leave something of themselves to posterity,\u201d she says. \u201cSome find it therapeutic. Virginia Woolf\u2019s diaries were a way of practising her writing.\u201d Courage says that the habit soared during the Covid lockdowns as people realised that they were living through history. \u201cDiaries give you the ability to distil your experiences and make sense of them,\u201d she says. \u201cFor historians they are priceless as they record social trends, layers and details that wouldn\u2019t make it into the history books. They plug a gap in the everyday.\u201d I had no inkling of what I\u2019d started when I recorded that first New Year\u2019s Day. My mother, a local historian, had nagged me for years to keep a diary so that future generations might learn what a 20th-century teen did for fun and ate for dinner. It was more an urge to write that motivated me to begin. I did not, I had sadly discovered, have a novel in me. There was a point, I like to think, when it dawned on me that life is its own story. A series of chapters, an evolving cast of characters, a thickening plot and an unguessed ending. Those future generations will have a very misleading idea of the 20th-century teen. Doris Day provided the soundtrack of my youth. My recreation was climbing trees. While classmates danced at discos, I was in bed with Anne of Green Gables. Adolescent passion passed me by entirely. My heart was broken by the deaths of prewar film stars, announced in lurid felt tip in the page margins, rather than boys. Over the years, the entries evolved from a record of school lessons and domestic routines to confessional and reportage. And I can chart my startled ageing: \u201cI\u2019m much too young to be so old so soon.\u201d I marvelled on my 21st birthday. On my 30th: \u201cMy face is lumpen, my body stale and my hair like tinned sardines. Feel every inch of 30.\u201d When 40 arrived: \u201cMy haemorrhoids are growing and my brain is shrinking. However, I am quite contented to be 40, if a little awed by my antiquity. I have always known that middle age would suit me and feel qualified now to march about in large hats berating miscreants.\u201d Now, when I look back on them, those volumes do read like a story. A chronicled life seems more like a plot with a sense of direction than a puzzle of random events. The darkest times \u2013 the night my mother was run over and the long years of her recovery; two unexpected redundancies \u2013 are, reading back, no longer isolated intrusions, but part of a developing narrative. I can read the chapters with a God-like omniscience. I\u2019ll know, if I follow that misfit teenager through four years of school, how things turned out. Which hopes came good, which friendships lasted; how, now and then, foes became benefactors. I could trace how becoming a university sacristan at 20 to please a dishy chaplain began a chain of events that led, seven years later, to my husband. Or, further back, how a crush on my new German teacher at 14 inspired me to study German at university where I encountered that dishy chaplain. I know that the self that celebrated the arrival of 1996 as a sorry singleton (\u201cWhile the others waltzed, J and I washed up and reflected mournfully on our unloved state. It\u2019s a condition that has landed us the worst bedroom behind the wellington boot depot. No one brings us tea in bed and no one dances to the Pogues with us\u201d) would meet at a ceilidh, before the year was out, the man I was to marry: \u201cI found myself paired with a priest. I was instructed to \u2018grab his left\u2019 and do a Doozy Doo. He kept coming back for more, so we \u2018stripped the willow\u2019 successfully together and later I found myself contemplating the pros and cons of marriage to a curate.\u201d And I can confirm that five handstands and a flip ensured that 1984 was \u201cnot at all bad, despite Orwell\u2019s ominous predictions.\u201d You pay more attention to the world when you know you\u2019ll be writing it up. I pen character sketches of strangers I meet \u2013 a pony-tailed sheet metalworker from Avonmouth who revered Prokofiev, the substantial matron in a waiting room \u201cwho described to me her knicker situation\u201d. I want to do justice even to the dullest day because life is a privilege and the mundane of today will be tomorrow\u2019s history. I recorded my first sight of a mobile phone, wielded from a pulpit as a spiritual aid, in 1985: \u201c\u2018Can anyone tell me what this is?\u2019 asked Father R, holding up what looked like a bendy grey banana.\u201d In July 1996, I sent my first email \u201call on my own\u201d: \u201cThis,\u201d I marvelled, \u201ccould become an addictive device. [My colleague] and I spent the morning pinging simpering messages to each other across the desk like toddlers with toy phones, but they take up to an hour to arrive so I shall still prefer faxes.\u201d In the privacy of a diary, ego can take precedence over world events. Wars raged, governments came and went while I focused on domestic headlines. \u201cToday, I threw out the old Boden catalogue,\u201d began 20 January 2009. \u201cBarack Obama was inaugurated president also, so one had a vague sense of historic-ness as one flossed and hoovered, but the former event seemed to me more significant!\u201d It\u2019s never too late to start a journal and a life is never too dull to record. As the years pass and memory fades, I find it a comfort to know that I can dip at will into childhood or child-rearing and that milestones are preserved. I imagine my future self in a care home, faculties slipping, reliving my first property purchase: \u201cI examined my feelings at being a flat owner, but it didn\u2019t seem real. I must buy some hyacinths and cats.\u201d My first date: \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t said my beer tasted of pus; he must now think I suck boils!\u201d My first born: \u201cAll of a sudden E was holding a large, pink, alert baby of a size quite unfeasible given the manner of exit. It didn\u2019t seem remotely real that this was mine.\u201d I feel that if I were to read from the first entry to the last, I might find an answer to a question I can\u2019t articulate. But time travel can become unhealthily consuming so I do it sparingly. The past still lives on in those pages and I can feel it closing over me if I linger there. In lockdown, I read every day of my university years. It was like reading a novel about someone else. I read in suspense of predicaments I no longer recalled and of dramas whose endings I\u2019d forgotten. Unremembered griefs were disinterred; dormant grievances rekindled. Long-lost friends jived to Abba in my student room and long-dead voices spoke again. When I closed the volumes, I emerged blinking into a different century, a different home and a different family and marvelled at the chain of successive days that had brought me here. But some things are constant. It\u2019s simultaneously reassuring and dispiriting that I remain recognisably the same me from 40 years ago. I continue to transcribe my likes at the front of each diary and jacket potatoes and graveyards reliably top the list. I remain faithful to Doris Day and still wear a red beret. It\u2019s a weighty business recording a life, yet it\u2019s taught me not to take myself too seriously. When painful moments are written down I can more easily let them go. Seeing life as a story with an unknown number of chapters left to write is both exciting and daunting. My children are already alarmed at the space my life will take up on their shelves when it\u2019s over, but I plan to chronicle the days until I can no longer hold a pen. The only part of the story I\u2019ll never get to write is the ending.",

They had removed the asphyxiating presence of KL Rahul, but Devdutt Padikkal kept up the squeeze. Jaiswal had raised his ton with an uppercut six but otherwise was happy to keep playing percentages. Sure, Australia had the brief benefit of a new ball, but the \u00adovernight lead of 218 might already have been enough, so 321 by lunch looked to have moved the target towards impossibility.</p> <p>When Padikkal edged Josh Hazlewood to slip first ball after the break, the clock and the sun had moved past 1pm.

      "bodyText": "Cricket probably doesn\u2019t owe Virat Kohli anything. It has given him riches beyond imagination, influence beyond reason, recognition that has built into idolatry. But then, he has given cricket riches, both in the literal cash churned from his name and the intangible of what his story has added to the game. So if the game owed him anything, perhaps it was a lucky break, one generous chance at a century to ease the tension of a lean 18 months without one. Walking out with India two wickets down, 321 runs ahead, with Yashasvi Jaiswal immaculately set on 141 and Australia already wheezing, the game delivered one. The third day of this first Test saw the real Perth appear. Not the mild impostor of the two days prior, with their gentle temperatures and occasional cloud. By the middle of day three, even in the shade, the heat buffeted up against you like a herd of cattle jostling through a gate. Horrible stuff to bowl in, more horrible still for players who knew they had let a match slip with a bad batting hour of their own. When Kohli was called upon to face the second ball after lunch, the Australians were already in their 85th over. They had removed the asphyxiating presence of KL Rahul, but Devdutt Padikkal kept up the squeeze. Jaiswal had raised his ton with an uppercut six but otherwise was happy to keep playing percentages. Sure, Australia had the brief benefit of a new ball, but the overnight lead of 218 might already have been enough, so 321 by lunch looked to have moved the target towards impossibility. When Padikkal edged Josh Hazlewood to slip first ball after the break, the clock and the sun had moved past 1pm. Even with no heat in the match, there was heat in the ground: the Australians were in the middle of a frying pan. But there is always the heat of being Kohli, the player who fans most want to see succeed. There is the want, the expectation.

What many failed to address, throughout the intense and crammed days of negotiating, was that supplying this money \u2013 which will go towards shifting low-income countries to a low-carbon economy, and helping them cope with the impacts of extreme weather \u2013 is very much in the interests of rich countries themselves.</p> <p>Developing countries face economic losses of more than $500bn a year from the effects of extreme weather, which is likely to push at least an extra 100 million people into poverty by 2030, according to estimates from the World Bank.</p> <p>In that context, $1.3tn a year \u2013 that will not only stem those losses and prevent decades of progress in lifting people out of poverty to be reversed, but also reduce future greenhouse gas emissions and help the world limit global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/19/it-is-feasible-climate-finance-wont-burden-rich-countries-say-economists\">represents something of a bargain</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis number is not of an irrational order of magnitude,\u201d Achim Steiner, the administrator of the UN Development Programme, told the Guardian. \u201cTo give a little bit of context, $3tn will be invested globally in energy infrastructure this year. So when we say $1.3tn, that is not something out of this world, when it would allow a world of 8 billion people to accelerate and raise their levels of ambition in decarbonising their economies.\u201d</p> <p>The goal of $1.3tn comes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/14/wealthy-countries-must-invest-1tn-a-year-by-2030-for-climate\">estimates made by leading economists in the Independent High Level Expert Group</a> (IHLEG). They found that about $2.4tn would be needed each year by 2035 to enable developing countries, excluding China, to cut their greenhouse gases and adapt their infrastructure to the impacts of extreme weather. But most of this will come from developing countries\u2019 existing domestic budgets.</p> <p>\u201cDeveloping countries are actually investing hundreds of billions of dollars a year already from their own taxpayers\u2019 revenue, in climate action,\u201d Steiner told the Guardian in an interview at Cop29 before the developed country offer was put on the table. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt or harm anyone on the other side of the table to acknowledge that.\u201d</p> <p>The IHLEG also suggested that about half of the $1.3tn could come from the private sector, with about $300bn needed from developed country budgets. Amar Bhattacharya, the group\u2019s executive secretary, said developed countries could find this money from their budgets without difficulty. \u201cIs it feasible? The answer is absolutely yes. Is it politically challenging? The answer is also yes. But I do believe it can be done.\u201d</p> <p>Why, then, was setting a goal of $1.3tn so hard, and why did it take so long?</p> <p>Although it was the 29th Cop (\u201cconference of the parties\u201d, under the UN framework convention on climate change) in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/11/cop-climate-change-conference-30-years-highlights-lowlights\">near-annual series stretching back to 1992</a>, this summit was set a task that no other previous meeting had attempted.</p> <p>Negotiating on money has never been a Cop issue. Previous meetings have focused on cuts to greenhouse gases, and meeting scientific goals. The previous finance goal, of delivering $100bn a year by 2020 \u2013 not met until 2022 \u2013 was set without real negotiation at the Copenhagen Cop in 2009.</p> <p>There is not even any clearcut definition of what constitutes appropriate forms or uses for this finance, within the UN process. \u201cIf we tried to define climate finance, we would be here until 2100,\u201d one negotiator joked.</p> <p>This meant there was no clear template for how the negotiations should proceed. The fact that the offer of finance from the developed world came so late in the process partly reflected that difficulty \u2013 developed countries said it was because they needed to have the right framework assured before they could make promises of cash.</p> <p>Some explained why the \u201cnew collective quantified goal\u201d on climate finance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/16/un-warns-of-economic-carnage-if-g20-leaders-cannot-agree-on-climate-finance-for-poor-countries\">was in rich countries\u2019 interests</a>. This is not charity, civil society groups said \u2013 it only begins to repay the damage rich countries have caused in burning fossil fuels, and real restitution would come to at least $5tn to $7tn a year.</p> <p>Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, said: \u201cIf I can\u2019t live because I can\u2019t farm because I don\u2019t have access to water \u2026 I\u2019m going to shift where I\u2019m living from. So the volume of climate migration will wake up those who have been slow to see that this must be a win-win.\u201d</p> <p>Though the sums might seem large, the money promised is not even all that it seems. On paper, $300bn appears to be a tripling of the current finance pledge of $100bn a year by 2020. But that pledge was made in 2009 and inflation has since eroded the buying power of the dollar.</p> <p>Developed countries made clear that updating the $300bn pledge with inflation was not part of the plan. The offer was made on the same terms as the $100bn goal, the Guardian was told.</p> <p>If Cop29 was hard, it is only the beginning of the process. In the coming years, developed countries will be expected to make individual pledges of climate finance to show they are ramping up their efforts to meet the goal. Getting those proposals to add up is likely to be a whole series of equally bitter battles.</p>",

Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, said: \u201cIf I can\u2019t live because I can\u2019t farm because I don\u2019t have access to water \u2026 I\u2019m going to shift where I\u2019m living from. So the volume of climate migration will wake up those who have been slow to see that this must be a win-win.\u201d Though the sums might seem large, the money promised is not even all that it seems. On paper, $300bn appears to be a tripling of the current finance pledge of $100bn a year by 2020. But that pledge was made in 2009 and inflation has since eroded the buying power of the dollar. Developed countries made clear that updating the $300bn pledge with inflation was not part of the plan. The offer was made on the same terms as the $100bn goal, the Guardian was told. If Cop29 was hard, it is only the beginning of the process. In the coming years, developed countries will be expected to make individual pledges of climate finance to show they are ramping up their efforts to meet the goal. Getting those proposals to add up is likely to be a whole series of equally bitter battles.",

      "body": "<p>Gurpreet Singh Johal is sitting in a London hotel lobby the night before he is due to meet David Lammy.</p> <p>He recalls in his soft Scottish burr that this will be the fifth UK foreign secretary he will have seen in his quest to secure the release of his brother, Jagtar, who has been detained in Indian prisons for seven years, with the case making virtually no progress.</p> <p>He can rate each foreign secretary\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. Jeremy Hunt, whom he met with Jagtar\u2019s wife, \u201ctook me seriously, and registered at that stage, after two years in jail, my brother had not had a fair trial. But he did not take it beyond that.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic Raab \u201cwould not have a meeting. He just wanted a trade deal.\u201d Liz Truss \u201cwas sort of forced to have a meeting in 2022, and then she became prime minister and did nothing\u201d.</p> <p>And then: \u201cJames Cleverly \u2013 it was the worst meeting of the lot \u2013 since all he said was that he would do everything in Jagtar\u2019s best interest. But he said he would not call for his release. I asked him how it could be in my brother\u2019s best interest for his government not to call for his release?\u201d</p> <p>The argument of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office was that critical comments on the domestic laws of another state might limit the detained Briton\u2019s consular access.</p> <p>But this experience \u2013 a cycle of hope, then hopes dashed, and repeat \u2013 is familiar to other families of those who have been detained abroad.</p> <p>The Foreign Office and British consular services are there to help incarcerated Britons and their relatives. Yet many complain of feeling isolated and unsupported, forced to contend with punitive or highly politicised justice systems, a lack of transparency, dire prison conditions including solitary confinement, or no access to lawyers.</p> <p>Now a number of relatives, as well as campaigners and MPs, are calling for the Labour government to up its game and usher in a step-change in the handling of hostage situations and other cases of Britons unlawfully held overseas.</p> <h2>Cultural defensiveness</h2>    <p>The case of 37-year-old Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton in Scotland, is particularly galling. He was arrested in connection with targeted killing cases in Punjab in 2016 and 2017 \u2013 allegedly part of a conspiracy by the Khalistan Liberation Force, an organisation that Indian police say he was a member of.</p> <p>Reprieve, the charity supporting him, has insisted the charges are based on a false confession he gave after being tortured with electricity by police, who are also alleged to have brought petrol into the cell and threatened to burn him alive.</p> <p>For his brother, the exchanges he had with Cleverly \u2013 the penultimate in a run of Conservative foreign secretaries involved in the case \u2013 represented a step backwards ince Boris Johnson, as prime minister in 2022, had said his brother was arbitrarily detained.</p> <p>Gurpreet gives credit to the former prime minister David Cameron, the final Tory to hold the role of foreign secretary, who met him in Scotland. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018The one thing I do not understand is if they have got evidence against your brother, why are they not doing anything? What benefit do they gain?\u2019 And I explained keeping him in jail is a punishment in itself, and that is how the system works.</p> <p>\u201cIt took Cameron to understand that, despite there being a legal case against Jagtar, that if India wanted, they could release him tomorrow and send him back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about political will. None of the other foreign secretaries understood that point, but he did. But then the [UK general] election intervened. I genuinely believe he would have done more.\u201d</p> <p>He recalls that, lower down the ministerial ladder, Rory Stewart as a Foreign Office minister promised in 2017 that \u201cextreme action\u201d would be taken if claims that a British national had been tortured proved to be true. Two months later Stewart switched departments, becoming prisons minister.</p> <p>\u201cFrankly, Mark Field [another Foreign Office minister] was the best. He was very honest and candid in our first meeting. He said: \u2018Keep up the pressure because the more pressure you put on, the more we will do. Without the pressure we won\u2019t do anything.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the churn in ministers and what can seem like arbitrary inconsistencies in their approach, but the constant swirl of case workers. It makes Johal ensure that everything is in writing so there is a paper trail about what has been promised. \u201cThe consular staff often want to have a conversation, but I say I want it in writing to keep them on point,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Other families of high-profile detainees also complain of a cultural defensiveness and a sense that other unspoken interests are always in play.</p> <p>In Jagtar\u2019s case there have even been doubts over whether the whole of the government machine was on his side.</p> <p>Multiple attempts were made to remove his wife from the UK, and some Sikh activists who had campaigned for his release were subject to dawn raids by counter-terrorism police. The UK has never confirmed whether British intelligence acted as an informant to the Indian government in this case.</p> <h2>\u2019They let him down\u2019</h2>    <p>Richard Ratcliffe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/24/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffes-husband-on-second-hunger-strike-in-effort-to-free-her\">who held two hunger strikes</a> to secure the return of his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Iran after six years, said that trying to discover what lay at the centre of the government\u2019s thinking was like peeling an onion.</p> <p>It took his own detective work and a tip-off from two foreign diplomats from Oman and Switzerland, rather than a UK Foreign Office disclosure, to realise that a \u00a3450m debt owed by the UK to Iran was the barrier to securing her freedom.</p> <p>Repeated letters sent by his solicitors asking what was being done about the debt were left not just unanswered but often unacknowledged. The government refused to accept the self-evident link between the debt and her detention.</p> <p>Matthew Hedges, a PhD student detained by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in May 2018 on suspicion of being a spy and released after seven months, always felt the UK\u2019s relations with a close Gulf trading partner inhibited the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Freedom of Information Act requests revealed that the Foreign Office knew within hours of his arrest that he was being held on national security grounds, yet his case was not immediately elevated.</p> <p>A rare report by the parliamentary ombudsman in 2023 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/04/foreign-office-apologises-over-handling-of-matthew-hedges-torture-case\">ordered the Foreign Office to apologise to him</a>. It found Hedges \u201ctrusted them to help him and they let him down. Officials failed to notice signs of torture, failed to intervene and failed to help.\u201d</p> <p>The Foreign Office made many requests to see him in jail in Dubai. He was visited by the officials three times, the first time after two months, and once on the day after he had signed his confession papers.</p> <p>Hedges feels he survived because of the choices he took, including the confession. \u201cIt potentially endangered my life. It certainly endangered the lives of others, who I know were picked up by state security authorities, either in the UK or abroad in Egypt, in Jordan, in Russia, and in Yemen,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to reduce the impact on others, but I was also trying, quite literally, to survive.\u201d He is now pursuing the UAE in the French courts.</p> <h2>\u2019Textbook case\u2019</h2>    <p>Another case in point is Alaa Abd el-Fattah, the British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist and writer. He was to have completed his five-year prison sentence on 29 September this year but Egyptian officials decided not to count the two years he had spent in pre-trial detention. Egypt does not recognise him as a British national.</p> <p>John Casson, the former ambassador to Egypt, says Abd el-Fattah\u2019s detention has been \u201ca textbook case\u201d of how to do all the wrong things to put effective pressure on the Egyptian government.</p> <p>He said the UK sacrifices leverage through \u201cour culture of non-offence, not upsetting people and being seen to say the right thing\u201d, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t think about how to use access and political conversations for leverage.\u201d</p> <p>The Egyptian foreign ministry is \u201ca pantomime designed to keep foreigners away from the real conversations\u201d. The key levers \u2013 British intelligence and the defence industry \u2013 operate largely independently of UK diplomats, and are not used to secure releases.</p> <p>Casson pointed out: \u201cHere we have got Britain\u2019s most fundamental right under the Vienna convention of diplomatic access being denied. We are not being treated as a serious country and allowed access to the British national in prison, and the Egyptian ambassador in London is welcomed cordially.\u201d</p> <p>While in opposition Lammy, as MP for Abd el-Fattah\u2019s sister Mona Seif, called for reciprocal measures to be applied to the Egyptian embassy in London, saying: \u201cUK officials in Egypt have no consular access to this British national and you\u2019ve got to ask why is it that the Egyptian ambassador has access to Whitehall in those circumstances \u2013 I think it should stop.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert, an Australian-British academic who like Zaghari-Ratcliffe was held in Iran, did not receive any communication from the consular sections of either the British or Australian governments until after four months of interrogation in Iran.</p> <h2>Arm\u2019s length</h2>    <p>Of course, securing the release of a Briton in jail is not just a matter of political will. The era of simply demanding that an authoritarian government, ally or foe, should release a British detainee, with the doors to the jail then springing open, have long gone. It takes tact, patience and understanding the motives and weaknesses of the captor.</p> <p>Many of the cases solved privately are by definition hidden from view. Each case has its unique ingredients, and there are many cases. The Foreign Office says in any given year it supports about 20-25,000 British nationals and their families, including about 4-5,000 detained or arrested abroad. Spotting the high value cases early is key.</p> <p>Nor is the Foreign Office\u2019s task made easier by the strict rule that ransoms will not be paid by the UK.</p> <p>But nevertheless, too many times families feel they have not been involved in a shared endeavour, but instead are treated as someone to be kept at arm\u2019s length, just one factor among many to be weighed when shaping the bilateral relationship with a country.</p> <p>Bland reassurances that an issue has been raised by a minister on such a date on an overseas visit do not assuage the agony of the families or their sense of burning injustice.</p> <h2>\u2018Counterproductive\u2019</h2>    <p>One of the most controversial issues is publicity, and Whitehall\u2019s bias towards quiet diplomacy.</p> <p>The Labour peer and human rights specialist Helena Kennedy recalls after contacting the Iran desk early in the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case that she was personally visited by officials and told not to go public. Similarly the Foreign Office sought to disrupt Hedges\u2019 efforts to go public, the foreign affairs select committee concluded.</p> <p>Johal says: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to other families and they say Foreign Office advice is always: \u2018Do not go public. It won\u2019t be beneficial to you.\u2019 Whereas you often didn\u2019t have a choice.</p> <p>\u201cAnd genuinely, I believe if I didn\u2019t go loud, my brother would be dead. I was worried he would have a fatal \u2018encounter\u2019 with the police. The torture wouldn\u2019t have stopped. It could have cost him his life.\u201d</p> <p>The quiet diplomacy route forms part of a pattern of refusing to use tools at the Foreign Office\u2019s disposal for fear of damaging bilateral relationships.</p> <p>In its <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/40750/documents/198593/default/\">report entitled Stolen Years</a>, the foreign affairs select committee found: \u201cThe Foreign Office has a policy of not commenting on, or interfering with, a foreign state\u2019s legal system.</p> <p>\u201cFor instance the evidence suggests that the existence of an opinion from the UN working group on arbitrary detention that a British national is illegally detained makes little or no tangible difference to the way the [Foreign Office] approaches resolving that case. This is counterproductive and risks undermining an important tool, as well as the government\u2019s commitment to a rules-based international order.\u201d</p> <p>At one point, ministers became aware that the Foreign Office\u2019s handling of consular cases might be part of a cultural pattern, so in 2019 Hunt appointed a senior diplomat, Dame Judith Macgregor, to conduct a published but largely internal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/15/ministers-often-kept-in-dark-over-britons-held-abroad-inquiry-finds\">review of how the department dealt with such issues</a>.</p> <p>The top line finding that \u201cno systematic attempt existed to protect the bilateral relationship at the expense of the individual\u201d disguised her sharp criticism.</p> <p>It found: \u201cAmongst families there was an admission of a shared belief \u2013 albeit with different levels of acceptance \u2013 that the Foreign Office was overly sparing with what was revealed to them and when, which had undermined their trust \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>The department could move from seeking to \u201cmanage and contain\u201d complex cases to setting out clearer plans to resolve them. Since then the foreign affairs select committee has produced a damning report informed by the experience of families.</p> <h2>Specialist unit?</h2>    <p>So what is the solution? When in opposition, the twofold solution that the Labour party alighted on was a legal right to consular access, included in the Labour manifesto, and a US-style special envoy for hostages, dedicated to pursuing these cases.</p> <p>In the US, one of the few Trump appointments kept on by the Biden administration, Roger Carstens, is seen as a success as the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.</p> <p>Carstens has clearly been effective, and the existence of a specialist unit \u201cwould be very reassuring to those who didn\u2019t know where to go and who to talk to, or how to manage those things\u201d, Lady Kennedy said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Foreign Office will say it does not need specialist units and everyone is trained to handle consular cases, but there are specialist units dealing with atrocity crimes and sexual violence in conflict.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is a reticence in this country to fall out with the people that we do business with.\u201d</p> <p>Johal encapsulates the level of frustration for those who feel trapped in a nightmare. \u201cI was born and brought up here. I expected my country to look after me, and it\u2019s not happened,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been campaigning for the last seven years, not just against the Indian government, but for the UK government to do a lot more.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s totally unfair, because other countries like America go out of their way to help the citizens, whereas the UK government has not. I genuinely believe it is because they put a trade deal first.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cSome people in the community feel like I have got as far because I am a lawyer. But I was never trained to do this. I have had to learn as I go along. Too often you feel like you are someone to be handled, not confided in. I just have to hope with Lammy it is different.\u201d</p>",

But this experience \u2013 a cycle of hope, then hopes dashed, and repeat \u2013 is familiar to other families of those who have been detained abroad. The Foreign Office and British consular services are there to help incarcerated Britons and their relatives. Yet many complain of feeling isolated and unsupported, forced to contend with punitive or highly politicised justice systems, a lack of transparency, dire prison conditions including solitary confinement, or no access to lawyers. Now a number of relatives, as well as campaigners and MPs, are calling for the Labour government to up its game and usher in a step-change in the handling of hostage situations and other cases of Britons unlawfully held overseas. Cultural defensiveness The case of 37-year-old Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton in Scotland, is particularly galling. He was arrested in connection with targeted killing cases in Punjab in 2016 and 2017 \u2013 allegedly part of a conspiracy by the Khalistan Liberation Force, an organisation that Indian police say he was a member of. Reprieve, the charity supporting him, has insisted the charges are based on a false confession he gave after being tortured with electricity by police, who are also alleged to have brought petrol into the cell and threatened to burn him alive. For his brother, the exchanges he had with Cleverly \u2013 the penultimate in a run of Conservative foreign secretaries involved in the case \u2013 represented a step backwards ince Boris Johnson, as prime minister in 2022, had said his brother was arbitrarily detained. Gurpreet gives credit to the former prime minister David Cameron, the final Tory to hold the role of foreign secretary, who met him in Scotland. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018The one thing I do not understand is if they have got evidence against your brother, why are they not doing anything?

Other families of high-profile detainees also complain of a cultural defensiveness and a sense that other unspoken interests are always in play. In Jagtar\u2019s case there have even been doubts over whether the whole of the government machine was on his side. Multiple attempts were made to remove his wife from the UK, and some Sikh activists who had campaigned for his release were subject to dawn raids by counter-terrorism police. The UK has never confirmed whether British intelligence acted as an informant to the Indian government in this case. \u2019They let him down\u2019 Richard Ratcliffe, who held two hunger strikes to secure the return of his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Iran after six years, said that trying to discover what lay at the centre of the government\u2019s thinking was like peeling an onion. It took his own detective work and a tip-off from two foreign diplomats from Oman and Switzerland, rather than a UK Foreign Office disclosure, to realise that a \u00a3450m debt owed by the UK to Iran was the barrier to securing her freedom. Repeated letters sent by his solicitors asking what was being done about the debt were left not just unanswered but often unacknowledged. The government refused to accept the self-evident link between the debt and her detention. Matthew Hedges, a PhD student detained by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in May 2018 on suspicion of being a spy and released after seven months, always felt the UK\u2019s relations with a close Gulf trading partner inhibited the Foreign Office. Freedom of Information Act requests revealed that the Foreign Office knew within hours of his arrest that he was being held on national security grounds, yet his case was not immediately elevated. A rare report by the parliamentary ombudsman in 2023 ordered the Foreign Office to apologise to him. It found Hedges \u201ctrusted them to help him and they let him down. Officials failed to notice signs of torture, failed to intervene and failed to help.\u201d The Foreign Office made many requests to see him in jail in Dubai. He was visited by the officials three times, the first time after two months, and once on the day after he had signed his confession papers. Hedges feels he survived because of the choices he took, including the confession. \u201cIt potentially endangered my life. It certainly endangered the lives of others, who I know were picked up by state security authorities, either in the UK or abroad in Egypt, in Jordan, in Russia, and in Yemen,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to reduce the impact on others, but I was also trying, quite literally, to survive.\u201d He is now pursuing the UAE in the French courts. \u2019Textbook case\u2019 Another case in point is Alaa Abd el-Fattah, the British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist and writer. He was to have completed his five-year prison sentence on 29 September this year but Egyptian officials decided not to count the two years he had spent in pre-trial detention. Egypt does not recognise him as a British national. John Casson, the former ambassador to Egypt, says Abd el-Fattah\u2019s detention has been \u201ca textbook case\u201d of how to do all the wrong things to put effective pressure on the Egyptian government. He said the UK sacrifices leverage through \u201cour culture of non-offence, not upsetting people and being seen to say the right thing\u201d, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t think about how to use access and political conversations for leverage.\u201d The Egyptian foreign ministry is \u201ca pantomime designed to keep foreigners away from the real conversations\u201d. The key levers \u2013 British intelligence and the defence industry \u2013 operate largely independently of UK diplomats, and are not used to secure releases. Casson pointed out: \u201cHere we have got Britain\u2019s most fundamental right under the Vienna convention of diplomatic access being denied. We are not being treated as a serious country and allowed access to the British national in prison, and the Egyptian ambassador in London is welcomed cordially.\u201d While in opposition Lammy, as MP for Abd el-Fattah\u2019s sister Mona Seif, called for reciprocal measures to be applied to the Egyptian embassy in London, saying: \u201cUK officials in Egypt have no consular access to this British national and you\u2019ve got to ask why is it that the Egyptian ambassador has access to Whitehall in those circumstances \u2013 I think it should stop.\u201d Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert, an Australian-British academic who like Zaghari-Ratcliffe was held in Iran, did not receive any communication from the consular sections of either the British or Australian governments until after four months of interrogation in Iran. Arm\u2019s length Of course, securing the release of a Briton in jail is not just a matter of political will. The era of simply demanding that an authoritarian government, ally or foe, should release a British detainee, with the doors to the jail then springing open, have long gone. It takes tact, patience and understanding the motives and weaknesses of the captor. Many of the cases solved privately are by definition hidden from view. Each case has its unique ingredients, and there are many cases. The Foreign Office says in any given year it supports about 20-25,000 British nationals and their families, including about 4-5,000 detained or arrested abroad. Spotting the high value cases early is key. Nor is the Foreign Office\u2019s task made easier by the strict rule that ransoms will not be paid by the UK. But nevertheless, too many times families feel they have not been involved in a shared endeavour, but instead are treated as someone to be kept at arm\u2019s length, just one factor among many to be weighed when shaping the bilateral relationship with a country. Bland reassurances that an issue has been raised by a minister on such a date on an overseas visit do not assuage the agony of the families or their sense of burning injustice. \u2018Counterproductive\u2019 One of the most controversial issues is publicity, and Whitehall\u2019s bias towards quiet diplomacy. The Labour peer and human rights specialist Helena Kennedy recalls after contacting the Iran desk early in the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case that she was personally visited by officials and told not to go public. Similarly the Foreign Office sought to disrupt Hedges\u2019 efforts to go public, the foreign affairs select committee concluded. Johal says: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to other families and they say Foreign Office advice is always: \u2018Do not go public. It won\u2019t be beneficial to you.\u2019 Whereas you often didn\u2019t have a choice. \u201cAnd genuinely, I believe if I didn\u2019t go loud, my brother would be dead. I was worried he would have a fatal \u2018encounter\u2019 with the police. The torture wouldn\u2019t have stopped. It could have cost him his life.\u201d The quiet diplomacy route forms part of a pattern of refusing to use tools at the Foreign Office\u2019s disposal for fear of damaging bilateral relationships. In its report entitled Stolen Years, the foreign affairs select committee found: \u201cThe Foreign Office has a policy of not commenting on, or interfering with, a foreign state\u2019s legal system. \u201cFor instance the evidence suggests that the existence of an opinion from the UN working group on arbitrary detention that a British national is illegally detained makes little or no tangible difference to the way the [Foreign Office] approaches resolving that case. This is counterproductive and risks undermining an important tool, as well as the government\u2019s commitment to a rules-based international order.\u201d At one point, ministers became aware that the Foreign Office\u2019s handling of consular cases might be part of a cultural pattern, so in 2019 Hunt appointed a senior diplomat, Dame Judith Macgregor, to conduct a published but largely internal review of how the department dealt with such issues. The top line finding that \u201cno systematic attempt existed to protect the bilateral relationship at the expense of the individual\u201d disguised her sharp criticism. It found: \u201cAmongst families there was an admission of a shared belief \u2013 albeit with different levels of acceptance \u2013 that the Foreign Office was overly sparing with what was revealed to them and when, which had undermined their trust \u2026 \u201d The department could move from seeking to \u201cmanage and contain\u201d complex cases to setting out clearer plans to resolve them. Since then the foreign affairs select committee has produced a damning report informed by the experience of families. Specialist unit? So what is the solution? When in opposition, the twofold solution that the Labour party alighted on was a legal right to consular access, included in the Labour manifesto, and a US-style special envoy for hostages, dedicated to pursuing these cases. In the US, one of the few Trump appointments kept on by the Biden administration, Roger Carstens, is seen as a success as the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. Carstens has clearly been effective, and the existence of a specialist unit \u201cwould be very reassuring to those who didn\u2019t know where to go and who to talk to, or how to manage those things\u201d, Lady Kennedy said. \u201cThe Foreign Office will say it does not need specialist units and everyone is trained to handle consular cases, but there are specialist units dealing with atrocity crimes and sexual violence in conflict.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is a reticence in this country to fall out with the people that we do business with.\u201d Johal encapsulates the level of frustration for those who feel trapped in a nightmare. \u201cI was born and brought up here. I expected my country to look after me, and it\u2019s not happened,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been campaigning for the last seven years, not just against the Indian government, but for the UK government to do a lot more. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s totally unfair, because other countries like America go out of their way to help the citizens, whereas the UK government has not. I genuinely believe it is because they put a trade deal first.\u201d He added: \u201cSome people in the community feel like I have got as far because I am a lawyer. But I was never trained to do this. I have had to learn as I go along. Too often you feel like you are someone to be handled, not confided in. I just have to hope with Lammy it is different.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Musicals used to be associated with glee club kids more likely to be wearing jazz shoes than anything cutting edge from the catwalks. But with the film version of Wicked \u2013 which was released this weekend and was expected to take more than $100m (\u00a380m) at the US box office alone \u2013 promoted by global pop star Ariana Grande and actor Cynthia Erivo wearing Vivienne Westwood, Schiaparelli and Louis Vuitton, musicals are having a pitch-perfect style moment. Even before it opened, there was a glut of Wicked collaborations across skincare, haircare and hoodies \u2013 more than 400 in total, including Gap, Kipling, Crocs, H&amp;M, Claire\u2019s Accessories and Marks &amp; Spencer. Fancy London department store Liberty, with its tasteful Tudor-beamed building, has teamed up with Universal Pictures to make over its windows Wicked-style. Ryan McBryde, former artistic director at the Mercury theatre in Colchester, who has worked on many musicals, said: \u201cOz is depicted in Wicked as a kind of high-fashion, elitist society. They\u2019re all dressing in high couture.\u201d He added: \u201cIt makes perfect sense that those companies should buy into that.\u201d That a musical \u2013 albeit one in the cinema rather than on stage \u2013 is having such a jazz-hands fashion moment arguably reflects a wider trend. On Broadway, a revival of Sunset Boulevard, starring former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, has received attention for what the Washington Post called its \u201cJil Sander-chic costumes\u201d. The costumes of Cabaret at London\u2019s Kit Kat club \u2013 the leather, the lingerie \u2013 all could have seamlessly sashayed on to spring/summer 2024 catwalks. Plus, Prada and Chanel are centre stage with the new musical of The Devil Wears Prada that recently opened in London\u2019s West End. Red carpets have for a long time been fashion\u2019s best marketing tool, while costume designers use contemporary fashion as a way to connect to audiences and welcome new ones in. David Benedict, the London theatre critic for Variety, notes that \u201c[costume] designers are looking to place things in a way that people can read\u201d. Soutra Gilmour, who was the costume designer for Scherzinger\u2019s Sunset Boulevard, wants \u201cthe people on stage to reflect and speak to the people in the audience, to be of the same world, to connect through the proscenium\u201d. Clothes, she says, \u201care a great way to support that \u2013 it\u2019s a language we all read very quickly\u201d. Enver Chakartash is to thank for the fashion-forward ensembles of Romeo + Juliet, now on Broadway. While it is not strictly speaking a musical, Jack Antonoff, songwriter and producer of Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter, wrote two original songs for the show. \u201cIt was important for the costumes to feel of-the-moment in terms of how young people present themselves,\u201d says Chakartash. Hence why those costumes include Ludovic de Saint Sernin and Adidas, as well as Vaquera and Salomon. For the balcony scene, they dressed Juliet in a vintage Vivienne Westwood Care Bear T-shirt. While McBryde points out that musicals \u201calways had a kind of relationship with modern fashion\u201d \u2013 he cites Coco Chanel working with Jean Cocteau in the 1920s and Halston working with Martin Scorsese on The Act with Liza Minnelli in the 1970s \u2013 he thinks that \u201cthe difference between then and now is the proliferation of imagery that you can get on the internet\u201d. Crossover between the two worlds is happening more and more: Es Devlin has designed for musicals as well as for Stormzy, Lorde, Beyonc\u00e9, Louis Vuitton and YSL. Tom Scutt, the designer responsible for the Cabaret costumes, has worked with Sam Smith. Of course some of this fashionable moment for musicals might also be down to chance. That the recent West End production of Oklahoma! felt so on trend was in part thanks to the rise of cowboycore. Still, there is a drive for modernity within musicals. \u201cEverybody wants to do a take on the show that hasn\u2019t been done before,\u201d says Chakartash. \u201cA lot of the time that leans into making it feel contemporary and relatable and also aspirational. \u201cWhen you go to Cabaret, you\u2019re like: \u2018Where can I find that seafoam-green coat that looks like [it\u2019s] straight off the Gucci runway?\u2019\u201d When you go to Wicked, you leave wanting to find emerald green, pastel pink and bubble skirts.",

He has nominated officials including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/who-is-tom-homan-trump-border-czar\">Tom Homan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/trump-appoint-stephen-miller-deputy-chief\">Stephen Miller</a>, architects of family separations at the southern border during his first term, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/18/trump-military-mass-deportation\">vowed to use the US military</a> to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>The plans include mandatory detention, potentially trapping immigrants in inhumane conditions for years as they fight deportation. The <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/how-biden-can-act-now-to-limit-trumps-mass-deportation-agenda\">American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</a> is leading an opposition effort, urging Biden to halt the current expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facilities, especially those with records of human rights abuses.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/bio/eunice-cho\">Eunice Cho</a>, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU national prison project, said Ice detention facilities \u201ccharacterised by abusive conditions, pervasive neglect and utter disregard for the dignity of people in their custody\u201d were key to Trump\u2019s logistical plan.</p> <p>Dozens of people have died in Ice detention facilities \u2013 mostly owned or operated by private prison corporations \u2013 over the past four years, according to the ACLU, and 95% of deaths would probably have been preventable had appropriate medical care been provided. Yet the Biden administration has backed new Ice detention facilities in states where they did not exist before, such as Kansas, Wyoming and Missouri.</p> <p>\u201cWe are calling on the Biden administration to take action now, in the final days of the administration, to halt any efforts to expand immigration detention and to shut down specifically abusive facilities once and for all,\u201d Cho told reporters <a href=\"https://aclu.zoom.us/rec/play/ZAV2iOJUxlanGsXzEU_qec2jNX96OQZlrZzJf3AmhtWFPDwQOpvR1kW_1LG5uirY_dS4eOWwDRhA7iX_.hb-E2VayBULc4TtS?canPlayFromShare=true&amp;from=share_recording_detail&amp;continueMode=true&amp;componentName=rec-play&amp;originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Faclu.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FMrHytVe7z9iTeo2g3EfuhmHbRFlHChiE26M18wLJzRQfwdY04oj5LdoEeTw5106k.ZskfdL0-4-9rbXAs\">on a Zoom call this week</a>. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to put down runway for the Trump administration to put in place these mass detention and deportation machines.\u201d</p> <p>She warned: \u201cWe know that the anti-immigrant policies of a second administration are going to be far more aggressive than what we saw in the first term, and mass arrest and detention is going to become perhaps the norm to create and carry out these deportation operations unless we can do all we can to put a halt to them.\u201d</p>    <p>Another crucial area for Biden to make a last stand is criminal justice. In his first term, Trump oversaw the execution of more people than the previous 10 presidents combined. Biden\u2019s attorney general, Merrick Garland, then <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-imposes-moratorium-federal-executions-orders-review\">imposed</a> a moratorium on federal executions in 2021.</p> <p>Trump has indicated his intention to resume such executions and even expand the death penalty. His nominee for attorney general, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/things-to-know-pam-bondi-eec1d16075c7debda62223b475e3977d\">Pam Bondi</a>, issued a public apology in 2013 while serving as Florida\u2019s top law enforcement officer after she sought to delay the execution of a convicted killer because it conflicted with a fundraiser for her re-election campaign.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/bio/cassandra-stubbs\">Cassandra Stubbs</a>, director of the ACLU\u2019s capital punishment project, told reporters over Zoom that Trump said \u201che will work to expand the death penalty. He\u2019s going to try to expand it to people who do not even commit killings. He\u2019s called for expanding the death penalty to his political opponents.</p> <p>\u201cBut perhaps most dangerously in Project 2025 [a policy blueprint from the Heritage Foundation thinktank] \u2013 and we believe every word of it is this \u2013 he promised to try to kill everyone on death row, and the reason why we have to believe this and take it so seriously is the record that Donald Trump left where he, in a span of six months, carried out 13 executions.\u201d</p> <p>The ACLU and other groups are therefore pressing Biden to commute the sentences of all individuals on federal death row to life in prison, fulfilling a campaign promise and preventing potential executions under Trump. Commuting \u201cis really the thing that Biden can do to make it harder for Trump to restart executions\u201d, Stubbs added.</p> <p>Pastor Brandi Slaughter, a board member of the pressure group <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyaction.org/\">Death Penalty Action</a>, told reporters this week: \u201cWe know what the next president plans to do if any prisoners are left under a sentence of death under the Biden administration. We\u2019ve been there, we\u2019ve done that.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has also received <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/4986436-president-biden-pardon-power/\">8,000 petitions for clemency from federal prisoners</a> serving non-death penalty sentences that he could either reduce or pardon. The former senator has long been criticised for his role in drawing up a 1994 crime law that led to the incarceration of thousands of Black men and women for drug offences.</p> <p>This week, members of Congress including Ayanna Pressley and James Clyburn led 64 colleagues in <a href=\"https://pressley.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-20-Letter-to-President-Biden-on-Clemency.pdf\">sending a letter</a> to Biden urging him to use his clemency power \u201cto reunite families, address longstanding injustices in our legal system and set our nation on the path toward ending mass incarceration\u201d.</p> <p>They were joined <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTw2dJlUvfI\">at a press conference</a> on Capitol Hill by Maria Garza, 50, from Illinois, a prison reform advocate who spent 12 years in a state prison. She said in an interview:<strong> </strong>\u201cThere is a sense of urgency because a lot of the people that are sitting waiting for clemency are people that have de facto life sentences that will die in prison if they don\u2019t [receive clemency]. A lot of their unjust sentencing was because of the 1994 crime bill that he was the founding father of.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/14/jonathan-wall-marijuana-legalization-maryland/\">Mitzi Wall</a>, whose 29-year-old son Jonathan is incarcerated on a seven-and-a-half-year federal cannabis charge, called on Biden to keep a campaign promise to grant clemency to more than 4,000 people in federal prison for nonviolent cannabis crimes.</p> <p>\u201cWe voted for President Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gave us hope and we\u2019re asking him to do nothing more than keep his promise.\u201d</p> <p>Wall, 63, from Maryland, added:<em> </em>\u201cPresident Biden was partly responsible for writing the 1994 crime bill that thrust families into abject poverty and pain. I know he feels bad about that and he can right that wrong with the power of the pen. I\u2019m appealing to him as a father whose son [Hunter] could very possibly be going to prison.\u201d</p> <p>In other efforts to protect civil liberties, the ACLU is recommending a moratorium on all federal government purchases of Americans\u2019 personal data without a warrant. It is also asking Congress to pass the Fourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act to prevent potential abuse of surveillance technologies under the Trump administration.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump has pledged to rescind unspent funds in Biden\u2019s landmark climate and healthcare law and stop clean-energy development projects. White House officials are working against the clock to dole out billions of dollars in grants for existing programmes to minimise Trump\u2019s ability to rescind or redirect these funds. Earlier this month, the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/big-deal-third-anniversary-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-signing-biden-harris\">announced</a> more than $3.4bn<strong> </strong>in grants for infrastructure projects across the country.</p> <p><a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller</a>, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, notes that Trump will have the power of impoundment to stall the money flowing out of the government and can order rescissions to programmes funded by Congress.</p> <p>\u201cThe singular thing that Joe Biden can do is expedite the flow of federal dollars in all the programmes,\u201d Schiller said.</p> <p>\u201cAny money that is supposed to leave the treasury to go to schools, food safety, environmental protection \u2013 anything that is not yet distributed needs to get distributed. It\u2019s like emptying literally the piggy bank before you go on a trip. President Biden needs to be literally getting as much money out the door in the hands of state, local and community organisations as he can.\u201d</p> <p>Another priority for the White House is getting Senate confirmation of as many federal judges as possible, given the potential impact of the judiciary in challenging Trump administration policies. The Marshall Project, a non-profit news organisation, noted: \u201cFederal judges <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/courts-restrained-trump-term-check-power/story?id=115657129\">restricted hundreds of Trump administration policies</a> during his first term, and will likely play a significant role in determining the trajectory of his second.\u201d</p> <p>Senate Republicans forced numerous procedural votes and late-night sessions this week in attempt to stall confirmations. Eventually a deal was struck that will bring Biden within striking distance of the 234 judicial confirmations that occurred in Trump\u2019s first term \u2013 but four of Biden\u2019s appellate court nominees will not be considered.</p> <p>The outgoing president could also engage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/16/democrats-resistance-trump-agenda\">with Democratic-led states</a> and localities to bolster protections and establish \u201cfirewalls\u201d against Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly in areas such as immigration. These collaborations could involve reinforcing sanctuary city policies and providing resources to states that are likely to face pressure from the Trump administration.</p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/chrisliscott?lang=en\">Chris Scott</a>, former coalitions director for Harris, said: \u201cWhat will be interesting is how or what can President Biden to work with states, especially where we have Democratic leadership in place, to be able to brace themselves and arm themselves with more protection. We already have places like a Michigan or Illinois where you have governors vowing to make sure that they have protections \u2013 even in the Trump presidency.<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>As Barack Obama discovered before handing Trump the keys to the Oval Office in 2017, however, lame duck presidents can only do so much. Trump will come into office with a flurry of executive orders, a supportive Congress and fewer guardrails than the first time around.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/people/william-a-galston/\">Bill Galston</a>, a former adviser in the Bill Clinton administration, said: \u201cOn January 20 Donald Trump will control all the instruments of government and, at that point, it\u2019ll be up to the courts \u2013 and public opinion \u2013 to restrain him.\u201d</p>",

Lesley Imgart, whose brilliant broomstick-ridden story <em>Witch Way?</em> we publish today, has entered the competition five times in the past six years, and when she talks to me from her home in Edinburgh, she still sounds amazed finally to have triumphed. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was this thing I just did every year\u2026 I keep forgetting I\u2019ve won, and then 15 minutes later, I\u2019ll remember, and feel pleased all over again.\u201d Her verdict on herself: \u201cI am nothing if not persistent.\u201d</p> <p>Imgart\u2019s story is about the life of a young witch. First, comes witch school, and the struggle to concentrate on maths when she\u2019d rather be casting spells. Then, university (Contemporary Magic Practice BA Hons at the College of Arcane Arts). But what to do with her life once she graduates? Even witches need to earn a living. While her friends all seem gung-ho (\u201cI\u2019m going to focus on my YouBroom career,\u201d says one, mobile phone already in front of his face), she ends up listening to customers\u2019 complaints in a magical hardware shop (\u201cYour self-stirring spoons stir too fast!\u201d). Her magic is on the back burner, performed only for family and friends, or at weddings and birthdays, mainly because it\u2019s cheaper than buying a present.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a parody of the self-indulgent comics of my 20s, all those coming-of-age struggles</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Imgart is not a witch, but the story is broadly autobiographical. \u201cIt\u2019s a parody of the self-indulgent comics of my 20s, all those coming-of-age struggles,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was also inspired by Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld books, the whole series of which I read last year.\u201d At 28, and a trainee in the production department of a Scottish animation studio, the days when she worked in a warehouse are now behind her, she hopes. But who knows what the future holds? \u201cI take this as encouragement to carry on [with comics]. I\u2019ve so many ideas for things I think I can do. But I\u2019m also so content right now\u2026 I mean, this week especially.\u201d She laughs. \u201cMaybe I am a bit like the witch in my story. As she says: I\u2019ll [have to] figure it out.\u201d</p> <p>Imgart is German. She moved to the UK for art school in Birmingham, where she studied for a BA in illustration. After that came the warehouse years, and then she moved to Edinburgh to do a master\u2019s degree, also in illustration. She didn\u2019t, she says, grow up reading comics; her interest in the form didn\u2019t begin until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/06/observer-graphic-short-story-prize-greenberg\">Isabel Greenberg</a>, a former winner of the prize, came to Birmingham to give a talk to students. \u201cI began reading graphic novels quite begrudgingly,\u201d she says. \u201cI like Kate Beaton [the award-winning Canadian author of <em>Hark! A Vagrant</em>] and Noah Van Sciver [the American cartoonist best known for his book <em>Fante Bukowski</em>], but it was Alison Bechdel [<em>Fun Home</em>] who convinced me that comics are an art form.\u201d</p> <p>Joining me as judges of the 2024 prize were, as always, Angus Cargill, publishing director at Faber, our partner; Paul Gravett, wraparound expert on all things cartoon and the director of Comica; and Tom Oldham of Gosh! in Soho, London\u2019s best comic book shop. Our brilliant guests were the author-artists Luke Healy and Posy Simmonds, who judged the prize in 2007, the year it launched (how lovely to have her back). On the day, our discussions were gentle: Imgart ultimately rose to the top of our shortlist of six with ease. However, two things struck us: the first, relatively benign, was the influence of Alice Oseman\u2019s bestselling young adult <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/22/graphic-novelist-alice-oseman-heartstopper\">Heartstopper</a></em> series on some younger entrants. The second, more worryingly, was the possible (even probable) deployment of AI by some artists. We frowned on this, and will be vigilant about its use in future years.</p> <p>This year\u2019s runner-up, whose entry you can read online, is Elly Bazigos, who lives in Coventry, where she works as a full-time freelance illustrator (she did her illustration degree in Leeds). Her story <em>LANSA Flight 508</em> was marked out by both its beautifully lush and detailed pictures, and by its subject matter \u2013 for, as its title suggests, it is inspired by an infamous plane crash of 1971, the sole survivor of which was 17-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/06/a-bolt-of-lightning-struck-my-plane-and-i-plunged-3000m-into-a-rainforest\">Juliane Koepcke</a>; having landed in the rainforest \u2013 the plane was flying from Lima to Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon \u2013 she survived for 11 days until she was rescued by lumberjacks.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so chuffed,\u201d Bazigos says. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much confidence in myself as a storyteller \u2013 I mean as an author as well as an illustrator \u2013 and this is so encouraging. Though I still feel like an impostor.\u201d Like Imgart, she wasn\u2019t much of a reader of comics as a child (though she was a fan of Terry Deary\u2019s <em>Horrible Histories</em> series). But at university, she met people who did like them, and she began sketching her daily diary: a therapeutic experience for her eyes only. Why did she decide to draw a comic about flight 508? \u201cI like stories about real people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/01/werner-herzog-dark-films\">Werner Herzog</a>\u2019s documentary about the crash, <em>Wings of Hope</em>, that really captured my imagination. For some reason I related to Juliane Koepcke. I began drawing immediately, but I also did a lot of research: I read her autobiography, and I picked out species of animals, plants and insects she mentioned, because in my pictures, I wanted to honour the rainforest.\u201d</p> <p>The judges thought she pulled this off. Her entry pays rereading. Each time you do so, you notice another creature, hidden in all that foliage. Its shades of green don\u2019t only work to tell Koepcke\u2019s miraculous story; they speak to a vital wild space now greatly under threat (Koepcke went on to become an entomologist, and to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps as the director of Panguana, a Peruvian conservation project). Congratulations to both Bazigos and to Imgart from me and all the other judges \u2013 and I hope you enjoy their work.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>Meet the judges</strong></h2>    <h2>Luke Healy</h2> <p><em>Author of graphic novels including </em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/americana-and-the-act-of-getting-over-it-9781910620618/\">Americana (And the Act of Getting Over It.)</a></em><em>, </em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-con-artists-9780571368761/\">The Con Artists</a></em><em> and, most recently, </em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/self-esteem-and-the-end-of-the-world-9780571375608/\">Self-Esteem and the End of the World</a></em><em> (</em><em>Faber</em><em>)</em></p> <p><strong>Did </strong><strong>judging the competition take you back to your own start as a cartoonist, and if so, in what way?<br></strong>It made me reminisce about my early days in art school more than anything. I\u2019d already been making comics for a few years, but always ended up with failed attempts at sprawling epics. Then I went to the Center for Cartoon Studies, where we were drilled endlessly on making short, self-contained comics. Reading everyone\u2019s four-page entries made me want to create a few short comics myself!</p> <p><strong>What did you make of the standard of the entrants? What was the most common mistake?<br></strong>I certainly enjoyed reading through the entries, and there was a huge variety in terms of style and quality. I would say that the most common mistake I saw was a lack of attention to clarity for the reader. In comics, we aren\u2019t really drawing, we are writing with pictures \u2013 so making sure everything is clear and readable should be a top priority.</p> <p><strong>Our winner, </strong><em><strong>Witch Way?</strong></em><strong>, is about the uncertain feeling of being young and how to make your way in the world (as well as about magic). Why did you feel it was a worthy winner?<br></strong>To me, <em>Witch Way?</em> was the most polished and self-assured entry. It had a clear, simple idea (important for such a short story) and it explored that idea with simple, explicit emotions. The art was charming, and I imagine a lot of artists can relate to the sucking void of post-art-school doubt, myself included!</p> <p><strong>Which cartoonists inspired you early in your career, and who do you have your eye on now?<br></strong>Two of my biggest early influences were Pascal Girard, a cartoonist from Quebec who is a master of awkward humour, and Ulli Lust, an Austrian cartoonist whose memoir <em>Today Is the Last Day of the Rest of Your Life</em> still firmly ranks as my favourite book of all time. Lately, I have been obsessed with humour cartoons from the <em>New Yorker</em> \u2013 particularly stuff from the 1950s and 60s from artists like Charles Addams and Whitney Darrow Jr. A recently published graphic novel that I loved was <em>Tender</em> by Beth Hetland \u2013 a truly creepy tale of social media addiction.</p>    <h2>Posy Simmonds</h2> <p><em>Author of books including </em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gemma-bovery-9780224061148/\">Gemma Bovary</a></em><em> and </em><em>Tamara Drew</em><em>. A major retrospective of her work was held last year at the <a href=\"https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/magazine/article/posy-simmonds-i-am-still-doing-what-i-loved-doing-aged-9-making-comics\">Pompidou Centre in Paris</a>. At the </em><em>2024</em><em> </em><em>International Comics festival in Angoul\u00eame</em><em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/24/graphic-novelist-posy-simmonds-wins-prestigious-french-comics-award\">she received the </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/24/graphic-novelist-posy-simmonds-wins-prestigious-french-comics-award\">Grand Prix</a></em><em> (for </em><em>lifetime achievement</em><em>), the </em><em>first time a British artist has ever won the award</em></p> <p><strong>You are a returning judge. What did you make of this year\u2019s entrants? Did their work make you feel stern or indulgent?<br></strong>I think I was sternly indulgent. Drawing a two- or three-page narrative is difficult. First, finding the idea and then juggling the elements \u2013 plot, characters, images, text and dialogue \u2013 so that they form a coherent story, with a beginning and an end. All the entrants on the short list produced engaging work and in several cases the standard of the artwork was very high.</p> <p><strong>What was the most common pitfall?<br></strong>The lack of a story, or, if there was a story, the lack of planning. Sometimes the plots were baffling. Sometimes an entrant would spend energy on an elaborate beginning, after which the idea would tail away.</p> <p><strong>The journey to become a fully fledged cartoonist/writer of graphic novels isn\u2019t straightforward. How did you get your own start, and what advice do you have for our winner as they press on?<br></strong>After leaving art college in 1968, I spent several months lugging my portfolio round the offices of newspapers and magazines. Eventually, there were small commissions, illustrating newspaper articles. The deadlines were tight, there was no time for second thoughts, but it was excellent training. My drawing hand became freer; I learned how to concentrate.</p> <p>My advice would be to draw every day and always have a notebook with you. August is often a very good month for finding freelance work. People go on holiday, but papers and magazines always have pages to fill.</p> <p><strong>Did you read comics as a child?<br></strong>Yes. British comics, including <em>Beano, Dandy</em><em>, </em><em>Topper</em><em>, </em><em>Eagle</em> and <em>Girl</em><em>.</em> And many US comics, passed on by American children in the village where I grew up. These included <em>Superman</em><em>, </em><em>Caspar the Friendly Ghost</em><em>, </em><em>Blondie &amp; Dagwood</em><em> </em>and, from time to time, horror comics.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the best graphic novel you\u2019ve read recently, and why?<br></strong><em>Final Cut</em> by Charles Burns. Original, obsessive, weird\u2026 and with terrific artwork.</p> <p><strong>If you had to press two or three books on someone who hadn\u2019t read any long-form comics before, what might they be, and why?<br></strong><em>Persepolis (Vol 1) </em>by Marjane Satrapi. A powerful memoir of Iran during the Islamic revolution and Satrapi\u2019s childhood struggle with fundamentalism. <em>Persepolis</em> is as pertinent now as it was when first published more than 20 years ago. Raymond Briggs\u2019s <em>Ethel &amp; Ernest</em> tells the story of his parents\u2019 lives, which spanned the upheavals of war and social change in the last century. Bittersweet, very funny and beautifully drawn.</p>",

A former Democratic governor of Arkansas, Clinton had a flair for policy and retail politics. He felt your pain, garnering support from voters without a four-year degree and graduates alike. He played the saxophone, belting out Heartbreak Hotel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LhgGs4TrYA\">on late-night TV</a>. Redefining what it meant to be presidential, he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFMW5RIwVhU\">told a studio audience</a> he preferred briefs to boxers.</p> <p>He oozed charisma \u2013 and more. But his legacy remains deeply stained by allegations of predatory conduct and questionable judgment. He is one of three presidents to be impeached \u2013 in his case, for lying under oath about his extra-marital relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. Before leaving office, to avoid professional discipline, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/19/politics/clinton-reaches-deal-to-avoid-indictment-and-to-give-up-law-license.html\">surrendered</a> his law license.</p> <p>Congress twice impeached Donald Trump.

Like an old-time vaudevillian, the 42nd president, now 78, finds it hard to leave the stage. His second memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/14/bill-clinton-monica-lewinsky-book\">subtitled My Life After the White House</a>, is a stab at image rehabilitation and relevance.</p> <p>Densely written, the 464-page tome is a prolonged stroll down memory lane that never quite reaches a desired destination. It is too much, too little, too late \u2013 all at once.</p> <p>Clinton grapples with his past. In January 1998, news broke that the president, then in his 50s, had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky, a 22-year-old intern. It gave a nascent internet culture \u2013 most of it following and shaped by Matt Drudge \u2013 plenty to talk about.</p> <p>Newt Gingrich, the soon-to-be disgraced speaker of the House, and Ken Starr, an independent counsel turned modern-day Torquemada, did their best to bring Clinton down. Lindsey Graham, then an eager young congressman, now the senior senator from South Carolina and a key Trump ally, dutifully fanned the flames.</p> <p>Fast forward 30 years. In 2018, Craig Melvin of NBC asked Clinton if he apologized to Lewinsky. Clinton did not take kindly to the question. He now admits the interview \u201cwas not my finest hour\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI live with it all the time,\u201d he writes, reflecting on the affair. \u201cMonica\u2019s done a lot of good and important work over the last few years in her campaign against bullying, earning her well-deserved recognition in the United States and abroad. I wish her nothing but the best.\u201d</p> <p>Lewinsky is probably unimpressed. In 2021, NBC asked her if Clinton owed her an apology. \u201cI don\u2019t need it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe should wanna apologize, in the same way that I wanna apologize any chance I get to people that I\u2019ve hurt, and my actions have hurt.\u201d</p> <p>In his new book, Clinton stays silent about other women who accused him of sexual misconduct \u2013 Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick \u2013 but gingerly rehashes Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood moment and proliferating allegations of groping. As for Epstein, the financier and sex offender who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/jeffrey-epstein-dead-prison-report-latest\">killed himself</a> in jail in New York in 2019, and whose links to Trump are perennially discussed, Clinton pleads ignorance.</p> <p>\u201cI had always thought Epstein was odd but had no inkling of the crimes he was committing,\u201d he writes. \u201cHe hurt a lot of people, but I knew nothing about it and by the time he was first arrested in 2005, I had stopped contact with him.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton adds: \u201cI\u2019ve never visited his island.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton does acknowledge two flights, in 2002 and 2003, on Epstein\u2019s plane, luridly known as the \u201cLolita Express\u201d: \u201cThe bottom line is, even though it allowed me to visit the work of my foundation, traveling on Epstein\u2019s plane was not worth the years of questioning afterward. I wish I had never met him.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton for the White House. On the page, Bill Clinton burnishes the memory of his wife\u2019s failed campaigns \u2013 though he is ever aware of her shortcomings. He recognizes the meaning of her Democratic primary defeat, by Barack Obama in 2008. Blaming the media, in part, Clinton implicitly acknowledges that Obama, then the junior senator from Illinois, was a better candidate than Hillary, then a former first lady and junior senator from New York.</p> <p>\u201cObama\u2019s best decision was to start his campaign early with a full 50-state strategy, something Hillary\u2019s campaign had to develop after she strengthened her leadership team in February,\u201d Bill laments. \u201cBut she never really caught up.\u201d</p> <p>Said differently, 2008 was a change election. Obama stood atop history. Hillary was in over her head. She was also the status quo. As for 2016, Clinton pins his wife\u2019s loss on James Comey, the FBI director who investigated her private email use; WikiLeaks, which released Democratic emails; and Vladimir Putin, who capitalized on such scandals in order to boost Trump.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Clinton revisits his last-minute pardon of Marc Rich \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/clintons-pardon-of-marc-rich\">scandal</a> from the last day of the presidency, 20 January 2001. Denise Rich, the fugitive financier\u2019s ex-wife, donated $450,000 to the Clinton library and wrote to him, seeking a pardon.</p> <p>\u201cI wish Denise hadn\u2019t written to me, for her sake and mine,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cI knew she had made plenty of money on her own, did not get along with her ex-husband, and didn\u2019t know he would apply for a pardon when she gave money to the library fund.\u201d</p> <p>Again, parallels to Trump are apparent. At the end of his first term, the 45th president gave get-out-of-jail-free cards to cronies and the connected. Charlie Kushner, father of Jared Kushner, was one who benefited. So did Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Steve Bannon. A robust pardon pipeline emerged with an ultimate audience of one. Trump will soon wield the pardon power again.</p> <p>On the whole, Bill Clinton\u2019s latest book will be remembered for its omissions.

      "bodyText": "Cabinet ministers should not impose their religious beliefs on others in their objections to assisted dying, a leading proponent of changing the law has said. In response to an intervention from Shabana Mahmood, Charlie Falconer, a Labour peer and ally of Keir Starmer, said the justice secretary had \u201creligious and spiritual reasons\u201d for being opposed to assisted dying. \u201cI think she\u2019s motivated \u2013 and I respect this \u2013 by her religious beliefs. They shouldn\u2019t be imposed on everybody else,\u201d Lord Falconer told Sky News. Mahmood had said there was a risk of going down a \u201cslippery slope towards death on demand\u201d, as MPs prepare to vote on a bill to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill people in England and Wales this week. In a letter to her constituents, Mahmood, who is the most senior Muslim politician in Britain, said she was \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d by the legislation and that \u201cthe state should never offer death as a service\u201d. Falconer said Mahmood\u2019s argument was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, although she had \u201creligious and spiritual reasons why she believes completely in the sanctity of life\u201d. His intervention turns the heat up on what has become an increasingly acrimonious debate between senior Labour figures over the legislation. Falconer said Mahmood was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d to say the bill was a slippery slope because \u201cif you look all the way around the world wherever a terminally ill assisted dying bill has been introduced, as opposed to an undue suffering-type bill \u2026 it doesn\u2019t expand to anything else\u201d. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour backbencher who has brought forward the bill, said she had \u201ca huge amount of respect\u201d for Mahmood and that it was right to have \u201ca very robust debate on this hugely important subject\u201d. She said: \u201cThe point about religion does come into this debate. We have to be honest about that. There are people who would never support a change in the law because of their religious beliefs. \u201cEqually, within faith communities there are a range of opinions,\u201d she added, pointing out that George Carey, a former archbishop of Canterbury, and Jonathan Romain, a prominent rabbi, supported a change in the law. Polling by More in Common published by the Sunday Times showed that Mahmood\u2019s seat, Birmingham Ladywood, is one of only seven constituencies in the country where a majority of voters do not support assisted dying. All seven seats identified by the poll have a higher-than-average proportion of residents with religious views, predominantly Muslim. Leadbeater said she did not have \u201cany doubts whatsoever\u201d about her position. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put the bill forward if I did. What I\u2019m very clear about is we have got people now who the law is failing. We have got people taking their own lives. We have got families losing loved ones in very harrowing circumstances and we have got people having very painful deaths \u2026 By creating a legal framework, we will improve the situation.\u201d Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said she would be voting in favour of Leadbeater\u2019s bill on Friday. \u201cI believe in giving people as much power, say and control as possible over the things that matter to them most.

With his reputed $50m fee for Red One, and with an estimated net worth of about $800m, he has become one of Hollywood\u2019s highest paid stars.

Saroyan was admired by Joseph Heller, Arthur Miller and Kurt Vonnegut, among others. His story Seventeen, portraying one boy\u2019s uneasy transition into adulthood, calls to mind The Catcher in the Rye. Saroyan\u2019s visceral description of alienation, rage, feelings of violence combined with a \u201cstrange tenderness\u201d arrived some years before Salinger had conceived Holden Caulfield. Aspirin Is a Member of the NRA could have been written about the numbing properties of opioids today. Saroyan mixes compassion and humour to terrific effect in this resonant collection. \u2022 The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze and Other Stories by William Saroyan is published by Faber (\u00a39.99).

      "body": "<p>In the American heartland, they\u2019re excited. Finally, say voters who put Donald Trump into the White House for a second time, they are about to get the president they wanted all along.</p> <p>Even as leading Democrats decry Trump\u2019s cabinet nominations as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/20/trump-cabinet-picks-contempt-rage-vengeance\">agents of his contempt, rage and vengeance</a>\u201d, the former and future president\u2019s supporters are interpreting the selections as evidence that he has finally broken free of the Washington establishment.</p> <p>Democrats are fuming that Trump wants to put a vaccine denier in charge of health, former Fox News presenters at the helm of the Pentagon and transportation department, and at the prospect of Elon Musk slashing and burning his way through the sprawling federal bureaucracy.</p> <p>Even senior Republicans have been less than enthusiastic about some of Trump\u2019s choices. The tapping of the former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz to be the US attorney general ran into the sand after just a few days over allegations of sex with a minor.</p> <p>But many of those who voted for Trump are weighing other priorities.</p> <p>Neil Shaffer, chair of the Republican party in Howard county, Iowa, which twice voted for Barack Obama but has swung ever more to Trump with each passing election, has never been an enthusiast for the former president even if he voted for him three times.</p> <p>\u201cThis time around I was still a little lukewarm on the whole thing but I\u2019m very impressed with the people he\u2019s surrounded himself with, especially Tulsi Gabbard and Bobby Kennedy and Elon Musk. With each one of these people there\u2019s a big, big part of their appointment that is reforming and streamlining,\u201d said Shaffer, who works in water conservation for the state.</p> <p>\u201cI like the idea of bringing people from outside government to look at this with eyes from the real world not Washington DC. Washington DC is not the real world. It\u2019s a made-up puppet regime of dark shadows. You\u2019ve got the military-industrial complex, big pharma, big agriculture pulling all the levers. They want all that money. It\u2019s why we got the way we are with our food. I\u2019m actually mystified that he\u2019s this well organised, that all these names are coming out so quickly.\u201d</p>    <p>Shaffer offers a frequently heard view among Trump supporters that the former president was ill-prepared for his unexpected victory in 2016, and was then captured by big business and the Republican establishment in making cabinet appointments. That, he said, held back Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe was inundated with all these lobbyists and corporate interests and individuals who really were there more to perpetuate the system instead of reform the system,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This time, said Shaffer, Trump has the experience to put in place officials who will represent his ambitions.</p> <p>Among the most contentious nominations, and popular with the next president\u2019s supporters, is the choice of Robert F Kennedy, scion of the US\u2019s most famous Democratic political family, as secretary of health and human services. His liberal critics see a crank who rejected Covid vaccinations and promoted false claims over links between immunisation and autism.</p> <p>But more than a few Trump supporters are focused on Kennedy\u2019s longstanding criticisms of the power of the food and agricultural industry over what Americans farm and eat, and the prescription drug makers\u2019 influence on healthcare.</p> <p>Corporate lobbyists helped ensure that the US government spent more than $100bn subsidising the growing of corn over the past 30 years. Some of that ends up as high-fructose corn syrup now found in most processed foods in the US, from breakfast cereals to salad dressings and soft drinks, and is a major contributor to some of the highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the world.</p> <p>A meme about the unhealthy ingredients in Heinz tomato ketchup made in the US, including corn syrup, compared with the UK version is doing the rounds among Trump supporters enthusiastic about Kennedy\u2019s appointment. As Shafer sees it, corporations are getting taxpayers to subsidise an industry that is killing them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I heard Bobby Kennedy say the other day, when you go back to the 1960s and what our health was then to where it is now, our DNA didn\u2019t change, our diet changed. And what spurred our diet to change?\u201d said Shaffer.</p> <p>\u201cThe food thing is huge. I\u2019m so happy that he\u2019s going to have a cabinet position.\u201d</p> <p>Bo Copley, a former miner in West Virginia who now works as a salesman, said he was disappointed that Trump did not behave with more dignity during his first term. He\u2019s not confident that will change but thinks the former president has learned from other mistakes, principally in who he appoints to positions of power.</p> <p>\u201cOpponents would consider them radical but for the people who support him, he\u2019s putting people in place who will help him get the job done. There are people that would shake up the establishment in Washington DC. We\u2019re not looking for lobbyists to be in these positions. We\u2019re not looking at people from big pharma to be in these positions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Copley named Kennedy and Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman who switched to the Republicans earlier this year and is nominated as director of national intelligence, as among the choices he most liked.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nikki-haley\">Nikki Haley</a>, the former UN ambassador who challenged Trump in the Republican primaries, on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/nikki-haley-trump-cabinet-tulsi-gabbard-rfk-jr\">criticised Gabbard</a> as \u201ca Russian, Iranian, Syrian, Chinese sympathiser\u201d. But Copley is not alone in welcoming Gabbard\u2019s scepticism about Washington\u2019s escalating military support for Ukraine, including the Biden administration\u2019s decision this week to supply landmines and permit the firing of US-made missiles into Russia.</p>    <p>\u201cOne of the biggest talking points the first time Donald Trump went into office was he\u2019s going to start world war three and he actually de-escalated conflicts. Now we\u2019ve sent Ukraine billions and billions of dollars when we have people in North Carolina who went through humongous disaster, the hurricane, and we offer them $750 apiece when their entire lives have been wiped out. It\u2019s completely asinine to me,\u201d he said</p> <p>Then there is Elon Musk. Even before he was nominated to head the new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d, some were questioning how long the egotistical billionaire would remain in Trump\u2019s favour. But Shaffer is particularly keen on Musk carrying through his promise of deep cuts to government spending after the national debt rose by more than $2tn over the past year.</p> <p>\u201cI was in DC this summer. I walked past this ginormous education department building every time I left my hotel. I thought there\u2019s no reason for this to be here. If that money was spent in our local communities, the quality of education would skyrocket,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Copley, too, is enthused at the prospect of Musk \u201ccutting down the wasteful spending that happens in Washington\u201d. He acknowledges that West Virginia, one of the poorest states in the US, is heavily reliant on federal aid to fund education, transport and social services. A relatively high proportion of people on low incomes in the state receive welfare payments and healthcare coverage.</p> <p>\u201cI know that a lot of West Virginians receive money and receive those kind of payments, but I\u2019m all for revamping those so that people don\u2019t game the system and use them as lifelong crutches,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For Ed Bisch the desire to tear down parts of the system is deeply personal. He lost his 18-year-old son Eddie to a prescription opioid overdose in 2001, an early victim of an epidemic that has claimed close to 900,000 lives. Bisch voted solidly Democratic all the way up to supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016 in the belief that the party would take on the big pharma interests that caused the opioid epidemic. But little changed.</p> <p>Then Bisch saw Trump in office and decided he was the president most likely to challenge the drug industry and what he sees as its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/28/us-opioids-crisis-fentanyl-appalachia\">corruption of American medicine</a> and health regulation.</p> <p>Bisch is enthusiastic about Kennedy, who is a former heroin addict, and JD Vance as vice-president after he wrote a bestseller, Hillbilly Elegy, about growing up in a region blighted by drugs.</p> <p>He is also pleased by the nomination of Pam Bondi to be the US attorney general after Gaetz dropped out. As Florida\u2019s attorney general, Bondi shut down the \u201cpill mills\u201d churning out opioid prescriptions at a time when more oxycodone pills were sold in Florida than all other US states combined.</p> <p>Bisch wants to see Bondi prosecute the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/17/opioids-crisis-sackler-family-purdue-pharma-deal\">Sackler family</a> which owned the company that kicked off the opioid epidemic with the powerful narcotic OxyContin. He\u2019s also counting on Kennedy to follow through on a pledge to \u201cclose the revolving door\u201d between the drug industry and its regulators at the Food and Drug Administration which has been accused of allowing the epidemic to take off because of lax oversight and too close a relationship with the drug makers.</p> <p>Kennedy has repeatedly criticised the FDA for conflicts of interest, accusing it of putting the interests of the pharmaceutical industry ahead of the nation\u2019s health.</p> <p>Then there is Trump\u2019s promise to finish building the wall on the border with Mexico. That is primarily about immigration but Bisch said it would also help stem the flow of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is responsible for most overdose deaths these days.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m excited. Let\u2019s finish the border wall. I agree when people say most of the fentanyl gets in through ports of entry not the open border but once we get the wall built and secure the border, then you can put more resources at the ports of entry. The bottom line is, you\u2019ll never be able to stop it but reducing the supply is a proven way to reduce deaths,\u201d he said.</p> <p>How the desire to see Trump take on a system that has increasingly come to resemble a corporate oligarchy will square with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/nov/04/what-is-project-2025-trump\">Project 2025,</a> the Heritage Foundation\u2019s authoritarian plan to impose rightwing control across the entire US government that would also enlarge the power of big business, remains to be seen. Trump has distanced himself from the plan even though members of his first administration were influential in its creation.</p> <p>Shaffer is no fan of Project 2025. He takes Trump assurances at face value and believes the next president will see that his supporters want to see the corporate grip on government broken.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democrats have leftwing crazies. We\u2019ve got some wackos out there on the far right and they concocted this list of their priorities. There\u2019s probably some good things in there but there\u2019s a lot of screwball things. I don\u2019t see those people coming to the table,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think Trump is going to have enough free-thinkers and people that have already explicitly criticised a lot of the stuff that\u2019s been going on out there. That will be his guiding force.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Four years ago, when my son was only one month old, he and I were admitted to a mother and baby unit, a psychiatric ward that cares for people with perinatal mental health issues and their babies. I was diagnosed with severe postpartum anxiety and depression, and placed on medication. I had weekly sessions with the psychiatric team about my progress, and my son and I spent time with the other women on the ward and their babies. Every day, sometimes twice a day, my husband would come and see us and we would walk around Hackney as I tried to remember who I once was, tried to resist the temptation to step in front of a car. Gradually, horrifically, painfully slowly, I got a bit better. After eight weeks we were discharged and we went home.</p> <p>But while I was no longer in a crisis situation, my mental health was extremely fragile. I had weekly calls with an NHS therapist who approached my illness in a methodical, precise way. She explained what was happening to me and why it had happened. I was desperate to put it all down to hormones, I wanted to run away from the corrupt version of myself and never think about her again, wanted to slice her out of my heart, my mind, bury her and spit on her grave. I was so embarrassed and ashamed of her, I hated her. But my therapist gently pushed back \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just hormones, and I needed to find a way to accept that.</p> <p>Two months later, I was still not in my right mind, still plagued by the knowledge that I had imagined doing terrible, evil things to my son. I knew that those intrusive thoughts were caused by my illness, but that didn\u2019t make them any easier to live with. It was at this point that I started thinking about witches. Although, to be fair, I have always thought about witches. Many women have. Even this year for Halloween, my son wanted to be the witch from <em>Room on the Broom</em> \u2013 which was annoying because I\u2019d already bought him a skeleton costume. And lots of women have a favourite witch: Glinda from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, <em>The Witches of Eastwick</em>, Samantha in <em>Bewitched</em>, and \u2013 for me personally \u2013 Mildred Hubble (<em>The Worst Witch</em>).</p> <p>Witches represent female power and can be a celebration of our potency, but they are also often used as the embodiment of society\u2019s ancient fears about women. Consequently many of us are afraid of turning into witches, transforming into hags and crones as we age, pushed to the edge of our communities, derided, ignored, hideous. For others, witches represent women who are out of control \u2013 they show us the dangers of an unhinged female, a vixen who doesn\u2019t do as she is told. But I think for me, in that quiet, grey December, still so deep in my madness, witches represented hope.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bad witches became aspirational. They made me feel I wasn\u2019t alone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I made a list of every witch film I could think of and watched them one by one while my son slept on my chest. As I did so I found connection and comfort. But while once I had loved the \u201cgood\u201d witches who were pink and maternal, who only used their power to change their outfit or help a friend, I was now increasingly drawn to \u201cbad\u201d witches. Maybe the Wicked Witch of The West had a point when she wailed, \u201cwhat a world, what a world, what a world!\u201d as she melted into a cold stone floor.</p> <p>I realised that actually what I needed was the courage to accept that the person I thought of as evil, pathetic and sick was, in fact, me. After that the bad witches became aspirational. They made me feel like I wasn\u2019t alone. Maybe I wasn\u2019t evil. Maybe I was just a witch?</p> <p><em><strong>In the summer of 1645,</strong></em> Matthew Hopkins, one of the most famous \u201cwitch finders\u201d to clomp around the country in his little heeled boots, arrived in Suffolk. By this point, witch trials had been happening in England for more than 60 years, and Hopkins was notorious for uncovering witches wherever he went. In breaks from films while my son drank warm formula from his bottle (told you I\u2019m evil), I read through the testimonies of the women accused in this trial.</p> <p>Anna Moats had voluntarily confessed within two hours of her arrest. And the devilish deed she had performed? \u201cCursing her husband and children.\u201d Anna knew that confessing to be a witch meant she would be put in a cart and driven through the streets, before swinging from the gallows, in front of her friends, family, possibly even her children. And yet she still confessed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1645, Matthew Hopkins was notorious for uncovering witches wherever he went</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I called Marion Gibson, Professor of Renaissance and Magical Studies at Exeter University and asked why someone like Anna would confess \u2013 was it because of torture? \u201cNo, witches weren\u2019t tortured in England.\u201d My voice caught in my throat. So some women confessed without torture? \u201cYes.\u201d And they knew they would die? \u201cYes. And no one is sure why they did that.\u201d Huh. I have a theory.</p> <p>To clarify \u2013 while there wasn\u2019t torture, they did use sleep deprivation and intimidation. And they searched the women\u2019s naked bodies for marks of the devil, which would have led to many coerced confessions. However, thanks to Professor Louise Jackson\u2019s research, I learned that in a few of the Suffolk depositions, confessions had been made \u201cfreely\u201d. Matthew Hopkins wrote that Rebecca Morris \u201cconfessed before any violence, watching [sleep deprivation] or other threats\u201d that the devil came to her in the shape of a boy. Alicia Warner \u201cfreely being at her liberty confessed that she had entertained certain evil spirits\u201d. Eliza Southerne confessed immediately, \u201cThe minister used no other argument to make her confess\u2026 [only] saying do wrong yourself, but clear your conscience.\u201d</p> <p>Very little research has been done into these \u201cvoluntary confessions\u201d or why these women were so ready to condemn themselves to death. But reading through their testimonies I felt as if I knew. Scrolling through phone conversations I have with the women in my life, I felt like I knew. The guilt and the shame so many of us feel at not being good enough. The suffocating pressure we feel to be perfect. As Professor Louise Jackson <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/09612029500200075?needAccess=true\">writes</a>, \u201cIn the production of confessions, coercion was as much cultural as it was physical. Frameworks of belief about women\u2019s roles, responsibilities and expectations would lead women to condemn themselves\u2026 The Suffolk women who confessed that they were witches were also confessing that they were \u2018bad\u2019 mothers, \u2018bad\u2019 wives and \u2018bad\u2019 neighbours\u2026\u201d In my opinion very little has changed. They don\u2019t need to torture us, we will do it to ourselves.</p>    <p>I also saw descriptions of mental illness within the confessions. Back then suicide attempts and depression were almost always linked to the devil, and those ideations feature prominently in the women\u2019s testimonies. Lidea Taylor confessed \u201cthat her imps\u2026 counselled her to kill herself\u201d. Ellen Greenelif confessed that \u201cshe was often tempted to kill herself\u201d. Elizabeth Fillet confessed that \u201cthe devil tempted her to kill herself\u201d. I also saw hints of postpartum depression and psychosis. Prissilla Collit confessed that the devil had tempted her to kill her children. She placed one of her children next to the fire to burn it, a sibling pulled it away. Mary Scrutton confessed that the \u201cdevil appeared to her twice, once like a bear, once like a cat and tempted her in a hollow voice to kill her child\u201d. Susanna Smith confessed the day after her arrest that 18 years previously the devil had appeared to her in the form of a shaggy red dog and tempted her to kill her children.</p> <p><em><strong>I contacted Dr Trudi Seneviratne,</strong></em> a psychiatrist who has saved countless lives through her work at the Bethlem Mother and Baby unit, part of South London and Maudsley hospital. She nodded as she read the testimonies from 1645, recognising symptoms of postpartum mental health illness. She said that even today the devil still appears in cases of psychosis, women will see themselves as witches, hear satanic voices telling them to do terrible things.</p> <p>One of the most tragic cases of postpartum psychosis happened in 2001 when <a href=\"https://www.oprah.com/omagazine/andrea-yates-a-cry-in-the-dark/all\">Andrea Yates</a>, a Texan mother, drowned all five of her children in the bathtub during a psychotic episode. Yates later said that she thought she was a bad mother and had condemned them to hell. When I read about Andrea and her family I sobbed. While I didn\u2019t have psychosis I knew how close I had come to her experience. Many of my symptoms were similar to hers \u2013 mania, restlessness, depression.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many of my symptoms were similar to Andrea\u2019s \u2013 mania, restlessness, depression</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was withdrawn, tearful, my anxiety so severe I couldn\u2019t sleep. Most alarming, though, was that a few days before I was admitted to hospital I started to believe that ending my son\u2019s life was the only way out of the torture I was experiencing. If I hadn\u2019t received help so quickly, who knows what would have happened \u2013 women with these illnesses can deteriorate shockingly quickly. Postpartum psychosis symptoms usually start within hours or days of giving birth and presentations can change within minutes. For a general patient suffering from psychosis it could take months to see the same changes. It\u2019s one of the rare instances where a psychiatric episode is considered an emergency.</p> <p>I think about Andrea all the time. She currently lives in a low-security state mental hospital and though she has been eligible for release for many years, she always refuses. Thankfully cases like hers are not common, but they still happen, and while in the UK the Infanticide Act, which was re-enacted in 1938, ensures lenient sentencing for a mother who kills her child during the first year of its life, in the US there is no such protection.</p> <p>On 4 January 2023, Lindsay Clancy of Massachusetts strangled her three children then slit her wrists and jumped out of a window. She survived, but her children did not. Now paralysed from the waist down, she\u2019s on trial for homicide. Clancy, whose youngest child was only eight months old when he died, said she strangled the children during a \u201cmoment of psychosis\u201d. The prosecution are depicting her as a sociopath who murdered her children, then faked a suicide attempt. They claim she\u2019d been behaving normally on the day of the tragedy and had never mentioned anything suggesting a psychotic break, just \u201ca touch of postpartum anxiety\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My friends and family were incredibly supportive during my illness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Any woman who has experienced perinatal mental health illness will not be surprised that Clancy was reticent to talk explicitly about what was happening to her. My friends and family were incredibly supportive during my illness, but I was scared to tell them everything I was thinking and feeling. Including how, in the days before my hospitalisation, my brain had started playing a constant loop of hideous scenes. I saw myself smothering our son with a pillow, dropping him from a window on the third floor, drowning him in the bathtub. And yet I loved him more than I had ever loved anyone or anything. It was so scary, so horrifying. I didn\u2019t want to burden them, but also I didn\u2019t want it to be true. So I would convince myself I was making a big deal out of nothing.</p> <p>What finally shifted things for me was joining <a href=\"https://www.wearemotherlylove.co.uk/\">Motherly Love</a>, a support group filled with women from different backgrounds who have experienced perinatal mental health issues. All of them understood. Whatever terrifying thoughts I was having, someone else had had them, too, and they\u2019d survived. The group became a vital source of hope, support and anecdotal knowledge, which didn\u2019t seem to be accessible anywhere else. It was those women who recognised the severity of my symptoms and urged me to get immediate care. They saved my life simply by sharing how they were feeling and making sure I knew I wasn\u2019t alone.</p> <p>Suicide continues to be the leading cause of maternal death between six weeks and 12 months after birth, accounting for 39% of deaths in this period. And despite increased funding and awareness, suicide rates have increased 15% in 10 years. I think a huge part of that is the suffocating pressure women feel to be perfect.</p> <p>My illness began with hormones, but was exacerbated by the stigma, guilt and shame that started the second I left hospital with my tiny son and realised I\u2019d unlocked the door to yet another torture chamber for women. We must be mothers and when we\u2019re mothers, we must be perfect mothers. We must breastfeed our babies, they must sleep well, if they\u2019re in childcare it has to be the very best childcare, we have to be killing it in our careers, and still be present and calm for our children, we must stay youthful, we cannot put on weight. We must behave. And above all, we must be good.</p> <p>It is impossible, we all know it is impossible, and yet we keep trying, and we keep failing, and when we fail we internalise the shame and the guilt because that is what we have been conditioned to do, and it eats away at us.</p> <p>Going through my illness has changed me in so many ways, but I think the greatest gift it has given me is the realisation there are infinite ways to be a woman. And I\u2019ve given up on being a good mother \u2013 I failed at that after only one month. Which is actually incredibly liberating. These days I just feel so lucky to still be here. To hold my son\u2019s warm body every morning when he wakes up, to watch him eat a slice of birthday cake in rapturous silence. I am lucky I have been given the opportunity to feel acceptance and even love for that dark twisted version of myself I once hated so much. I would miss her if she ever went away. And I am so lucky that I get to age. Far too many of us don\u2019t. I plan to fly towards it like the witch I am, wild and mad, flawed and imperfect.</p> <p><em>Elizabeth Sankey\u2019s documentary film, Witches, will stream on MUBI from 22 November 2024</em></p> <p><em>If you\u2019ve been affected by any of these issues, go to <a href=\"https://maternalmentalhealthalliance.org/\">Maternal Mental Health Alliance</a> or <a href=\"https://www.app-network.org/\">Action on Postpartum Psychosis</a></em></p>",

I am lucky I have been given the opportunity to feel acceptance and even love for that dark twisted version of myself I once hated so much. I would miss her if she ever went away. And I am so lucky that I get to age. Far too many of us don\u2019t. I plan to fly towards it like the witch I am, wild and mad, flawed and imperfect.

Scores of companies had written to the chancellor to plead their case.</p> <p>The noisy protests and hurried government consultations conjured botched budgets of the past \u2013 George Osborne\u2019s omnishambles in 2012, with its pasty and caravan taxes; Gordon Brown\u2019s abolition of the 10p tax rate in 2007, which Alistair Darling later had to paper over. </p> <p>Yet inside the Treasury, the sense is that the budget landed as well as could have been expected, given that it will raise \u00a340bn in tax.</p> <p>Some backlash was inevitable, the Treasury believes, given the historic scale of the revenue-raising measures. But Labour focus groups carried out on budget day and repeatedly since have suggested that while they aren\u2019t cheering the tax rises, voters are mainly relieved that they won\u2019t be hit directly via their payslips.</p> <p>Government strategists were struck by how positive voters were about the increase in the minimum wage \u2013 which benefits 3 million people \u2013 and plans for higher spending on the NHS. In particular, the \u201chero voters\u201d they are fixated with, including Tory-to-Labour switchers they are keen to hang on to at a future general election, apparently liked what they saw.</p> <p>That long summer pause, after Reeves issued a gloomy warning about the \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d she had uncovered in the public finances, is blamed by business groups for holding back investment and depressing confidence for months. Even Labour\u2019s supporters spent a queasy few weeks contemplating the cut to the winter fuel allowance and wondering what fresh horrors loomed. </p> <p>But in the minds of Labour strategists, those bleak weeks were vital pitch-rolling: the public approached the budget expecting the worst.</p> <p>With no increase in fuel duty (despite the government\u2019s avowed green credentials) and the national insurance increase levied on employers rather than directly on their staff, the bottom line for most voters was: no change.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s research suggests that voters accept someone had to pay for a much-needed increase in public spending and are glad it wasn\u2019t them, at least not directly.</p> <p>\u201cPeople do get this argument that NICs will be felt in other ways. But where that takes you is \u2018give them a break, they\u2019ve got to find the money from somewhere\u2019,\u201d says one senior party strategist.</p> <p>Some insiders believe that even had Reeves not boxed herself in by promising not to raise the three major direct taxes \u2013 national insurance, income tax and VAT \u2013 there is no democratic consent at this moment for increasing taxes on individuals. They cite populist arguments against spending on areas such as international aid, green projects and the war in Ukraine (Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party says it would halve international aid spending, for example).</p> <p>Of course, we can never know how the electorate would have responded to a party that stated clearly in advance that a major uplift in public investment was necessary, and set out how they would pay for it, since Labour didn\u2019t dare try. But Reeves has now made her pitch about who needs to pay and why, and intends to stick to it.</p> <p>In truth, the biggest threat to this government and its pact with the voters is unlikely to come from any tax backlash \u2013 from Jeremy Clarkson, James Dyson or the CBI. Nor is it from the conspiracy-adjacent fad for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/21/rachel-reeves-bank-england-cv-chancellor\">factchecking</a> Reeves\u2019s CV.</p> <p>Instead, the real threat lies in the promise of what those taxes, and the increased public sector borrowing, are meant to buy, which is better public services and a stronger economy.</p> <p>Some of the risks were already evident on the morning after the budget. Public spending totals look eyewateringly tight towards the back end of the parliament, and the government will have to make its money go further to deliver tangible improvements.</p> <p>Wes Streeting\u2019s plans for NHS revival will be critical. So too will delivery across a whole range of other public services. But even the most optimistic Labour insiders are conscious that they also need to deliver on the promise of stronger economic growth, and here the early omens are unsettling.</p> <p>GDP apparently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/15/uk-economy-third-quarter-2024-ons-labour#:~:text=Month%2Don%2Dmonth%20GDP%20shrank,a%20rise%20in%20car%20sales.\">contracted in September</a>; the PMIs, which measure business sentiment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/22/retail-sales-fell-in-october-great-britain-amid-pre-budget-uncertainty\">slipped into the red</a> this month, with some quick to blame the budget. Inflation is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/20/uk-inflation-rises-delay-interest-rate-cut-price-rises\">drifting up</a>. Business groups are poised to blame the government for clobbering them with extra costs.</p> <p>Labour has big plans for growth, but many of the major structural changes it has promised \u2013 on planning, infrastructure, industrial strategy, labour market reform, devolution \u2013 are yet to be fully fleshed out. It is early days, and yet, given how long reforms like these need to take effect, time is so short.</p> <p>Similarly, the limited nature of changes to the UK-EU relationship envisaged in Labour\u2019s manifesto means that they would be likely to have little impact on growth. Reeves has sometimes appeared to hint at something more ambitious, involving aligning with EU rules in key sectors. </p> <p>Without early dividends from its reforms, whether Labour is given the benefit of the doubt to crack on with \u201cfixing the foundations\u201d, as Starmer loves to call it, may well depend on what happens to economic growth and living standards in the shorter term.</p> <p>And that is far from entirely in Labour\u2019s hands. The jolt to public spending should shore up growth in the coming months, but Donald Trump\u2019s imminent arrival in the White House is causing angst among policymakers, the geopolitical outlook is distinctly shaky and the EU economy, still the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner, looks fragile.</p> <p>Labour has a story to tell about the budget, which it is rightly sticking to. But it will be harder to shape the narrative if the longed-for growth fails to materialise. As Trump prepares to arrive in the White House, a perilous period lies ahead.</p>",

In particular, the \u201chero voters\u201d they are fixated with, including Tory-to-Labour switchers they are keen to hang on to at a future general election, apparently liked what they saw. That long summer pause, after Reeves issued a gloomy warning about the \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d she had uncovered in the public finances, is blamed by business groups for holding back investment and depressing confidence for months. Even Labour\u2019s supporters spent a queasy few weeks contemplating the cut to the winter fuel allowance and wondering what fresh horrors loomed. But in the minds of Labour strategists, those bleak weeks were vital pitch-rolling: the public approached the budget expecting the worst. With no increase in fuel duty (despite the government\u2019s avowed green credentials) and the national insurance increase levied on employers rather than directly on their staff, the bottom line for most voters was: no change. Labour\u2019s research suggests that voters accept someone had to pay for a much-needed increase in public spending and are glad it wasn\u2019t them, at least not directly. \u201cPeople do get this argument that NICs will be felt in other ways. But where that takes you is \u2018give them a break, they\u2019ve got to find the money from somewhere\u2019,\u201d says one senior party strategist. Some insiders believe that even had Reeves not boxed herself in by promising not to raise the three major direct taxes \u2013 national insurance, income tax and VAT \u2013 there is no democratic consent at this moment for increasing taxes on individuals. They cite populist arguments against spending on areas such as international aid, green projects and the war in Ukraine (Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party says it would halve international aid spending, for example). Of course, we can never know how the electorate would have responded to a party that stated clearly in advance that a major uplift in public investment was necessary, and set out how they would pay for it, since Labour didn\u2019t dare try. But Reeves has now made her pitch about who needs to pay and why, and intends to stick to it. In truth, the biggest threat to this government and its pact with the voters is unlikely to come from any tax backlash \u2013 from Jeremy Clarkson, James Dyson or the CBI. Nor is it from the conspiracy-adjacent fad for factchecking Reeves\u2019s CV. Instead, the real threat lies in the promise of what those taxes, and the increased public sector borrowing, are meant to buy, which is better public services and a stronger economy. Some of the risks were already evident on the morning after the budget. Public spending totals look eyewateringly tight towards the back end of the parliament, and the government will have to make its money go further to deliver tangible improvements. Wes Streeting\u2019s plans for NHS revival will be critical. So too will delivery across a whole range of other public services. But even the most optimistic Labour insiders are conscious that they also need to deliver on the promise of stronger economic growth, and here the early omens are unsettling. GDP apparently contracted in September; the PMIs, which measure business sentiment, slipped into the red this month, with some quick to blame the budget. Inflation is drifting up. Business groups are poised to blame the government for clobbering them with extra costs. Labour has big plans for growth, but many of the major structural changes it has promised \u2013 on planning, infrastructure, industrial strategy, labour market reform, devolution \u2013 are yet to be fully fleshed out. It is early days, and yet, given how long reforms like these need to take effect, time is so short. Similarly, the limited nature of changes to the UK-EU relationship envisaged in Labour\u2019s manifesto means that they would be likely to have little impact on growth. Reeves has sometimes appeared to hint at something more ambitious, involving aligning with EU rules in key sectors. Without early dividends from its reforms, whether Labour is given the benefit of the doubt to crack on with \u201cfixing the foundations\u201d, as Starmer loves to call it, may well depend on what happens to economic growth and living standards in the shorter term. And that is far from entirely in Labour\u2019s hands. The jolt to public spending should shore up growth in the coming months, but Donald Trump\u2019s imminent arrival in the White House is causing angst among policymakers, the geopolitical outlook is distinctly shaky and the EU economy, still the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner, looks fragile. Labour has a story to tell about the budget, which it is rightly sticking to. But it will be harder to shape the narrative if the longed-for growth fails to materialise. As Trump prepares to arrive in the White House, a perilous period lies ahead.",

      "bodyText": "Young people who refuse to take up jobs or training will lose their benefits in the government\u2019s crackdown on worklessness, Liz Kendall has said. The work and pensions secretary said on Sunday: \u201cIf people repeatedly refuse to take up the training or work responsibilities, there will be sanctions on their benefits.\u201d Asked on Sky News\u2019s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips if this meant losing those benefits, Kendall replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Ministers are preparing to announce sweeping changes to the welfare system and out-of-work support next week. It forms part of a drive to get more people into work and cut the government\u2019s welfare bill, which has ballooned since the Covid crisis. \u201cThe reason why we believe this so strongly is that we believe in our responsibility to provide those new opportunities, which is what we will do,\u201d Kendall told Sky. \u201cWe will transform those opportunities, but young people will be required to take them up, just as they did in the late 1990s with the new deal for young people, and the late noughties with the future jobs fund, because it is so damaging for young people not to have skills or not to be in work.\u201d Kendall added: \u201cI do not want an ever increasing benefits bill spent on the cost of failure, people trapped out of work, terrible for their life chances, and paid for by the taxpayer.\u201d She said there were nearly a million young people \u2013 one in eight \u2013 who were not in education, employment or training. Asked on the BBC\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg whether there were people who could work but did not work, Kendall said: \u201cYes.\u201d She said: \u201cI know from speaking to our job coaches, our fantastic job coaches in jobcentres, that there are people who could work, who aren\u2019t. But I think they are in the minority.\u201d Kendall said some people who were out of work had \u201cself-diagnosed\u201d mental health problems, though she stressed there was a \u201cgenuine problem with mental health in this country\u201d. She set out plans to overhaul apprenticeships and jobcentres in an attempt to reduce the number of people who are out of work. In an interview with the Observer, Kendall said jobcentres had become a hollowed-out \u201cbenefit administration service\u201d that was no longer \u201cfit for purpose\u201d and was being shunned by employers and jobseekers alike. \u201cEmployers are desperate to recruit,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cPeople are desperate to earn money and get on in their jobs. So we need big change. We need to see change in our jobcentres from a one-size-fits-all benefit administration service to a genuine public employment service.\u201d In an article in the Mail on Sunday, Keir Starmer vowed to \u201cget to grips with the bulging benefits bill blighting our society\u201d in \u201cthe biggest overhaul of employment support in memory\u201d. But he promised not to \u201ccall people shirkers or go down the road of division\u201d and said that instead ministers would \u201ctreat people with dignity and respect\u201d. \u201cNext week, my government will set out radical reforms to get Britain working. No more business as usual,\u201d the prime minister wrote. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get me wrong, we will crack down hard on anyone who tries to game the system, to tackle fraud so we can take cash straight from the banks of fraudsters. There will be a zero-tolerance approach to these criminals.\u201d",

Australia briefly revived after lunch to pinch four wickets but that was as good as it got for them.</p> <p>India\u2019s dominant display was led by a magnificent 161 by Yashasvi Jaiswal and a return to form for Virat Kohli who was unbeaten on 100. Wonderful support innings from KL Rahul (77), Devdutt Padikkal (25), Washington Sundar (25) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (38) took them to 487 for 6 \u2013 a record total against Australia in Australia.</p> <p>India then finished it in dramatic style with three wickets in four overs, Jasprit Bumrah turning Nathan McSweeney\u2019s first Test into a nightmare (10 &amp; 0) and then shooting-out Marnus Labsuchagbne (3) with the final ball of the day. In between, Mohammed Siraj found Pat Cummins\u2019 (2) edge after the skipper bravely came out as nightwatchman.</p> <p>Australia has finished the day in disarray at 12 for 3 needing 522 runs to win.</p> <p>They face further humiliation tomorrow as a record home defeat looms. Hard questions will be asked about their casual preparations for this important series, their flat body language in the field, and their disappointing play in all facets of the second dig \u2013 negative batting, rusty bowling, sloppy fielding and dodgy leadership from the senior men.</p> <p>It\u2019s been painful to watch if you\u2019re an Australian fan, glorious if you\u2019re cheering Team India. But we go again tomorrow. Perhaps this strange Test has some twists left in it? For now we must call time and retreat with a stiff drink and much to think on.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Geoff\u2019s report from Perth: Australia has suffered an extraordinary day of punishment with bat and ball in Perth are now on the brink of a heavy and humiliating defeat. Despite being without several of their key stars, India have been superb, recovering from their early skittling for 150 in the first innings on day one to dominate every session of the Test thereafter. Australia briefly revived after lunch to pinch four wickets but that was as good as it got for them. India\u2019s dominant display was led by a magnificent 161 by Yashasvi Jaiswal and a return to form for Virat Kohli who was unbeaten on 100. Wonderful support innings from KL Rahul (77), Devdutt Padikkal (25), Washington Sundar (25) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (38) took them to 487 for 6 \u2013 a record total against Australia in Australia. India then finished it in dramatic style with three wickets in four overs, Jasprit Bumrah turning Nathan McSweeney\u2019s first Test into a nightmare (10 &amp; 0) and then shooting-out Marnus Labsuchagbne (3) with the final ball of the day. In between, Mohammed Siraj found Pat Cummins\u2019 (2) edge after the skipper bravely came out as nightwatchman. Australia has finished the day in disarray at 12 for 3 needing 522 runs to win. They face further humiliation tomorrow as a record home defeat looms. Hard questions will be asked about their casual preparations for this important series, their flat body language in the field, and their disappointing play in all facets of the second dig \u2013 negative batting, rusty bowling, sloppy fielding and dodgy leadership from the senior men. It\u2019s been painful to watch if you\u2019re an Australian fan, glorious if you\u2019re cheering Team India. But we go again tomorrow. Perhaps this strange Test has some twists left in it? For now we must call time and retreat with a stiff drink and much to think on. Thanks for your company today and stay tuned for Geoff Lemon\u2019s match analysis coming soon. Over and OUT! Labuschagne is GONE! What a day for India. They have destroyed Australia with the bat and now they\u2019ve brutalised them with the ball. Australia are three down and, barring a dead-set miracle, are heading for abject defeat in the first Test. 5th over: Australia 12-2 (Khawaja 3, Labuschagne 3) Final over. But it\u2019s from Jasprit Bumrah so anything could happen. First ball is angled in but Labuschagne fends it to cover. No run. Second ball is faster, straighter, lower and Labuschagne misses\u2026 this looks plum LBW. An awful non-shot by Labuschagne and it looks dead straight on middle but Marnus reviews it. Yep, it\u2019s hitting top of middle. 4th over: Australia 12-2 (Khawaja 3, Labuschagne 3) Here comes Marnus, whose skipper surely indulges him too much. First he gets six bowling overs for India to gorge on, then he gets to sit in the stands while Captain Pat walks into the furnace. Anyway, he\u2019s out there now. And after watching a couple and exchanging a few words with Siraj he thunks a three which pulls up short of the boundary. Cummins falls! Oh no, he didn\u2019t need to play at that. Siraj hung it out there and the Australian skipper went after it with hard hands and Kohli gobbled up the edge. 3rd over: Australia 9-1 (Khawaja 3, Cummins 2) India have had their feet up for the best part of two days while Australia toiled in the sun. Unlike the Australians, their body language looks superb, lots of chatter, pats on the back and hand gesticulating. Cummins biffs one down the ground to get a single. Bumrah puts a rare bad ball down leg side and it runs for four 2nd over: Australia 4-1 (Khawaja 3, Cummins 1) Khawaja finally faces up but his over is from Mohammed Siraj. Sure enough he strokes three runs through covers. Now Cummins, showing the leadership his men so sorely need, faces up\u2026 almost gets an edge! Swing for Siraj. India have their tail up and the crowd are abuzz. The skipper taps a single to retain sgtrike to Bumrah. Captain v captain coming up. 1st over: Australia 0-1 (Khawaja 0, Cummins 0) Brave leadership from Cummins. No one wants to come out so he dons the pads and faces the music as nightwatchman. I;\u2019m dirty on Khawaja, a 74-Test veteran, for letting McSweeney face that first over from the Indian captain, a bowler in the form of his life. Lamb to the slaughter. Plum LBW! India strike. Can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you, Nathan. The ball stayed low and McSweeney chopped down too late just as he did in the first dig. Australia reeling. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (McSweeney 0, Khawaja 0) Bumrah goes wide on the first one. McSweeney watches it pass. Second one hits the channel but no need to play. TRhree card trick coming up. Watch out, Nathan\u2026 Players are out and Nathan McSweeney is going to face up to Jasprit Bumrah. Brave lad but dubious senior leadership from Khawaja for mine. Here we go\u2026 Virat Kohli\u2019s 30th Test century brings to an end a day of glory for India and agony for Australia. They must now make Test cricket history and chase down 533 for victory. We have roughly 20 minutes of play left and it will be torrid. Australia\u2019s debutant opener Nathan McSweeney is about to get the fiercest baptism imaginable in Test cricket. An exultant Kohli has paid tribute to his wife: Anushka has been right by my side through thick and thin. She knows everything that goes on behind the scene, what goes on in the head when you don\u2019t play as well, you make a few mistakes after getting yourself in. I just wanted to contribute to the team\u2019s cause, I don\u2019t want to hang around just for the sake of it, I take pride in performing for the country. Feels amazing, the fact that she\u2019s here makes it more special Kohli swipes for FOUR to bring up a magnificent century and India declare at 487 for 6. That is a fine innings from a fantastic batsman. Labuschagne tossed it up short and juicy with a big red bow on it and Kohli gave it what it deserved, sending it to the fence where Head\u2019s valiant attempt to save the boundary fell short. A second of indecision as the umpires confer and then the arms go up and that 200-watt smile lights up Perth Stadium. 134th over: India 480-6 (Kohli 95, Nitish 37) Nitish takes a single from Lyon\u2019s first to get Kohli on strike. The decibel levels rise at Perth Stadium. Cummins and Lyons confer and the crowd jeer. Lyon delivers a scooting delivery that shaves Kohli\u2019s laces. Smiles all round as this Perth pitch continues to bamboozle everyone. The King takes a single. Next man in Jasprit Bumrah is removing his pads, a sure sign India will wait for Kohli\u2019s to and then declare to give themselves a hot half hour at the Aussies. 133rd over: India 478-6 (Kohli 94, Nitish 36) Labuschagne returns, this time bowling spin. He has 0-20 from five overs. Kohli takes a single to get himself is one stroke from a century. There\u2019s a replay for a stumping but Nitish has his foot firmly grounded. And now he grounds it even more firmly, stepping down and thundering it down the ground for SIX. He goes again on the fifth but doesn\u2019t middle it. Marnus is barking orders to his fielders trying to bleed time but it\u2019s only prolonging the agony. Eleven from the over. 132nd over: India 467-6 (Kohli 93, Nitish 27) Kohli has averaged just 22 from his last six Tests. But Australia\u2019s bowlers have played him back into form today and a famous century is now in the offing. Nitish takes a single from Lyon to get Kohli on strike. Fifty partnership is up for these two. Make that 54 as Kohli reverse sweeps fine for another FOUR. Kohli is in the 90s but he looks anything but nervous. He cuts for a single. Nitish gets him back on strike with ease and Kohli swats down the ground for another run. Big over coming up. 131st over: India 459-6 (Kohli 87, Nitish 25) Things are about to get worse for Australia. Marnus Labuschagne is back on to bowl. As if Australia could humiliate themselves even more. Sure enough his first ball is short and wide and results in a bye. His second is an absolute buffet ball and Kohli swipes it to the boundary for FOUR. And now Kohli goes again, stepping down and carting Marnus to the mid-on boundary for FOUR. The crowd are roaring the King on as the lead rattles past 500. Labuschagne gives him width on the final ball and Kohli takes two. Eleven runs from an abysmal over. 130th over: India 447-6 (Kohli 77, Nitish 25) After four, four, four in the last over, this one from Lyon starts with SIX! Beautifully dispatched down the ground by Kohli with one knee on the deck. There\u2019s a lot of waving going on in the Indian dugout. Are thery about to declare or are they cheering on Kohli to a century? 129th over: India 440-6 (Kohli 76, Ntish 24) A tired Bison rumbles in for a 12th over and after giving up two leg byes and a single he manages to convince his captain to challenge an LBW decision. Computer says no. It\u2019s on a seventh stump line Terrible review, Australia. BANG! goes Nitish for a magnificent FOUR in front of square. CRASH goes Nitish to the next one, this time through covers. WALLOP goes Nitish to the last, this time it\u2019s a pull shot that rattles into the rope. That\u2019s 15 from the over and India lead by 486. 128th over: India 425-6 (Kohli 70, Ntish 11) Thanks Jonathan \u2013 great call as always. Nathan Lyon has the grim task of trying to extract Virat Kohli before the great man notches his 30th Test century. \u2018The King\u2019 curreently has 70 from 121 deliveries and Australia have notched 50 extras in an innings for the first time since 2001. 127th over: India 423-6 (Kohli 68, Ntish 10) Matthew Hayden is about to re-enter the commentary box and I think that\u2019s my cue. As Haydos once said \u201cthe game stands on the coalface of anticipated change\u201d and that makes about as much sense as Australia\u2019s performance this innings. To go out with a bang, Ntish hits a whopping six as I hand back to Angus. A wild swing from Sundar and he\u2019s clean bowled. Lyon deserved that. 125th over: India 406-5 (Kohli 66, Washington 27) More overthrows from the Australians, which reflects the sloppiness and lethargy that\u2019s been evident for two days now. Marsh is toiling hard but this pair is picking him off with ease. Once again, only the slow outfield denies Washington a boundary. 122nd over: India 396-5 (Kohli 62, Washington 20) A glorious cover drive to kick things off from Kohli, straight from the textbook. Starc keeps tempting him outside off stump and the champ is more than happy to take him on. 121st over: India 390-5 (Kohli 56, Washington 20) Washington\u2019s dancing and chopping but Lyon\u2019s bowling well and keeping him in check. The spinner deserves a few breaks. 121st over: India 389-5 (Kohli 55, Washington 20) This pitch is acting very peculiarly now. Starc\u2019s fourth delivery rolls straight along the ground. Shades of the MCG in the early 1980s. One thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 this ain\u2019t a pitch to be chasing 450 plus on. 120th over: India 388-5 (Kohli 54, Washington 20) This has been Kohli\u2019s 31st test half century, to go with his 29 tons. He and Washington have put on 67 and steadied the ship after the Indians were starting to look a bit shaky. 119th over: India 387-5 (Kohli 53, Washington 20) This has been a real slog for Starc, with figures of 1/104. He looks absolutely knackered. 118th over: India 385-5 (Kohli 52, Washington 19) Lyon has the less than convincing Washington poking and dabbing but the Aussie just can\u2019t take a trick. A very impressive response from the Indian star after a long, lean patch. He\u2019s been tied in knots at times by Lyon but he\u2019s otherwise been loose, compact and composed. A welcome return to form from the King. 116th over: India 377-5 (Kohli 49, Washington 14) This pitch is turning viciously at times now. Lyon v Kohli is an intriguing battle but Lyon just can\u2019t buy any luck. 115th over: India 375-5 (Kohli 47, Washington 14) India lead by 421 and no team has ever chased that much to win a test match. No pressure at all lads. A couple of tired bouncers from Cummins to complete the over. 114th over: India 375-5 (Kohli 47, Washington 14) Some excellent, albeit unrewarded bowling from Lyon, who also concedes four byes after a violently turning ball bamboozles both batter and keeper. 113th over: India 368-5 (Kohli 45, Washington 14) Four more byes, though it\u2019s hard to apportion blame to keeper Carey. Some wild bowling from the Australian skipper, who then concedes four more courtesy of an inside edge. 111th over: India 359-5 (Kohli 40, Washington 14) Largely uneventful over from Cummins as play resumes, shadows loom and India look to build lead. A teatime shoutout to some of our loyal readers, including Paul Moody, who\u2019s living it up in Kampot in Southern Cambodia and Simon Land. Both, to their credit, concur with my thoughts on the commentary of the Big \u2018Dos. Also to Finbar Anslow who\u2019s in beautiful Piedmont, where it\u2019s currently 2 degrees. I\u2019m sensing a bit of schadenfreude from our overseas readers at the current plight of the Aussie team. India head to tea 405 runs the better, with five wickets in hand. Australia had signs of positivity in the first part of this session, but the visitors have since reasserted control. Kohli is nearing his much needed half century at a swift rate and Sundar is rotating the strike with aplomb. They added 84 runs for the loss of four wickets in this session, but they couldn\u2019t be better placed to win this test match. 109th over: India 358-5 (Kohli 40, Washington 13) Hazlewood hits one of those Perth cracks that are beginning to open up. Jasprit Bumrah would be licking his lips watching that. Good tight bowling from the Aussie, who has been a standout. 108th over: India 358-5 (Kohli 40, Washington 13) India\u2019s lead is now 402 and they\u2019re just ticking along until the tea break. Australia has a period of optimism about an hour ago, but the visitors have consolidated. Ominously, Kohli has regained his confidence and touch. 107th over: India 355-5 (Kohli 38, Washington 12) Head is punted, Hazlewood re-enters the attack and Kohli flicks a sublime stroke through mid-wicket. Only the slow outfield denies him the boundary he deserves. One of the shots of the day from a man who has found his form and looks very comfortable right now. 106th over: India 352-5 (Kohli 35, Washington 12) A \u201cpandemic\u201d is how Matt Hayden describes the Indian loss to New Zealand. He\u2019s doing to the English language what he did to a bunch of Zimbabwean famers two decades ago. 104th over: India 350-5 (Kohli 34, Washington 11) More Head and more of the same. Easy singles for both batters. Any momentum Australia had seems to have gone. 103rd over: India 347-5 (Kohli 33, Washington 9) Lyon to Kohli is an intriguing little subplot. Kohli rolls his wrists and slog sweeps him for four, not usually a shot that\u2019s in his repertoire. 103rd over: India 343-5 (Kohli 29, Washington 9) Travis Head trundles in and the Indian pair handle him with ease, including a lofted six over mid-wicket from Sundar. A bit odd that Head is bowling with a relatively new ball here. 101st over: India 334-5 (Kohli 27, Washington 2) A contemptuous slash from Kohli over point that clears the rope and imperils the security guard. It\u2019s a risky caper working on the boundary when Kohli has his eye in. 100th over: India 326-5 (Kohli 20, Washington 1) India lead by 372. In the history of test cricket there\u2019s been four successful second innings run chases over 400. South Africa did it across the road at the Waca in 2008 but it would be some sort of effort given the current form of the Australian top order. 99th over: India 325-5 (Kohli 19, Washington 1) Starc returns and elicits some half chances, including a poky nothing shot from Kohli which just falls short of Smith, as well as a couple of shambolic, semi run out chances. 98th over: India 324-5 (Kohli 17, Washington 1) Some nice turn and flight from Lyon. The Australians were dragging their feet earlier today but look energised and sharp again. India\u2019s top scorer from the first dig is yet to bat however so they have plenty of depth. 97th over: India 321-5 (Kohli 16, Washington 0) Excellent over from Cummins after a tardy start. The Australians have 4-46 in this session so kudos to them after all looked lost. Cummings traps Jurel, who challenges the call. It\u2019s angling down leg but it\u2019s just tipping leg stump and that\u2019s enough. Cummins had him tied in knots leading up to that. 96th over: India 321-4 (Kohli 16, Jurel 1) Nathan Lyon enters the attack and strikes immediately. Wickets on the first ball of both sessions keeping Australians off the ledge here. Ludicrous shot from Pant and lovely bit of glovework from Carey. A rare failure from the Indian on Australian shores but this was a stinker. 95th over: India 320-3 (Kohli 16, Pant 1) As is his way, Pant charges his first ball from Marsh. Another sloppy Cummins delivery slips by Carey for four byes. Time for drinks and I\u2019ll be doing the same. India now 366 runs the better. Jaiswal picks out Steve Smith at backward point. It\u2019s a rank delivery, and a poor shot but what an innings. His first century in Australia and he\u2019s played a pivotal role in putting this test match beyond Australia\u2019s reach. 93rd over: India 312-2 (Jaiswal 161 Kohli 15) Another sumptuous straight drive from Kohli. Cummins, who\u2019s really struggling in this innings, needs to sort his length out. Jaiswal then pounds him through the covers for four. \u201cGotta say, they\u2019re pretty decent batting conditions,\u201d says Haydos, as the score reaches 2-312. 92nd over: India 301-2 (Jaiswal 155 Kohli 10) Hayden masters the art of saying the bleedin\u2019 obvious, and then repeating it thrice hourly. India, meanwhile, lead by nearly 350 runs. Kohli is seeing them well today, and will be desperate to cash in. A wild swing and a miss from Jaiswal is one of the few blemishes in an otherwise superb knock. 91st over: India 299-2 (Jaiswal 155 Kohli 9) Pat Cummins is into the attack and Big Haydos is into the commentary box, which doesn\u2019t always sit well with this columnist. Lovely cover drive from Kohli nets him three. Yaiswal slashes at a ball outside leg and that goes down as a missed chance by Carey, albeit an extremely difficult one. Such is this test match for the Aussies. 90th over: India 292-2 (Jaiswal 151 Kohli 6) Mitch Marsh returns after his injury concerns. Marsh still looks a bit proppy, and hasn\u2019t done a lot of bowling in recent times. It\u2019s a big ask to take on these two in such circumstances, in these conditions. Kohli flicks him off his pads for an easy single and Jaiswal follows suit. 89th over: India 288-2 (Jaiswal 150 Kohli 4) Some glorious straight drives in the previous over from Jaiswal but he\u2019s a lot more watchful here, with Hazlewood right on target. Outstanding from Jaiswal, who reaches his fourth 150 in a test match. When he reaches 100, he invariably goes on with him. Ten runs off the over 87th over: India 278-2 (Jaiswal 143, Kohli 1) Jaiswal is so compact, so utterly unfazed by opening after his first innings duck. Hazlewood continues to nag away, and he\u2019s been the best of Australia\u2019s bowlers by far today. But the baby faced Indian knows exactly what to leave, what to have a crack at and when to rotate the strike. Kohli is off the mark with a quick single and a rousing cheer. 86th over: India 276-2 (Jaiswal 142, Kohli 0) Young Jaiswal is not perturbed by losing his partner, and is fast approaching 150. Kohli persists with batting outside his crease but isn\u2019t the imperious figure of yore. A tight over from Starc who was far too loose earlier today. 85th over: India 275-2 (Jaiswal 141, Kohli 0) Excellent start for Australia but they\u2019re still 325 runs and eight wickets adrift mind you. A circumspect start by Kohli who needs to fill his boots here. He slashes at one outside off and is less than convincing. 84th over: India 275-2 (Jaiswal 141, Kohli 0) What a start for Australia and what a tussle we have now: Hazlewood v Kohli, The Hoff v The King. The volume has risen significantly now at Optus Stadium but Kohli is watchful to the first four. He flashes at the final ball but the fielder stops any runs. Great start to the new session. First ball of the session! Paddikal was fat and smug and sleepy after the break and he flashed at Hazlewood\u2019s juicy first delivery and caught the edge where Smith scooped it up down low. Australia strike ands here comes King Kohli. Something to contemplate over lunch courtesy of Gervase Greene in balmy Sydney\u2026 A fabulous ton by young Jaiswal, but I couldn\u2019t help noticing when he removed his gloves to acknowledge the crowd that he was sporting a watch on his left wrist. Perhaps he is timing his centuries to the minute - he is fast getting used to making them - but is it perhaps some canny product placement by (I think) a tech-company based in California? Another wonderful session for India. They really squeezed the life out of Australia, rattling off 103 runs to extend their lead past 300 and take the game well out of sight for the home side. The highlight of the morning has been the magnificent century by Yashasvi Jaiswal who brought up his fourth Test hundred with a cheeky ramp shot over slips for six. Even better, he went on with it, piling on another 41 runs to go to lunch unbeaten on 141. Fellow opener KL Rahul lent stellar support with 77 before Starc caught his edge. Even then the Australians didn\u2019t have the energy or brio to celebrate. On a sweltering 30+ day in Perth, Pat Cummins\u2019 men are hot and bothered and, to be honest, look a beaten side. They have nine Indian wickets to take and Virat \u201cKing\u201d Kohli waiting to bat next. Worse, allrounder Mitchell Marsh has been off the field for much of the morning with an injury that has prevented him from bowling and now threatens his ability to bat. With first-pick allrounder Cameron Green sidelined all season, that bad news could get worse if Marsh is unavailable for the second Test. But that\u2019s a dilemma for another day and Australia have a VERY long day ahead. Time to wet the whistle and grab a bite to eat. We\u2019ll be back with the second session soon. 84th over: India 275-1 (Jaiswal 141, Padikkal 25) Starc\u2019s first ball is wide and short and Padikkal slashes it to the rope for FOUR. The big quick responds with gusto, hitting the pitch a little harder and beating the edge. Starc throws down a yorker but Padikkal brings down the bat in time. And now he steps out cover drives elegantly for three. That makes it 103 runs added for the session and India in front by a whopping 321 runs. 83rd over: India 268-1 (Jaiswal 141, Padikkal 17) We\u2019ll get two overs before this session is done. Can Australia go to lunch with another wicket? Hazlewood thinks so. His first ball is fast and straight and it leaps at Padikkal awkwardly. Better by the Bendemeer Bullet! Next delivery has Padakkal similarly bamboozled. He\u2019s elected to come around the wicket and the angle is troubling young Padikkal who Hazlewood dismissed for a duck in the first dig. He gets away from strike with a single as Cummins fumbles at mid-on. 82nd over: India 267-1 (Jaiswal 141, Padikkal 18) Starc is on\u2026 but so is Jaiswal. On fire! Big Mitch threw down a loosener and Jaiswal stepped out and drove it downtown. Great shot young man! That\u2019s deflating for Australia. They are trying to snare a second wicket to expose Virat Kohli in the precious minutes before lunch and Starc, who gushed 11 from his first over today, has gift-wrapped another boundary to a batter who doesn\u2019t require any favours today. Fourth ball is over 140kph and Jaiswal nudges it through the cordon and McSweeney dives to save the boundary. Good fielding by the debutant. Final ball is a corker yorker but Jaiswal somehow keeps it out. 81st over: India 263-1 (Jaiswal 137, Padikkal 17) Josh Hazlewood gets first use of the new ball. The Hoff is coming over the wicket trying to exploit the off stump line that got Padikkal\u2019s wicket in the first innings. First ball is a peach but second is a rotten tomato. It flies down leg and Carey can\u2019t get a glove on it. Four byes. Oh no, another legside ball, even wider than the first, and it\u2019s way beyond Carey. Another four byes. That\u2019s very uncharacteristic by the reliably straight-shooting Hazlewood and it\u2019ll make for a cranky \u2018keeper over the lunch break. 80th over: India 255-1 (Jaiswal 137, Padikkal 17) It\u2019s the final over before the new ball is available and Travis Head is hunting his 13th Test wicket. Jaiswal taps a single and Padikkal does the same. Jaiswal eases two to deep backward point and Padikkal hands the strike back with a well-timed drop shot. Another single makes it six from the over. India are officially 301 runs in front with nine wickets in hand. That\u2019s a tough sentence to read let alone type. Is it a death sentence for Australia in this first Test? 79th over: India 247-1 (Jaiswal 133, Padikkal 15) Lyon resumes and Padikkal rolls the wrists nicely to find two more. That\u2019s it for now though. 78th over: India 247-1 (Jaiswal 133, Padikkal 13) Marnus madness is over for now and Travis Head has been given a bowl. This got one yesterday and it cost eight runs but he\u2019s the fastest route to the new ball right now so what the hell. And Jaiswal says the same, slapping two from last after five dots. That wasn\u2019t far from the hands of short cover. 77th over: India 245-1 (Jaiswal 131, Padikkal 13) Nathan Lyon is playing his 130th Test and chasing his 531st wicket. He has done his job for Australia so far, slowing the run rate. Padikkal plays out a maiden. 76th over: India 240-1 (Jaiswal 131, Padikkal 13) Labuschagne pesters his way into a second over as Australia try to hustle through overs and get to the new ball. With this partnership at 39 and the lead edging toward 300, they desperately need something. But not that. Marnus sends down a full toss and Padikkal gives it what it deserves and slaps it to the rope. Labuschagne follows it up with another short wide one down the legside. Final delivery is straighter and Padikkal works it off his hip for a run. India now lead by 291. Yeesh. 75th over: India 239-1 (Jaiswal 130, Padikkal 8) Normal service resumes with Lyon into his 17th over. He has 0-36 and is not finding much from the footmarks so far. Jaiswal strokes a single and Padikkal does likewise. There\u2019s a cut shot played to the fourth but it can\u2019t get past the fielder. Next one succeeds \u2013 three singles from the over. 74th over: India 236-1 (Jaiswal 128, Padikkal 7) I\u2019ve received a neatly timed email from Jeremy Henderson who writes: Around 20 minutes into each session, Marnus starts on at Pat Cummins, \u201cLet me bowl, let me bowl, let me bowl, etc...\u201d After 30 minutes of this, Pat responds \u201cIf you shut the hell up, I\u2019ll give you an over before the break\u201d. (We\u2019ve all dealt with annoying kids). Sure enough, Marnus has the ball. And sure enough, his first ball is horrible \u2013 short, wide and annoying. Labuschagne goes short again but this time it\u2019s straight. Padikkal is beaten by the third but Marnus goes short and wide again. And again. And again. 73rd over: India 234-1 (Jaiswal 127, Padikkal 7) Slapshot by Jaiswal and that\u2019s FOUR! He\u2019d been circumspect against Lyon until then but boy he broke the shackles in style, getting low and forward and sweeping beautifully to the boundary rope. Jaiswal takes two runs to backward square and a single to close out another profitable over. This partnership is at 33. 72nd over: India 227-1 (Jaiswal 120, Padikkal 7) Close\u2026 but no donut! Cummins bent his back and zeroed a ball at the bum fluff on Jaiswal\u2019s top lip. The youngster went to fend over slips and Smith\u2019s goalkeeping leap was just short of snaring the catch. It runs away for a single but good aggressive bowling from the Australian captain. 71st over: India 224-1 (Jaiswal 117, Padikkal 7) Nathan Lyon begins his 15th over with 0-28. Jaiswal taps a single from the first. Devdutt Padikkal \u2013 who stands a handsome 6ft 3in \u2013 uses his height and reach to smother five well-pitched balls without score. Tight bowling by the old man from Young. 70th over: India 223-1 (Jaiswal 116, Padikkal 7) Pat Cummins returns and Jaiswal tucks him away for a single. It\u2019s high noon here in Perth and temperatures are rising into the 30s. Cummins is wicketless so far and Padikkal clips him backward of square where substitute fielder Josh Inglis has to chase hard to save a boundary. Three runs means this partnership is already at 22 from 42 deliveries. 69th over: India 220-1 (Jaiswal 115, Padikkal 5) The GOAT is on. Nathan Lyon wheels in for his first over of the day and the 14th of this innings. And straight away he\u2019s on the button. Jaiswal plays forward and back but doesn\u2019t do anything silly. It\u2019s a maiden. 68th over: India 220-1 (Jaiswal 115, Padikkal 5) Almost a catch! Jaiswal attacked Cummins\u2019 first ball and it flew out to the rope but Head was standing too far infield and it cleared him easily and bounced over the boundary rope for FOUR. Jaiswal is entering T20 mode. With Nathan Lyon warming up on the rope, we might see fireworks before lunch here. Will Jaiswal go bezerk and try to beat his IPL record of fifty in 13 deliveries? 67th over: India 216-1 (Jaiswal 111, Padikkal 5) Inswinger by Starc and Jaiswal has to hustle to keep it out. In fact he squirts it for a single and gets a rueful grin from Starc. India now lead by 262 runs and King Kohli is padded up and coming in next. 66th over: India 214-1 (Jaiswal 110, Padikkal 4) After 10 runs from that last Starc over, Pat Cummins has injected himself into the attack. He starts this spell with 0-44 from 13 overs. Can he find a crack and bring Virat Kohli to the crease? Devdutt Padikkal is the new batter. He is off his \u2018pair\u2019 and strokes a single through backward point to get his younger partner back on strike. Jaiswal has 110 and is seeking his second double-century after the magnificent 214 not out he stroked against England earlier this year. 65th over: India 212-1 (Jaiswal 110, Padikkal 3) Bang! Jaiswal threw his hands at Starc\u2019s first ball and flashed it down to the third man boundary for FOUR. Superb batting. This is Jaiswal\u2019s 15th Test and he already has four centuries, eight fifties and a century in the high-fifties. Nor is Yashasvi Jaiswal solely a Test star. In 2023 he scored the fastest fifty in IPL cricket (13 balls!) for Rajasthan Royals and that same season became their youngest centurion at 21 years and 123 days in 2023, with a superb 124. What a star! 64th over: India 202-1 (Jaiswal 103, Padikkal 0) Now that\u2019s cocky! Jaiswal, still giddy from ramp shotting Mitchell Starc over the fine leg boundary to bring up his ton, tries it again from Hazlewood. This one doesn\u2019t come off but strewth, that\u2019s bold batting by the young gun who famously slept in tents and sold pani puri to earn pocket money en route to his dream of representing India. Finally a wicket! Good bowling by Starc. He switched the angle to come round the wicket and put the ball bang in the corridor of uncertainty. Rahul pushed too hard and it had enough bounce to beat the man and find the edge. Carey swooped forward to take the catch. Muted celebrations by the home side but after 201 runs they have first blood. 63rd over: India 201-0 (Jaiswal 102, Rahul 77) Starc strides in for his 15th over and Rahul takes a single and Jaiswal cuts hard for another. A scampered single and an overthrow bring up India\u2019s 200. That seems fitting. Australia have been sloppy in the field, missing run-outs and leaking singles. Another two to the total. India lead by 245. What a glorious way to ice an incredible century! Hazlewood dug it in short and the kid simply leaned back, took it off his chin and chipped it into the rope for a SIX. After a brief wait to confirm the maximum, the 22-year-old takes his helmet off and holds his arms aloft. Kohli gives him a standing ovation and a fist-pump from the dugout That is fourth Test hundred and his first in Australia. 62nd over: India 191-0 (Jaiswal 95, Rahul 74) Hazlewood enters his 13th over with the typically miserly figures of 0-15. Jaiswal edges the second ball short of slips. No run. Hazlewood digs the next one into the youngsters ribs and he gets tangled keeping it out. Good bowling by the Hoff. But that\u2019s great batting by Jaiswal \u2013 he has leaned back and lifted Hazlewood over slips for\u2026. SIX! That\u2019s his century and what a shot to bring it up! 61st over: India 191-0 (Jaiswal 95, Rahul 74) India have carted 17 runs from the first three overs \u2013 not the start Australia were looking for. Can Starc atone for the 11-run over last time around that took his figures to 54-0 from 13 overs? He leaks a single from the fourth ball as Rahul drops and runs for an easy single. A leg bye from the fifth means this pair have equalled the greatest opening stand for India against Australia. 60th over: India 189-0 (Jaiswal 95, Rahul 73) Here comes Hazlewood. A maiden would be so valuable for Australia now, anything to slow the progress of India\u2019s fast march to a 250-lead and fire a shot for a home side on the back foot. Four dots becomes five thanks to a diving save by McSweeney at a wide third. That atones for his error in the Starc over. Rahul squashes the maiden on the last, stepping out and cover driving for three. 59th over: India 185-0 (Jaiswal 95, Rahul 70) Starc is driven by Rahul and that\u2019s FOUR! Beautiful shot by the wicketkeeper-batter from Karnataka. Starc was a touch full and Rahul stepped out and smashed it to the rope. And now he drives again! This one doesn\u2019t have the heft to go all the way but it\u2019s three more runs and it takes Rahul to 70. And now Jaiswal brutalises Starc, chipping over slips for another boundary. Great batting India! Starc strikes back with the fifth, zipping it through a little quicker and beating the young man. Jaiswal takes another swing at the last but it\u2019s a swish. 58th over: India 174-0 (Jaiswal 91, Rahul 63) Josh Hazlewood rumbles in to Jaiswal and it\u2019s a sharp single to get us under way! That\u2019ll test the hamstrings. Great intent from India. Yesterday was a masterclass in running between wickets as the Indian pair \u2013 a right-hand, left-hand combination \u2013 rotated the strike and never let the Australian bowlers turn the screws on one individual. Rahul is beaten by Hazlewood\u2019s fourth ball as he pushes nervy hands at a perfectly pitched ball. Misfield by debutant McSweeney lets Rahul off the hook with an easy single. Here we go, folks. India\u2019s batting pair are taking the field and Pat Cummins is leading his men out to encouraging cheers. We have had record-breaking 30,000-plus crowds for days one and two and there are high hopes for another on a beautiful Perth day. Australia have 20 overs until the new ball is available. Can they put a dent in Jaiswal and Rahul with the old Kookaburra first and then crash through the rest with a fresh cherry? We\u2019re about to find out\u2026 Much is being made of the Australian\u2019s poor body language in the field yesterday \u2013 heads down, hands on hips, infrequent pats on the bum and curiously stilted tongues. A few commentators are asking who is responsible for revving up this Australia side now that gee-up man David Warner has retired. Which personality is best placed to light a fire under the Aussies when things are going awry, you reckon? Conditions are hot and dry in Perth and this mercurial pitch \u2013 a bowler\u2019s paradise on day one, batting nirvana on day two \u2013 looks a lighter shade of pale today. The green tinge of the opening day has gone and cracks are starting to open. Can Pat Cummins\u2019 men exploit those fractures and crack India\u2019s batting wide open? Two Australian openers have radically different outlooks on how day three will pan out. Matt Hayden forecasts a frenzy of wickets in this opening session. Greg Blewett predicts a hard day\u2019s slog in the field for Australia. Either way, Australia are in strife \u2013 218 runs behind already with an entire Indian batting side to dismiss. All this week we\u2019re remembering Phillip Hughes, Australian Test cricketer #408, who passed away this week 10 years ago. Jonathan Horn has penned this beautiful tribute\u2026 Geoff Lemon aka the Keanu Reeves of Cricket covered day two with customary aplomb. Here\u2019s how he saw the second day\u2019s action in Perth\u2026 Greetings cricket comrades! Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of day three in this compelling first Test between Australia and India in Perth. After a 17-wicket flurry on day one \u2013 the highest number of wickets to fall on the first day of a Test in Australia since 1952 \u2013 the familiar rhythms of Test cricket returned on day two, with bat reasserting itself over ball. Australia resumed at 7 for 67 and promptly lost Alex Carey to the first ball of the second over giving stand-in India captain Jasprit Bumrah his fifth wicket. Nathan Lyon followed soon after leaving Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood to put on a stoic 25-run partnership, hanging on until lunch to get Australia to a total of 104, 46 runs in arrears. With 20 wickets having fallen in four sessions, India\u2019s opening pair were expected to face a blitzkrieg from the Australian pace bowling cartel of Cummins, Starc and Hazlewood. Instead, Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul cruised to tea intact, then crunched their way to stumps to be unbeaten on 0 for 172 \u2013 the highest opening stand by an Indian pair in Australia. It gives India a commanding lead of 218 runs with all ten wickets in hand. Today Jaiswal resumes on 90 looking to score his maiden Test century in Australia. His partner Rahul has 62 and Australia are officially on the ropes. Will day three spring yet more surprises? Batten \u2018em down and buckle \u2018em up. We\u2019re about to find out\u2026",

      "bodyText": "Catholic women whose hopes of ordination were dashed at a recent worldwide synod in Rome are being urged to go on strike from church duties in protest at inertia on a reform that many now see as not only just but also inevitable. Catholic Women Strike: Global Witness for Equality was launched this month and is calling on women who are regular churchgoers, who work for the church on a voluntary basis or who have paid jobs with Catholic organisations to withhold their labour through Lent next year (5 March to 20 April). \u201cWe believe the time is ripe to demand what is right \u2026 Instead of waiting for a papal \u2018yes\u2019, we issue forth our \u2018no\u2019 to the systems of misogyny, sexism and patriarchy,\u201d says the campaign\u2019s website. For the last three years the Catholic church has been engaged in a worldwide synod on synodality, with people encouraged to take part in meetings at parish and diocesan level to focus on the future of the church. Women\u2019s issues, especially the need to allow women greater leadership roles and give them more of a voice in the running of the church, topped the agenda across the world. Pope Francis has twice, in 2016 and 2020, commissioned reports to study the history of women deacons. The findings were not publicised, but it is widely acknowledged that women have performed this role. Many believe that, once women are ordained as deacons, it will only be a question of time before they are also ordained as priests. The issue is urgent because fewer men, in Europe especially, are coming forward for ordination. Matters came to a head as the synod in Rome ended last month. Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, charged with heading a group on women\u2019s ministry, failed to attend an important meeting on the subject.

      "body": "<p>Greek myth is not a stable thing. There is no such thing as a canonical, \u201coriginal\u201d version of a Greek myth. The stories that remain to us \u2013 the material of classical plays and poetry, and of visual culture from pottery to pediments \u2013 are already elaborations and accretions. In the ancient Greek and Roman world, stories were adapted and remade to serve the needs of the moment. The Greek tragedians often took the germ of an idea from the Homeric epics, and built an entire plot from it. Aeschylus\u2019s <em>Agamemnon</em>, for instance, is in dialogue with Homer\u2019s <em>Odyssey</em>: both are stories of a warrior\u2019s return from war, but with entirely different outcomes. Euripides\u2019s subversive play <em>Helen</em> proposes that the entire Trojan war was fought not in the cause of a real woman, but of an illusory, fake version sent by the gods, while the \u201creal\u201d Helen of Troy sat out the siege in Egypt.</p> <p>Seen in this light, as novelist Pat Barker points out below, the modern appetite for working with (and maybe sometimes against) Greek myth is a part of a long continuum, rather than an innovation. Sometimes stories retold in the modern, or early modern, era have taken remarkably circuitous routes: Barker\u2019s choice, Shakespeare\u2019s <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, a love story from the Trojan war, came to the playwright not directly from a classical source, but indirectly through a winding lineage including Chaucer and Boccaccio that substantially transforms the story in the process. The artist Chris Ofili, who illustrated my book <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/greek-myths-9781529111118/\">Greek Myths: A New Retelling</a></em>, is one of the most mesmerising \u201cretellers\u201d of classical mythology. His deep artistic engagement with this world of stories began for him with Ovid\u2019s epic poem about mythical transformations, <em>Metamorphoses</em>, more than a decade ago. Emily Wilson\u2019s translation of Homer\u2019s <em>Odyssey</em> has also been important for him. But his paintings and drawings are, at the same time, deeply personal, infused with the landscapes and stories of the Caribbean, where he lives and works. Greek myths can travel endlessly through cultures, time and space. Kamila Shamsie\u2019s novel <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/home-fire-9781526679987/\">Home Fire</a></em>, set in modern Britain, Islamic State-controlled Syria and Pakistan, is a reworking of Sophocles\u2019s tragedy, <em>Antigone</em>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jul/07/constantine-cavafy-greek-poet-alexandrian-home\">Constantine Cavafy</a> \u2013 the great Greek poet who lived in Alexandria, Liverpool and Constantinople \u2013 infused Homer with his restless spirit in his great poem Ithaka, which is chosen by Stephen Fry, below.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rick Riordan\u2019s myth-inspired novels, the Percy Jackson series, for younger children, are an utter joy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The story of Orpheus and Eurydice \u2013 which had its richest ancient telling in Ovid\u2019s <em>Metamorphoses</em> \u2013 seems to be a never-failing power source for artists, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/16/anais-mitchell-interview-hadestown-musical\">Ana\u00efs Mitchell</a>, who used it in her score and book for the musical <em>Hadestown</em>, and who offers her own favourite classical reworking below. For Brie Larson, the Orpheus story has found intriguing expression in the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/15/baz-luhrmann-flamboyant-director-of-moulin-rouge-and-romeo-and-juliet-turns-focus-to-elvis\">Baz Luhrmann</a>: it is the riptide that flows beneath his film, <em>Moulin Rouge!</em>. The poet Alice Oswald has also selected a work of performance and storytelling based on the Orpheus myth, Ben Haggarty\u2019s <em>Orpheus Dismembered</em>. Oswald\u2019s poem <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/02/memorial-alice-oswald-review\">Memorial</a></em> is one of my most treasured retellings of Greek myth. It is a radical stripping-back of Homer\u2019s <em>Iliad</em>, in which almost all the material is removed except for the killing, on the battlefield, of its characters. The resulting work is a spare, monumental parade of the war dead, cut through with her versions of some of Homer\u2019s remarkable extended similes, which reach out beyond the combat zone to the natural world.</p> <p>Writer Daniel Mendelsohn has pointed to a novel that I also love: Mary Renault\u2019s 1958 book, <em>The King Must Die</em>, a brilliant retelling of the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, and proof that novelists have been working closely with mythical material well before the current generation of writers such as Madeline Miller and Barker. <em>The King Must Die</em> is also an important intertext for Rick Riordan\u2019s recommendation: Suzanne Collins\u2019s <em>The Hunger Games</em>, which plays with the Theseus myth refracted through <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/books/suzanne-collins-talks-about-the-hunger-games-the-books-and-the-movies.html\">Collins\u2019s reading of Renault\u2019s novel</a>. Collins\u2019s setting for her YA trilogy \u2013 a decadent, careless, wealthy \u201ccourt\u201d that enjoys the spectacle of young people fighting to the death \u2013 has a recognisable precursor in Renault\u2019s imagined court of Knossos. Riordan\u2019s own myth-inspired novels, the <em>Percy Jackson</em> series, for younger children, are an utter joy. I gave them all to my nieces when they were young, having read them cover-to-cover myself first \u2013 purely for quality-control purposes, of course.</p> <p>The question, so often, is why artists want to keep working with classical myth. It is partly because of that endless malleability: they are living stories, limber and flexible but also tough and durable, a wonderful material to work with. It\u2019s partly, too, because of what they deal with: love, death, heartbreak, reversals of fortune, grief, hatred, revenge, lust for power, desire \u2013 the human fundamentals at their most raw, their most bitter, and their most beautiful. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlottehiggins\">Charlotte Higgins</a></strong></p>    <h2>Pat Barker on Troilus and Cressida (1602), William Shakespeare\u2019s play inspired by the Iliad</h2> <p><strong>Booker prize-winning novelist</strong><strong> and author of a series of books telling the stories of women during the Trojan war, starting with </strong><strong>2018</strong><strong>\u2019s </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-silence-of-the-girls-9780241983201/\">The Silence of the Girls</a></strong></em></p> <p>Everybody talks about the retelling of Greek myths as being a recent event, but actually it\u2019s been a continuing dialogue for centuries. In 1598, when George Chapman published his translation of seven books of the <em>Iliad</em>, there was a very similar surge in interest to what we\u2019re having, and it produced a fascinating play. <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> was a retelling of the<em> Iliad</em> that was radically contemporary to that time. Several of the characters, notably Thersites, a syphilis-obsessed scumbag, are very much speaking the language you would hear in taverns \u2013 sexual slang of a very offensive kind, and the language Shakespeare would hear as he went about his business.</p>    <p>Achilles, who is very close to being a tragic hero in the <em>Iliad</em>, is in Shakespeare\u2019s play petulant, out of condition and dishonourable. He gets his men to kill Hector and then claims it as victory in single combat. The bit I remember about seeing it on stage for the first time is where the myrmidons, these barely human ant-men, surround Hector and kill him. And it\u2019s like the killing of a pig. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting. It fascinates me that Shakespeare was doing that in 1602, questioning the heroic values of war as they were presented in his own day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We turn to stories that are durable, that have stood the test of time, because we live in an era of disposable stories</p> <footer> <cite>Pat Barker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, Cressida is also a contemporary character: she\u2019s a bright, witty woman, rather brittle, and when she betrays Troilus and takes Diomedes as her lover, she is simply doing what she needs to do in order to survive in a situation in which she has no power. One of the features about the recent resurgence of interest in Greek myth has been the desire of women to reclaim the heroines of Greek myth and tell their story. And I am very much part of that, though I try to be a bit more hopeful.</p> <p>This was a play that was not much performed for a long time, but increasingly in the 20th century, and again in the 21st century, it seems to be speaking more powerfully to our contemporary preoccupations. The general atmosphere at the time of writing was not unlike the atmosphere of our own day. In times of cynicism, hopelessness and fear, I think we turn to stories that are durable, that have stood the test of time, because we live in an era of disposable stories. These stories were already old 2,500 years ago, when the <em>Iliad</em> first took the form in which we know it. Homer was drawing on an oral tradition which had already lasted and been meaningful for hundreds of years. <br><strong>As told to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kathryn-bromwich\">Kathryn Bromwich</a></strong></p>    <h2>Brie Larson on Moulin Rouge! (2001), a film inspired by Orpheus and Eurydice</h2> <p><strong>Academy Award-winning actor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/sep/17/brie-larson-to-make-her-west-end-debut-elektra-london\">to star</a> as </strong><em><strong>Elektra</strong></em><strong> at the </strong><strong>Duke of York\u2019s theatre in London\u2019s West End from 24 January 2025</strong></p> <p>I often wonder about the Greeks and how they were able to get to the bottom of the human experience. Since I was a child I was always drawn to their stories. I find them to be distilled capsules of life, and it\u2019s rewarding and sometimes shocking to realise that as much as we have progressed, we are still bound to pain and loss we cannot escape. The Greek myths are \u201call in\u201d on whatever they are: no words are minced. It reminds me that I am not alone.</p>    <p>Films like <em>Moulin Rouge!</em> were part of my journey in understanding allegory, and that there are core themes and stories we continue to retell. My mom was always great about taking me to the theatre to see movies she thought would inspire me. I must have been 10 or 11 when<em> Moulin Rouge! </em>came out, so I can\u2019t say I understood all of it, but it was an auditory and sensory experience that inspired me beyond belief. I had never seen anything like it. My mom then got it for me on DVD and I would watch it on a loop while I did my schoolwork.</p> <p>I love everything about the film: the cast is perfect, and the music is used as another metaphor for the story. The design makes it feel so over the top, like all of time is clashing at once. It feels eternal and progressive. When musicals work it\u2019s a straight shot to the heart, and this film has it all: colour, dance, heartbreak, humour. The celebration of the human spirit and our ability to continue to find meaning and love \u2013 even in tragedy \u2013 means so much. And it reminds me that I deeply want to do a musical.</p>    <h2>Chris Ofili on Emily Wilson\u2019s translation of the Odyssey (2018)</h2> <p><strong>Turner prize-winning artist whose work is frequently inspired by Greek mythology; he created nine prints for Charlotte Higgins\u2019s book </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.victoria-miro.com/store/publications/338/\">Greek Myths: A New Retelling</a></strong></em></p> <p>In late 2018, I went to visit my friend, curator Okwui Enwezor, in Munich as he approached the final months of his life. I spent the day with him, which was rare since we both had busy lives on different continents. The day was lovely and as it turned to evening, he said that he would like to read something to me. He read the first line: \u201cTell me about a complicated man \u2026\u201d and continued until, \u201cTell the old story for our modern times\u201d. This was the first page of Emily Wilson\u2019s translation of the<em> Odyssey</em> and I was hooked from then on. Wilson\u2019s translation is in iambic pentameter, which makes it familiar and easier to digest. It\u2019s close to the original text, but the translation reads so effortlessly.</p> <p>In the first page of the<em> Odyssey</em> it feels like it is all laid out: the whole poem in that first page. It was the words, \u201ca complicated man\u201d, that drew me in. Odysseus is a complicated man, an adventurous and restless traveller, a survivor: he isn\u2019t the type to remain in a state that won\u2019t feed his appetite for life. In book five he\u2019s apparently trapped on Calypso\u2019s island, Ogygia, for seven years. This is a beautiful island with a beautiful woman, an immortal goddess \u2013 they are there together with no distractions. I think Odysseus is comfortable with the outward image of him as suffering, but inwardly, I\u2019m prepared to imagine him having a wonderful time in that blissful setting. I loved Wilson\u2019s descriptions of the island and Calypso\u2019s cave surrounded by the fragrant forest. Her translation manages to capture the particular way Homer describes colour with similes, which inspired me to produce my own images.</p>    <p>After and while reading it, I made a series of drawings and paintings that led to my exhibition, Dangerous Liaisons, at David Zwirner gallery in New York. Along with Ovid\u2019s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, the Bible and, more recently, Biyi B\u00e1nd\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s <em>Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Boy Running</em>, it has helped me to think about the process of making images when reading \u2013 how to capture those images as they appear in the mind, as they float out of the text, before disappearing back into the printed word.</p> <p>Greek myths are stories of human beings, our psyche, and the aspects of us that are not limited to time: fears, desires, what gives us joy, danger, love, concepts of the immortal. These essential concerns and the performative aspect of the poem \u2013 they were, after all, written to be performed to an audience \u2013 will always speak to us.</p>    <h2>Stephen Fry on Ithaka by CP Cavafy (1911), a poem inspired by The Odyssey</h2> <p><strong>Author of </strong><em><strong>Mythos</strong></em><strong>, </strong><em><strong>Heroes</strong></em><strong> and</strong><em><strong> Troy</strong></em><strong>, a trilogy of books retelling the myths of ancient Greece</strong></p> <p><em>The Odyssey</em> is the beginning of human modernity. Suddenly, the greatest qualities a warrior could have were cunning, intelligence and curiosity, but also a sense of home \u2013 Odysseus is constantly striving to get back to his wife and son. There was something new in that. This idea of \u201c<em>nostos</em>\u201d \u2013 of returning home to the hearth after your wanderings \u2013 has been very powerful in the Greek imagination ever since.</p> <p>Early last century, there was a wonderful Greek poet living in Alexandria named Constantine Cavafy. I found out about him by reading EM Forster, who met Cavafy in Alexandria and recommended him to WH Auden and others. One of Cavafy\u2019s greatest poems is about Ithaca, the island which Odysseus spends 10 years trying to get back to. The poem is about this journey, this yearning to find the place that we think of as home, but Cavafy tells us that it\u2019s not worth anything. You must strive for it, he says, but you\u2019ll find it isn\u2019t the place itself that\u2019s the destination, it\u2019s the striving, it\u2019s what you learn on the way. It\u2019s the gorgeous things you find and the people you meet and the experiences you have. So you must aim for Ithaca and simultaneously know it\u2019s not worth getting to, because it will have nothing to give you. That\u2019s how the poem ends, in Edmund Keeley\u2019s terrific translation: \u201cIthaka gave you the marvellous journey./ Without her you wouldn\u2019t have set out./ She has nothing left to give you now.\u201d</p> <p>I think it\u2019s a very brilliant and moving poem, even in translation (I\u2019m sure if you were fluent in modern Greek it would be even more astonishing). It\u2019s an example of what the Greek myths can give us in terms of retellings. All the JRR Tolkien books are <em>nostos</em> stories, stories of returns home \u2013 <em>The Hobbit</em> is subtitled <em>There and Back Again</em>. It is the most mythic, primal, elemental story that we have. <strong>As told to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/killianfox\">Killian Fox</a></strong></p>    <h2>Ana\u00efs Mitchell on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0M-sPTc2P0\">Europa</a> by Santana, a 1976 song inspired \u2013 perhaps \u2013 by the rape of Europa</h2> <p><strong>Singer-songwriter, musician</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>writer of </strong><em><strong>Hadestown</strong></em><strong>, a musical based on </strong><strong>Orpheus and Eurydice</strong></p> <p>Something about Greek mythology being older than Christendom feels very healing. We recognise it in this very primal way. Europa was one of my dad\u2019s favourite songs \u2013 he would have played it for me as a kid in the 1980s. I must have listened a lot because there are parts of that melodic guitar journey that I will never forget: I could sing them now, and usually I\u2019m a words person \u2013 I don\u2019t listen to a lot of instrumental music. I remember at some point being interviewed about <em>Hadestown</em> and this memory arose spontaneously, of my dad playing that song for me and describing the myth of Europa. I had never processed how significant it might have been for my creative life. Beyond the obvious Greek and mythic implications, I think there was something about the marriage of music and storytelling in this song that had my heart from an early age.</p>    <p>The way my dad explained it, the music illustrates Zeus shapeshifting into a white bull and carrying the beautiful Europa off to the ocean. As a kid I pictured wind, salt, hooves flashing, long hair flying, running to sea. But the crazy thing is, when I looked up the song online, it seems it wasn\u2019t meant to illustrate the Europa myth at all. The title was almost irrelevant. It seems it was written after an encounter with a woman having a bad trip. (However, if you think about it, I guess Europa getting carried off on a white bull is kind of like a bad trip.) I hadn\u2019t realised the meaning was disputed \u2013 my dad\u2019s word was always the final one, until now. My dad certainly heard and felt that myth in this song. And I did too, by way of him. I\u2019m not going to mention this to him. Let him keep his own myth intact.</p>    <h2>Daniel Mendelsohn on Mary Renault\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-king-must-die-9781844089635/\">The King Must Die</a> (1958), a book inspired by Theseus and the Minotaur</h2> <p><strong>Professor, critic, editor-at-large of the </strong><em><strong>New York Review of Books</strong></em><strong>, </strong><strong>translator of Homer\u2019s </strong><em><strong>Odyssey</strong></em><strong>, and author of numerous books on Greek mythology</strong></p> <p>Even as a kid I was very interested in mythology. I first read this when I was 14 or 15 \u2013 Theseus is a kind of boy hero, and it\u2019s a coming-of-age story, so it was a good moment to encounter the book. The most appealing thing about it, to me, is that Mary Renault has a very fine sense of psychology. Before she wrote these ancient Greek novels, she had a very high reputation as a writer of contemporary novels, so she\u2019s trying to figure out ways to explain how the mythic version would have arisen from perfectly ordinary circumstances. So for example she solves the problem of the Minotaur being half-man, half-bull by having him be some sort of terrifying, totally human character who wears a ceremonial bull mask. And she has this brilliant idea of making Theseus rather short, so he has a Napoleon complex, and he\u2019s got to prove himself. It\u2019s those touches which make it feel like a novel and not just a fun romp through mythology.</p> <p>Renault\u2019s books certainly informed my own writing in the sense that they made the ancient Greek world feel very real to the reader. In my own work, I\u2019m always trying to bring the Greeks closer and to show how so much of this culture still lives with us. What the myths do is they take essential elements of human experience \u2013 victory, defeat, shame, betrayal, war, peace \u2013 and create a gripping narrative that makes you understand in a very visceral way. They\u2019re great delivery vehicles for some of the most important emotions and events that we experience in life. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so open for adaptation and reinterpretation. You can play with the particulars: the settings, the names, the decor, the time frame. But the bones are very striking, and hard, and they have endured. I think that\u2019s why we keep coming back to them. <strong>As told to KB</strong></p>    <h2>Rick Riordan on The Hunger Games (2008), a book inspired by Theseus and the Minotaur</h2> <p><strong>Bestselling author of the </strong><em><strong>Percy Jackson </strong></em><em><strong>and the Olympians</strong></em><strong> series, based on all aspects of Greek mythology</strong></p> <p>I was already a fan of Suzanne\u2019s earlier work when I got the chance to read <em>The Hunger Games</em> a few months before it was published. I knew immediately that she had tapped into something powerful \u2013 a new spin on a timeless story. As with the myth of Theseus, we see a subjugated people forced to send \u201ctributes\u201d to their overlords for yearly sacrifices. And as with the tale of the Labyrinth, our hero Katniss disrupts the cycle of oppression by subverting the game.</p>    <p><em>The Hunger Games</em> takes chances in all the right ways, but it resonates for the same reasons that the original myth does. Our hero is an underdog. Their country has been conquered by an aggressive imperialist power. The hero becomes a symbol of fighting against a system that would subjugate us, whether it is a foreign power or an overreaching domestic dictator. Unfortunately, the threat of tyranny and the need for heroes to stand against it is as real now as it was in ancient Greece. Collins\u2019s novels tap directly into this social anxiety, marrying the myth with our modern social media and reality TV culture, to show how easily oppression can be marketed as entertainment, and cruelty packaged as spectacle.</p> <p>Greek mythology is still relevant after all these millennia because it deals with the building blocks of the human experience. Every story is \u201ctrue\u201d, in the sense that it says something authentic and enduring about our nature. You can be fascinated and disturbed by the world <em>The Hunger Games</em> presents, whether or not you realise it is a version of Theseus\u2019s tale. The mythology well is old and deep, but the water that we draw from it tastes as cool and fresh as if it were newly created.</p>    <h2>Alice Oswald on <a href=\"http://benhaggarty.com/\">Ben Haggarty\u2019s</a> Orpheus Dismembered (2023), a play with music by Jonah Brody inspired by Orpheus and Eurydice</h2> <p><strong>Poet and professor of poetry, author of </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/memorial-9780571274185/\">Memorial</a></strong></em><strong>, a poetic reworking of Homer\u2019s the</strong><em><strong> Iliad</strong></em></p> <p>About a year ago, I was at the Cube in Bristol, listening to the story of Orpheus, the great lyre player and poet who could charm the plants from their places. I remember that the theatre contained a grove of young oak trees and one of them stepped forward. It was spring and the leaves of this oak were a rustling pinkish green. I can remember the curve of the moving tree, but the strange thing is, there were no trees in the theatre that night. What I saw was a hand gesture and a change of stance in the storyteller, and my imagination provided the rest.</p> <p>Ben Haggarty has spent 40 years learning this kind of hypnosis, from oral performers all round the world. When I asked him about the oak tree, he referred me to Gwydion, a Welsh magician who defeated a whole navy with a piece of seaweed draped on driftwood. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you describe Gwydion as a trickster or a poet. The point is that, under certain conditions, the imagination alters our sense data. When the sailors looked at Gwydion, they saw a fleet of armoured ships bearing down upon them and they fled.</p> <p>In Haggarty\u2019s telling, Orpheus married the moving oak tree, who had to sacrifice her divinity for the sake of love. Her name was Eurydice. She trod on a snake and died, and the story which follows is all about the strange relationship between music and the natural world. There is no point in reading that or indeed any other Greek myth in a book. You need to hear the music and see the tree step forward for yourself, and it takes a Haggarty or a Homer or a Gwydion \u2013 or Orpheus himself \u2013 to make that happen.</p>    <h2>Ferdia Lennon on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/19/o-brother-where-art-thou-revisiting-the-glory-and-silliness-of-the-coen-brothers-classic\">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a> (2000), a film inspired by The Odyssey</h2> <p><strong>Author of </strong><em><strong>Glorious Exploits</strong></em><strong>, retelling Homer\u2019s </strong><em><strong>Odyssey</strong></em><strong> using modern Irish vernacular</strong></p> <p>Although I love a good mythological retelling, what I like even more is transposition, where an aspect of a well-known myth or narrative is put somewhere it seemingly doesn\u2019t belong. I think the Coen brothers do this brilliantly here. The film brings its own distinct narrative to life by creating resonances with the<em> Odyssey</em>, which gives it an uncanny quality where you recognise and anticipate aspects of the structure and certain motifs, and yet they are altered. The gap between expectation and what unfolds on screen makes the film feel both fresh and pleasingly familiar.</p>    <p>I was 14 when I first saw <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em>. I hadn\u2019t read the<em> Odyssey</em><em> </em>at the time, yet, like many of us, I had a sense of the main narrative beats from the countless other retellings and pop culture references. After studying the<em> Odyssey</em> in university, I realised how loose a retelling the film really is, yet it still gets much of its power from the spine of myth that runs through it.</p> <p>I love the film\u2019s humour. Like with a lot of the best comedy, it has a vein of melancholy running through it, so although in one sense it\u2019s a whimsical farce, the overall impression is of something far richer. I also enjoy the constant, playful inversion. The wily trickster Odysseus becomes a con artist who is continually being duped. Constant Penelope, far from pining after her husband, insists, even upon his return, that he is actually dead as she eagerly anticipates her new marriage.</p> <p>The isolated rural setting plays into the<em> Odyssey\u2019s</em> loose, episodic structure. It\u2019s the archetypal journey narrative. It also riffs on most of the key sequences from the<em> Odyssey</em>: the initial escape, the sirens, the Cyclops, and the suitors. However, here the adversaries are not divinely instigated monsters but altogether more relatable human forces, like the poverty and racism of Depression-era Mississippi.</p>    <h2>Ella Hickson on Carrie Cracknell\u2019s production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/22/medea-carrie-cracknell-helen-mccrory-national-theatre-review\">Medea</a> at the National Theatre, 2014</h2> <p><strong>Award-winning playwright whose adaptation of </strong><em><strong>Oedipus</strong></em><strong>, starring</strong><strong> Rami Malek</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Indira Varma</strong><strong>, will be at the</strong><strong> Old Vic from 21 January 2025</strong></p> <p>The Greeks deal with the extremity of human emotion in an unflinching way. There is something hugely cathartic about witnessing a woman rocked by misery that she nurses into fury, a fury that she then acts on. She speaks for rageful women everywhere.</p> <p>This production of <em>Medea</em> gave full vent to female rage in a way so rarely seen on stage. Helen McCrory was exceptional. She really took on the full extremity of feeling that the Greeks demand. It never felt melodramatic, it remained rooted and credible \u2013 but jeez, the rage, the incredible burning rage, and the scheming and the tactics. It was incredible. She was tensile and fraught and agitated throughout. She carried the underworld of a woman rocked by grief and fury, she was so physical in her agony and energetic in her vengeance. She could switch from blind, spitting rage to calm, beguiling politician in seconds. The performance was masterly.</p>    <p>The update to the present day isn\u2019t total \u2013 the language remains archaic in some way and the setting is modern in its design, but Greek in its location (it\u2019s still set in a Corinth ruled by Creon). The hybrid works: the contemporisation allows us emotional access to the central character, but the historic elements, particularly the poetics of the chorus, allow for the depth and darkness found in the original myth. The movement was incredible: I remember specifically the dance of the new wife \u2013 she was like a broken doll. The chorus felt primal and powerful and authoritative, as if only a band of women were capable of understanding Medea\u2019s rage.</p> <p>What\u2019s so moving about re-watching it [on National Theatre at Home], is just how uniquely brilliant Helen was. Her range and versatility are spellbinding. The production is exquisite. I\u2019d forgotten the trees at the back, this primitive element \u2013 rooted and earthy, cutting against the sterile shop-window, glass box up top. It was beautiful.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Greek myth is not a stable thing. There is no such thing as a canonical, \u201coriginal\u201d version of a Greek myth. The stories that remain to us \u2013 the material of classical plays and poetry, and of visual culture from pottery to pediments \u2013 are already elaborations and accretions. In the ancient Greek and Roman world, stories were adapted and remade to serve the needs of the moment. The Greek tragedians often took the germ of an idea from the Homeric epics, and built an entire plot from it. Aeschylus\u2019s Agamemnon, for instance, is in dialogue with Homer\u2019s Odyssey: both are stories of a warrior\u2019s return from war, but with entirely different outcomes. Euripides\u2019s subversive play Helen proposes that the entire Trojan war was fought not in the cause of a real woman, but of an illusory, fake version sent by the gods, while the \u201creal\u201d Helen of Troy sat out the siege in Egypt. Seen in this light, as novelist Pat Barker points out below, the modern appetite for working with (and maybe sometimes against) Greek myth is a part of a long continuum, rather than an innovation. Sometimes stories retold in the modern, or early modern, era have taken remarkably circuitous routes: Barker\u2019s choice, Shakespeare\u2019s Troilus and Cressida, a love story from the Trojan war, came to the playwright not directly from a classical source, but indirectly through a winding lineage including Chaucer and Boccaccio that substantially transforms the story in the process. The artist Chris Ofili, who illustrated my book Greek Myths: A New Retelling, is one of the most mesmerising \u201cretellers\u201d of classical mythology. His deep artistic engagement with this world of stories began for him with Ovid\u2019s epic poem about mythical transformations, Metamorphoses, more than a decade ago. Emily Wilson\u2019s translation of Homer\u2019s Odyssey has also been important for him. But his paintings and drawings are, at the same time, deeply personal, infused with the landscapes and stories of the Caribbean, where he lives and works. Greek myths can travel endlessly through cultures, time and space. Kamila Shamsie\u2019s novel Home Fire, set in modern Britain, Islamic State-controlled Syria and Pakistan, is a reworking of Sophocles\u2019s tragedy, Antigone. Constantine Cavafy \u2013 the great Greek poet who lived in Alexandria, Liverpool and Constantinople \u2013 infused Homer with his restless spirit in his great poem Ithaka, which is chosen by Stephen Fry, below. The story of Orpheus and Eurydice \u2013 which had its richest ancient telling in Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses \u2013 seems to be a never-failing power source for artists, including Ana\u00efs Mitchell, who used it in her score and book for the musical Hadestown, and who offers her own favourite classical reworking below. For Brie Larson, the Orpheus story has found intriguing expression in the work of Baz Luhrmann: it is the riptide that flows beneath his film, Moulin Rouge!. The poet Alice Oswald has also selected a work of performance and storytelling based on the Orpheus myth, Ben Haggarty\u2019s Orpheus Dismembered. Oswald\u2019s poem Memorial is one of my most treasured retellings of Greek myth. It is a radical stripping-back of Homer\u2019s Iliad, in which almost all the material is removed except for the killing, on the battlefield, of its characters. The resulting work is a spare, monumental parade of the war dead, cut through with her versions of some of Homer\u2019s remarkable extended similes, which reach out beyond the combat zone to the natural world. Writer Daniel Mendelsohn has pointed to a novel that I also love: Mary Renault\u2019s 1958 book, The King Must Die, a brilliant retelling of the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, and proof that novelists have been working closely with mythical material well before the current generation of writers such as Madeline Miller and Barker. The King Must Die is also an important intertext for Rick Riordan\u2019s recommendation: Suzanne Collins\u2019s The Hunger Games, which plays with the Theseus myth refracted through Collins\u2019s reading of Renault\u2019s novel. Collins\u2019s setting for her YA trilogy \u2013 a decadent, careless, wealthy \u201ccourt\u201d that enjoys the spectacle of young people fighting to the death \u2013 has a recognisable precursor in Renault\u2019s imagined court of Knossos. Riordan\u2019s own myth-inspired novels, the Percy Jackson series, for younger children, are an utter joy. I gave them all to my nieces when they were young, having read them cover-to-cover myself first \u2013 purely for quality-control purposes, of course. The question, so often, is why artists want to keep working with classical myth. It is partly because of that endless malleability: they are living stories, limber and flexible but also tough and durable, a wonderful material to work with. It\u2019s partly, too, because of what they deal with: love, death, heartbreak, reversals of fortune, grief, hatred, revenge, lust for power, desire \u2013 the human fundamentals at their most raw, their most bitter, and their most beautiful. Charlotte Higgins Pat Barker on Troilus and Cressida (1602), William Shakespeare\u2019s play inspired by the Iliad Booker prize-winning novelist and author of a series of books telling the stories of women during the Trojan war, starting with 2018\u2019s The Silence of the Girls Everybody talks about the retelling of Greek myths as being a recent event, but actually it\u2019s been a continuing dialogue for centuries. In 1598, when George Chapman published his translation of seven books of the Iliad, there was a very similar surge in interest to what we\u2019re having, and it produced a fascinating play. Troilus and Cressida was a retelling of the Iliad that was radically contemporary to that time. Several of the characters, notably Thersites, a syphilis-obsessed scumbag, are very much speaking the language you would hear in taverns \u2013 sexual slang of a very offensive kind, and the language Shakespeare would hear as he went about his business. Achilles, who is very close to being a tragic hero in the Iliad, is in Shakespeare\u2019s play petulant, out of condition and dishonourable. He gets his men to kill Hector and then claims it as victory in single combat. The bit I remember about seeing it on stage for the first time is where the myrmidons, these barely human ant-men, surround Hector and kill him. And it\u2019s like the killing of a pig. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting. It fascinates me that Shakespeare was doing that in 1602, questioning the heroic values of war as they were presented in his own day. Of course, Cressida is also a contemporary character: she\u2019s a bright, witty woman, rather brittle, and when she betrays Troilus and takes Diomedes as her lover, she is simply doing what she needs to do in order to survive in a situation in which she has no power. One of the features about the recent resurgence of interest in Greek myth has been the desire of women to reclaim the heroines of Greek myth and tell their story. And I am very much part of that, though I try to be a bit more hopeful. This was a play that was not much performed for a long time, but increasingly in the 20th century, and again in the 21st century, it seems to be speaking more powerfully to our contemporary preoccupations. The general atmosphere at the time of writing was not unlike the atmosphere of our own day. In times of cynicism, hopelessness and fear, I think we turn to stories that are durable, that have stood the test of time, because we live in an era of disposable stories. These stories were already old 2,500 years ago, when the Iliad first took the form in which we know it. Homer was drawing on an oral tradition which had already lasted and been meaningful for hundreds of years. As told to Kathryn Bromwich Brie Larson on Moulin Rouge! (2001), a film inspired by Orpheus and Eurydice Academy Award-winning actor, to star as Elektra at the Duke of York\u2019s theatre in London\u2019s West End from 24 January 2025 I often wonder about the Greeks and how they were able to get to the bottom of the human experience. Since I was a child I was always drawn to their stories. I find them to be distilled capsules of life, and it\u2019s rewarding and sometimes shocking to realise that as much as we have progressed, we are still bound to pain and loss we cannot escape. The Greek myths are \u201call in\u201d on whatever they are: no words are minced. It reminds me that I am not alone. Films like Moulin Rouge! were part of my journey in understanding allegory, and that there are core themes and stories we continue to retell. My mom was always great about taking me to the theatre to see movies she thought would inspire me. I must have been 10 or 11 when Moulin Rouge! came out, so I can\u2019t say I understood all of it, but it was an auditory and sensory experience that inspired me beyond belief. I had never seen anything like it. My mom then got it for me on DVD and I would watch it on a loop while I did my schoolwork. I love everything about the film: the cast is perfect, and the music is used as another metaphor for the story. The design makes it feel so over the top, like all of time is clashing at once. It feels eternal and progressive. When musicals work it\u2019s a straight shot to the heart, and this film has it all: colour, dance, heartbreak, humour. The celebration of the human spirit and our ability to continue to find meaning and love \u2013 even in tragedy \u2013 means so much. And it reminds me that I deeply want to do a musical. Chris Ofili on Emily Wilson\u2019s translation of the Odyssey (2018) Turner prize-winning artist whose work is frequently inspired by Greek mythology; he created nine prints for Charlotte Higgins\u2019s book Greek Myths: A New Retelling In late 2018, I went to visit my friend, curator Okwui Enwezor, in Munich as he approached the final months of his life. I spent the day with him, which was rare since we both had busy lives on different continents. The day was lovely and as it turned to evening, he said that he would like to read something to me. He read the first line: \u201cTell me about a complicated man \u2026\u201d and continued until, \u201cTell the old story for our modern times\u201d. This was the first page of Emily Wilson\u2019s translation of the Odyssey and I was hooked from then on. Wilson\u2019s translation is in iambic pentameter, which makes it familiar and easier to digest. It\u2019s close to the original text, but the translation reads so effortlessly. In the first page of the Odyssey it feels like it is all laid out: the whole poem in that first page. It was the words, \u201ca complicated man\u201d, that drew me in. Odysseus is a complicated man, an adventurous and restless traveller, a survivor: he isn\u2019t the type to remain in a state that won\u2019t feed his appetite for life. In book five he\u2019s apparently trapped on Calypso\u2019s island, Ogygia, for seven years. This is a beautiful island with a beautiful woman, an immortal goddess \u2013 they are there together with no distractions. I think Odysseus is comfortable with the outward image of him as suffering, but inwardly, I\u2019m prepared to imagine him having a wonderful time in that blissful setting. I loved Wilson\u2019s descriptions of the island and Calypso\u2019s cave surrounded by the fragrant forest. Her translation manages to capture the particular way Homer describes colour with similes, which inspired me to produce my own images. After and while reading it, I made a series of drawings and paintings that led to my exhibition, Dangerous Liaisons, at David Zwirner gallery in New York. Along with Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, the Bible and, more recently, Biyi B\u00e1nd\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Boy Running, it has helped me to think about the process of making images when reading \u2013 how to capture those images as they appear in the mind, as they float out of the text, before disappearing back into the printed word. Greek myths are stories of human beings, our psyche, and the aspects of us that are not limited to time: fears, desires, what gives us joy, danger, love, concepts of the immortal. These essential concerns and the performative aspect of the poem \u2013 they were, after all, written to be performed to an audience \u2013 will always speak to us. Stephen Fry on Ithaka by CP Cavafy (1911), a poem inspired by The Odyssey Author of Mythos, Heroes and Troy, a trilogy of books retelling the myths of ancient Greece The Odyssey is the beginning of human modernity. Suddenly, the greatest qualities a warrior could have were cunning, intelligence and curiosity, but also a sense of home \u2013 Odysseus is constantly striving to get back to his wife and son. There was something new in that. This idea of \u201cnostos\u201d \u2013 of returning home to the hearth after your wanderings \u2013 has been very powerful in the Greek imagination ever since. Early last century, there was a wonderful Greek poet living in Alexandria named Constantine Cavafy. I found out about him by reading EM Forster, who met Cavafy in Alexandria and recommended him to WH Auden and others. One of Cavafy\u2019s greatest poems is about Ithaca, the island which Odysseus spends 10 years trying to get back to. The poem is about this journey, this yearning to find the place that we think of as home, but Cavafy tells us that it\u2019s not worth anything. You must strive for it, he says, but you\u2019ll find it isn\u2019t the place itself that\u2019s the destination, it\u2019s the striving, it\u2019s what you learn on the way. It\u2019s the gorgeous things you find and the people you meet and the experiences you have. So you must aim for Ithaca and simultaneously know it\u2019s not worth getting to, because it will have nothing to give you. That\u2019s how the poem ends, in Edmund Keeley\u2019s terrific translation: \u201cIthaka gave you the marvellous journey./ Without her you wouldn\u2019t have set out./ She has nothing left to give you now.\u201d I think it\u2019s a very brilliant and moving poem, even in translation (I\u2019m sure if you were fluent in modern Greek it would be even more astonishing). It\u2019s an example of what the Greek myths can give us in terms of retellings. All the JRR Tolkien books are nostos stories, stories of returns home \u2013 The Hobbit is subtitled There and Back Again. It is the most mythic, primal, elemental story that we have. As told to Killian Fox Ana\u00efs Mitchell on Europa by Santana, a 1976 song inspired \u2013 perhaps \u2013 by the rape of Europa Singer-songwriter, musician and writer of Hadestown, a musical based on Orpheus and Eurydice Something about Greek mythology being older than Christendom feels very healing. We recognise it in this very primal way. Europa was one of my dad\u2019s favourite songs \u2013 he would have played it for me as a kid in the 1980s. I must have listened a lot because there are parts of that melodic guitar journey that I will never forget: I could sing them now, and usually I\u2019m a words person \u2013 I don\u2019t listen to a lot of instrumental music. I remember at some point being interviewed about Hadestown and this memory arose spontaneously, of my dad playing that song for me and describing the myth of Europa. I had never processed how significant it might have been for my creative life. Beyond the obvious Greek and mythic implications, I think there was something about the marriage of music and storytelling in this song that had my heart from an early age. The way my dad explained it, the music illustrates Zeus shapeshifting into a white bull and carrying the beautiful Europa off to the ocean. As a kid I pictured wind, salt, hooves flashing, long hair flying, running to sea. But the crazy thing is, when I looked up the song online, it seems it wasn\u2019t meant to illustrate the Europa myth at all. The title was almost irrelevant. It seems it was written after an encounter with a woman having a bad trip. (However, if you think about it, I guess Europa getting carried off on a white bull is kind of like a bad trip.) I hadn\u2019t realised the meaning was disputed \u2013 my dad\u2019s word was always the final one, until now. My dad certainly heard and felt that myth in this song. And I did too, by way of him. I\u2019m not going to mention this to him. Let him keep his own myth intact. Daniel Mendelsohn on Mary Renault\u2019s The King Must Die (1958), a book inspired by Theseus and the Minotaur Professor, critic, editor-at-large of the New York Review of Books, translator of Homer\u2019s Odyssey, and author of numerous books on Greek mythology Even as a kid I was very interested in mythology. I first read this when I was 14 or 15 \u2013 Theseus is a kind of boy hero, and it\u2019s a coming-of-age story, so it was a good moment to encounter the book. The most appealing thing about it, to me, is that Mary Renault has a very fine sense of psychology. Before she wrote these ancient Greek novels, she had a very high reputation as a writer of contemporary novels, so she\u2019s trying to figure out ways to explain how the mythic version would have arisen from perfectly ordinary circumstances. So for example she solves the problem of the Minotaur being half-man, half-bull by having him be some sort of terrifying, totally human character who wears a ceremonial bull mask. And she has this brilliant idea of making Theseus rather short, so he has a Napoleon complex, and he\u2019s got to prove himself. It\u2019s those touches which make it feel like a novel and not just a fun romp through mythology. Renault\u2019s books certainly informed my own writing in the sense that they made the ancient Greek world feel very real to the reader. In my own work, I\u2019m always trying to bring the Greeks closer and to show how so much of this culture still lives with us. What the myths do is they take essential elements of human experience \u2013 victory, defeat, shame, betrayal, war, peace \u2013 and create a gripping narrative that makes you understand in a very visceral way. They\u2019re great delivery vehicles for some of the most important emotions and events that we experience in life. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so open for adaptation and reinterpretation. You can play with the particulars: the settings, the names, the decor, the time frame. But the bones are very striking, and hard, and they have endured. I think that\u2019s why we keep coming back to them. As told to KB Rick Riordan on The Hunger Games (2008), a book inspired by Theseus and the Minotaur Bestselling author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, based on all aspects of Greek mythology I was already a fan of Suzanne\u2019s earlier work when I got the chance to read The Hunger Games a few months before it was published. I knew immediately that she had tapped into something powerful \u2013 a new spin on a timeless story. As with the myth of Theseus, we see a subjugated people forced to send \u201ctributes\u201d to their overlords for yearly sacrifices. And as with the tale of the Labyrinth, our hero Katniss disrupts the cycle of oppression by subverting the game. The Hunger Games takes chances in all the right ways, but it resonates for the same reasons that the original myth does. Our hero is an underdog. Their country has been conquered by an aggressive imperialist power. The hero becomes a symbol of fighting against a system that would subjugate us, whether it is a foreign power or an overreaching domestic dictator. Unfortunately, the threat of tyranny and the need for heroes to stand against it is as real now as it was in ancient Greece. Collins\u2019s novels tap directly into this social anxiety, marrying the myth with our modern social media and reality TV culture, to show how easily oppression can be marketed as entertainment, and cruelty packaged as spectacle. Greek mythology is still relevant after all these millennia because it deals with the building blocks of the human experience. Every story is \u201ctrue\u201d, in the sense that it says something authentic and enduring about our nature. You can be fascinated and disturbed by the world The Hunger Games presents, whether or not you realise it is a version of Theseus\u2019s tale. The mythology well is old and deep, but the water that we draw from it tastes as cool and fresh as if it were newly created. Alice Oswald on Ben Haggarty\u2019s Orpheus Dismembered (2023), a play with music by Jonah Brody inspired by Orpheus and Eurydice Poet and professor of poetry, author of Memorial, a poetic reworking of Homer\u2019s the Iliad About a year ago, I was at the Cube in Bristol, listening to the story of Orpheus, the great lyre player and poet who could charm the plants from their places. I remember that the theatre contained a grove of young oak trees and one of them stepped forward. It was spring and the leaves of this oak were a rustling pinkish green. I can remember the curve of the moving tree, but the strange thing is, there were no trees in the theatre that night. What I saw was a hand gesture and a change of stance in the storyteller, and my imagination provided the rest. Ben Haggarty has spent 40 years learning this kind of hypnosis, from oral performers all round the world. When I asked him about the oak tree, he referred me to Gwydion, a Welsh magician who defeated a whole navy with a piece of seaweed draped on driftwood. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you describe Gwydion as a trickster or a poet. The point is that, under certain conditions, the imagination alters our sense data. When the sailors looked at Gwydion, they saw a fleet of armoured ships bearing down upon them and they fled. In Haggarty\u2019s telling, Orpheus married the moving oak tree, who had to sacrifice her divinity for the sake of love. Her name was Eurydice. She trod on a snake and died, and the story which follows is all about the strange relationship between music and the natural world. There is no point in reading that or indeed any other Greek myth in a book. You need to hear the music and see the tree step forward for yourself, and it takes a Haggarty or a Homer or a Gwydion \u2013 or Orpheus himself \u2013 to make that happen. Ferdia Lennon on O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), a film inspired by The Odyssey Author of Glorious Exploits, retelling Homer\u2019s Odyssey using modern Irish vernacular Although I love a good mythological retelling, what I like even more is transposition, where an aspect of a well-known myth or narrative is put somewhere it seemingly doesn\u2019t belong. I think the Coen brothers do this brilliantly here. The film brings its own distinct narrative to life by creating resonances with the Odyssey, which gives it an uncanny quality where you recognise and anticipate aspects of the structure and certain motifs, and yet they are altered. The gap between expectation and what unfolds on screen makes the film feel both fresh and pleasingly familiar. I was 14 when I first saw O Brother, Where Art Thou?. I hadn\u2019t read the Odyssey at the time, yet, like many of us, I had a sense of the main narrative beats from the countless other retellings and pop culture references. After studying the Odyssey in university, I realised how loose a retelling the film really is, yet it still gets much of its power from the spine of myth that runs through it. I love the film\u2019s humour. Like with a lot of the best comedy, it has a vein of melancholy running through it, so although in one sense it\u2019s a whimsical farce, the overall impression is of something far richer. I also enjoy the constant, playful inversion. The wily trickster Odysseus becomes a con artist who is continually being duped. Constant Penelope, far from pining after her husband, insists, even upon his return, that he is actually dead as she eagerly anticipates her new marriage. The isolated rural setting plays into the Odyssey\u2019s loose, episodic structure. It\u2019s the archetypal journey narrative. It also riffs on most of the key sequences from the Odyssey: the initial escape, the sirens, the Cyclops, and the suitors. However, here the adversaries are not divinely instigated monsters but altogether more relatable human forces, like the poverty and racism of Depression-era Mississippi. Ella Hickson on Carrie Cracknell\u2019s production of Medea at the National Theatre, 2014 Award-winning playwright whose adaptation of Oedipus, starring Rami Malek and Indira Varma, will be at the Old Vic from 21 January 2025 The Greeks deal with the extremity of human emotion in an unflinching way. There is something hugely cathartic about witnessing a woman rocked by misery that she nurses into fury, a fury that she then acts on. She speaks for rageful women everywhere. This production of Medea gave full vent to female rage in a way so rarely seen on stage. Helen McCrory was exceptional. She really took on the full extremity of feeling that the Greeks demand. It never felt melodramatic, it remained rooted and credible \u2013 but jeez, the rage, the incredible burning rage, and the scheming and the tactics. It was incredible. She was tensile and fraught and agitated throughout. She carried the underworld of a woman rocked by grief and fury, she was so physical in her agony and energetic in her vengeance. She could switch from blind, spitting rage to calm, beguiling politician in seconds. The performance was masterly. The update to the present day isn\u2019t total \u2013 the language remains archaic in some way and the setting is modern in its design, but Greek in its location (it\u2019s still set in a Corinth ruled by Creon). The hybrid works: the contemporisation allows us emotional access to the central character, but the historic elements, particularly the poetics of the chorus, allow for the depth and darkness found in the original myth. The movement was incredible: I remember specifically the dance of the new wife \u2013 she was like a broken doll. The chorus felt primal and powerful and authoritative, as if only a band of women were capable of understanding Medea\u2019s rage. What\u2019s so moving about re-watching it [on National Theatre at Home], is just how uniquely brilliant Helen was. Her range and versatility are spellbinding. The production is exquisite. I\u2019d forgotten the trees at the back, this primitive element \u2013 rooted and earthy, cutting against the sterile shop-window, glass box up top. It was beautiful.",

There\u2019s also a highly problematic rock\u2019n\u2019roll-style excitement to early IRA manoeuvres, though this is addressed as the series progresses, and, for some characters, doubt and conscience seep in. What emerges is a disordered, skewed account, but a powerful one.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to know where you are with new four-part BBC One drama <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00255ff/the-listeners-series-1-episode-1\">The Listeners</a></strong> \u2013 and that\u2019s both its biggest fault and its greatest selling point. Adapted from his own left-field novel by Canadian author and playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/15/gimp-play-is-a-craft-how-a-canadian-writer-went-from-fetish-sex-work-to-creating-powerful-bbc-drama\">Jordan Tannahill</a>, it follows teacher Claire (a vivid performance from Rebecca Hall) as she struggles to cope with an omnipresent rumbling hum only she can hear \u2013 to the increasing alarm and exasperation of her husband and daughter (played by Prasanna Puwanarajah and Mia Tharia respectively).</p>    <p>Directed by Janicza Bravo (<em>Zola</em>), the story has a chilly, stubbornly conceptual feel as Claire keeps gaining and losing your sympathy. Surely a teacher would know it was inappropriate to meet alone with a teenage pupil (a credibly off-kilter Ollie West) who also hears the hum? They join a group of fellow listeners, led by a risibly creepy, blissed-out couple. As Claire\u2019s life unravels, themes jostle: conspiracy theories; alternative facts; cults; condescension to women (Claire\u2019s hum is initially branded a menopausal symptom); quasi-religious fervour and rapture, but also rising dread.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/17/ive-had-a-wild-chaotic-beautiful-life-rebecca-hall-on-race-regrets-and-learning-to-be-herself\">\u2018I\u2019ve had a wild, chaotic, beautiful life\u2019: Rebecca Hall on race, regrets and learning to be herself</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are times when <em>The Listeners</em> feels akin to a sprawling, uber-woolly episode of <em>Black Mirror</em>.

There\u2019s also a highly problematic rock\u2019n\u2019roll-style excitement to early IRA manoeuvres, though this is addressed as the series progresses, and, for some characters, doubt and conscience seep in. What emerges is a disordered, skewed account, but a powerful one. It\u2019s hard to know where you are with new four-part BBC One drama The Listeners \u2013 and that\u2019s both its biggest fault and its greatest selling point. Adapted from his own left-field novel by Canadian author and playwright Jordan Tannahill, it follows teacher Claire (a vivid performance from Rebecca Hall) as she struggles to cope with an omnipresent rumbling hum only she can hear \u2013 to the increasing alarm and exasperation of her husband and daughter (played by Prasanna Puwanarajah and Mia Tharia respectively). Directed by Janicza Bravo (Zola), the story has a chilly, stubbornly conceptual feel as Claire keeps gaining and losing your sympathy. Surely a teacher would know it was inappropriate to meet alone with a teenage pupil (a credibly off-kilter Ollie West) who also hears the hum? They join a group of fellow listeners, led by a risibly creepy, blissed-out couple. As Claire\u2019s life unravels, themes jostle: conspiracy theories; alternative facts; cults; condescension to women (Claire\u2019s hum is initially branded a menopausal symptom); quasi-religious fervour and rapture, but also rising dread. There are times when The Listeners feels akin to a sprawling, uber-woolly episode of Black Mirror. But there\u2019s also the sense that you\u2019re partaking against your will in a televised immersive art installation, and I like that. Here is a drama that aggravates and intrigues in equal measure. Star ratings (out of five) Dune: Prophecy \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! \u2605\u2605\u2605 Say Nothing \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Listeners \u2605\u2605\u2605 What else I\u2019m watching Landman (Paramount Plus) The new Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) drama set in the recent past in west Texas.

      "body": "<p>Stephen Graham likes to quote that very famous saying in acting, \u201cThere are no small parts, only small actors\u201d \u2013 though it has nothing to do with the fact that the 51-year-old stands a power-packed 5ft five-and-a-half inches. When in 2020 he set up his own production company, Matriarch Productions, after a storied career as one of our great character performers, he made it one of the company\u2019s founding principles.</p> <p>Graham established Matriarch with his wife, the actor Hannah Walters. Their first project was the 2021 film <em>Boiling Point</em>, which created history as the first British single-take movie. Graham won a Bafta nomination for his portrayal of head chef Andy Jones, whose life unravels in real time during one frenzied service in the kitchen. But he was determined that <em>Boiling Point</em> would be just as radical behind the camera, too. Typically on TV and film productions, each actor is assigned a cast number, which functions as an unspoken hierarchy of their importance on the set. Graham decided he didn\u2019t want that.</p> <p>\u201cYou get number one on a call sheet, and then you get number, like, 52,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been number 52. I\u2019ve been number 12. I\u2019ve been number seven \u2013 I\u2019ve been all of those numbers. And I\u2019ve been number one. And, to me, I wanted to just smash that structure and say, \u2018We\u2019re not doing that. Everyone is as important as everyone.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>Graham has been popping up, stealing scenes and generally being a rock in TV and movies for almost 30&nbsp;years now. He\u2019s held his own opposite some of the biggest names in the game: Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. And he\u2019s built recurring relationships with revered filmmakers such as Shane Meadows and Martin Scorsese. Kevin Bacon may have the six-degrees-of-separation theory, but I have the (admittedly untestable) conviction that every one of us will have seen Graham in <em>something</em>: perhaps as a&nbsp;rogue undercover police officer in <em>Line of Duty</em> or the avaricious dad in <em>Matilda the Musical</em>, or maybe as Al&nbsp;Capone in Sky Atlantic\u2019s <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> or supreme as the British nationalist Combo in Meadows\u2019s <em>This is England</em> series. None of those? OK, there\u2019s also Scorsese\u2019s <em>The Irishman</em>, two instalments of <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, and \u2013 there he is! \u2013 in the finale of <em>Peaky Blinders</em>.</p> <p>And Graham is at it again with short but sweet roles in two new projects. The first is <em>Blitz</em>, the latest film from Steve McQueen (<em>12&nbsp;Years a Slave</em>, <em>Small Axe</em>), which is a&nbsp;Dickensian fable about a mixed-race boy called George (newcomer Elliott Heffernan) in London in 1940. He is evacuated to the countryside, but decides to risk his life to return to the city to be with his mother (Saoirse Ronan). German bombs are falling all around George, but the greatest peril he faces is from an encounter with a pair of grotesque grave-robbers, brother and sister Albert and Beryl, played by Graham and Kathy Burke. They enlist him to comb the rubble, looting jewellery and personal effects from the recently deceased.</p> <p>Graham is quite often cast as a nasty piece of work, but this new character \u2013 who is based on uncomfortable yet true stories from the Blitz that McQueen was keen to include \u2013 feels like a new low. Does he not mind? \u201cThey\u2019re the most interesting. They\u2019re fun,\u201d he replies, smiling. \u201cThere\u2019s also lots to bring to them, in many ways.\u201d</p>    <p>He\u2019s being a bit arch here. Graham likes to invest all his characters with depth and complexity, no matter how long their screen time (which for Albert in <em>Blitz</em> is less than 10 minutes). He starts his preparation for every role by carefully selecting the correct shoes for the person he is portraying. He will then move on to their walk, which might take days or even weeks of padding around his living room to perfect. \u201cI\u2019m a great one for nicking walks,\u201d says Graham. \u201cI&nbsp;might be sitting at St Pancras station or something and see someone walk, and I\u2019ll go, \u2018Ooooh, I love that.\u2019 And I\u2019ll lock it away and then I\u2019ll try and go through my little Rolodex when I\u2019m creating a character, and go, \u2018That walk, I\u2019m having that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For Albert in <em>Blitz</em>, he developed a whole backstory with McQueen that most viewers will never have a clue about: he and Beryl were children raised in a Victorian workhouse; he fought in the First World War, suffered from undiagnosed PTSD and was now again destitute, reduced to stealing from the dead. \u201cThat\u2019s what I loved about Steve\u2019s story,\u201d says Graham. \u201cWhen George escapes, jumps off the train, there\u2019s an element of Pinocchio \u2013 though he\u2019s trying to get back to his mother, whereas Pinocchio is trying to get back to Geppetto. And you meet all of these really wild and interestingly wonderful characters on the journey: some are really evil and some show you there is decency in humanity. To me, it was like a&nbsp;twisted fairytale.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Graham knows</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>a bit</strong></em><strong> </strong>about fairytales: his life and career has that feel to it. An inveterate story spinner, there\u2019s a breeziness in which he talks about his ascent through the acting ranks. Here\u2019s how he describes being cast as Al Capone in <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>: \u201cI hadn\u2019t had no work for a while and I got a phone call from my agent saying, \u2018Could Marty [Scorsese] speak to you?\u2019 And then he phoned me up, and he was like, \u2018Hey kid, how are you doing?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m good, ta.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>Or his 20-year friendship with DiCaprio that was forged on the set of <em>Gangs of New York</em> in 2002: \u201cI\u2019d class him as a&nbsp;very dear friend still today.\u201d</p> <p>But the reality is that very little was preordained about Graham\u2019s rise. He was born in Kirkby, six miles outside of Liverpool, and was raised for the first 10 years of his life solo by his mother, Marie, a social worker. His grandfather on his dad\u2019s side was Jamaican and Graham has been told that he came over on the Windrush, \u201cthough I\u2019m not 1,000,001% sure on that\u201d. As a kid he was pretty constantly getting into scrapes: he was flattened by a taxi in Liverpool aged seven; three years later, he fell from a seven-storey car park and smashed his arm, collarbone and both of his legs.</p> <p>There were no links to acting in Graham\u2019s family, but it was on his radar because Andrew Schofield, best-known for playing Johnny Rotten in the 1986 film <em>Sid and Nancy</em>, lived across the road from his gran\u2019s house, where Graham went most days for his dinner. Schofield saw a 10-year-old Graham play Jim Hawkins in his school production of <em>Treasure Island</em> and suggested to Marie that he join the youth programme at the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool, where playwrights such as Alan Bleasdale and Willy Russell would often showcase new work. Graham followed his advice, and it led to a spot in the National Youth Music Theatre.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Graham\u2019s stepfather Mike \u2013 a man he calls Pops \u2013 had arrived on the scene. Pops was also mixed-race, though his heritage was African, and he educated Graham on activists such as Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X. \u201cPops came into my life and he taught me about identity and my history,\u201d Graham recalls. \u201cHe was my huge role model, and my huge male figure in my life.\u201d Pops was also a big movie buff. When a teenage Graham told him he wanted to be an actor, they marched down to the video store and rented <em>The Godfather</em> parts one and two, <em>Deer Hunter</em> and <em>Taxi Driver</em>. They binged the films over a weekend. \u201cHe was like, \u2018All right, watch these, this is how you do it properly,\u201d says Graham.</p>    <p>There were plenty of quiet moments, even years, when Graham started out as an actor, but his break came in his late twenties when he was cast by Scorsese (who also directed <em>Taxi Driver</em>, of course) in <em>Gangs of New York</em>. Graham may have been meeting one of his heroes, but he wasn\u2019t cowed: he told Scorsese he wanted his character, Shang, to have a dog, and that went in; he mentioned the gruesome detail that fishmongers would rip the cheeks of kids that stole from them with fish hooks \u2013 and Scorsese added that, too.</p> <p>The film involved a five-month shoot in Rome. Early on, Graham met his co-star Daniel Day-Lewis in the gym. Graham had done some boxing as a child and they did some pad work together, chatting away, getting on nicely. \u201cThen on the day of filming, I\u2019m sitting in the chair in makeup, and Daniel comes walking through in full regalia,\u201d says Graham. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it. He looks in the mirror, puts his hand on my shoulder, and he goes, \u2018From now on, I call you Shang and you call me Bill.\u2019 And I just went, \u2018OK, Bill,\u2019 and that was it. We were locked in.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, every day is a school day,\u201d Graham goes on. \u201cWhen you see Scorsese do what he does, you are getting to watch a master paint, basically. It\u2019s the best school you could ever get.\u201d</p>    <p>If Graham had a bucket-list of dream collaborators, he would have ticked off most of the names on it by now. But the big one came when he had to audition in New York for Scorsese again and De Niro before being offered a role in their 2019 mob epic <em>The Irishman</em>. \u201cIn all those films I\u2019d watched with my dad, and all of those classic gangster films, there\u2019s a moment when someone gets \u2018made\u2019 and they become a member of the family,\u201d says Graham. \u201cAnd when I got a hug off the two of them, I felt like I\u2019d become a made man. It was surreal.\u201d</p> <p>Graham shakes his head. \u201cYou have to understand this kid from Liverpool who grew up in a block of flats, and now all of a sudden, he\u2019s there with these two people who have been icons. You never think you\u2019re going to meet Al Pacino. You never think you\u2019re going to meet Robert De Niro. Your head \u2013 it doesn\u2019t enter your head.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Graham was living</strong></em> with Hannah in a flat in south London when he landed <em>Gangs of New York</em>. Because of the length of the shoot, it made sense to give up their place and decide where to base themselves when Graham returned: London? Los Angeles? Or, as it turns out, rural Leicestershire, which is where Graham is speaking to me from on a video call today. He insists they live a pretty unremarkable life: the couple have grownup children, Grace and Alfie, who both still live at home, and the four of them will go out to the cinema or for something to eat in Leicester.</p>    <p>\u201cIf people meet me in the Co-op or in Tesco when I\u2019m shopping with Hannah, you can tell they\u2019re thinking, \u2018What are <em>you</em> doing <em>here</em>?\u2019\u201d says Graham. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean to be literal, but it\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m pushing a trolley\u2026 We haven\u2019t come here to have a dance, have we? It\u2019s a shop.\u2019 I do a lot of normal things. I go to the tip. I\u2019ve got to go to the tip again in a minute. The fellas at the tip are like, \u2018Alwight mate, back again?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This, again, is only half the story. Of course there must be busier people than Graham \u2013 presidents, Amazon drivers, single parents \u2013 but not many. Matriarch Productions, the company he set up with Hannah during the pandemic, is in full swing now. Its next project is <em>A Thousand Blows</em>, a&nbsp;rip-roaring, 12-part drama that will screen on Disney+ next year. The idea came from a photograph of a man called Hezekiah Moscow, a celebrated bare-knuckle fighter from the West Indies who landed in 1880s London. Hannah thought the story might interest the screenwriter Steven Knight, whom Graham had worked with on <em>Peaky Blinders</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI went, \u2018You\u2019ve got no chance, don\u2019t be stupid!\u2019\u201d says Graham. \u201cThen I swear to God, literally about four days later, she went, \u2018Oi! Come here. Read that.\u2019 And it was from Steven saying, \u2018I love this. I want to do it. When can we start?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d managed to do it.\u201d</p>    <p>Graham has an eye-catching turn in <em>A Thousand Blows </em>as Sugar Goodson, the principal adversary of Moscow (played by <em>Small Axe</em>\u2019s Malachi Kirby). You may have seen a trailer in which Graham walks into the ring looking absurdly hench for a man in his 50s. \u201cIt is out of order being 50 and being able to get into that shape,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut it was a regime. It was habitual. I had to eat so much food and all the right foods. And then the working out: it\u2019s not something that I did in three weeks. It took me about five months to get into that shape.\u201d</p> <p>Our time is up: Graham has to take some oversized cardboard to the tip, and then he\u2019s shooting a week of nights on the forthcoming <em>Peaky Blinders</em> film, <em>The Immortal Man</em>. At the weekend, he\u2019s flying to New York. A while back, Graham received a call out of nowhere from American director Scott Cooper, who he had tried to work with before, but the dates hadn\u2019t aligned. Cooper was making a biopic of Bruce Springsteen, <em>Deliver Me From Nowhere</em>, with <em>The Bear</em>\u2019s Jeremy Allen White playing the Boss. He wanted to know if Graham would play Springsteen\u2019s father.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Scott said, \u2018Look, it\u2019s not a huge role, but it\u2019s a&nbsp;really integral role, a wonderful role. And when I wrote it, I&nbsp;thought of you,\u2019\u201d says Graham. \u201cThis is the bit where I was like, \u2018What the fuck?\u2019 Where your mind just goes, \u2018Whaaaa\u2026\u2019 He said, \u2018When I said to Bruce, I know who I&nbsp;want to play your father,\u2019 he was like, \u2018Who?\u2019 Because it\u2019s an important role. And then Scott said, \u2018Stephen Graham. He\u2019s an actor from England. He\u2019s played\u2026\u2019 And Bruce went, \u2018Oh, I know him. I loved his Al Capone. And <em>This is England</em>.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Graham laughs \u2013 even for one of his stories, his whole improbable career, this feels a bit far-fetched. \u201cAnd then my head goes, \u2018Bruce Springsteen has seen me in <em>This is England</em> and as Al Capone\u2026 Really?\u2019 I still can\u2019t quite fathom it sometimes.\u201d</p> <p><em>Blitz is in cinemas now before streaming on Apple TV+ on 22 November</em></p> <p><em>Styling by Mark Anthony Bradley; grooming by Josh Knight; shot on location at The Roost, Dalston, London</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Stephen Graham likes to quote that very famous saying in acting, \u201cThere are no small parts, only small actors\u201d \u2013 though it has nothing to do with the fact that the 51-year-old stands a power-packed 5ft five-and-a-half inches. When in 2020 he set up his own production company, Matriarch Productions, after a storied career as one of our great character performers, he made it one of the company\u2019s founding principles. Graham established Matriarch with his wife, the actor Hannah Walters. Their first project was the 2021 film Boiling Point, which created history as the first British single-take movie. Graham won a Bafta nomination for his portrayal of head chef Andy Jones, whose life unravels in real time during one frenzied service in the kitchen. But he was determined that Boiling Point would be just as radical behind the camera, too. Typically on TV and film productions, each actor is assigned a cast number, which functions as an unspoken hierarchy of their importance on the set. Graham decided he didn\u2019t want that. \u201cYou get number one on a call sheet, and then you get number, like, 52,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been number 52. I\u2019ve been number 12. I\u2019ve been number seven \u2013 I\u2019ve been all of those numbers. And I\u2019ve been number one. And, to me, I wanted to just smash that structure and say, \u2018We\u2019re not doing that. Everyone is as important as everyone.\u2019\u201d Graham has been popping up, stealing scenes and generally being a rock in TV and movies for almost 30 years now. He\u2019s held his own opposite some of the biggest names in the game: Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. And he\u2019s built recurring relationships with revered filmmakers such as Shane Meadows and Martin Scorsese. Kevin Bacon may have the six-degrees-of-separation theory, but I have the (admittedly untestable) conviction that every one of us will have seen Graham in something: perhaps as a rogue undercover police officer in Line of Duty or the avaricious dad in Matilda the Musical, or maybe as Al Capone in Sky Atlantic\u2019s Boardwalk Empire or supreme as the British nationalist Combo in Meadows\u2019s This is England series. None of those? OK, there\u2019s also Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, two instalments of Pirates of the Caribbean, and \u2013 there he is! \u2013 in the finale of Peaky Blinders. And Graham is at it again with short but sweet roles in two new projects. The first is Blitz, the latest film from Steve McQueen (12 Years a Slave, Small Axe), which is a Dickensian fable about a mixed-race boy called George (newcomer Elliott Heffernan) in London in 1940. He is evacuated to the countryside, but decides to risk his life to return to the city to be with his mother (Saoirse Ronan). German bombs are falling all around George, but the greatest peril he faces is from an encounter with a pair of grotesque grave-robbers, brother and sister Albert and Beryl, played by Graham and Kathy Burke. They enlist him to comb the rubble, looting jewellery and personal effects from the recently deceased. Graham is quite often cast as a nasty piece of work, but this new character \u2013 who is based on uncomfortable yet true stories from the Blitz that McQueen was keen to include \u2013 feels like a new low. Does he not mind? \u201cThey\u2019re the most interesting. They\u2019re fun,\u201d he replies, smiling. \u201cThere\u2019s also lots to bring to them, in many ways.\u201d He\u2019s being a bit arch here. Graham likes to invest all his characters with depth and complexity, no matter how long their screen time (which for Albert in Blitz is less than 10 minutes). He starts his preparation for every role by carefully selecting the correct shoes for the person he is portraying. He will then move on to their walk, which might take days or even weeks of padding around his living room to perfect. \u201cI\u2019m a great one for nicking walks,\u201d says Graham. \u201cI might be sitting at St Pancras station or something and see someone walk, and I\u2019ll go, \u2018Ooooh, I love that.\u2019 And I\u2019ll lock it away and then I\u2019ll try and go through my little Rolodex when I\u2019m creating a character, and go, \u2018That walk, I\u2019m having that.\u2019\u201d For Albert in Blitz, he developed a whole backstory with McQueen that most viewers will never have a clue about: he and Beryl were children raised in a Victorian workhouse; he fought in the First World War, suffered from undiagnosed PTSD and was now again destitute, reduced to stealing from the dead. \u201cThat\u2019s what I loved about Steve\u2019s story,\u201d says Graham. \u201cWhen George escapes, jumps off the train, there\u2019s an element of Pinocchio \u2013 though he\u2019s trying to get back to his mother, whereas Pinocchio is trying to get back to Geppetto. And you meet all of these really wild and interestingly wonderful characters on the journey: some are really evil and some show you there is decency in humanity. To me, it was like a twisted fairytale.\u201d Graham knows a bit about fairytales: his life and career has that feel to it. An inveterate story spinner, there\u2019s a breeziness in which he talks about his ascent through the acting ranks. Here\u2019s how he describes being cast as Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire: \u201cI hadn\u2019t had no work for a while and I got a phone call from my agent saying, \u2018Could Marty [Scorsese] speak to you?\u2019 And then he phoned me up, and he was like, \u2018Hey kid, how are you doing?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m good, ta.\u2019\u201d Or his 20-year friendship with DiCaprio that was forged on the set of Gangs of New York in 2002: \u201cI\u2019d class him as a very dear friend still today.\u201d But the reality is that very little was preordained about Graham\u2019s rise. He was born in Kirkby, six miles outside of Liverpool, and was raised for the first 10 years of his life solo by his mother, Marie, a social worker. His grandfather on his dad\u2019s side was Jamaican and Graham has been told that he came over on the Windrush, \u201cthough I\u2019m not 1,000,001% sure on that\u201d. As a kid he was pretty constantly getting into scrapes: he was flattened by a taxi in Liverpool aged seven; three years later, he fell from a seven-storey car park and smashed his arm, collarbone and both of his legs. There were no links to acting in Graham\u2019s family, but it was on his radar because Andrew Schofield, best-known for playing Johnny Rotten in the 1986 film Sid and Nancy, lived across the road from his gran\u2019s house, where Graham went most days for his dinner. Schofield saw a 10-year-old Graham play Jim Hawkins in his school production of Treasure Island and suggested to Marie that he join the youth programme at the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool, where playwrights such as Alan Bleasdale and Willy Russell would often showcase new work. Graham followed his advice, and it led to a spot in the National Youth Music Theatre. Meanwhile, Graham\u2019s stepfather Mike \u2013 a man he calls Pops \u2013 had arrived on the scene. Pops was also mixed-race, though his heritage was African, and he educated Graham on activists such as Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X. \u201cPops came into my life and he taught me about identity and my history,\u201d Graham recalls. \u201cHe was my huge role model, and my huge male figure in my life.\u201d Pops was also a big movie buff. When a teenage Graham told him he wanted to be an actor, they marched down to the video store and rented The Godfather parts one and two, Deer Hunter and Taxi Driver. They binged the films over a weekend. \u201cHe was like, \u2018All right, watch these, this is how you do it properly,\u201d says Graham. There were plenty of quiet moments, even years, when Graham started out as an actor, but his break came in his late twenties when he was cast by Scorsese (who also directed Taxi Driver, of course) in Gangs of New York. Graham may have been meeting one of his heroes, but he wasn\u2019t cowed: he told Scorsese he wanted his character, Shang, to have a dog, and that went in; he mentioned the gruesome detail that fishmongers would rip the cheeks of kids that stole from them with fish hooks \u2013 and Scorsese added that, too. The film involved a five-month shoot in Rome. Early on, Graham met his co-star Daniel Day-Lewis in the gym. Graham had done some boxing as a child and they did some pad work together, chatting away, getting on nicely. \u201cThen on the day of filming, I\u2019m sitting in the chair in makeup, and Daniel comes walking through in full regalia,\u201d says Graham. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it.

      "body": "<p>There are few columnists with whom I disagree more than I do with the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>\u2019s Allison Pearson. Yet, I welcome the decision by the police to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rxy8727z2o\">drop their investigation</a> into her alleged tweet. This should never have been a matter for the police. At the same time, the debate sparked by the investigation has shown how selective many free speech campaigners are about the speech they are willing to defend.</p> <p>The facts of the case remain contested. It appears that in November 2023, Pearson retweeted a photo of police officers standing next to two men holding a flag. \u201cInvited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters,\u201d she wrote, apparently jumping to the conclusion that the image was of Metropolitan police officers with demonstrators from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/15/allison-pearson-jew-haters-tweet-is-at-centre-of-telegraphs-row-with-police\">pro-Palestinian march</a>.</p> <p>The photo had in fact been taken in Manchester several months earlier, during a celebration of Pakistan Independence Day. Eventually, after the facts were pointed out in several responses to Pearson\u2019s tweet, she deleted it.</p> <p>A year later, Essex police knocked on her door. Whether they told her they were investigating a \u201cnon-crime hate incident\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/12/my-visit-from-police-is-proof-of-two-tier-justice-system/\">as Pearson claims</a>, or informed her that they were pursuing an allegation of \u201cpotentially inciting racial hatred online\u201d, as a partial extract of the <a href=\"https://www.essex.police.uk/news/essex/news/news/2024/november/update-relating-to-ongoing-investigation/\">bodycam transcript suggests</a>, it was a case of police over-reach, especially given the tweet had been deleted a year earlier.</p> <p>Pearson\u2019s alleged tweet was a false claim based on a prejudice-driven assumption and an accusation of being \u201cJew haters\u201d made against a group of people about whom she had little knowledge apart from that they were brown-skinned. Pearson insists she was simply \u201cstanding up for British Jews\u201d. It is difficult to see how, with no evidence, labelling people as antisemites is helpful for Jews or anyone else. Nevertheless, however obnoxious that tweet, Pearson should be allowed to be that obnoxious if she so wishes. Such a tweet might shape our moral assessment of Pearson but it should not be a criminal matter.</p> <p>In the debate that followed, many claimed that we are now living in \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllisonPearson/status/1859137738374570469\">Soviet-style\u201d Britain</a>, to use Pearson\u2019s phrase, a nation being turned into a \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/GBNEWS/status/1856855178009255941\">police state</a>\u201d, according to GB News. Such hyperbole both diminishes the horrors of real police states, from Belarus to Saudi Arabia, and misunderstands the social changes that have taken place in recent years. And while there is some truth to the charge of two-tier policing, it is nothing new. There is a long history of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/27/two-tier-justice-britain-political-policing\">such policing in Britain</a>. But when the targets of excessive policing were almost exclusively black people or Irish republicans or working-class militants, those campaigning on behalf of victims of perverted justice such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jan/18/ukcrime.race\">Winston Silcott</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/26/why-the-birmingham-six-story-must-not-be-forgotten\">Birmingham Six</a> or the <a href=\"https://shrewsbury24campaign.org.uk/\">Shrewsbury 24</a> were often dismissed as mad lefties who hated Britain.</p> <p>What is undoubtedly true, though, is that Britain has become more censorious in recent years and the law used to police political and moral boundaries. Whether it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/09/since-when-was-it-police-job-to-impose-sanctions-on-drill-musicians\">drill musicians playing a song</a>, activists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/13/pro-palestine-protester-cleared-racial-offence-coconut-placard-sunak-braverman\">describing politicians as \u201ccoconuts\u201d</a> or feminists accused of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/16/tweets-free-speech-gender-ideology-transphobia-police/\">transphobic comments</a>, the investigation, prosecution, even imprisonment, of people for what they have said or written is not unusual.

Another journalist, Asa Winstanley, had his home raided last month, and his electronic devices seized, apparently for his <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2024/10/british-police-seize-electronic-devices-in-raid-on-journalist-asa-winstanleys-home/\">social media posts</a>. Earlier this month, the academic Haim Bresheeth, founder of the Jewish Network for Palestine, was arrested for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-police-arrest-israeli-academic-haim-bresheeth-speech-pro-palestine-demonstration\">hate speech</a>\u201d after a demonstration against the Israeli ambassador Tzipi Hotovely. Unlike the Pearson investigation, these more egregious cases barely made it into the media. One does not have to agree with the views of such writers or academics, any more than one has to agree with Pearson\u2019s views, to defend their right to free expression.</p> <p>Too many of those presenting themselves as champions of free speech are, though, selective about what speech they think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/defence-of-free-speech-should-not-depend-whose-side-you-take-in-culture-wars\">should be free</a>. Pearson has a history of trying to intimidate those who disagree with her too sharply. One notorious incident was a Twitter spat in 2021 with microbiologist Dave Bradshaw who had tweeted that Pearson and other journalists were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/youre-finished-telegraph-columnist-threatens-to-sue-kent-based-scientist-240167/\">stoking hatred of and aggression towards NHS workers</a>\u201d during Covid.</p> <p>Pearson threatened him with lawyers. When Bradshaw apologised and deleted his tweets, Pearson replied \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/allisonpearson/status/1345838142906114049?s=20\">You\u2019re finished</a>\u201d and called out his employers, the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. The following day, a petrified Bradshaw again apologised, imploring Pearson that he was \u201cterrified and feeling suicidal\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/djbradshaw64/status/1345890139424362502\">pleading for your&nbsp;mercy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Pearson once more threatened legal action and sought to involve his employers: \u201cWhat does @GSK think about an employee who attacks journalists for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllisonPearson/status/1345890182424391681\">reporting the truth?</a>\u201d Only after many prominent figures interceded on Bradshaw\u2019s behalf did Pearson relent.</p> <p>In the wake of the latest controversy, Pearson has again threatened those suggesting that her original tweet might be racist <a href=\"https://x.com/AllisonPearson/status/1857833705730912762\">with legal action</a>. One might have thought that someone who is on the advisory council of the Free Speech Union, which insists that \u201cRobust debate\u2026 is the best way to resolve disagreements about questions big and small without descending to <a href=\"https://freespeechunion.org/freedom-of-speech/\">violence or intimidation</a>\u201d would think twice before threatening to lawyer-up against critics or doxing those who challenge her too robustly for her liking.</p> <p>Nor is Pearson particularly bothered about free speech for those holding political views she detests. Why, she asks, has Britain not \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/AllisonPearson/status/1761770318895411589?s=20\">banned pro-Palestinian rallies</a>\u201d as France and Germany have done? A case of free speech for me but not for thee.</p> <p>The <em>Telegraph</em>, too, is selective about what speech should be free. Last year, for example, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/how-i-became-woke-villain-with-views-too-heretical-for-civil-service-ears\">denounced civil servants for inviting me to speak</a> to them because I had been horrid to Suella Braverman and was a critic of her <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/08/09/kenan-malik-civil-servants-suella-braverman-whitehall/\">immigration policies</a>.</p> <p>Free speech is an essential weapon in the struggle for social change, and too many on the left fail to recognise its importance. But a selective defence of free speech is no defence at all.

Last year, for example, it denounced civil servants for inviting me to speak to them because I had been horrid to Suella Braverman and was a critic of her immigration policies. Free speech is an essential weapon in the struggle for social change, and too many on the left fail to recognise its importance. But a selective defence of free speech is no defence at all. Demanding \u201cfree speech for me but not for thee\u201d: that is the voice of privilege, not of progress. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

McLaren sit on 608 points, Ferrari on 584 and Red Bull then land in third on 55.</p> <p>There\u2019s interest further down the rankings, too, as Haas has just a one-point lead over Alpine for seventh-place -- 50 points to 49 -- while RB come in on their heels on 46 points.</p> <p>But that\u2019s for future live coverage.

And just seeing the words arranged the way they are feels right, because Vegas is a place that has written itself into history as a place where the title goes on the line. It\u2019s where we got Holmes against Norton in 1978; Spinks becoming the only man to take the title of Ali in the ring in 1978; The Showdown between Leonard and Hearns in 1981 and then the latter\u2019s incredible bout with Hagler in 1985; Holyfield and Bowe in 1992 and the former\u2019s meaty bouts with Tyson; Mayweather locking up with De La Hoya in 2007 and then finally clashing with Pacquaio in 2015; and Wilder and Fury II in 2020.</p> <p>Today, it\u2019s Verstappen and Norris. And it\u2019s pretty straightforward as to how it will work. Starting next to each other in on the gird, the Red Bull driver leads his Maclaren rival by 62 points entering the race, ensuring that he\u2019ll clinch the hardest fought of fourth-straight titles if he can finish ahead of his rival come the end of the 50th lap. To keep the battle for the championship alive heading into the next race in Doha, the Brit must get past Verstappen and outscore him by three points.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s only just ahead of us today,\u201d Norris said of his rival after qualifying. \u201cI think we have a chance to beat them tomorrow. I\u2019ll go out and do my best.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/F1/status/1860383563251614150\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Number four is truly in reach for Max Verstappen now \ud83c\udfc6<br><br>If he and Lando both finish the Las Vegas Grand Prix where they qualified, and Norris fails to score the fastest lap, Max WILL be crowned champion once again \ud83d\udc51<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/F1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#F1</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LasVegasGP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LasVegasGP</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Q1QnLj2xIc\">pic.twitter.com/Q1QnLj2xIc</a></p>&mdash; Formula 1 (@F1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1/status/1860383563251614150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 23, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Deep down, there\u2019ll be plenty among the F1 executive class that will be hoping Verstappen gets the job done on the neon-lit streets of Sin City, providing new marquee event with a signature moment that can cement its place in the calendar and the burgeoning American market.

We have been lacking a lot of low-speed performance and we haven\u2019t been able to put the tyres in the right window, that was the main issue and has been very costly in this session. I wanted more today but the progress was not enough.\u201d</p> <p>After an energy recovery system failure in final practice, the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll was only able to manage one hot lap and qualified in 20. He and Bottas will swap places on the grid, however, after the Fin was handed a five-place grid penalty for an engine change. Fernando Alonso and his Aston Martin will start from 14th.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been uncompetitive the whole weekend so far and expected it to be a struggle heading into Qualifying,\u201d said Alonso. \u201cWe have been struggling with the balance and managing the tyre temperatures in these colder conditions here in Las Vegas. We\u2019ve had a few races of being uncompetitive now, but we need to improve and keep learning for next year.

At around this point in 2023, Formula One\u2019s foray into the desert of Nevada was the subject of scepticism and criticism. The first practice on Thursday evening had been forced to be abandoned when a drain cover on the street circuit ripped through the chassis of Carlos Sainz\u2019s Ferrari, locals were expressing their disquietude over the race\u2019s impact, and Max Verstappen, never one to tiptoe around the issue, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/16/max-verstappen-dismisses-las-vegas-gp-f1\">labelled the event</a> \u201c99% show and 1% sporting event\u201d.</p> <p>One enthralling race later, however, and not only was the Dutchman seemingly won over, singing along with \u2018Viva Las Vegas\u2019 as he cruised to an 18th win in the 2023 season, but so was most of F1. There\u2019s a decided sense of excitement surrounding this year\u2019s race, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/23/f1s-high-stakes-gamble-on-las-vegas-gp-is-already-paying-out\">Giles Richards reporting on the ground</a> that the event possesses \u201can atmosphere that boundless petrodollars simply cannot buy, and everyone feels it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/F1/status/1726142875551859062\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Viva Laaaas Vegas!&quot; sings Max Verstappen in his Elvis-themed race suit on the radio \ud83d\ude02<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LasVegasGP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LasVegasGP</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/F1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#F1</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7axGVFiK8c\">pic.twitter.com/7axGVFiK8c</a></p>&mdash; Formula 1 (@F1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F1/status/1726142875551859062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>This year\u2019s driver\u2019s title still being on the line, as opposed to last year when Verstappen had long since wrapped it up, probably has a lot to do with building this sense of excitement. Despite struggling for pace throughout practice, the Red Bull driver will line up fifth on the grid in today\u2019s race and, adding to the sense of occasion, he will do so next to the Maclaren of the man seeking to get in front of him from sixth and deny him glory, Lando Norris. Of course, while Verstappen won last year\u2019s race, Norris crashed on lap three and was forced to retire \u2013 so there\u2019s plenty of work for the Brit to do on that front.</p> <p>Up the front of the grid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/23/formula-one-las-vegas-f1-grand-prix-gp-pole-position-george-russell-mercedes-max-verstappen\">George Russell will start from pole</a> in front of Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz and, after his surprise podium finish in Brazil, Alpine\u2019s Pierre Gasly \u2013 who also qualified fourth at this circuit last year, only to end the race outside the points.

George Russell has taken the chequered flag for his second win of the season but it\u2019s Max Verstappen that is the biggest winner: claiming his fourth-straight world title and putting him into rarefied air. The tour will now head to the Middle East for its final two races, landing in Qatar next week \u2013 that one a sprint weekend \u2013 before ending the season in Abu Dhabi. While Verstappen has taken out the Driver\u2019s Championship, the Constructor\u2019s one will remain very much up for grab in these coming two races, with McLaren\u2019s lead over Ferrari cut to 24 points this evening thanks to Sainz and Leclerc\u2019s third- and fourth-placed finish. McLaren sit on 608 points, Ferrari on 584 and Red Bull then land in third on 55. There\u2019s interest further down the rankings, too, as Haas has just a one-point lead over Alpine for seventh-place -- 50 points to 49 -- while RB come in on their heels on 46 points. But that\u2019s for future live coverage. For now, the story is Verstappen\u2019s fourth title. My name\u2019s been Joey Lynch and it\u2019s been a great pleasure to have your company following along as it was sealed in the neon-soaked streets of Las Vegas. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner is speaking on the Sky Sports coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster of a year, but Max has been truly outstanding,\u201d says Horner. \u201cMax got off to a flying start, we had a difficult summer but he has just been outstanding. I think it\u2019s been his best and hardest world championship, he\u2019s delivered on days where the car wasn\u2019t quite there. \u201cThis one has been hard won. All credit to the men and women in Milton Keynes. The others have pushed us really hard this year. Max joins an elite group of champions now, it puts him in amongst the all-time greats.\u201d Verstappen now joins Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel as a four-time champion of F1. The only three names now ahead of him, five-time Juan Manuel Fangio and seven-time champions Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher. Fireworks explode and the champagne flows as Russell celebrates his win. Meanwhile, in the Red Bull garage, the celebrations of Verstappen\u2019s win have already begun. 1. George Russell (25 Pts) 2. Lewis Hamilton (18) 3. Carlos Sainz (15) 4. Charles Leclerc (12) 5. Max Verstappen (10) 6. Lando Norris (9) 7. Oscar Piastri (6) 8. Nico Hulkenberg (4) 9. Yuki Tsunoda (2) 10. Sergio Perez (1) 11.

Alexander Albon, Pierre Gasly For the second time this season, Russell takes the win. There\u2019s been complications and controversy around his other race wins and non-wins this year, but this one is all his own. The sounds of \u2018God Save The King\u2019 ring out across Las Vegas to mark the occasion. Pretty sure the Americans fought a revolution about that. The newly crowned four-time champion takes the stage with Button and Crews. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long season,\u201d Verstappen says. \u201cWe started off cruising, and we have to be proud of everyone. To stand here as a four-time world champion, I never thought it was possible. I\u2019m relieved in a way, and very proud. \u201cWe hit the ground running with the new concept, and to be a four-time champion is just incredible. It was a very challenging season, I had to be calm and in a way - I still prefer last season, but this season taught me a lot of lessons and I\u2019m very proud how we handled it as a team.\u201d Crews has declared Verstappen\u2019s run of title a dynasty. It\u2019s a very American phrase but it we\u2019re in Vegas, after all, and it seems an apt descriptor of his consistent dominance. Thoughts, inevitably, will already begin to turn to a fifth title and who could stand in his way in 2025. \u201cAll these highs we are achieving right now, it\u2019s very special to achieve with all the people here and back at the factory, it\u2019s very special. \u201cOf course, if you look at next year right now, it will be a proper battle between lots of cars. But I need to enjoy this, there are still two races to come and then we have a little break before we go back at it next year.\u201d Button and Crews are now chatting with Hamilton and Sainz. \u201cFirstly I have to say a big congratulations to Max, winning the championship,\u201d says second-place finisher Hamilton. \u201cIf I\u2019d done my job yesterday, it would have been a breeze today. But I had fun coming from tenth, we don\u2019t know why the car was so quick but that\u2019s the best the car has felt. If the car drivers like that in the next couple of races, we\u2019ll be able to challenge the guys in front.\u201d \u201cIt was a bit of a shock - the mediums, it lasted eight, nine laps for me and from there it was a damage limitation,\u201d said Sainz. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t have it today. This race has delivered a good show and I\u2019m looking forward to coming back here in the future.\u201d Jenson Button has been joined by Terry Crews for the post-race interviews. Terry loves the F1. Russell confirms that the initial plan was for him to be on a flight out of the States later that evening \u2013 the Doha GP is next week \u2013 but that this isn\u2019t happening anymore; he\u2019s headed wherever Crews is headed to celebrate. \u201cI was planning on flying in a couple of hours, but I am definitely not getting on that flight - I\u2019m going to enjoy this with all my team,\u201d he said. \u201cVegas is just a crazy, crazy place. To get pole, a dominant weekend, a 1-2 with Lewis as well - I was just waiting for something to happen, the last two I\u2019ve had on pole have been crazy races with rain, red flags. But I\u2019m so, so happy right now.\u201d The podium finishers have packed into a very expensive looking Rolls Royce as they make their way to the Bellagio for the post-race festivities, as has the newly crowned World Champion, Verstappen, alongside race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase. Queen\u2019s \u2018We are the Champions\u2019 can be heard blaring out across the circuit. Somebody already has a special M4x signs and merch ready for this moment. That\u2019s preparation, right there. We\u2019ll bring you the full standings soon, but the top ten in Vegas were as follows: Russell, Hamilton, Sainz, Leclerc, Verstappen, Norris, Piastri, Hulkenberg, Tsunoda and then Perez. Lando Norris has crossed the line and he did end up setting the fastest lap of the race, earning himself a few extra points. Verstappen crosses the line in fifth position, finishing ahead of Norris and, in doing so, writes his name into history: claiming a fourth-straight title. \u201cWhat a season,\u201d he says over the radio, emotion clearly beginning to seep into the voice of a driver who at 27-years-old has already put together a career that will mark him as one of the greatest ever. It was probably the most difficult of his four titles, the early season dominance of the Red Bull giving way as the season wore on to a car that was challenged by its rivals. But Verstappen found a way. For the first time in his F1 career, Russell has won from pole position; his Mercedes never looking like being challenged as he takes the chequered flag in front of his teammate Hamilton. Carlos Sainz takes third in his Ferrari. Lap 49/50: Russel with a comfortable lead as he takes the turn for the final lap. Perez, meanwhile, has moved into the top ten and is Tsunoda for ninth. Lap 48/50: Russell leads from Hamilton and Sainz. Leclerc follows and then Verstappen. Norris has gone into the pits, getting himself set to try to pick up a few extra points by setting a fastest lap of the race. Lap 47/50: Hamilton briefly runs off the track as his tyres begin to go, costing himself nearly a second, and it looks like Russell has well and seen off the danger, it would appear. Russell is going to win this race but Verstappen is going to win the title \u2013 sitting comfortably in fifth place ahead of sixth-placed Norris. Lap 46/50: Russell still leads from Hamilton and Sainz but behind them, Leclerc has now moved ahead of Verstappen. It\u2019s a one-two for Mercedes and a three-four for Ferrari \u2013 the two class teams of the Vegas GP taking the top positions. Norris is now behind Verstappen but is nearly ten seconds back with only four to go. Lap 45/50: Verstappen is keeping Leclerc at bay, with Sainz very slowly opening up a gap in third. Russell gets some instructions over the radio to pick up the pace, suggesting we might begin to see him re-open something of a gap over Hamilton. Lap 44/50: Russell\u2019s lead over Hamilton is now less than five seconds, with the broadcast confirming the soon-to-be Ferrari driver is under no special instruction should he come up behind his teammate. However, Russell\u2019s tyres are six laps younger than Hamilton\u2019s, so he should have some pace in the bank. Further back, Hulkenberg has moved ahead of Tsunoda. Lap 43/50: As it stands, Tsunoda and Hulkenberg\u2019s battle for eighth has RB and Haas level on points in the Constructors\u2019 Title, just a point back of Alpine. Lap 42/50: Sainz has now begun to motor away from Verstappen but there\u2019s a long way to go to catch up to Hamilton, who is now less than six seconds back of Russell. Leclerc is now looking to get ahead of Verstappen but the Red Bull is now getting a slipstream and even some DRS opportunities from Sainz. Norris is now more than 11 seconds back of Leclerc \u2013 his hopes of keeping the title race alive now resting on Verstappen making a mistake. Lap 41/50: Leclerc is also putting together some lightning laps as he and teammate Sainz increasingly overhaul Verstappen \u2013 the Red Bull just doesn\u2019t have the pace of the Mercedes\u2019 or the Ferraris\u2019 tonight. And there it is! Sainz moves in front of Verstappen, with Leclerc now looking to do the same. Down in the battle for eighth, Hulkenberg is all over the back of Tsunoda. Lap 40/50: Another fastest lap for Hamilton \u2013 nearly half a second quicker than Russell \u2013 and the gap between he and his teammate in first is down to less than seven seconds. Verstappen has now been informed that he\u2019s 16 seconds in front of Norris with ten laps to go. Lap 39/50: Verstappen is comfortably in front of Norris but he looks to be labouring a bit and now coming under some pressure from Sainz, with Leclerc not too far behind. With little to gain from doing so, however, one imagines he won\u2019t work too hard to keep those two at bay \u2013 even if his team suggests on the radio he should try and do so. Lap 38/50: Russell leads Hamilton \u2013 that gap now down to less than eight seconds \u2013 with Verstappen rounding out the podium. The Ferraris of Sainz and Leclerc come next, followed by the McLarens of Norris and Piastri. Then comes Tsunoda and Hulkenberg as RB and Haas battle for positioning in the Constructors\u2019 Title and Alonso to round out the top ten. Lap 37/50: Verstappen looks like he\u2019s going to cruise to a fourth-straight title with ease. He\u2019s sitting comfortably in third, while Norris is more than twelve seconds back of fifth-placed Leclerc. Lap 36/50: In the Constructors\u2019 Championship, eighth-placed Tsunoda has helped RB move ahead of Haas on the live rankings. Lap 35/50: Hamilton is going like absolute lightning in second, setting another fastest lap. Surely he couldn\u2019t hunt down Russell for the lead, could he? Lap 34/50: The RB\u2019s of Lawson and Tsunoda are putting a lot of pressure on Ocon, with all moving upwards into ninth, tenth, and eleventh as Hulkenberg pits. Lap 33/50: Russell comes into pit lane but as he did so with a 30 second lead over second-placed Hamilton, he maintains the lead and a 12 second buffer when he emerges. Verstappen follows Hamilton, then come the Ferraris of Sainz and Leclerc. Hulkenberg comes next, then the McLarens of Norris and Piastri, Guanyu, and then Ocon. Lap 32/50: Both Mercedes are flying this evening as Hamilton moves past Verstappen \u2013 his battle not with the Brit tonight \u2013 for third and then finds himself in second when Leclerc heads into the pit lane. Lap 31/50: Norris moves into the pits and emerges in seventh position behind Hulkenberg. If these positions hold (they won\u2019t), Verstappen will end today 71 points clear and a world champion. Lap 30/50: So, the top ten: Russell leads from Leclerc, Norris, Verstappen and Hamilton. Sainz sits in sixth, followed by Hulkenberg, Perez, Guanyu, and Ocon. Lap 29/50: Sainz now pits asking what happened, with the response being that \u201cwe weren\u2019t ready\u201d. He emerges in sixth position, just in front of Tsunoda. Russell looks very comfortable out in front, 15 seconds in front of Leclerc. Norris then sits in third in front of the two-stopped Verstappen and Hamilton. Lap 28/50: Verstappen moves into the pit lane, the first of this leading pack of six to come in for a second time, immediately followed by Hamilton. It looked like Sainz was about to come in as well but pulled out at the last second. However, it appeared the Ferrari aborted after crossing into the demarcation of pit lane, meaning he\u2019s likely to come in for a penalty. Lap 27/50: It\u2019s a suspected power unit issue for Albon, with the coverage suggesting some debris may have gotten caught in his car. Lap 26/50: Albon has been called into the pits and is going to be forced to retire. Another blow to the Williams. Sainz, meanwhile, wants to get a new set of tyres in a two-stopper but he\u2019s staying out there for now. Lap 25/50: Perez gets past Lawson into 13th place, looking to get some important points in the context of the Constructor\u2019s Title. Norris is now seven seconds back of Hamilton, with Verstappen sitting pretty comfortably in second-place. Lap 24/50: Further down the grid, Guanyu has moved up into eleventh place past Alonso. Norris, meanwhile, wants to pit again and get rid of his tyres but his team are telling him that the traffic he\u2019d emerge back into makes that unwise, asking him to stay out there a bit longer. Lap 23/50: Norris is starting to drop back of Hamilton and Leclerc\u2019s battle for fourth, getting on the radio complaining about some trouble with his right front tyre. Russell maintains his healthy lead at the front of the grid. Lap 22/50: Hamilton continues to absolutely monster Leclerc in the hunt for fourth in this narrow circuit but the Ferrari, for now, is keeping him at bay thanks to his pace on the straights. Lap 21/50: Russell holds a ten second lead to Verstappen, followed by Sainz, Leclerc, Hamilton, and Norris. There\u2019s then a big gap to Tsunoda, Piastri, Albon, and Hulkenberg to round out the top ten. Lap 20/50: With Norris sitting back down in sixth and Verstappen in second, the broadcast is beginning to muse that McLaren doesn\u2019t have the pace to go with Red Bull. McLaren\u2019s Zak Brown joins the broadcast and does admit they\u2019re off the pace but references Mercedes in doing so, not referencing Red Bull. Obvious title implications, nonetheless. Lap 19/50: The Mercedes are flying out there tonight, with Russell comfortably out in front and Hamilton all over the back of Leclerc in his hunt for fourth. Lap 18/50: Perez pits to get some mediums put on and comes back out in 14th. The top six are now able to do battle with no stragglers: Russell, Verstappen, Sainz, Leclerc, Hamilton, and Norris. Lap 17/50: Russell leads from Verstappen, followed by Sainz, Leclerc, Perez, Hamilton, Norris, Tsunoda, Piastri, and Magnussen. Lap 16/50: Russell leads by nearly ten seconds to Verstappen but, importantly for the Red Bull driver, he\u2019s well clear of sixth-placed Norris. As things stand, we\u2019re going to crown a four-time champion. Lap 15/50: Gasly is on the radio complaining about low power. His team answer back saying everything is fine on their end but he\u2019s still not happy. And now there\u2019s smoke coming out the back of his car! Looks like his engine is gone \u2013 that great qualifying run quite literally going up in smoke. Laps 14/50: Russell maintains around a six second lead on Perez, with Verstappen moving up into third as Hulkenberg pits. Then comes Sainz, Leclerc, Norris, Hamilton, Magnussen, Bottas, and Tsunoda. Hamilton wasn\u2019t too happy about the amount of places he lost in his stop but his team are quickly on the radio to tell him he\u2019d have lost a lot more had they waited. Lap 13/50: The scene is being set for some absolute chaos as this race goes on \u2013 overtakes aplenty. Hamilton pits now, too, with Russell taking his lead back. He\u2019s followed by Perez and Hulkenberg, neither of whom have pitted. Then comes Verstappen, Sainz, Leclerc, Norris, Magnussen, the resuming Hamilton, and Bottas. Apparently, Ocon came into pit lane, missed his garage completely, and had to come in next lap to do his stop. That can\u2019t happen too oftenn. Lap 12/50: Verstappen pits as well and while it\u2019s a good stop, he comes out behind some traffic in the form of Magnussen and Bottas. Nonetheless, he\u2019s emerged in front of Sainz, Leclerc, and Norris. Russell is now going to be the next to pit, leaving Hamilton as out new race leader \u2013 albeit one expects he\u2019ll be coming into pit soon. Lap 11/50: So a host of early pit stops as the field begins to stretch out. Lap 10/50: Sainz now pits after being overtaken on that lap by Verstappen. Russell maintains the lead but as it stands, Verstappen will be crowned world champion in 40 laps time. Piastri, meanwhile, has picked up a five-second time penalty for a false start. Lap 9/50: Norris moves to respond and gets past Gasly for fifth position. Meanwhile, it looks like Leclerc is slowing with indications are that he\u2019s perhaps having some trouble with his tyres after his aggressive start. He heads into the pits. Norris, too, has been called into the pits! Albon and Stroll heading into there as well, with Leclerc emerging in 16th and Norris in 17th. Lap 8/50: It\u2019s now around a four-second gap between fourth-placed Verstappen and sixth-placed Norris, as the former makes a move to try and overtake Leclerc for third\u2026 and gets past him! Lap 7/50: The Mercedes of Hamilton moves past Hulkenberg and lays Piastri under siege, only for Piastri to prove up the task and keep him at bay, for now at least. Lap 6/50: Despite a plastic bag appearing to have been caught in his body, Russell still leads from the Ferraris of Leclerc and Sainz. Verstappen follows in fourth, with Gasly\u2019s Alpine serving as a buffer between he and Norris. Tsunoda, Hulkenberg, Piastri, and Hamilton round out the top ten. Lap 5/50: Norris went around half a second slower on that lap than he did four, hurting his efforts to get past Gasly and maintain the pressure on Verstappen. Lap 4/50: Russell leads by less than a second from Leclerc, followed by Sainz. Verstappen has vaulted past Gasly and into fourth, putting a car between he and Norris. On the radio, Ferrari are apparently telling their drivers to maintain their tyres through turns ten and eleven but, in contrast, Verstappen has been told he can go a bit harder by Red Bull. Lap 3/50: Given the circumstances, Verstappen isn\u2019t being as aggressive as he otherwise might be, looking after his tyres in fifth position. Up top, Leclerc is piling on the pressure on Russell. Lap 2/50: Russell maintains his lead over Leclerc, Sainz and Gasly. No change between Verstappen and Norris. Hulkenberg has moved past Piastri and into eighth, while Alonso has moved up multiple positions into 14th. Lap 1/50: Leclerc with the incredible start, vaulting up past Sainz and Gasly and into second place as Russell leads them around turn one! Verstappen holds his fifth position over Norris in the battle for the title while Tsunoda, Piastri, Hulkenberg, and Hamilton round out the top ten. Can Verstappen claim the title? Can Norris keep his hunt alive? 50 laps will tell us the answer. The formation lap is underway in Vegas and the circuit is looking resplendent under the 12 million light bulbs that illuminate the city. Alonso will be starting the race on soft tyres, catching a few by surprise. Perhaps looking for an early safety car. Down at the back, Bottas and Perez are on the hards, as is the pit lane starting Colapinto. In other Americana-related news, General Motors\u2019 efforts to secure a place as the 11th team on the F1 grid look to have moved into its final stages against the backdrop of the Las Vegas GP, with McLaren chief Zak Brown saying its announcement was \u201cprobably imminent\u201d. An Andretti-led bid to join the grid in 2026 was rejected earlier this year but Giles Richards and others are reporting that a retooled bid that will see the new entrant operate as a GM works team \u2013 including building their engine by the 2028 season \u2013 and potentially operating under the Cadillac brand name looking to have swayed F1 towards seeing the bid as a strong commercial proposition. Verstappen is a winner and Americans tend to like winners, so perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Giles Richards has found that the championship leader has his fair share of admirers in Vegas this week. Gasly\u2019s claiming of third place on the grid represents the Frenchman\u2019s best-ever performance since entering F1 in 2017 and sets a new mark for Alpine this season after his teammate Esteban Ocon\u2019s remarkable effort to grab fourth secured in a sodden Brazilian qualifying earlier this month. Needless to say, it was one of the biggest shocks of Saturday \u201cI\u2019m very happy to qualify in the top three today,\u201d said Gasly. \u201cThe lap felt incredible and it was one of those when you cross the line and you know that everything was thrown at it. I never imagined that we would be in the top three, though, that was a surprise. \u201cTomorrow, we will give it everything but we know where our fight is. It\u2019s a tough race for tyre degradation and graining. We have to stay on top of it as last year at this race it cost us. We\u2019ve worked hard as a team to understand it and there is more hard work tonight to prepare ourselves. We will go for it tomorrow with the target of taking some points.\u201d Ocon \u2013 who qualified 11th in Vegas \u2013 and Gasly ended up flanking Verstappen on the podium in Brazil, a result that saw them overhaul Haas for sixth place in the Constructor\u2019s Championship and move five points clear of RB. \u201cWith Esteban just missing out on the final part of Qualifying in eleventh place, our goal is to get both cars in the points tomorrow,\u201d team principal Oliver Oakes said. \u201cSimilar to last year, we expect the conditions will be tricky with the lower temperatures and tyre management, so we need to analyse how we can get the most out of our strategy.\u201d Sainz is now two-from-two in qualifying second-fastest in Vegas, albeit last year he was hit with a ten-place penalty before lights out and had to fight back up the grid to finish sixth. The Spaniard, who will be driving with Williams next season, won from pole in Mexico City but crashed his Ferrari and was forced to retire in the following race in Brazil. \u201cI\u2019m happy with qualifying today as it was one of the trickiest Saturdays of the season and we performed well,\u201d said Sainz. \u201cI would have obviously preferred to be on pole, but Mercedes has been very fast all weekend on a flying lap. Overall, we are in a good position for the race and in terms of pace I\u2019m confident we can put up a fight.\u201d Sainz\u2019s teammate Leclerc dramatically overtook P\u00e9rez in the final lap of last year\u2019s race to secure a second-placed finish and will start today on the second row \u2013 Ferrari the only team with representation on both two front rows. With three races remaining on the season, the Italian outfit sits second in the Constructors\u2019 Championship behind McLaren, trailing 557 points to 593, and will be seeking to close that gap this evening. \u201cFor most of the season, we have had a car that has better race than qualifying pace, and certainly our long run pace yesterday was strong,\u201d team principal Fred Vasseur said. \u201cFor sure, the most important thing tomorrow will be tyre management and keeping the graining under control, trying not to push too much at the beginning of the race and managing the tyres as well as possible in order to have more strategy choices.\u201d Given the emergence of a safety car pretty much smack-bang in the middle of the race likely adjusted a lot of team\u2019s plans, it\u2019s unclear just how reflective last year\u2019s debut in Vegas can be used as a guide for what to expect strategy-wise today. We can be confident that teams will have to contend with relatively chilly temperatures. The temperatures drop rapidly after sundown in the Nevada desert and with a 10pm local start time, this is the latest start time of any race on the calendar. Every driver on the grid has two sets of hard tyres up their sleeves for today\u2019s race but given the performance of the mediums throughout the opening days on the street circuit, a one-stop strategy of medium onto hards seems to be emerging as the consensus pick for today\u2019s race. Such an approach would see a lot of cars pitting relatively early, in the 14 to 20 lap range, while those able to nurse their tyres could look to do so between the 28 to 34 lap mark. Invariably, however, there could be interruptions and stoppages throughout \u2013 Vegas is a circuit in which there\u2019s going to be plenty of chances for chopping and changing \u2013 and that means adaptability will be key. In a remarkable example of longevity and love for the sport, Las Vegas will mark the 600th race of Aston Martin stalwart and its current sporting director Andy Stevenson, who has been with the team across its various incarnations as Jordan, Midland, Spyker, Force India, Racing Point and Aston Martin. Giles Richards spoke with him. The national anthem of the United States has been sung. A lovely acappella version by Boyz II Men. Lights out is imminent in Las Vegas! Brundle has now bumped into Colapinto, who says that he\u2019s going ok after his 50g crash last night and is full of praise for his team for getting a car ready for this race. And now here\u2019s Sly Stallone! He was going to race today but apparently he has a bum ankle. Seems he\u2019s conflicted about who to support, he loves a champion but he also loves an underdog. That feels a bit like having one\u2019s cake and eating it too, to be honest. Immediately following the \u2018Rocky\u2019 director is a stoic Verstappen, who looks very much all business. Martin Brundle\u2019s grid walk has begun on Sky Sports but he\u2019s having a bit of trouble anyone finding anyone to talk to at the moment. Well, nobody he wants to talk to; he\u2019s already been stopped by a couple of locals to tell him how excited they are. Oh, he\u2019s found Jerry Bruckheimer, whose producing the film \u2018F1\u2019 that has been doing some filming this weekend. He\u2019s going \u201cfabulous\u201d and he loves the track. They\u2019ll be off to Abu Dhabi to finish filming. And now here\u2019s Paul Mescal, star of the new Gladiator II movie. He\u2019s been hanging with the Ferrari team, apparently. He\u2019s very excited. So, too, is 100m Gold Medalist Noah Lyles. No doubt he\u2019d approve of the global nature of F1 crowning a world champion. The cut and thrust of a race is, of course, a much different beast to the chase for one-lap performance but Verstappen hasn\u2019t been all that happy with the pace of his Red Bull in Vegas as he seeks to secure the title. Though their car looks to be well-placed to succeed on the Qatar and Abu Dhabi courses that will follow this race, Verstappen hasn\u2019t been happy with his car\u2019s top speed in Nevada. \u201cI mean we\u2019re just a bit too slow, we have been struggling to get the tyres to work over a lap, and we are too slow on the straights as well, especially in qualifying,\u201d he said after qualifying. \u201cYou can see our rear wing, it\u2019s trimmed down quite a lot, around the DRS flap, so when we open DRS we don\u2019t get the gains like others do, so that makes it a bit more complicated around here. \u201cBut that\u2019s our own fault, we know that, that\u2019s a compromise we have, but nevertheless I tried to do the best I could. \u201cIt was quite close for P3, little details that could have been a bit better maybe, but overall I\u2019m happy with the laps \u2013 was not much more in it.\u201d Off the track, Russell is also a director of the Grand Prix Drivers\u2019 Association (GPDA), who are increasingly losing patience and confidence in the FIA and its president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem. Giles Richards has more from Nevada. Vegas will mark the fourth time in Russell\u2019s career and the third time this season in which he has qualified in pole. And given the pace his Mercedes has shown throughout the week, the Brit will be determined to make this the race in which he takes that momentum goes from coast-to-coast. The 26-year-old ended up finishing in third behind Verstappen and Norris after recording the fastest qualifying time in Canada earlier this year \u2013 he also finished third after grabbing his maiden pole in Hungary back in 2022 \u2013 and was forced to retire mid-race at Silverstone due to a water leak in his car. Should he take out his second win of the season today, joining his triumph in Austria, it would mark Mercedes\u2019 of the season \u2013 Hamilton taking out wins at Silverstone and Spa, the latter after initial winner Russell was disqualified for an underweight car \u2013 their most since 2021. \u201cThe car has been really strong all weekend,\u201d Mercedes principal Toto Wolff said. \u201cWe seem to be able to extract good performance in these cold temperatures, as we saw at Silverstone and Spa earlier in the season, and that has helped us today. Taking pole position is great but it is also a little bittersweet with Lewis in P10. We definitely had the speed to be on the front row with both cars, but I am sure he will bounce back tomorrow. \u201cIt is difficult to say how the race will go tomorrow. We saw on Thursday that graining is a risk; nobody has had a proper look at the hard tyre either, so there are going to be plenty of unknowns. Hopefully, our single-lap speed translates into race pace, and we have a competitive Grand Prix and fight for victory. Let\u2019s see what we can do.\u201d Jenson Button talking on the Sky Sports coverage about the hours of gaming that have helped Verstappen become what he is today. The former champion, of course, is talking about the simulator but I\u2019m going to pretend his talking about the more recreational type. It gives me hope my hours and hours of Red Dead Redemption 2 may help me ride a horse. To put Verstappen\u2019s chase of a fourpeat in its historical context, should he take out the title today he will become just the fifth driver to accomplish the feat, joining Juan Manuel Fangio, Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton. He\u2019d separate himself from Ayrton Senna, Niki Lauda, Jackie Stewart, Nelson Piquet, and Jack Brabham with three F1 titles and become just the sixth racer to ever win four or more, with that aforementioned quartet joined by Alain Prost in that pantheon. History beckons. Today\u2019s biggest story is that the title is on the line in Vegas. And just seeing the words arranged the way they are feels right, because Vegas is a place that has written itself into history as a place where the title goes on the line. It\u2019s where we got Holmes against Norton in 1978; Spinks becoming the only man to take the title of Ali in the ring in 1978; The Showdown between Leonard and Hearns in 1981 and then the latter\u2019s incredible bout with Hagler in 1985; Holyfield and Bowe in 1992 and the former\u2019s meaty bouts with Tyson; Mayweather locking up with De La Hoya in 2007 and then finally clashing with Pacquaio in 2015; and Wilder and Fury II in 2020. Today, it\u2019s Verstappen and Norris. And it\u2019s pretty straightforward as to how it will work. Starting next to each other in on the gird, the Red Bull driver leads his Maclaren rival by 62 points entering the race, ensuring that he\u2019ll clinch the hardest fought of fourth-straight titles if he can finish ahead of his rival come the end of the 50th lap. To keep the battle for the championship alive heading into the next race in Doha, the Brit must get past Verstappen and outscore him by three points. \u201cHe\u2019s only just ahead of us today,\u201d Norris said of his rival after qualifying. \u201cI think we have a chance to beat them tomorrow. I\u2019ll go out and do my best.\u201d Deep down, there\u2019ll be plenty among the F1 executive class that will be hoping Verstappen gets the job done on the neon-lit streets of Sin City, providing new marquee event with a signature moment that can cement its place in the calendar and the burgeoning American market. Norris and Maclaren, though, won\u2019t care much for that. Further down the grid, Williams\u2019 Franco Colapinto suffered a major impact with the wall at the end of Q2, seeing him end up in 14th place. There had existed concerns that the Argentine rookie wouldn\u2019t be able to take up his place on the grid after the team revealed the force of the impact of the crash amounted to 50Gs but in a team statement Williams confirmed he and his car were able to compete. \u201cFollowing Franco\u2019s incident in qualifying yesterday, he has undergone a thorough follow-up evaluation from the event medical team today and has been cleared to race in this evening\u2019s Las Vegas Grand Prix,\u201d said the statement. \u201cFranco\u2019s health is our main priority, and we are relieved that he is well enough to race following such a significant incident. We thank the medical staff for prioritising Franco\u2019s health and wellbeing and for the excellent care he received.\u201d As a result of the crash, however, Colapinto will start the race from the pit lane due to the significant work needed to get his car back on the grid; a heck of an effort from the crew given both Colapinto and teammate Alexander Albon also DNFd in Brazil. \u201cWe are extremely thankful to our incredible garage team for their hard work overnight to repair Franco\u2019s car and our fans and partners for their continued support,\u201d said Williams\u2019 statement. \u201cWe have taken the opportunity to make some set-up changes during the repair and, as a result, Franco will start the race from the pitlane. \u201cWe are looking forward to going racing under the lights tonight.\u201d Elsewhere, with doubts continuing to linger about his future, Sergio P\u00e9rez\u2019s turgid run of things since F1 returned from its summer break continued, qualifying in 16th and failing to make it through Q1 for the sixth time this season. \u201cThe whole weekend we have been struggling with the grip, it is weirdly difficult to put a lap together, with sliding and grip with the tyres,\u201d said P\u00e9rez. \u201cI did expect a very difficult qualifying and it turned out to be a very tricky one. We have been lacking a lot of low-speed performance and we haven\u2019t been able to put the tyres in the right window, that was the main issue and has been very costly in this session. I wanted more today but the progress was not enough.\u201d After an energy recovery system failure in final practice, the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll was only able to manage one hot lap and qualified in 20. He and Bottas will swap places on the grid, however, after the Fin was handed a five-place grid penalty for an engine change. Fernando Alonso and his Aston Martin will start from 14th. \u201cWe have been uncompetitive the whole weekend so far and expected it to be a struggle heading into Qualifying,\u201d said Alonso. \u201cWe have been struggling with the balance and managing the tyre temperatures in these colder conditions here in Las Vegas. We\u2019ve had a few races of being uncompetitive now, but we need to improve and keep learning for next year. As we saw in last year\u2019s race anything can happen, so we will be ready to capitalise on any incidents or safety cars that come up.\u201d 1. George Russell (Mercedes) 2. Carlos Sainz (Ferrari) 3.

Franco Colapinto (Williams) Howdy, y\u2019all, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Las Vegas Grand Prix and what could prove the decisive race in the hunt for the 2024 world championship. What a difference a year makes. At around this point in 2023, Formula One\u2019s foray into the desert of Nevada was the subject of scepticism and criticism. The first practice on Thursday evening had been forced to be abandoned when a drain cover on the street circuit ripped through the chassis of Carlos Sainz\u2019s Ferrari, locals were expressing their disquietude over the race\u2019s impact, and Max Verstappen, never one to tiptoe around the issue, labelled the event \u201c99% show and 1% sporting event\u201d. One enthralling race later, however, and not only was the Dutchman seemingly won over, singing along with \u2018Viva Las Vegas\u2019 as he cruised to an 18th win in the 2023 season, but so was most of F1. There\u2019s a decided sense of excitement surrounding this year\u2019s race, with Giles Richards reporting on the ground that the event possesses \u201can atmosphere that boundless petrodollars simply cannot buy, and everyone feels it.\u201d This year\u2019s driver\u2019s title still being on the line, as opposed to last year when Verstappen had long since wrapped it up, probably has a lot to do with building this sense of excitement. Despite struggling for pace throughout practice, the Red Bull driver will line up fifth on the grid in today\u2019s race and, adding to the sense of occasion, he will do so next to the Maclaren of the man seeking to get in front of him from sixth and deny him glory, Lando Norris. Of course, while Verstappen won last year\u2019s race, Norris crashed on lap three and was forced to retire \u2013 so there\u2019s plenty of work for the Brit to do on that front. Up the front of the grid, George Russell will start from pole in front of Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz and, after his surprise podium finish in Brazil, Alpine\u2019s Pierre Gasly \u2013 who also qualified fourth at this circuit last year, only to end the race outside the points. Charles Leclerc and his Ferrari will start next to Gasly in fourth. The Mercedes have shown significant pace throughout their time in Vegas, with Lewis Hamilton bemoaning two errors that led to him qualifying in tenth place. \u201cI should have been on pole but I am not,\u201d said Hamilton, in one of his final races for Mercedes before he makes his offseason switch to Ferrari. \u201cC\u2019est la vie. You live to fight another day. But I didn\u2019t do the job. I didn\u2019t put the laps together. It\u2019s not a stinger. I feel great. The good thing is I have pace.\u201d The RB of Yuki Tsunoda \u2013 after the Japanese driver was interrogated by United States border officials in his pyjamas \u2013 and McLaren of Oscar Piastri will line up behind Verstappen and Norris, while Nico H\u00fclkenberg and his Haas will start in ninth place next to Hamilton.

Their first-to-10-wins encounter was held in three US cities over the next 78 days for a prize fund of $4,000. Since then, the world chess championship has provided the stage for countless unforgettable contests showcasing the precision, imagination and brilliance of the royal game at the highest level. Here are 22 of the most memorable.</p> \n<h2></h2> \n<p>New Orleans 1886</p> \n<p>Wilhelm Steinitz v Johannes Zukertort (Game 19)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The inaugural world title match reached its climax at the New Orleans Chess, Checkers and Whist Club at the corner of Baronne and Canal Street, the <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/home_garden/playing-games-at-canal-and-baronne-before-walgreens-the-corner-was-home-to-the-chess/article_bd822b78-fccf-11e9-958c-9b0e8df5875f.html\">site of a present-day Walgreen\u2019s</a>. Steinitz, playing with the black pieces, relied on his innovative positional style against the physically and mentally fatigued Zukertort, skillfully maneuvering into a sharp endgame where his superior calculation and strategic understanding prevailed. The game embodied the triumph of modern, scientific chess over the romantic, aggressive style of the 19th century, cementing the Austrian\u2019s legacy as a pioneer of positional play and the first undisputed chess champion.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wilhelm Steinitz v Johannes Zukertort (Game 19)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/sOsIglC1/zxA6H7jY\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>New York 1894</p> \n<p>Emanuel Lasker v Wilhelm Steinitz (Game 7)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>In one of the most famous games of the era, Lasker punished Steinitz\u2019s overaggression, capitalizing on the champion\u2019s uncharacteristic inaccuracies to secure a decisive win with sharp tactical play and superior endgame technique. Played before a capacity crowd at the Union Square Hotel, the game exemplified the contrast between Steinitz\u2019s classical, more dogmatic foundations and his German foe\u2019s adaptable, pragmatic style, which came to define his record 27-year reign as world champion. As Kasparov put it: \u201cIn a difficult position, he succeeded in setting his opponent the sort of complex problems, of a sort that chess would not see again until the latter half of the 20th century.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Emanuel Lasker v Wilhelm Steinitz (1894, Game 7)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/5cBb4ta7/BDLdWTk6\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>New York 1907</p> \n<p>Emanuel Lasker v Frank Marshall (Game 1)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The opening game of a six-city affair set the tone for a match that proved a fiasco for the 29-year-old Marshall, the top American and one of the finest attacking players of his era. The emboldened challenger launched a sharp offensive early in the game, but Lasker calmly dismantled the threats and transitioned into a superior position. The decisive win at the Manhattan Chess Club was a showcase of the 38-year-old champion\u2019s ability to neutralize aggression and exploit overextension, which became a theme of a contest that saw Marshall fail to win any of the 15 games.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Emanuel Lasker v Frank Marshall (1907, Game 1)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/2k6CI0TT/sOfXAJf5\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Havana 1921</p> \n<p>Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca v Emanuel Lasker (Game 10)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The 32-year-old Capablanca\u2019s precise, almost effortless accumulation of minute positional advantages in the middlegame demonstrated a profound understanding of strategy, while the conclusion helped solidify his reputation as one of history\u2019s finest endgame players. The 68-move win proved the turning point of a tightly wound match, which went downhill in a hurry for the longtime champion, giving rise to a stylistic shift from Lasker\u2019s resourceful, combative approach to Capablanca\u2019s clean, logical play that ushered in a new era of chess. The Cuban\u2019s winning margin of four victories and no defeats was the most lopsided in a world championship match <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/11/magnus-carlsen-epochal-chess-world-title-triumph-proves-an-antidote-to-perfection\">for the next 100 years</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca v Emanuel Lasker (Game 10)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/IHd26YD9/653TJF7r\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Buenos Aires 1927</p> \n<p>Alexander Alekhine v Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca (Game 11)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Having never beaten Capabalanca in a classical game before their first-to-six-wins match at the Club Argentino de Ajedrez, Alekhine adopted the Queen\u2019s Gambit Declined and applied relentless positional pressure, forcing the champion into a series of difficult decisions. The Russian-born challenger, who became a naturalized French citizen during the course of the nine-week contest, then relied on superior calcuation and technique in the endgame to outplay Capablanca in his strongest phase. The victory punctured the Cuban giant\u2019s aura of invincibility and marked a pivotal moment in Alekhine\u2019s ultimately successful bid to dethrone the reigning champion. A rematch never came to pass due to a combination of Alekhine\u2019s reluctance, financial disagreements, the players\u2019 mutual disdain and the lack of a formal championship structure (which wouldn\u2019t exist until 1948).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Alexander Alekhine v Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca (1927, Game 11)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/4osZl9LA/nF4qFrk5\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Bayreuth 1934</p> \n<p>Alexander Alekhine v Efim Bogoljubov (Game 16)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>\u201cIt is incredible how long Alekhine remained on top despite his pernicious addiction to alcohol,\u201d wrote the Dutch-American grandmaster Hans Kmoch, who was taken aback by the large trunk containing \u201cnothing but liquor bottles \u2013 a traveling bar\u201d he saw delivered to the champion\u2019s hotel room during his 1934 tie with Bogoljubow. No matter. The 41-year-old Alekhine was still capable of brilliant attacking performances like their 16th game, which he steered into a sharp and complex middlegame to create a decisive kingside attack. The result left Alekhine with one hand on the trophy in a rematch of their world title showdown from six years before, reaffirming his status as one of the most dominant champions of his era.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Alexander Alekhine v Efim Bogoljubov (1934, Game 16)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/gjebhlw9/DrtcC7WU\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Zandvoort 1935</p> \n<p>Max Euwe v Alexander Alekhine (Game 26)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Euwe\u2019s tactical brilliance in one of the finest games ever played (immortalized as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_4Dw3-XmYiw?si=J7A0m-F4eLxkPDh1\">the Pearl of Zandvoort</a>) was the turning point in his historic upset of Alekhine <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oii4PlhB_VM?si=xaNoYxMUBkmTzRtC\">in a back-and-forth match</a> staged in 13 cities across the Netherlands over an 80-day span.

Botvinnik, renowned for his strategic precision and ironclad defense, clashed with Bronstein\u2019s creative and unpredictable play. The 27-year-old challenger\u2019s daring sacrifices in their sixth game placed suffocating pressure on Botvinnik, who was able to gradually equalize toward a dead-drawn position. That\u2019s when Bronstein (after 45 minutes of thought!) made one of the most spectacular errors in world championship history (57 Kc2??), a move the press immediately declared the Blunder of the Century. The complexity and tension of the contest embodied the high level of psychological intensity that defined the first drawn world title match, which saw the 39-year-old Botvinnik retain the title at Moscow\u2019s Tchaikovsky Concert Hall.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mikhail Botvinnik v David Bronstein (1951, Game 6)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/VWWZhfra/IgcQWKyL\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Moscow 1954</p> \n<p>Mikhail Botvinnik v Vasily Smyslov (Game 9)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The opening chapter in Botvinnik and Smyslov\u2019s world championship trilogy is regarded as one of the most exciting matches ever played with the ninth game standing out as the highlight. The 33-year-old Smyslov probed at subtle weaknesses in Botvinnik\u2019s pawn structure, restricted counterplay in the middlegame and ended a short but heated battle with a rare queen sacrifice (19 Qxe4!!) against one of history\u2019s most formidable defenders. It was the first of three straight wins that saw Smyslov swing a 3-0 match deficit into a 5-3 advantage, only for Botvinnik to fight back and retain the title on another 12-12 draw.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mikhail Botvinnik v Vasily Smyslov (1954, Game 9)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/4kW88tiy/f8aOSBtJ\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Moscow 1957</p> \n<p>Vasily Smyslov v Mikhail Botvinnik (Game 6)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Smyslov\u2019s deep positional understanding and ability to exploit small advantages was on full display as he incrementally gained control over key squares, gradually building a kingside attack while limiting Botvinnik\u2019s counterplay. The Muscovite challenger\u2019s precise calculations and harmonious piece coordination culminated in a decisive breakthrough, forcing Botvinnik into a passive and losing position. The game marked the crossroads in a match that saw Smyslov prevail 12\u00bd-9\u00bd and end Botvinnik\u2019s nine-year championship reign, though the Soviet legend would wrest back the title the following year in their rubber match.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Vasily Smyslov v Mikhail Botvinnik (1957, Game 6)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/MPkpQJkr/uw74l8RT\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Moscow 1960</p> \n<p>Mikhail Tal v Mikhail Botvinnik (Game 6)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>It\u2019s been said that while Botvinnik was always searching for the rules, Tal was always looking out for the exceptions. Never was that more apt than in the sixth game of their first title clash, when the swashbuckling Magician from Riga unleashed a sacrificial assault, prioritizing dynamic piece play over material, leaving Botvinnik to grapple with the startling complications. The audience was said to have been so excited by the 23-year-old\u2019s speculative knight sacrifice (21...Nf4) that organizers moved the game to a back room due to the noise. The most famous game of Tal\u2019s career was the artistic pinnacle of a match he never trailed, winning by a decisive four-point margin to become the youngest ever world champion until Kasparov.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mikhail Tal v Mikhail Botvinnik (1960, Game 6)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/gIQYxy2h/yTm6ibUU\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Moscow 1966</p> \n<p>Boris Spassky v Tigran Petrosian (Game 10)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Spassky, the rising star of Soviet chess, had gone off as a slight favorite against Petrosian, the Armenian southpaw nicknamed Iron Tigran whose unmatched defensive prowess carried him to the championship three years earlier. But Petrosian tightened his grip on the match in their 10th game, neutralizing the 29-year-old challenger\u2019s aggressive attack with precise, prophylactic play. In a stunning reversal, Petrosian turned defense into offense, seizing control and claiming his second win. The game exemplified the 36-year-old\u2019s flair for exploiting small positional edges while maintaining psychological pressure in the hairy moments. He\u2019d go on retain the title but Spassky\u2019s time was not far off; he\u2019d win their rematch three years later.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Boris Spassky v Tigran Petrosian (1966, Game 10)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/hm6ViybN/pwO07DGj\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Reykjav\u00edk 1972</p> \n<p>Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky (Game 6)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The peak of Fischer\u2019s genius.

Playing with the white pieces, Fischer surprised the champion by deviating from his usual 1 e4 openings and deploying 1 c4 for only the third time in a serious game. His deep strategic planning shined in the middlegame, leaving the champion with no counterplay, before he closed the show with a flawless, elegant endgame. Recognizing the brilliance of the moment, Spassky could only stand and applaud with the audience when he resigned after 41 moves. \u201cThis game was notable for two things,\u201d the former British champion C.H.O\u2019D. Alexander observed. \u201cFirst, Fischer played the Queen\u2019s Gambit for the first time in his life in a serious game; second, he played it to perfection, the game indeed casting doubt on Black\u2019s whole opening system.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky (1972, Game 6)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/Eyl4uwTZ/XAap6rqF\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Reykjav\u00edk 1972</p> \n<p>Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky (Game 10)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Trailing 5\u00bd-3\u00bd in a match he\u2019d once led 2-0, the unbowed Spassky achieved a favorable position from the Ruy Lopez opening and appeared to have the upper hand. But Fischer defended with extraordinary skill and found ingenious counterplay to neutralize the threats, seize the initiative and transition into attack by exploiting Spassky\u2019s inaccuracies (25...Qxa5?!). A classic example of Fischer\u2019s ability to adapt under enormous pressure and capitalize on seemingly equal or even slightly worse positions, the result delivered a critical psychological blow to the champion and reinforced Fischer\u2019s mounting dominance in the match. The lone, self-taught American went on to win 12\u00bd-8\u00bd over the Soviet chess machine, the only world championship match won by a player from outside the USSR from 1948 until the country\u2019s dissolution in 1991.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky (1972, Game 10)\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/Eyl4uwTZ/g0uwrqrL\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Moscow 1985</p> \n<p>Anatoly Karpov v Garry Kasparov (Game 16)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Seven months after their grueling first world title encounter was controversially abandoned after 48 games due to concerns over player health, Kasparov and Karpov reconvened in Moscow for a rematch freighted with ideological undertones amid a shifting political climate in Russia.

      "bodyText": "From the middle of the 16th century, there have come down to us the names of chess players who have been widely regarded as the strongest of their time. The earliest of these was the Spanish priest Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura, after whom one of the most popular openings of modern times is named. Others who followed include the Calabrese Gioachino Greco, Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor, Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais, Alexander McDonnell, Howard Staunton, Adolf Anderssen, Mikhail Chigorin and Paul Morphy, each of whom are lionized for their contributions to the development of theory and strategy as well as their dominance over their board during their respective eras. But not until Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort sat down in a small room at 80 Fifth Avenue in New York City on the afternoon of 11 January 1886 did a formal competition to determine the best player on the planet come to pass. Their first-to-10-wins encounter was held in three US cities over the next 78 days for a prize fund of $4,000. Since then, the world chess championship has provided the stage for countless unforgettable contests showcasing the precision, imagination and brilliance of the royal game at the highest level. Here are 22 of the most memorable. New Orleans 1886 Wilhelm Steinitz v Johannes Zukertort (Game 19) The inaugural world title match reached its climax at the New Orleans Chess, Checkers and Whist Club at the corner of Baronne and Canal Street, the site of a present-day Walgreen\u2019s. Steinitz, playing with the black pieces, relied on his innovative positional style against the physically and mentally fatigued Zukertort, skillfully maneuvering into a sharp endgame where his superior calculation and strategic understanding prevailed. The game embodied the triumph of modern, scientific chess over the romantic, aggressive style of the 19th century, cementing the Austrian\u2019s legacy as a pioneer of positional play and the first undisputed chess champion. New York 1894 Emanuel Lasker v Wilhelm Steinitz (Game 7) In one of the most famous games of the era, Lasker punished Steinitz\u2019s overaggression, capitalizing on the champion\u2019s uncharacteristic inaccuracies to secure a decisive win with sharp tactical play and superior endgame technique. Played before a capacity crowd at the Union Square Hotel, the game exemplified the contrast between Steinitz\u2019s classical, more dogmatic foundations and his German foe\u2019s adaptable, pragmatic style, which came to define his record 27-year reign as world champion. As Kasparov put it: \u201cIn a difficult position, he succeeded in setting his opponent the sort of complex problems, of a sort that chess would not see again until the latter half of the 20th century.\u201d New York 1907 Emanuel Lasker v Frank Marshall (Game 1) The opening game of a six-city affair set the tone for a match that proved a fiasco for the 29-year-old Marshall, the top American and one of the finest attacking players of his era. The emboldened challenger launched a sharp offensive early in the game, but Lasker calmly dismantled the threats and transitioned into a superior position. The decisive win at the Manhattan Chess Club was a showcase of the 38-year-old champion\u2019s ability to neutralize aggression and exploit overextension, which became a theme of a contest that saw Marshall fail to win any of the 15 games. Havana 1921 Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca v Emanuel Lasker (Game 10) The 32-year-old Capablanca\u2019s precise, almost effortless accumulation of minute positional advantages in the middlegame demonstrated a profound understanding of strategy, while the conclusion helped solidify his reputation as one of history\u2019s finest endgame players. The 68-move win proved the turning point of a tightly wound match, which went downhill in a hurry for the longtime champion, giving rise to a stylistic shift from Lasker\u2019s resourceful, combative approach to Capablanca\u2019s clean, logical play that ushered in a new era of chess. The Cuban\u2019s winning margin of four victories and no defeats was the most lopsided in a world championship match for the next 100 years. Buenos Aires 1927 Alexander Alekhine v Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca (Game 11) Having never beaten Capabalanca in a classical game before their first-to-six-wins match at the Club Argentino de Ajedrez, Alekhine adopted the Queen\u2019s Gambit Declined and applied relentless positional pressure, forcing the champion into a series of difficult decisions. The Russian-born challenger, who became a naturalized French citizen during the course of the nine-week contest, then relied on superior calcuation and technique in the endgame to outplay Capablanca in his strongest phase. The victory punctured the Cuban giant\u2019s aura of invincibility and marked a pivotal moment in Alekhine\u2019s ultimately successful bid to dethrone the reigning champion. A rematch never came to pass due to a combination of Alekhine\u2019s reluctance, financial disagreements, the players\u2019 mutual disdain and the lack of a formal championship structure (which wouldn\u2019t exist until 1948). Bayreuth 1934 Alexander Alekhine v Efim Bogoljubov (Game 16) \u201cIt is incredible how long Alekhine remained on top despite his pernicious addiction to alcohol,\u201d wrote the Dutch-American grandmaster Hans Kmoch, who was taken aback by the large trunk containing \u201cnothing but liquor bottles \u2013 a traveling bar\u201d he saw delivered to the champion\u2019s hotel room during his 1934 tie with Bogoljubow. No matter. The 41-year-old Alekhine was still capable of brilliant attacking performances like their 16th game, which he steered into a sharp and complex middlegame to create a decisive kingside attack. The result left Alekhine with one hand on the trophy in a rematch of their world title showdown from six years before, reaffirming his status as one of the most dominant champions of his era. Zandvoort 1935 Max Euwe v Alexander Alekhine (Game 26) Euwe\u2019s tactical brilliance in one of the finest games ever played (immortalized as the Pearl of Zandvoort) was the turning point in his historic upset of Alekhine in a back-and-forth match staged in 13 cities across the Netherlands over an 80-day span. The Amsterdam native showed composed precision under immense pressure, outplaying Alekhine in a tense, strategic battle that exemplified the challenger\u2019s resilience and positional understanding. Euwe, a 34-year-old mathematics teacher who\u2019d captured the world amateur title seven years prior, went on to become the fifth wereldkampioen and first non-professional to win the crown. Moscow 1951 Mikhail Botvinnik v David Bronstein (Game 6) The first all-Soviet world title match, but far from the last, offered up a delicious contrast of styles. Botvinnik, renowned for his strategic precision and ironclad defense, clashed with Bronstein\u2019s creative and unpredictable play. The 27-year-old challenger\u2019s daring sacrifices in their sixth game placed suffocating pressure on Botvinnik, who was able to gradually equalize toward a dead-drawn position. That\u2019s when Bronstein (after 45 minutes of thought!) made one of the most spectacular errors in world championship history (57 Kc2??), a move the press immediately declared the Blunder of the Century. The complexity and tension of the contest embodied the high level of psychological intensity that defined the first drawn world title match, which saw the 39-year-old Botvinnik retain the title at Moscow\u2019s Tchaikovsky Concert Hall. Moscow 1954 Mikhail Botvinnik v Vasily Smyslov (Game 9) The opening chapter in Botvinnik and Smyslov\u2019s world championship trilogy is regarded as one of the most exciting matches ever played with the ninth game standing out as the highlight. The 33-year-old Smyslov probed at subtle weaknesses in Botvinnik\u2019s pawn structure, restricted counterplay in the middlegame and ended a short but heated battle with a rare queen sacrifice (19 Qxe4!!) against one of history\u2019s most formidable defenders. It was the first of three straight wins that saw Smyslov swing a 3-0 match deficit into a 5-3 advantage, only for Botvinnik to fight back and retain the title on another 12-12 draw. Moscow 1957 Vasily Smyslov v Mikhail Botvinnik (Game 6) Smyslov\u2019s deep positional understanding and ability to exploit small advantages was on full display as he incrementally gained control over key squares, gradually building a kingside attack while limiting Botvinnik\u2019s counterplay. The Muscovite challenger\u2019s precise calculations and harmonious piece coordination culminated in a decisive breakthrough, forcing Botvinnik into a passive and losing position. The game marked the crossroads in a match that saw Smyslov prevail 12\u00bd-9\u00bd and end Botvinnik\u2019s nine-year championship reign, though the Soviet legend would wrest back the title the following year in their rubber match. Moscow 1960 Mikhail Tal v Mikhail Botvinnik (Game 6) It\u2019s been said that while Botvinnik was always searching for the rules, Tal was always looking out for the exceptions. Never was that more apt than in the sixth game of their first title clash, when the swashbuckling Magician from Riga unleashed a sacrificial assault, prioritizing dynamic piece play over material, leaving Botvinnik to grapple with the startling complications. The audience was said to have been so excited by the 23-year-old\u2019s speculative knight sacrifice (21...Nf4) that organizers moved the game to a back room due to the noise. The most famous game of Tal\u2019s career was the artistic pinnacle of a match he never trailed, winning by a decisive four-point margin to become the youngest ever world champion until Kasparov. Moscow 1966 Boris Spassky v Tigran Petrosian (Game 10) Spassky, the rising star of Soviet chess, had gone off as a slight favorite against Petrosian, the Armenian southpaw nicknamed Iron Tigran whose unmatched defensive prowess carried him to the championship three years earlier. But Petrosian tightened his grip on the match in their 10th game, neutralizing the 29-year-old challenger\u2019s aggressive attack with precise, prophylactic play. In a stunning reversal, Petrosian turned defense into offense, seizing control and claiming his second win. The game exemplified the 36-year-old\u2019s flair for exploiting small positional edges while maintaining psychological pressure in the hairy moments. He\u2019d go on retain the title but Spassky\u2019s time was not far off; he\u2019d win their rematch three years later. Reykjav\u00edk 1972 Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky (Game 6) The peak of Fischer\u2019s genius. Known as the Game of the Century, the 29-year-old American\u2019s profound understanding of positional chess, unparalleled adaptability and impeccable endgame play all came together on the day that proved the turning point of their Cold War proxy battle in the Icelandic capital. Playing with the white pieces, Fischer surprised the champion by deviating from his usual 1 e4 openings and deploying 1 c4 for only the third time in a serious game. His deep strategic planning shined in the middlegame, leaving the champion with no counterplay, before he closed the show with a flawless, elegant endgame. Recognizing the brilliance of the moment, Spassky could only stand and applaud with the audience when he resigned after 41 moves. \u201cThis game was notable for two things,\u201d the former British champion C.H.O\u2019D. Alexander observed. \u201cFirst, Fischer played the Queen\u2019s Gambit for the first time in his life in a serious game; second, he played it to perfection, the game indeed casting doubt on Black\u2019s whole opening system.\u201d Reykjav\u00edk 1972 Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky (Game 10) Trailing 5\u00bd-3\u00bd in a match he\u2019d once led 2-0, the unbowed Spassky achieved a favorable position from the Ruy Lopez opening and appeared to have the upper hand. But Fischer defended with extraordinary skill and found ingenious counterplay to neutralize the threats, seize the initiative and transition into attack by exploiting Spassky\u2019s inaccuracies (25...Qxa5?!). A classic example of Fischer\u2019s ability to adapt under enormous pressure and capitalize on seemingly equal or even slightly worse positions, the result delivered a critical psychological blow to the champion and reinforced Fischer\u2019s mounting dominance in the match. The lone, self-taught American went on to win 12\u00bd-8\u00bd over the Soviet chess machine, the only world championship match won by a player from outside the USSR from 1948 until the country\u2019s dissolution in 1991. Moscow 1985 Anatoly Karpov v Garry Kasparov (Game 16) Seven months after their grueling first world title encounter was controversially abandoned after 48 games due to concerns over player health, Kasparov and Karpov reconvened in Moscow for a rematch freighted with ideological undertones amid a shifting political climate in Russia. Kasparov, playing as white, unleashed a dynamic attack in a sharp variation of the Sicilian Defense, showcasing his aggressive and tactical prowess, dismantling Karpov\u2019s position with unsparing pressure. The 22-year-old Kasparov broke a tie in the match for a lead he would not surrender, winning 13-11 to become the youngest undisputed world champion in history (a mark India\u2019s Gukesh Dommaraju can eclipse in 2024). They\u2019d end up facing one another in five world title matches from 1984 to 1990, crystallizing one of the great rivalries across all of sport. London 2000 Vladimir Kramnik v Garry Kasparov (Game 2) The Riverside Studios in London\u2019s Hammersmith played host to a landmark contest as the 25-year-old Kramnik, playing as white, uncorked a novelty that helped dismantle Kasparov\u2019s beloved Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence so effectively that he wouldn\u2019t play again in the match. After winning their second game in an opposite-bishop ending, Kramnik went on to prevail 8\u00bd-6\u00bd and end Kasparov\u2019s 15-year title reign. The match (then known as the Braingames World Championship) also sparked a surge in popularity for the Berlin Defense, which Kramnik used four times with the black pieces, earning it the nickname \u2018Berlin Wall\u2019 and influencing future elite-level chess. Brissago 2004 Vladimir Kramnik v Peter Leko (Game 14) Trailing 7-6 in the best-of-14-games match with all margin for error completely spent, Kramnik was able to get an advantage out of the opening with a sharp variation of the Caro-Kann. The Hungarian challenger defended tenaciously but ultimately buckled after Kramnik managed to break into the black position with a positional pawn sacrifice. Facing checkmate in two moves, Leko resigned and Kramnik retained the championship on a 7-7 draw. \u201cI had to give everything, especially at the end, to win against such an opponent,\u201d he said. \u201cPeter Leko is an incredible defender. For me it was more difficult than my match against Kasparov in the year 2000.\u201d Bonn 2008 Viswanathan Anand v Vladimir Kramnik (Game 5) Twenty years after becoming India\u2019s first grandmaster, Anand put his deep preparation on full display as he unveiled the Meran Variation of the Semi-Slav Defense, neutralizing his opponent\u2019s threats while building a decisive advantage. The Tiger Of Madras incrementally applied pressure in dynamic battle with unbalanced pawn structures until a Kramnik blunder (29 Nxd4??) handed him a second win as black in the match. The showcase of adaptability and execution opened a 3\u00bd\u20131\u00bd lead for Anand, who went on to defend the undisputed world title he\u2019d won in 2006. New York 2016 Magnus Carlsen v Sergey Karjakin (Game 10) Carlsen later admitted to the Guardian he\u2019d believed defeat was \u201ccertain\u201d after he\u2019d lost the eighth game with the white pieces. But the Norwegian star leveled the match three days later with a stunning win under immense pressure. Playing as white, Carlsen opted for the Ruy Lopez, carefully building a small advantage in a tense middlegame. As the position transitioned to an endgame, the champion\u2019s relentless technique and deep understanding of nuances allowed him to outmaneuver Karjakin, who finally cracked under the strain. He\u2019d go on to retain the title with an elegant queen sacrifice in the third game a rapid tiebreaker. Dubai 2021 Magnus Carlsen v Ian Nepomniachtchi (Game 6) Carlsen fought back from the brink to draw first blood against Nepomniachtchi in a heart-stopping sixth game that spanned eight hours over parts of two days before ending after midnight. The Russian challenger and world No 5 went from having Carlsen on the ropes under clock pressure at the first time control, to coming within five seconds of losing on time himself, to finding himself squeezed toward submission in a positional endgame by an unforgiving foe operating with engine-like precision. When he finally resigned after 136 moves, the playing hall erupted in applause. It marked the longest game in the centuries-spanning history of world championship matchplay, surpassing the 124-move stalemate between Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi in the fifth game of their 1978 tilt. Astana 2023 Ian Nepomniachtchi v Ding Liren (Game 12) Needing at least one win in the final three games to force the championship into tiebreakers, Ding masterfully countered Nepomniachtchi\u2019s aggressive setup as white with precise defensive play and sharp tactics. The game moved into a tense and complex middlegame where Ding seized the initiative, gradually outmaneuvering Nepomniachtchi and capitalizing on this opponent\u2019s errors to secure a decisive victory. He\u2019d go on to win the title in a tiebreak playoff, despite having never once led in the three-week match, to become the 17th man to capture the world chess title and the first from China.",

      "bodyText": "A California doctor who has helped dozens of terminally ill people end their lives at a time of their own choosing has said decades of experience in the US showed that there was no danger of a \u201cslippery slope\u201d if assisted dying legislation was robustly framed. Dr Catherine Sonquist Forest, a family physician based in Santa Cruz, said the proposed legislation due to be voted on by MPs at Westminster this week was \u201cimpressive\u201d. Since California legalised assisted dying eight years ago, there had been no broadening of the criteria, and in neighbouring Oregon, there had been no change to the law in nearly three decades. \u201cI don\u2019t see change coming any time soon,\u201d Forest told the Observer. Forest has trained thousands of doctors to help terminally ill people to die, and has been personally involved in dozens of assisted deaths. All were \u201cprofound experiences\u201d and a privilege, she said. The option of assisted dying gave people a degree of control over their own body, she said: \u201cThe decision is theirs alone \u2013 not their family\u2019s, not their doctor\u2019s and certainly not the government\u2019s. \u201cThis is their agency. As in any situation, contingency planning gives most people great peace of mind,\u201d she said. California\u2019s End of Life Option Act allows terminally ill adults to request medication from their doctor that will end their life. But they must have a life-limiting illness with a prognosis of six months or less, plus mental capacity, to be eligible for what is termed aid in dying. Medication must be self-administered. \u201cWe prescribe a combination of drugs that cause someone to lose consciousness within between 20 minutes and two hours. The person\u2019s heart stops about two hours after taking the medication and they die,\u201d said Forest. \u201cIt\u2019s like a deep anaesthetic. We don\u2019t see any sign of suffering.\u201d She explains to patients what will happen, and offers to stay with them until they die \u201cbut it\u2019s their call. It\u2019s quite a privilege to be present at such a profound moment.\u201d Only about one in 10 people who embarked on the road to assisted dying \u201cfollow it through to the end\u201d, she said. Some just want the security of knowing an assisted death is available, some \u201cwant every possible minute\u201d with loved ones, and for others changing medical circumstances mean it is no longer possible. Overall, fewer than 1% of all deaths in the state were the result of the legislation, Forest said: \u201cMany physicians will never face [an assisted death], but those that do, want to do it well.\u201d Forest\u2019s first experience of people asking her to help them die was at the height of the HIV/Aids era in San Francisco: \u201cIn the 1980s we had no treatments that would alleviate much of the suffering. Many of them requested assistance, which at that time was illegal in my state.\u201d In 2009, Forest\u2019s mother was terminally ill. \u201cShe had terrific palliative care in a hospice, but there was nothing they could really do to alleviate her suffering.

There\u2019s the unwieldy running time, for a start \u2013 two hours and 40 minutes \u2013 and the cynical, box-office-gouging decision to carve the story into two films (fans will have to wait almost a year to the day before they get to watch the concluding chapter).</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing: reservations are soon extinguished and grumbles about the release strategy swiftly quashed. <em>Wicked</em> matches its polished razzle-dazzle with real heart. Driven by knockout performances from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, Jon M Chu\u2019s impossibly slick charm assault of an adaptation zips along so enjoyably that you almost wish it were longer (your bladder may disagree). With its all too timely themes of bullying, corrupt leaders and the demonisation of difference, this is a movie that promises a froth of pink and green escapism but delivers considerably more in the way of depth and darkness.</p> <p>For those who have somehow evaded <em>Wicked\u2019</em>s cultural reach over the past couple of decades, here\u2019s a brief primer. The film and the stage show are both loosely based on Gregory Maguire\u2019s 1995 novel <em>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</em>, which offers an alternative backstory for the Wicked Witch from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. This film focuses on <em>Wicked</em>\u2019s early years and two young witches-to-be: green-skinned outcast Elphaba (Erivo), who will go on to become the Wicked Witch of the West, and the vain, popular Galinda (Grande), who will eventually blossom into Glinda the Good.</p>    <p>Both Elphaba and Galinda are newly arrived at Shiz University (think the student politics of <em>Mean Girls\u2019s</em> North Shore High and the curriculum of Hogwarts). Although not enrolled as a student, Elphaba is on site to help her paraplegic younger sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode). But the formidable teacher Madame Morrible (a haughtily fabulous Michelle Yeoh, breezing over any vocal limitations in a cloud of intimidating glamour) spots potential in Elphaba and offers her one-to-one tutoring in the art of enchantment. To the mutual disgust of both girls, Elphaba and Galinda find themselves assigned as roomies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Grande has a vocal range so extensive that some of it is only audible to bats, and she uses every last note of it here</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not just their personalities that clash: the film\u2019s colour palette is at first a battleground between the chlorophyll green of Elphaba\u2019s skin and the candyfloss pink of Galinda\u2019s wardrobe. But visuals that initially seem jarring start to find harmony as the movie progresses. A scene in a forest full of mossy tuffets of vegetation and garlands of delicate, rosy blooms is lush and lovely, one of several notable triumphs for the production design department, led by Nathan Crowley, whose credits include the similarly lavish <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/10/wonka-review-paul-king-paddington-director-timothee-chalamet-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-prequel-roald-dahl-olivia-colman-hugh-grant\">Wonka</a></em>.

But it\u2019s also entirely conceivable that, whatever the US does over the next four years, the momentum of a new world order will continue to be fashioned through future Cops in Brazil and Australia, as well as in other forums \u2013 and that, as the transition continues to gather pace, America\u2019s abstention will not derail the process but open up a space of new possibility. \u2022 Ashish Ghadiali is founder/director of Radical Ecology Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "body": "<p>My sister and I are lying on slabs like&nbsp;flounders in a&nbsp;fishmonger\u2019s. Instead of a bed of&nbsp;ice, though, we\u2019re stretched out on heated marble. We move between three hot rooms, each resembling little chapels with vaulted ceilings, chatting quietly in the cooler one, applying face and hair masks in the middle one, and simply lying still, sweating, in the hottest one.&nbsp;Later, we will be scrubbed and massaged. In between, we cool off under a rain-mist shower, or retire to a&nbsp;bed in our own private mahogany-panelled booth beneath a glazed dome.</p> <p>It sounds like a luxury spa, with prices to match. In fact, we\u2019re at&nbsp;a&nbsp;century-old public bathhouse. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.city-baths.co.uk/\">City Baths in Newcastle</a> reopened in April after an \u00a38m restoration \u2013 and&nbsp;a decade-long campaign. A&nbsp;two\u2011hour Turkish bath session here&nbsp;costs about \u00a320, which includes a&nbsp;swim in the pool upstairs.</p> <p>The City Baths is one of the UK\u2019s few&nbsp;surviving Victorian or Victorian-style Turkish baths. It was built in&nbsp;1927&nbsp;on the site of an even older bathhouse, the Northumberland Baths, which opened in 1859. Despite being Grade II-listed in 1992, classed as&nbsp;of high architectural significance in&nbsp;2012, and being well used and loved by the people of Newcastle, the city council closed it in 2013.</p>    <p>The closure was a familiar story. There were once more than 600 Turkish baths in Britain and Ireland. The movement was spearheaded by the Scottish diplomat and politician David Urquhart, who had visited hammams in Turkey and Morocco, and the Irish doctor Richard Barter, a&nbsp;hydrotherapy pioneer. The first Turkish bath opened in Blarney, County Cork, in 1856. London had one by 1860, and they spread across Britain and Ireland over the next 40 years.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.victorianturkishbath.org/_000HOME/HOMEPAGE.htm\">Malcolm Shifrin</a>, a historian and the&nbsp;author of <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.co.uk/first-edition/Victorian-Turkish-Baths-Shifrin-Malcolm-Historic/31117248483/bd\">Victorian Turkish Baths</a>, explains their importance: \u201cThis cultural institution contributed public cleansing facilities when most people had no running water, therapeutic benefits at a time when modern medicine was barely in its infancy, and&nbsp;destressing, relaxation facilities.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Turkish baths began to decline after\u00a0the second world war, when more people had access to hot running water</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As well as their health benefits, Turkish baths were considered a social good. According to the Friends of the&nbsp;City Baths: \u201cUrquhart saw that working men gained skills when building the baths, and he also saw the&nbsp;value of using bath premises as a&nbsp;meeting place.\u201d</p> <p>Turkish baths began to decline after&nbsp;the second world war, when more people had access to hot running water&nbsp;and modern medicine. Today, they are an expensive leisure facility for&nbsp;cash-strapped councils to maintain, heat and staff. But as Shifrin points out:&nbsp;\u201cMany of the buildings that housed&nbsp;Victorian Turkish baths have architectural merit.\u201d He highlights the&nbsp;surviving baths in Harrogate, Manchester, Carlisle, Edinburgh and Glasgow as being particularly precious.</p> <p>Despite their historical significance, by 1990 only 34 original baths were still open. Today, there are 11 in the UK&nbsp;\u2013 and of those, three are in private members\u2019 clubs, two are closed for refurbishment and just six are open to&nbsp;the general public. The City Baths is&nbsp;a rare example of a bathhouse that came back from the brink, largely thanks to tireless local campaigning. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely brilliant,\u201d says Shifrin of the reopening, \u201cand thanks to a&nbsp;wonderful group of women who worked freely to keep alive something important in their lives.\u201d</p>    <p>Shifrin first went to a Victorian-style Turkish bath as a teenager in the&nbsp;1950s, at the original Imperial hotel in Russell Square, London, which was \u201csavagely demolished\u201d in 1967. He&nbsp;has since visited all the surviving baths, including those in private clubs (the Royal Automobile Club in London and the Western Baths Club and Arlington Baths, both in Glasgow).</p> <p>The reopening of Newcastle\u2019s City Baths was a fillip to campaigners hoping to resurrect other Turkish baths, namely the Carlisle Baths, the Victoria Baths in Manchester and the Govanhill Baths in Glasgow. Shifrin says he is \u201cfairly hopeful\u201d about Carlisle, as it also has an active campaigning group, one of whose leading members, Julie Minns, is now in parliament. Minns was elected as the Labour MP for Carlisle in July and mentioned the baths in her maiden speech.</p> <p>\u201cVictoria Baths also has a formidable campaigning group, but their problem (and that of the Govanhill baths) is that their Turkish bath is only one part of a large public baths complex, and just repairing roofs and the building\u2019s structure have had to be their first priorities,\u201d Shifrin say. \u201cBoth are now&nbsp;open to the public for a variety of&nbsp;activities, but neither has reached that part of their survival to-do list that includes the Turkish baths.\u201d</p> <p>Another Victorian baths, the Health Hydro in Swindon, which closed in April last year, seems to have the best hope of reopening in the near future. It&nbsp;has government and lottery funding, and work is under way. Its rebirth would be a real cause for celebration.</p>    <p>According to Shifrin: \u201cThis is the world\u2019s oldest extant Turkish bath institution, being opened in 1868 by the Great Western Railway\u2019s Medical Fund Society.\u201d Is he hopeful it will reopen next year as planned? \u201cI have learned not to tempt fate,\u201d he replies.</p> <p>Elsewhere, several significant buildings that once housed Turkish baths still stand, even though the baths themselves have long since closed. However, they, too, are under&nbsp;threat. \u201cToo many have been demolished, or will be diminished in&nbsp;stature,\u201d says Shifrin. He gives the example of the \u201cspectacular\u201d baths building in Bishopsgate, London. \u201cIt&nbsp;is&nbsp;to be virtually hidden by an overhanging office block towering above it, solely to provide a few extra feet of space for greedy developers in&nbsp;an area already overflowing with empty offices.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Staff at City Baths say they have met many older people who came to the bath decades ago as children</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is essential that the few remaining Victorian and Victorian-style Turkish baths are preserved, preferably as operational baths, as a&nbsp;reminder of something intrinsically good that Britain gave to the world in the Victorian era.\u201d</p> <p>Newcastle residents seem to agree. On our visit to the City Baths, there was a steady stream of bathers, from a&nbsp;lone woman reading, to couples and&nbsp;small groups of friends. One woman told us that she comes three times a week. Staff say they have met many older people who came to the bath decades ago as children, and are delighted it has reopened.</p> <p>Historical significance, architectural splendour and luxury at leisure-centre&nbsp;prices \u2013 surely Britain\u2019s last Turkish baths are worth treasuring?</p> <p><em>A</em><em> two-hour Turkish bath, sauna and&nbsp;swim session at the City Baths (<a href=\"https://www.city-baths.co.uk/\">city\u2011baths.co.uk</a>) is \u00a321.50</em><em>.

      "bodyText": "My sister and I are lying on slabs like flounders in a fishmonger\u2019s. Instead of a bed of ice, though, we\u2019re stretched out on heated marble. We move between three hot rooms, each resembling little chapels with vaulted ceilings, chatting quietly in the cooler one, applying face and hair masks in the middle one, and simply lying still, sweating, in the hottest one. Later, we will be scrubbed and massaged. In between, we cool off under a rain-mist shower, or retire to a bed in our own private mahogany-panelled booth beneath a glazed dome. It sounds like a luxury spa, with prices to match. In fact, we\u2019re at a century-old public bathhouse. The City Baths in Newcastle reopened in April after an \u00a38m restoration \u2013 and a decade-long campaign. A two\u2011hour Turkish bath session here costs about \u00a320, which includes a swim in the pool upstairs. The City Baths is one of the UK\u2019s few surviving Victorian or Victorian-style Turkish baths. It was built in 1927 on the site of an even older bathhouse, the Northumberland Baths, which opened in 1859. Despite being Grade II-listed in 1992, classed as of high architectural significance in 2012, and being well used and loved by the people of Newcastle, the city council closed it in 2013. The closure was a familiar story. There were once more than 600 Turkish baths in Britain and Ireland. The movement was spearheaded by the Scottish diplomat and politician David Urquhart, who had visited hammams in Turkey and Morocco, and the Irish doctor Richard Barter, a hydrotherapy pioneer. The first Turkish bath opened in Blarney, County Cork, in 1856. London had one by 1860, and they spread across Britain and Ireland over the next 40 years. Malcolm Shifrin, a historian and the author of Victorian Turkish Baths, explains their importance: \u201cThis cultural institution contributed public cleansing facilities when most people had no running water, therapeutic benefits at a time when modern medicine was barely in its infancy, and destressing, relaxation facilities.\u201d As well as their health benefits, Turkish baths were considered a social good. According to the Friends of the City Baths: \u201cUrquhart saw that working men gained skills when building the baths, and he also saw the value of using bath premises as a meeting place.\u201d Turkish baths began to decline after the second world war, when more people had access to hot running water and modern medicine. Today, they are an expensive leisure facility for cash-strapped councils to maintain, heat and staff. But as Shifrin points out: \u201cMany of the buildings that housed Victorian Turkish baths have architectural merit.\u201d He highlights the surviving baths in Harrogate, Manchester, Carlisle, Edinburgh and Glasgow as being particularly precious. Despite their historical significance, by 1990 only 34 original baths were still open. Today, there are 11 in the UK \u2013 and of those, three are in private members\u2019 clubs, two are closed for refurbishment and just six are open to the general public. The City Baths is a rare example of a bathhouse that came back from the brink, largely thanks to tireless local campaigning. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely brilliant,\u201d says Shifrin of the reopening, \u201cand thanks to a wonderful group of women who worked freely to keep alive something important in their lives.\u201d Shifrin first went to a Victorian-style Turkish bath as a teenager in the 1950s, at the original Imperial hotel in Russell Square, London, which was \u201csavagely demolished\u201d in 1967. He has since visited all the surviving baths, including those in private clubs (the Royal Automobile Club in London and the Western Baths Club and Arlington Baths, both in Glasgow). The reopening of Newcastle\u2019s City Baths was a fillip to campaigners hoping to resurrect other Turkish baths, namely the Carlisle Baths, the Victoria Baths in Manchester and the Govanhill Baths in Glasgow. Shifrin says he is \u201cfairly hopeful\u201d about Carlisle, as it also has an active campaigning group, one of whose leading members, Julie Minns, is now in parliament. Minns was elected as the Labour MP for Carlisle in July and mentioned the baths in her maiden speech. \u201cVictoria Baths also has a formidable campaigning group, but their problem (and that of the Govanhill baths) is that their Turkish bath is only one part of a large public baths complex, and just repairing roofs and the building\u2019s structure have had to be their first priorities,\u201d Shifrin say. \u201cBoth are now open to the public for a variety of activities, but neither has reached that part of their survival to-do list that includes the Turkish baths.\u201d Another Victorian baths, the Health Hydro in Swindon, which closed in April last year, seems to have the best hope of reopening in the near future. It has government and lottery funding, and work is under way. Its rebirth would be a real cause for celebration. According to Shifrin: \u201cThis is the world\u2019s oldest extant Turkish bath institution, being opened in 1868 by the Great Western Railway\u2019s Medical Fund Society.\u201d Is he hopeful it will reopen next year as planned? \u201cI have learned not to tempt fate,\u201d he replies. Elsewhere, several significant buildings that once housed Turkish baths still stand, even though the baths themselves have long since closed. However, they, too, are under threat. \u201cToo many have been demolished, or will be diminished in stature,\u201d says Shifrin. He gives the example of the \u201cspectacular\u201d baths building in Bishopsgate, London. \u201cIt is to be virtually hidden by an overhanging office block towering above it, solely to provide a few extra feet of space for greedy developers in an area already overflowing with empty offices. \u201cIt is essential that the few remaining Victorian and Victorian-style Turkish baths are preserved, preferably as operational baths, as a reminder of something intrinsically good that Britain gave to the world in the Victorian era.\u201d Newcastle residents seem to agree. On our visit to the City Baths, there was a steady stream of bathers, from a lone woman reading, to couples and small groups of friends. One woman told us that she comes three times a week. Staff say they have met many older people who came to the bath decades ago as children, and are delighted it has reopened. Historical significance, architectural splendour and luxury at leisure-centre prices \u2013 surely Britain\u2019s last Turkish baths are worth treasuring? A two-hour Turkish bath, sauna and swim session at the City Baths (city\u2011baths.co.uk) is \u00a321.50. Accommodation was provided by NewcastleGateshead Initiative and travel was provided by LNER on behalf of newcastlegateshead.com 10 more British Turkish baths.

Extensive renovations (in 2010\u201112, and after a fire in 2022) mean the modern-day luxury spa is unrecognisable from the 1930s baths, but it still has three hot rooms, plus saunas, steam rooms and a plunge pool.

So the government is beset by foes whose discontent is amplified by a largely hostile media. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2024/nov/19/farmers-march-into-central-london-to-protest-against-new-inheritance-tax-video\">Farmers say they\u2019re furious</a> about a reform to the way inheritances are taxed, though the new regime is still much more generous to them than the rules that apply to other families. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/uk-retailers-rachel-reeves-budget-tax-rises-brc\">Retailers are among those bemoaning</a> the effects of raising employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/19/winter-fuel-payment-cuts-may-force-100000-pensioners-below-poverty-line\">Pensioner groups continue to agitate</a> against the means testing of the winter fuel payment. Those cross with the government are being rewarded with huge headlines and loads of airtime to vent their grievances. This is having an impact.

Patients will get treatment earlier than they might otherwise have done thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/30/cash-injection-health-service-nhs-budget\">cash injection for the NHS</a> ) announced in the budget. The uplift to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48445674\">national living wage</a> is higher than was expected, with an especially big boost to the rate for 18- to 20-year-olds. Workers will get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/oct/10/labour-employment-rights-bill-key-changes\">enhanced protection from unfair dismissal</a> and other bad employment practices. Then there are the parents of primary school age children, who&nbsp;will see a tangible benefit from the Labour government once breakfast clubs are up and running.</p> <p>You won\u2019t have seen any marches on Parliament Square by thousands of happy winners flourishing placards congratulating the government. Gainers from change tend to be quiet, while the losers are invariably noisy. What\u2019s surprising to some of its concerned supporters is that the government itself is not putting more effort into broadcasting the positives. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a Labour politician being on the media in recent weeks pointing out who\u2019s gained,\u201d says one Labour strategist. </p> <p>Some contend that Labour would be in a better place had it not boxed itself in by ruling out increases to income tax, VAT or employee national insurance. The argument goes that it would not then have had to target particular groups with vocal lobbies to express their anger about being \u201csingled out\u201d. But I\u2019m rather sceptical that the government would be more popular had the chancellor used her first budget to up the amount of tax deducted from tens of millions of payslips, or made it more expensive to go to the shops. Some say Labour should have been more up front about just how tough it would be to plug the gaping fiscal hole bequeathed by the Tories while also finding additional funds for ailing public services. Conservative-leaning commentators berate Labour for not being \u201cmore honest\u201d during the election knowing that it was up against a Tory party that was utterly dishonest in its claims about tax and spend. </p> <p>To those who follow these things closely, it was clear that Labour was eyeing up the tax breaks for landowners and inheritors of business assets. What if they had been more explicit about this? I very much doubt that farmers would be any less aggrieved had they been given more notice of precisely what Labour intended. They would simply have revved up their tractors earlier. Some, including quite a few ministers, question whether the sums raised from curbing inheritance tax exemptions or curtailing the winter fuel payment are large enough to justify the cost to the government\u2019s political capital. The Treasury retorts that if the money doesn\u2019t come from there, it will have to come from somewhere else, and that won\u2019t be popular either. Though there\u2019s a very long way to go before the next general election, Labour MPs are \u201cgetting quite twitchy\u201d, in the words of one of them, about the levels of hostility that they are experiencing. Which leads to anxiety about whether their government is making its case as cleverly and robustly as it could be.</p> <p>It is not. Ministers are struggling in the propaganda battle being waged over the farmers not just because welly-clad protesters bringing young children on toy tractors to Westminster are catnip for the media. Different arms of government have issued clashing estimates of how many people will be affected, lending credence to their opponents\u2019 charge that they don\u2019t know what they are doing to a community that Labour doesn\u2019t understand. Before they embark on measures that are bound to excite opposition, ministers need to be more adept at getting their ducks in a row. The restriction of winter fuel payments will almost certainly shoot back up the agenda as the weather gets colder. That decision would have landed with less of a thump had the announcement not been dropped out of nowhere and been nuanced to mitigate the effect on the band of poorer pensioners hit by the change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Veterans of past Labour governments worry  this one only plays defence when it should be taking the fight into its critics\u2019 territory</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another critique heard within Labour circles is that there are a lot of first-time ministers too preoccupied with learning how to be administrators to remember that they are also supposed to be politicians. Attacks are too often answered with managerial and bloodless arguments when the government as a collective should be on the front foot proselytising its choices. Says one insider who wants his party to up its game: \u201cIn government, you can never take a fire-and-forget approach.\u201d Says another: \u201cIn this media environment, you\u2019ve got to be out there all the time constantly explaining your positions.\u201d Many Labour MPs would like more of their top team to emulate the confrontational, gloves-off style that comes naturally to Angela Rayner and is on <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-11-20/debates/86A1A41A-0E44-4A2E-92AB-56039978FF53/Engagements\">pyrotechnical display</a> whenever she substitutes for Sir Keir at PMQs. </p> <p>Kemi Badenoch, Sir Ed Davey and Nigel Farage have all clambered aboard the farmers\u2019 bandwagon. This ill-matched trio are also united in opposition to the increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. Labour is entitled to ask: if they don\u2019t like these tax rises, which other taxes would they be hiking instead? If they don\u2019t like any tax rises, what would they be slashing from public spending? Veterans of past Labour governments worry that this one only plays defence when it should be remorseless in taking the fight into its critics\u2019 territory.</p> <p>Even with improvements to how the government communicates its case, Labour will have to live with unpopularity for the foreseeable future. The party\u2019s MPs will have to get used to relentless bombardment from those who resist change while receiving little visible gratitude from groups who are benefiting. The party\u2019s ratings are unlikely to start moving in a more positive direction until large numbers of voters begin to experience palpable improvements to their lives. Sir Keir should expect to be the target of more and nastier nicknames. At least he now knows the wisdom of an old adage. If you are in politics and want a friend, get a dog.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

Sir Keir didn\u2019t set out to make enemies. On his way to power, he hoped to be everyone\u2019s friend. Business leaders and trades unionists, city dwellers and rural folk, young and old, the Labour leader was keen to give all the impression that they\u2019d be better off for having a Labour government. There were a few select groups \u2013 parents who sent their children to fee-paying schools, non-doms and private equity dealmakers \u2013 who were given prior notice that they should expect to pay higher taxes. There were also broad-brush warnings from Sir Keir and Rachel Reeves that a Labour government would have to make \u201ctough choices\u201d and \u201cunpopular decisions\u201d, but a lot of those were left unspecified. Now tough choices are being revealed and these decisions are indeed proving unpopular. So the government is beset by foes whose discontent is amplified by a largely hostile media. Farmers say they\u2019re furious about a reform to the way inheritances are taxed, though the new regime is still much more generous to them than the rules that apply to other families. Retailers are among those bemoaning the effects of raising employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. Pensioner groups continue to agitate against the means testing of the winter fuel payment. Those cross with the government are being rewarded with huge headlines and loads of airtime to vent their grievances. This is having an impact. When one pollster asked voters to name Labour\u2019s best achievements since it arrived in office, approaching half of the sample responded that the government hadn\u2019t done anything positive at all. The pervasive mood of negativity masks the fact that significant segments of the population do have reason to be grateful. Renters will no longer be threatened by no-fault eviction. Junior doctors are getting a hefty catch-up increase in their in pay, ending a long-running dispute that debilitated the health service. Patients will get treatment earlier than they might otherwise have done thanks to the cash injection for the NHS ) announced in the budget. The uplift to the national living wage is higher than was expected, with an especially big boost to the rate for 18- to 20-year-olds. Workers will get enhanced protection from unfair dismissal and other bad employment practices. Then there are the parents of primary school age children, who will see a tangible benefit from the Labour government once breakfast clubs are up and running. You won\u2019t have seen any marches on Parliament Square by thousands of happy winners flourishing placards congratulating the government. Gainers from change tend to be quiet, while the losers are invariably noisy. What\u2019s surprising to some of its concerned supporters is that the government itself is not putting more effort into broadcasting the positives. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a Labour politician being on the media in recent weeks pointing out who\u2019s gained,\u201d says one Labour strategist. Some contend that Labour would be in a better place had it not boxed itself in by ruling out increases to income tax, VAT or employee national insurance. The argument goes that it would not then have had to target particular groups with vocal lobbies to express their anger about being \u201csingled out\u201d. But I\u2019m rather sceptical that the government would be more popular had the chancellor used her first budget to up the amount of tax deducted from tens of millions of payslips, or made it more expensive to go to the shops. Some say Labour should have been more up front about just how tough it would be to plug the gaping fiscal hole bequeathed by the Tories while also finding additional funds for ailing public services. Conservative-leaning commentators berate Labour for not being \u201cmore honest\u201d during the election knowing that it was up against a Tory party that was utterly dishonest in its claims about tax and spend. To those who follow these things closely, it was clear that Labour was eyeing up the tax breaks for landowners and inheritors of business assets. What if they had been more explicit about this? I very much doubt that farmers would be any less aggrieved had they been given more notice of precisely what Labour intended. They would simply have revved up their tractors earlier. Some, including quite a few ministers, question whether the sums raised from curbing inheritance tax exemptions or curtailing the winter fuel payment are large enough to justify the cost to the government\u2019s political capital. The Treasury retorts that if the money doesn\u2019t come from there, it will have to come from somewhere else, and that won\u2019t be popular either. Though there\u2019s a very long way to go before the next general election, Labour MPs are \u201cgetting quite twitchy\u201d, in the words of one of them, about the levels of hostility that they are experiencing. Which leads to anxiety about whether their government is making its case as cleverly and robustly as it could be. It is not. Ministers are struggling in the propaganda battle being waged over the farmers not just because welly-clad protesters bringing young children on toy tractors to Westminster are catnip for the media. Different arms of government have issued clashing estimates of how many people will be affected, lending credence to their opponents\u2019 charge that they don\u2019t know what they are doing to a community that Labour doesn\u2019t understand. Before they embark on measures that are bound to excite opposition, ministers need to be more adept at getting their ducks in a row. The restriction of winter fuel payments will almost certainly shoot back up the agenda as the weather gets colder. That decision would have landed with less of a thump had the announcement not been dropped out of nowhere and been nuanced to mitigate the effect on the band of poorer pensioners hit by the change. Another critique heard within Labour circles is that there are a lot of first-time ministers too preoccupied with learning how to be administrators to remember that they are also supposed to be politicians. Attacks are too often answered with managerial and bloodless arguments when the government as a collective should be on the front foot proselytising its choices. Says one insider who wants his party to up its game: \u201cIn government, you can never take a fire-and-forget approach.\u201d Says another: \u201cIn this media environment, you\u2019ve got to be out there all the time constantly explaining your positions.\u201d Many Labour MPs would like more of their top team to emulate the confrontational, gloves-off style that comes naturally to Angela Rayner and is on pyrotechnical display whenever she substitutes for Sir Keir at PMQs. Kemi Badenoch, Sir Ed Davey and Nigel Farage have all clambered aboard the farmers\u2019 bandwagon. This ill-matched trio are also united in opposition to the increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. Labour is entitled to ask: if they don\u2019t like these tax rises, which other taxes would they be hiking instead? If they don\u2019t like any tax rises, what would they be slashing from public spending? Veterans of past Labour governments worry that this one only plays defence when it should be remorseless in taking the fight into its critics\u2019 territory. Even with improvements to how the government communicates its case, Labour will have to live with unpopularity for the foreseeable future. The party\u2019s MPs will have to get used to relentless bombardment from those who resist change while receiving little visible gratitude from groups who are benefiting. The party\u2019s ratings are unlikely to start moving in a more positive direction until large numbers of voters begin to experience palpable improvements to their lives. Sir Keir should expect to be the target of more and nastier nicknames. At least he now knows the wisdom of an old adage. If you are in politics and want a friend, get a dog. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

The injury now means England are scrambling to fly out a replacement wicketkeeper, with&nbsp;Ollie Pope likely to deputise initially when the series begins in Christchurch on Thursday.</p> <p>The incident occurred before the second and final day of England\u2019s warm-up match in Queenstown when Cox was receiving throwdowns from assistant coach Jeetan Patel in the nets. Scans at the local hospital confirmed the severity of the break, with the 24-year-old left understandably crestfallen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/23/stokes-and-mccullum-need-strong-start-to-year-that-could-define-bazball\">Stokes and McCullum need strong start to year that could define Bazball</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m gutted for Jordan,\u201d said Brendon McCullum, the head coach. \u201cHe has been shaping up nicely, both with the bat and gloves, since we got to New Zealand. That\u2019s sport and unfortunately these things happen. We will get around him and look after him. He is resilient and his time will come at some point in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Sympathy for Cox aside, the injury brings into question England\u2019s decision not to bring a specialist reserve wicketkeeper on tour, with Jamie Smith, the team\u2019s first-choice gloveman, at home on paternity leave. Pope is no mug behind the stumps, having kept in three Test matches previously. Equally, the vice-captain is under pressure for his spot in a year that has been feast or famine with the&nbsp;bat.</p> <p>The additional burden of keeping wicket is likely to last only one Test, however, until a new wicketkeeper is flown out. Durham\u2019s Ollie Robinson, uncapped at international level, appears favourite to get the nod, confirmation of which would suggest that England have fully moved on from Ben Foakes and Jonny Bairstow.</p> <p>Both players were dropped after the 4-1 defeat in India this year and while Bairstow still has another year to run on his central contract, he has not featured for England since the T20 World Cup in June. Foakes, who lost his place on the contract list last month, is considered the best gloveman in the country but failed to convince McCullum he could be a game-changer with the bat at No 7.</p> <p>Whoever gets the call \u2013 Phil Salt was another wicketkeeper under consideration at the start of last summer \u2013 they will now struggle to reach New Zealand in time for the series opener at Hagley Oval. The upshot of this could be a possible Test debut for Jacob Bethell, the Warwickshire all-rounder who is yet to score a century at professional level but is viewed as a generational talent.</p> <p>Bethell will be coming in slightly cold. The 21-year-old and Rehan Ahmed arrived in New Zealand only on Sunday \u2013 and were flown straight to Christchurch \u2013 after featuring in the recent white-ball tour to the Caribbean.

      "bodyText": "Jordan Cox landed in New Zealand seemingly assured of a Test debut only for his tour to be cruelly ended by a fractured thumb. The injury now means England are scrambling to fly out a replacement wicketkeeper, with Ollie Pope likely to deputise initially when the series begins in Christchurch on Thursday. The incident occurred before the second and final day of England\u2019s warm-up match in Queenstown when Cox was receiving throwdowns from assistant coach Jeetan Patel in the nets. Scans at the local hospital confirmed the severity of the break, with the 24-year-old left understandably crestfallen. \u201cI\u2019m gutted for Jordan,\u201d said Brendon McCullum, the head coach. \u201cHe has been shaping up nicely, both with the bat and gloves, since we got to New Zealand. That\u2019s sport and unfortunately these things happen. We will get around him and look after him. He is resilient and his time will come at some point in the future.\u201d Sympathy for Cox aside, the injury brings into question England\u2019s decision not to bring a specialist reserve wicketkeeper on tour, with Jamie Smith, the team\u2019s first-choice gloveman, at home on paternity leave. Pope is no mug behind the stumps, having kept in three Test matches previously. Equally, the vice-captain is under pressure for his spot in a year that has been feast or famine with the bat. The additional burden of keeping wicket is likely to last only one Test, however, until a new wicketkeeper is flown out. Durham\u2019s Ollie Robinson, uncapped at international level, appears favourite to get the nod, confirmation of which would suggest that England have fully moved on from Ben Foakes and Jonny Bairstow. Both players were dropped after the 4-1 defeat in India this year and while Bairstow still has another year to run on his central contract, he has not featured for England since the T20 World Cup in June. Foakes, who lost his place on the contract list last month, is considered the best gloveman in the country but failed to convince McCullum he could be a game-changer with the bat at No 7. Whoever gets the call \u2013 Phil Salt was another wicketkeeper under consideration at the start of last summer \u2013 they will now struggle to reach New Zealand in time for the series opener at Hagley Oval. The upshot of this could be a possible Test debut for Jacob Bethell, the Warwickshire all-rounder who is yet to score a century at professional level but is viewed as a generational talent. Bethell will be coming in slightly cold. The 21-year-old and Rehan Ahmed arrived in New Zealand only on Sunday \u2013 and were flown straight to Christchurch \u2013 after featuring in the recent white-ball tour to the Caribbean. Pope at least had the chance to refamiliarise himself with the gloves, keeping tidily for 68 overs before England fell five runs short of reeling in a contrived target of 201 in just 22 overs. It was an eventful day at one of the world\u2019s most scenic cricket grounds. Jimmy Anderson donned the whites for the first time since his international retirement in July \u2013 England\u2019s bowling coach appeared as a sub fielder \u2013 while Christopher Luxon, the prime minister of New Zealand, flew in for a photo opportunity at lunch.

      "body": "<p>Paedophiles, scammers, hackers and&nbsp;criminals of all kinds are increasingly exploiting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai\">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to target victims in new and harmful ways, a senior police chief has warned.</p> <p>Alex Murray, the national police lead for AI, said that the use of the technology was growing rapidly because of its increasing accessibility and that police had to \u201cmove fast\u201d to keep on top of the threat.</p> <p>\u201cWe know through the history of policing that criminals are inventive and will use anything they can to commit crime. They\u2019re certainly using AI to commit crime now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt can happen on an international and serious organised crime scale, and it can happen in someone\u2019s bedroom \u2026 You can think of any crime type and put it through an AI lens and say: \u2018What is the opportunity here?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Speaking at the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/18/police-chief-calls-for-biggest-shake-up-of-england-and-wales-policing-since-1960s\">conference in London last week</a>, Murray revealed concerns over emerging AI \u201cheists\u201d in which fraudsters use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/deepfake\">deepfake technology</a> to impersonate company executives and trick their colleagues into transferring large sums of money.</p> <p>This year, a finance worker at a multinational firm was duped into paying HK$200m (\u00a320.5m) to criminals after a video conference call in which the scammers were able to convincingly pose as the company\u2019s chief financial officer.</p> <p>Similar cases have been reported in several countries, while the first heist of its kind is believed to have targeted a British energy firm in 2019.</p> <p>Murray, who is director of threat leadership at the National Crime Agency, said the phenomenon was a \u201chigh cost, low prevalence crime\u201d and that he was personally aware of \u00addozens of cases in the UK.</p> <p>He said that the greatest volume of criminal AI use was by paedophiles, who have been using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/16/ai-isnt-about-unleashing-our-imaginations-its-about-outsourcing-them-the-real-purpose-is-profit\">generative AI</a> to create images and videos depicting child sexual abuse. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking thousands and thousands and thousands of images,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAll images, whether they are synthetic or otherwise, are against the law, and people are using generative AI to \u00adcreate images of children doing the most horrific things.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, 27-year-old Hugh Nelson, from Bolton, was jailed for 18 years after offering a paid service to online paedophile networks in which he used AI to generate requested images of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/28/man-who-used-ai-to-create-child-abuse-images-jailed-for-18-years\">children being abused</a>.</p> <p>The same technology is also being used for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/series/sextortion\">sextortion, a type of online blackmail</a> in which criminals threaten&nbsp;to release indecent images of victims unless they pay money or carry out demands.</p> <p>The phenomenon has previously used photos that victims had shared of themselves, often with former partners or abusers who used false identities to gain their trust, but AI can now be used to \u201cnudify\u201d and manipulate photos taken from social media.</p> <p>Murray said hackers were also using AI to look for weaknesses in targeted code or software and to provide \u201careas of focus\u201d for cyber-attacks. \u201cMost of the AI criminality at the moment is around child abuse imagery and fraud, but there are a lot of potential threats,\u201d he added.</p> <p>There is mounting concern that apparently benign chatbots could incite people into crime and terrorism after revelations that a man who tried to attack Queen Elizabeth II <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/05/man-who-broke-into-windsor-castle-with-crossbow-to-kill-queen-jailed-for-nine-years\">with a crossbow</a> in 2021 had gained encouragement from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/06/ai-chatbot-encouraged-man-who-planned-to-kill-queen-court-told\">female \u201cAI friend\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Jonathan Hall, the government\u2019s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, has been researching the potential uses of AI by terrorist groups and highlighted \u201cchatbot radicalisation\u201d as a threat alongside propaganda generation and attack facilitation and planning.</p> <p>He found that he was able to create an Osama bin Laden chatbot using a popular commercially available platform, and that it was \u201cvery easy to do\u201d.</p> <p>In a speech at Lancaster House last month, Hall warned: \u201cEven if we don\u2019t know precisely how generative AI is going to be exploited by terrorists, we need a common understanding of generative AI and a confidence to act, and certainly not a reaction that says: \u2018This is just too difficult.\u2019</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

      "bodyText": "Paedophiles, scammers, hackers and criminals of all kinds are increasingly exploiting artificial intelligence (AI) to target victims in new and harmful ways, a senior police chief has warned. Alex Murray, the national police lead for AI, said that the use of the technology was growing rapidly because of its increasing accessibility and that police had to \u201cmove fast\u201d to keep on top of the threat. \u201cWe know through the history of policing that criminals are inventive and will use anything they can to commit crime. They\u2019re certainly using AI to commit crime now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can happen on an international and serious organised crime scale, and it can happen in someone\u2019s bedroom \u2026 You can think of any crime type and put it through an AI lens and say: \u2018What is the opportunity here?\u2019\u201d Speaking at the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council conference in London last week, Murray revealed concerns over emerging AI \u201cheists\u201d in which fraudsters use deepfake technology to impersonate company executives and trick their colleagues into transferring large sums of money. This year, a finance worker at a multinational firm was duped into paying HK$200m (\u00a320.5m) to criminals after a video conference call in which the scammers were able to convincingly pose as the company\u2019s chief financial officer. Similar cases have been reported in several countries, while the first heist of its kind is believed to have targeted a British energy firm in 2019. Murray, who is director of threat leadership at the National Crime Agency, said the phenomenon was a \u201chigh cost, low prevalence crime\u201d and that he was personally aware of dozens of cases in the UK. He said that the greatest volume of criminal AI use was by paedophiles, who have been using generative AI to create images and videos depicting child sexual abuse. \u201cWe\u2019re talking thousands and thousands and thousands of images,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAll images, whether they are synthetic or otherwise, are against the law, and people are using generative AI to create images of children doing the most horrific things.\u201d Last month, 27-year-old Hugh Nelson, from Bolton, was jailed for 18 years after offering a paid service to online paedophile networks in which he used AI to generate requested images of children being abused. The same technology is also being used for sextortion, a type of online blackmail in which criminals threaten to release indecent images of victims unless they pay money or carry out demands. The phenomenon has previously used photos that victims had shared of themselves, often with former partners or abusers who used false identities to gain their trust, but AI can now be used to \u201cnudify\u201d and manipulate photos taken from social media. Murray said hackers were also using AI to look for weaknesses in targeted code or software and to provide \u201careas of focus\u201d for cyber-attacks. \u201cMost of the AI criminality at the moment is around child abuse imagery and fraud, but there are a lot of potential threats,\u201d he added. There is mounting concern that apparently benign chatbots could incite people into crime and terrorism after revelations that a man who tried to attack Queen Elizabeth II with a crossbow in 2021 had gained encouragement from a female \u201cAI friend\u201d. Jonathan Hall, the government\u2019s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, has been researching the potential uses of AI by terrorist groups and highlighted \u201cchatbot radicalisation\u201d as a threat alongside propaganda generation and attack facilitation and planning. He found that he was able to create an Osama bin Laden chatbot using a popular commercially available platform, and that it was \u201cvery easy to do\u201d. In a speech at Lancaster House last month, Hall warned: \u201cEven if we don\u2019t know precisely how generative AI is going to be exploited by terrorists, we need a common understanding of generative AI and a confidence to act, and certainly not a reaction that says: \u2018This is just too difficult.\u2019 \u201cWe need to avoid the mistakes of the early internet period where there is a free-for-all.\u201d Murray said that with AI technology becoming increasingly advanced, and more generative text and image software coming on to the market and into widespread use, its exploitation by criminals of all kinds was expected to rise. \u201cSometimes you can spot if something is an AI image, but very quickly that will disappear,\u201d he warned. \u201cPeople using this sort of software at the moment are still quite niche, but it will become very easy to use. \u201cThe ease of entry, realism and availability are the three vectors which will probably increase \u2026 We, as policing, have to move fast in this space to keep on top of it. \u201cI think it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that between now and 2029 we will see significant increases in all these crime types, and we want to prevent that,\u201d he said.",

On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart\u2019s desire at last, and the White House will be occupied by a downright fool and complete narcissistic moron.\u201d</p> <p>Those were the words of the great American journalist HL Mencken (in the<em> Baltimore Evening</em> <em>Sun</em>, 26 July 1920). The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/06/trump-win-election-panel\">impending arrival back at the White House</a> surely fulfils his&nbsp;prophecy.</p> <p>Last time Trump arrived in office, he was relatively unprepared. Indeed, there are those who say he did not expect to win. Then he was hampered by a democratic system of checks and balances, and an admirable government establishment who often kept him in his place. This time he is well prepared to cause domestic and international chaos, as his bizarre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/trump-white-house-circle\">collection of initial appointments</a> demonstrates.</p> <p>On the economic front he is obsessed by what he regards as the need to impose tariffs, theoretically to protect US manufacturing and improve the balance of trade. For Trump, \u201ctariffs\u201d is \u201ca beautiful word\u201d, more beautiful than \u201clove\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u2018As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart\u2019s desire at last, and the White House will be occupied by a downright fool and complete narcissistic moron.\u201d Those were the words of the great American journalist HL Mencken (in the Baltimore Evening Sun, 26 July 1920). The impending arrival back at the White House surely fulfils his prophecy. Last time Trump arrived in office, he was relatively unprepared. Indeed, there are those who say he did not expect to win. Then he was hampered by a democratic system of checks and balances, and an admirable government establishment who often kept him in his place. This time he is well prepared to cause domestic and international chaos, as his bizarre collection of initial appointments demonstrates. On the economic front he is obsessed by what he regards as the need to impose tariffs, theoretically to protect US manufacturing and improve the balance of trade. For Trump, \u201ctariffs\u201d is \u201ca beautiful word\u201d, more beautiful than \u201clove\u201d. They are \u201cthe greatest thing ever invented\u201d. However, it appears that a number of US citizens have swiftly woken up to the inflationary implications of tariffs, with some voters who have found they have been taken for a ride asking on social media whether it is possible to change their vote \u2026 I have read quite enough post-presidential election analysis, but, for me at least, the most convincing conclusion is not that Trump won but that the Democrats lost. One\u2019s mind goes back to the 2016 referendum on UK membership of the European Union, when there was no doubt that the Remainers were ineffectual and, unlike Harold Wilson in the 1975 referendum, Labour had a leader in Jeremy Corbyn who, to say the least, hardly fought the good fight and gave many people the impression he was a Leaver anyway. There has been much in the public prints about whether Labour now should try to come to a trade deal with the US. The very idea is preposterous. Experts know that Trump would insist on terms that would be formidably disadvantageous to the UK. But if we were part of a European Union trade negotiating team, we should be in a far stronger position. Talking of which, I welcome the recent intervention by Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England. He has been criticised by the Tory right wing and their useful idiots in the rightwing press for daring to point to the damaging consequences of Brexit and saying we need closer relations with the EU. He has diplomatically said he takes \u201cno position on Brexit\u201d and that the people have voted, implying that we have to make the best of it. But he is hardly being controversial in pointing out the consequences. His immediate predecessor, Mark Carney, had no doubt about the disastrous course the UK had embarked upon. But Carney\u2019s immediate predecessor, my old friend Mervyn, now Lord, King was, and still is, a Brexiter \u2013 for reasons best known to himself. I think Bailey is being too diplomatic in accepting the 2016 vote. Most surveys now find that a majority of the electorate regard Brexit as a serious mistake and would like to rejoin the EU.

The referendum was more than eight years ago. We have elections every four or five years, and the whole point is that people are allowed to change their minds. Moreover, some voters are no longer with us, and others have arrived on the electoral register.

The fact is that the election of Trump and his obsession with embarking on trade wars is bad news for the world economy, which, oddly enough, we are an important part of. I cannot resist concluding with a remark I recently heard from an American visitor to London who told me: \u201cWhat you English don\u2019t understand is that Donald Trump is a comedian.\u201d He could have fooled me.

      "bodyText": "American presidents are supposed to renounce pomp and disappear into private life when their term ends. George Washington enjoyed sampling the whiskey produced by the distillery at his Virginia plantation, while George W Bush currently amuses himself by clearing underbrush on his Texas ranch. Bill Clinton, aged only 54 when he left office in 2001, spurned bucolic oblivion; as he says with scriptural solemnity: \u201cI didn\u2019t think my work here on Earth was finished just yet.\u201d Although he calls his memoir Citizen to signal his reduced status, he admits to hankering after his years as a conqueror, with military bands that struck up Hail to the Chief as his personal anthem whenever he strode into a room. Because the presidency has grown ever more undemocratically monarchical, Clinton toyed with a possible succession. His wife\u2019s candidacy in 2016 offered him the prospect of returning to the White House as her First Gentleman, and his daughter, Chelsea, might have exotically extended the family line: in 2002 Muammar Gadaffi suggested marrying her to his son and thereby \u201claunching a dynasty\u201d. But Hillary lost to Trump, Chelsea nixed the proposal, and instead Clinton has incorporated himself. He set up the Clinton Foundation, kept it flush with his lecture fees and soon presided over an empire of eponymous acronyms - the CCI (Clinton Climate Initiative), the CDI (Clinton Development Initiative), the CGI (Clinton Global Initiative), the CHAI (Clinton Health Access Initiative), and so on to the end of the alphabet. He is frank about his initial motive for keeping busy. \u201cI had to start making money,\u201d he admits, mostly to pay the legal bills accrued during the Republican attempt to impeach him over his entanglement with Monica Lewinsky.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a running joke in Westminster that some on the British centre-left are fascinated by American politics to the point of obsession. So much so that it extends to the fictional: in 2006, a group of rebel Labour MPs inspired by the long-running US drama the<em> West Wing</em> borrowed tactics from its plotline to successfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/02/wrap.jamessturcke\">defeat the government in a vote</a>. It\u2019s right, therefore, to be wary of over-extrapolating lessons for the Labour party from the Democrats\u2019 presidential defeat.</p> <p>But with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/20/uk-inflation-rises-delay-interest-rate-cut-price-rises\">inflation again on the rise</a>, there will be more parallels between the economic backdrops to the Kamala Harris 2024 campaign and a 2029 Labour general election campaign than the party would like. There have been reams of analysis on why the Democrats lost, but the most important takeaway is that, in the context of living standards eroded by high inflation, a candidate who found it difficult to connect with voters and struggled to explain why her party should be given another four years was punished accordingly. </p> <p>It\u2019s not just the Democrats: in New&nbsp;Zealand, Japan and South Africa, governments have been booted out of office in what the academic Rob Ford has called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/nov/10/kamala-harris-is-just-the-latest-victim-of-global-trend-to-oust-incumbents\">the greatest wave of anti-incumbent voting ever seen</a>\u201d. Worryingly for Labour, there is little to suggest that this curse of incumbency is going to&nbsp;lift anytime soon.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s first few months have been dominated by a series of political rows very much of the present: the out-of-the-blue announcement about means-testing pensioners\u2019 winter fuel payment; questions about ministers accepting freebies, including from companies where there are potential conflicts of interest; the fight with farmers over inheritance tax. But an even bigger headache lies ahead: the gap between voter expectations and what Labour might realistically be able to deliver in the next four years.</p> <p>Voters have lost faith in politics to deliver and are desperate for things to get better. Polling from <a href=\"https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/rahdlw1v/lpc-respect-slides.pdf\">More in Common</a> shows just 31% of people think democracy is working and 62% think politicians aren\u2019t up to facing the country\u2019s challenges. Trust in politicians has <a href=\"https://www.labourtogether.uk/how-labour-won-2024-report\">more than halved</a> since the mid-1980s. The most common word people use to describe Britain is \u201cbroken\u201d. </p> <p>More in Common director Luke Tryl tells me there is an overwhelming feeling in focus groups that, despite doing the right thing and working hard, at the end of the month people feel as if they have nothing to show for it. He thinks that the steep fall in Labour\u2019s approval ratings isn\u2019t just a product of the government\u2019s shaky start, but a huge impatience for things to&nbsp;improve.</p> <p>The problem is that Britain\u2019s challenges are probably too big to fix in five years. There are the long-term structural issues with the economy \u2013 low investment, sluggish productivity and sharp regional inequalities \u2013 made worse by Brexit; and the state of the NHS and so many other public services, from policing to older care. And that\u2019s before you factor in the longer-term problems: a housing crisis that means many people in their 20s today will never own their own home and will retire unable to afford rent in their retirement. A falling birthrate that means that working-age taxpayers will need to pay ever-bigger sums in tax to support the health and care needs of an ageing&nbsp;society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform lurks in the wings, waiting to reap the benefits of further disaffection if Labour doesn\u2019t meet expectations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rachel Reeves is doing the best she can in the circumstances: raising taxes to increase spending on public services, and borrowing more to kickstart growth. The problem is that, while the extra money for the NHS looks good on paper, it\u2019s around a 4% real increase in health spending a year <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/long-reads/autumn-budget-2024-health-and-care\">for the next two years</a> \u2013 only in line with the average yearly increase the NHS has had from its inception <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/data-and-charts/nhs-budget-nutshell\">until 2010</a>. It will stop things getting worse, but is it enough to drive radical improvements? And the extra investment Reeves is planning will take longer than an electoral cycle to boost growth: the Office for Budget Responsibility thinks it will add just 0.14% to GDP by 2029. Donald Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 especially if he launches a global trade war \u2013 is likely to make the growth and living standards outlook even worse.</p> <p>It feels a bit like we are in a political doom loop: the financial crisis broke the happy spell of growth powered by the City, rising house prices and easy credit, and paved the way for years of stagnant living standards. Populist Conservatives promised to fix it all with Brexit; when the manna didn\u2019t transpire, they were kicked out of office. Now Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform lurks in the wings, waiting to reap the benefits of further disaffection and anti-politics sentiment if Labour doesn\u2019t meet voter expectations. Things get tougher and populists do&nbsp;better.</p> <p>Labour has to find a way of breaking this cycle if it is not to go the way of Harris. As the thinktank <a href=\"https://www.labourtogether.uk/how-labour-won-2024-report\">Labour Together has argued</a>, that is partly about being laser-focused on delivering as much as it possibly can of what matters to most voters, and not getting distracted with \u201cpet projects\u201d. Reducing NHS waiting lists and reducing the cost of living are <a href=\"https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/rahdlw1v/lpc-respect-slides.pdf\">top of&nbsp;the list</a>.</p> <p>But I also think it has to find a different way of communicating with voters. The Conservatives overpromised and under-delivered. There is a danger Labour finds itself in a similar bind in four years: having promised the country it would deliver growth and fix the public realm, it simply will not have enough to show for it. Everywhere you look there are tough trade-offs, and little sign that the economic boom of New Labour\u2019s first decade in power, which would make this problem go away, is going to materialise. </p> <p>I wonder if voters would end up respecting ministers more if they found a way to be more honest about&nbsp;how difficult things are, and how the solutions have to be long term, in a way that isn\u2019t simply about blaming the last lot and saying you\u2019re the fix. </p> <p>That\u2019s undoubtedly a tough message to communicate but, unlike the other political pitches out there, it has the advantage of being the&nbsp;truth.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist</p>",

It\u2019s not just the Democrats: in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa, governments have been booted out of office in what the academic Rob Ford has called \u201cthe greatest wave of anti-incumbent voting ever seen\u201d. Worryingly for Labour, there is little to suggest that this curse of incumbency is going to lift anytime soon. Labour\u2019s first few months have been dominated by a series of political rows very much of the present: the out-of-the-blue announcement about means-testing pensioners\u2019 winter fuel payment; questions about ministers accepting freebies, including from companies where there are potential conflicts of interest; the fight with farmers over inheritance tax. But an even bigger headache lies ahead: the gap between voter expectations and what Labour might realistically be able to deliver in the next four years. Voters have lost faith in politics to deliver and are desperate for things to get better. Polling from More in Common shows just 31% of people think democracy is working and 62% think politicians aren\u2019t up to facing the country\u2019s challenges. Trust in politicians has more than halved since the mid-1980s. The most common word people use to describe Britain is \u201cbroken\u201d. More in Common director Luke Tryl tells me there is an overwhelming feeling in focus groups that, despite doing the right thing and working hard, at the end of the month people feel as if they have nothing to show for it. He thinks that the steep fall in Labour\u2019s approval ratings isn\u2019t just a product of the government\u2019s shaky start, but a huge impatience for things to improve. The problem is that Britain\u2019s challenges are probably too big to fix in five years. There are the long-term structural issues with the economy \u2013 low investment, sluggish productivity and sharp regional inequalities \u2013 made worse by Brexit; and the state of the NHS and so many other public services, from policing to older care. And that\u2019s before you factor in the longer-term problems: a housing crisis that means many people in their 20s today will never own their own home and will retire unable to afford rent in their retirement. A falling birthrate that means that working-age taxpayers will need to pay ever-bigger sums in tax to support the health and care needs of an ageing society. Rachel Reeves is doing the best she can in the circumstances: raising taxes to increase spending on public services, and borrowing more to kickstart growth. The problem is that, while the extra money for the NHS looks good on paper, it\u2019s around a 4% real increase in health spending a year for the next two years \u2013 only in line with the average yearly increase the NHS has had from its inception until 2010. It will stop things getting worse, but is it enough to drive radical improvements? And the extra investment Reeves is planning will take longer than an electoral cycle to boost growth: the Office for Budget Responsibility thinks it will add just 0.14% to GDP by 2029. Donald Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 especially if he launches a global trade war \u2013 is likely to make the growth and living standards outlook even worse. It feels a bit like we are in a political doom loop: the financial crisis broke the happy spell of growth powered by the City, rising house prices and easy credit, and paved the way for years of stagnant living standards. Populist Conservatives promised to fix it all with Brexit; when the manna didn\u2019t transpire, they were kicked out of office. Now Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform lurks in the wings, waiting to reap the benefits of further disaffection and anti-politics sentiment if Labour doesn\u2019t meet voter expectations. Things get tougher and populists do better. Labour has to find a way of breaking this cycle if it is not to go the way of Harris. As the thinktank Labour Together has argued, that is partly about being laser-focused on delivering as much as it possibly can of what matters to most voters, and not getting distracted with \u201cpet projects\u201d. Reducing NHS waiting lists and reducing the cost of living are top of the list. But I also think it has to find a different way of communicating with voters. The Conservatives overpromised and under-delivered. There is a danger Labour finds itself in a similar bind in four years: having promised the country it would deliver growth and fix the public realm, it simply will not have enough to show for it. Everywhere you look there are tough trade-offs, and little sign that the economic boom of New Labour\u2019s first decade in power, which would make this problem go away, is going to materialise. I wonder if voters would end up respecting ministers more if they found a way to be more honest about how difficult things are, and how the solutions have to be long term, in a way that isn\u2019t simply about blaming the last lot and saying you\u2019re the fix. That\u2019s undoubtedly a tough message to communicate but, unlike the other political pitches out there, it has the advantage of being the truth. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>Most great female actors get to play a nun at some point in their career: a kind of thespian rite of passage that comes to many in their <em>grande dame</em> years. Isabella Rossellini, however, checked off that box in her very first screen appearance, aged 24: in 1976\u2019s little-remembered Vincente Minnelli musical <em>A Matter of Time</em>, in a bit part opposite her mother, screen legend and three-time Oscar winner Ingrid Bergman.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum was playing an eccentric countess, who\u2019s dying, and she thought one of the nuns assisting her dying could be me,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBecause we resembled each other, she thought it would be interesting for the countess to see her young self in me, in a kind of hallucination. But also, I think she wanted to tempt me to be an actress because she loved acting so much.\u201d She grimaces at the memory. \u201cIt was not successful at all.\u201d</p> <p>Nearly half a century later, Rossellini has again donned a wimple, to rather more successful effect, in Edward Berger\u2019s gripping Vatican thriller <em>Conclave</em>. Playing Sister Agnes, a sternly watchful nun overseeing the housekeeping for a high-stakes papal election, she\u2019s a deceptively quiet, background figure for much of the proceedings \u2013 eventually granted one short, blistering speech that tilts the film on its axis. \u201cI play a shadow,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Catholic church is very patriarchal, the cardinals are only men, but the nuns aren\u2019t subservient. They have enormous power. It was important to underline their silence, but that silence doesn\u2019t have to be powerless. I grew up in Rome and went to Catholic school. I knew how to play that because I lived it.\u201d</p> <p>At 72, Rossellini is happy to take smaller roles with fewer lines and concentrated impact. In playing Sister Agnes, she thought back to her lengthy modelling career, and something she learned from the photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/02/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Richard Avedon</a>: \u201cHe said, if you are modelling, you\u2019re acting. You\u2019re like a silent movie star because models don\u2019t have words, but still emote. You\u2019re not only present if you have dialogue. As Agnes, I don\u2019t have much dialogue, but I\u2019m a definite presence.\u201d</p>    <p>While Rossellini has never taken an extended screen hiatus, exactly, her acting career has felt rejuvenated in recent years \u2013 a full graduation into offbeat character actor territory, with lively supporting parts in films ranging from Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/12/la-chimera-review-josh-oconnor-dazzles-in-brilliant-tale-of-italian-tomb-raiders\">La Chimera</a></em> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/03/joy-review-jennifer-lawrence-robert-de-niro-david-o-russell\">David O Russell\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/03/joy-review-jennifer-lawrence-robert-de-niro-david-o-russell\">Joy</a></em>, while her unmistakeable Italo-American accent has featured in animated titles such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/19/marcel-the-shell-with-shoes-on-review-oddball-mollusc-mockumentary-is-one-from-the-heart-dean-fleischer-camp-jenny-slate\">Marcel the Shell With Shoes On</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/15/incredibles-2-review-mark-kermode\">The Incredibles 2</a></em>.</p> <p>\u201cI feel that too,\u201d she says when I suggest that she\u2019s mounted a subtle screen comeback. \u201cMy mum died when she was 67, younger than I am now. But she told me that sometimes actresses have a slump in their career when they are neither young nor old: 45 to 55 or 60. It\u2019s not that you cannot have love interests, but that story is not told. But then when you get older, she said, you get more parts.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The difference now is that the executives are women. And they understand that this idea of makeup used just as a tool of seduction is reductive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In middle age, with credits such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/blue-velvet-review-still-inventive-sexy-and-bizarre\">Blue Velvet</a></em> and <em>Death Becomes Her</em> to her name, Rossellini sensed the plum parts tailing off, as Bergman had warned. So she went back to university, in an academic pursuit very different from her early studies in costume design at Italy\u2019s academy of costume and fashion \u2013 returning instead to her childhood passion for animals. \u201cI took a masters in ethology, which is the science of animal behaviour, and started to make my own little films about that, and started to write monologues. So I created a parallel career to my acting.\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut then acting came back.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t only leading roles that deserted Rossellini in her 40s: her modelling career \u2013 in particular, her celebrity-defining gig as the face of Lanc\u00f4me cosmetics \u2013 took a hit too. Told at 43 by Lanc\u00f4me executives that she was too old to represent the brand, she was summarily dropped. \u201cThe rationale they gave me at the time was that advertising addresses dreams, and that people dream of being young,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t seem to be the dominant dream, as it was reported to me: when I asked my friends, do you want to stay young for ever, they didn\u2019t. Marketing research says women appreciate a 42-year-old advertising anti-ageing cream instead of a 20-year-old, but they ignore that part. At first, there was a reaction from some customers who were offended that I\u2019d been dropped, and I thought, maybe they\u2019ll get me back somehow. But then 20 years went by.\u201d</p>    <p>In 2016, aged 63, Rossellini was surprised to get a call from Lanc\u00f4me, inviting her back on board. \u201cThe difference now is that the executives are women. And they understand that this idea of makeup used just as a tool of seduction is reductive. Because makeup is for everybody: it\u2019s much more inclusive and is a tool of creativity. But when they called, I asked them, if you just want an older person because you want to be inclusive, why not call Helen Mirren or Meryl Streep? With me, you again have the press controversy because they remember when you didn\u2019t renew my contract. But they said, no, you can represent that change in society, because you\u2019ve been on both sides of it.\u201d</p> <p>She notes with some relish the irony of her having been cast in <em>Death Becomes Her</em>, Robert Zemeckis\u2019s satire of Hollywood ageism, as a supernatural merchant of eternal youth \u2013 shortly before the Lanc\u00f4me fallout. \u201cI was delighted to be in that film,\u201d she cackles, fishing for her phone to show me an Instagram image of nail art designed in the film\u2019s honour. It\u2019s not the last time Rossellini, an avid Instagrammer, consults the app during our interview: her own account is a busy riot of colour and cheer, with cute animal snaps adjacent to flamboyant outfit pics.</p> <p>I ask if she has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/22/the-substance-review-demi-moore-is-fearless-in-visceral-female-body-horror-coralie-fargeat\">Coralie Fargeat\u2019s horror film </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/22/the-substance-review-demi-moore-is-fearless-in-visceral-female-body-horror-coralie-fargeat\">The Substance</a></em>, which strikes me as a kind of present-day <em>Death Becomes Her</em>: magnifying concerns about Hollywood discarding older women, and pushing them into more violently extreme terrain. Her face immediately lights up. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cI love the feminist rage of it, and the humour in that.\u201d She heaps praise on its stars, Demi Moore \u2013 \u201cI always think that <em>she</em> represents that eternal youth, and yet she\u2019s very wise and accepting\u201d \u2013 and Margaret Qualley, whom she only recently learned is, like her, an industry baby.</p> <p>\u201cI was amazed by that young actress playing the double, the cruelty of her face when she becomes a murderer \u2013 and then somebody told me she\u2019s Andie MacDowell\u2019s daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I was so proud in a way. Right on! We daughter-ofs!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an obvious cue for a delicate question, one that can draw brittle responses from other sons- and daughters-of, to borrow Rossellini\u2019s phrasing. As the daughter of not just Bergman, but revered Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini, is she offended by the discourse around the term \u201cnepo baby\u201d? She frowns, and asks me to repeat the words. After a second, she laughs. \u201cOh, nepo like nepotism? That\u2019s very funny.\u201d Perhaps the term isn\u2019t quite as prevalent as I thought.</p>    <p>This aside, she has mixed feelings on the subject, having found inherited celebrity something of a double-edged sword at the outset of her career. \u201cOf course it opens the door, because people are curious to see you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that it was an advantage. The judgment is much more severe, and you don\u2019t have time to grow.\u201d</p> <p>She thinks back to the first substantial film role she had, three years after her fleeting appearance in <em>A Matter of Time</em>, in 1979\u2019s <em>The Meadow</em>, a solemn social-realist romance by fraternal Italian directing duo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/16/paolo-and-vittorio-taviani-radical-italian-padre-padrone\">Paolo and Vittorio Taviani</a>. The project was a prestigious one \u2013 the brothers had won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes with their previous film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/apr/28/my-favourite-cannes-winner-padre-padrone\">Padre Padrone</a></em> \u2013 and many critics, particularly on home turf in Italy, were not kind. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bad film, and I didn\u2019t do a bad job, now that I look back,\u201d she says with a shrug. \u201cBut there were big expectations, and the reviews were excruciating. I stopped and said, I\u2019m not going to be an actress.\u201d</p> <p>Bar a quirky appearance as herself in the 1980 Roberto Benigni comedy <em>In the Pope\u2019s Eye</em>, she kept her word for six years, as a modelling career beckoned instead, and her personal life got complicated. A three-year marriage to Martin Scorsese, ending in 1982, didn\u2019t tempt her back into the movies; a second marriage, to fellow model Jon Wiedemann, was also short-lived, but gave her her daughter Elettra \u2013 once a model, in the family tradition, now a food writer.</p> <p>Elettra was born less than a year after Bergman\u2019s death from breast cancer in 1982. Amid her grief and the travails of new motherhood, Hollywood came calling: when offered her first American film, the glossy 1985 dance drama <em>White Nights</em>, Rossellini finally felt ready to take on the career her mother had wanted for her. She recalls: \u201cMama said, it\u2019s ridiculous that you\u2019re not trying to act, just because you feel that you\u2019ll be compared with me. You\u2019ll be compared with me at the beginning. And then they\u2019ll forget. And she was right. But at the beginning, it was tough.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My daughter thought all billboard advertisements were posters of mothers and fathers, in case their children got lost</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She positively beams with pride when talking about her parents, and still pores over the films they made: she delights in pointing out that she\u2019s wearing her mother\u2019s jewellery from the shoot of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/06/journey-to-italy-roberto-rossellini\">Journey to Italy</a></em>, the gorgeous, bittersweet marital drama that Bergman and Rossellini made together when their daughter was a mere toddler. I ask at what age Rossellini became aware that her mother was a star; the realisation was a slow one. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a little girl, you don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought that parents were just famous, you know? I remember going to school and asking my friends, is my mum as famous as Joan Crawford? What about Greta Garbo? I didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p> <p>Rossellini\u2019s own daughter grew up accustomed to seeing her mother\u2019s face on billboards, though did not immediately connect that with celebrity. \u201cWhen I did the Lanc\u00f4me ads, they were everywhere, in every airport. And my daughter was going to school, she was five or six, and they were teaching the children to remember their last name and their address just in case they got lost. So they asked Elettra: if you\u2019re lost, what do you do? And she said, well, I will sit under Mama\u2019s poster and she will find me. She thought all advertisements were posters of mothers and fathers, in case their children got lost.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a source of sadness to Rossellini that neither of her two children \u2013 she adopted her son, Roberto, in 1993 \u2013 ever met her parents, though she finds that classic films can function in much the same way as family albums. \u201cWhen my daughter was maybe 10 or so, and she was asking about her grandmother, and I said, let me find her. So I just turned on the TV and there she was, in <em>Anastasia</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Rossellini\u2019s most celebrated screen role, as an abused nightclub singer in David Lynch\u2019s suburban nightmare <em>Blue Velvet</em>, cued a five-year relationship with Lynch himself; in the mid-1990s, she was engaged to Gary Oldman for two years before they broke up. After such a run of high-profile romances, however, she\u2019s been happily unpartnered for the past 25 years. Did she make a conscious decision to remain single?</p>    <p>She shakes her head. \u201cI think that\u2019s just how life panned out. I had children and it was difficult to have a relationship with a man who was not the father. And I started thinking, OK, I\u2019ll take care of the children and then when they\u2019re grown up, I\u2019ll be available for a partner. But then I found, I have to say, the great serenity of being single.\u201d She pauses, as if to savour the words. \u201cAnd if I hadn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think I would have been able to do all that I\u2019ve done. I have freedom of movement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe if I\u2019d found somebody and fallen in love,\u201d she says airily, not finishing the thought. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t look for a partner just to not be alone, because I wasn\u2019t alone. When you\u2019re with somebody, you become very vulnerable to the ups and downs of the other person. So I was able to keep an evenness and a concentration that allowed me to study, to get a master\u2019s degree in my 50s. I could just zero in on what I had wanted to do when I was 14.\u201d</p> <p>We are talking, again, about that ethology degree \u2013 which she eventually put to use in 2013 by buying and managing a 28-acre farmstead, 60 miles from New York City in Long Island. A conservation-minded community space where animals \u2013 including poultry, sheep and goats \u2013 are reared but never slaughtered, Mama Farm was born of weekend trips to the countryside with her children. \u201cThen a piece of land came available and somebody suggested, why don\u2019t you buy it and make a farm and take it away from the developer? And I did. It was ignorance and optimism. I didn\u2019t know how hard it was. It\u2019s still very hard.\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have a lot: I don\u2019t want to die and have my children be like, Oh my God, what do we do with 5,000 sheep?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX9jasdi3ic\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JX9jasdi3ic?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX9jasdi3ic\">Watch a trailer for Conclave.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Rossellini\u2019s life is a happy balance of family, farming, film and other, more particular passions: she\u2019s excited to begin touring her self-written one-woman show, <em>Darwin\u2019s Smile</em> \u2013 \u201cabout the expression of emotion of actors and animals\u201d \u2013 in France. For someone who has long been the face of anti-ageing products, she\u2019s decidedly pro-ageing herself.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, you get wrinkles and you get fat and you lose a kind of beauty \u2013 that is true,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they never talk about the freedom that comes with that. More than freedom, a lightness. When you\u2019re young, you have so many things to prove. You have to prove that you are intelligent, that you\u2019re financially independent, that you\u2019re a good parent. There are so many obligations. And when you\u2019re old, you\u2019re not proving yourself any more. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m that intelligent or not. I am who I am. You start to say, if I don\u2019t do what I want to do now, I will never do it. And life becomes more fun.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Conclave</em> opens in UK cinemas on Friday 29 November</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Most great female actors get to play a nun at some point in their career: a kind of thespian rite of passage that comes to many in their grande dame years. Isabella Rossellini, however, checked off that box in her very first screen appearance, aged 24: in 1976\u2019s little-remembered Vincente Minnelli musical A Matter of Time, in a bit part opposite her mother, screen legend and three-time Oscar winner Ingrid Bergman. \u201cMy mum was playing an eccentric countess, who\u2019s dying, and she thought one of the nuns assisting her dying could be me,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBecause we resembled each other, she thought it would be interesting for the countess to see her young self in me, in a kind of hallucination. But also, I think she wanted to tempt me to be an actress because she loved acting so much.\u201d She grimaces at the memory. \u201cIt was not successful at all.\u201d Nearly half a century later, Rossellini has again donned a wimple, to rather more successful effect, in Edward Berger\u2019s gripping Vatican thriller Conclave. Playing Sister Agnes, a sternly watchful nun overseeing the housekeeping for a high-stakes papal election, she\u2019s a deceptively quiet, background figure for much of the proceedings \u2013 eventually granted one short, blistering speech that tilts the film on its axis. \u201cI play a shadow,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Catholic church is very patriarchal, the cardinals are only men, but the nuns aren\u2019t subservient. They have enormous power. It was important to underline their silence, but that silence doesn\u2019t have to be powerless. I grew up in Rome and went to Catholic school. I knew how to play that because I lived it.\u201d At 72, Rossellini is happy to take smaller roles with fewer lines and concentrated impact. In playing Sister Agnes, she thought back to her lengthy modelling career, and something she learned from the photographer Richard Avedon: \u201cHe said, if you are modelling, you\u2019re acting. You\u2019re like a silent movie star because models don\u2019t have words, but still emote. You\u2019re not only present if you have dialogue. As Agnes, I don\u2019t have much dialogue, but I\u2019m a definite presence.\u201d While Rossellini has never taken an extended screen hiatus, exactly, her acting career has felt rejuvenated in recent years \u2013 a full graduation into offbeat character actor territory, with lively supporting parts in films ranging from Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s La Chimera to David O Russell\u2019s Joy, while her unmistakeable Italo-American accent has featured in animated titles such as Marcel the Shell With Shoes On and The Incredibles 2. \u201cI feel that too,\u201d she says when I suggest that she\u2019s mounted a subtle screen comeback. \u201cMy mum died when she was 67, younger than I am now. But she told me that sometimes actresses have a slump in their career when they are neither young nor old: 45 to 55 or 60. It\u2019s not that you cannot have love interests, but that story is not told. But then when you get older, she said, you get more parts.\u201d In middle age, with credits such as Blue Velvet and Death Becomes Her to her name, Rossellini sensed the plum parts tailing off, as Bergman had warned. So she went back to university, in an academic pursuit very different from her early studies in costume design at Italy\u2019s academy of costume and fashion \u2013 returning instead to her childhood passion for animals. \u201cI took a masters in ethology, which is the science of animal behaviour, and started to make my own little films about that, and started to write monologues. So I created a parallel career to my acting.\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut then acting came back.\u201d It wasn\u2019t only leading roles that deserted Rossellini in her 40s: her modelling career \u2013 in particular, her celebrity-defining gig as the face of Lanc\u00f4me cosmetics \u2013 took a hit too. Told at 43 by Lanc\u00f4me executives that she was too old to represent the brand, she was summarily dropped. \u201cThe rationale they gave me at the time was that advertising addresses dreams, and that people dream of being young,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t seem to be the dominant dream, as it was reported to me: when I asked my friends, do you want to stay young for ever, they didn\u2019t. Marketing research says women appreciate a 42-year-old advertising anti-ageing cream instead of a 20-year-old, but they ignore that part. At first, there was a reaction from some customers who were offended that I\u2019d been dropped, and I thought, maybe they\u2019ll get me back somehow. But then 20 years went by.\u201d In 2016, aged 63, Rossellini was surprised to get a call from Lanc\u00f4me, inviting her back on board. \u201cThe difference now is that the executives are women. And they understand that this idea of makeup used just as a tool of seduction is reductive. Because makeup is for everybody: it\u2019s much more inclusive and is a tool of creativity. But when they called, I asked them, if you just want an older person because you want to be inclusive, why not call Helen Mirren or Meryl Streep? With me, you again have the press controversy because they remember when you didn\u2019t renew my contract. But they said, no, you can represent that change in society, because you\u2019ve been on both sides of it.\u201d She notes with some relish the irony of her having been cast in Death Becomes Her, Robert Zemeckis\u2019s satire of Hollywood ageism, as a supernatural merchant of eternal youth \u2013 shortly before the Lanc\u00f4me fallout. \u201cI was delighted to be in that film,\u201d she cackles, fishing for her phone to show me an Instagram image of nail art designed in the film\u2019s honour. It\u2019s not the last time Rossellini, an avid Instagrammer, consults the app during our interview: her own account is a busy riot of colour and cheer, with cute animal snaps adjacent to flamboyant outfit pics. I ask if she has seen Coralie Fargeat\u2019s horror film The Substance, which strikes me as a kind of present-day Death Becomes Her: magnifying concerns about Hollywood discarding older women, and pushing them into more violently extreme terrain. Her face immediately lights up. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cI love the feminist rage of it, and the humour in that.\u201d She heaps praise on its stars, Demi Moore \u2013 \u201cI always think that she represents that eternal youth, and yet she\u2019s very wise and accepting\u201d \u2013 and Margaret Qualley, whom she only recently learned is, like her, an industry baby. \u201cI was amazed by that young actress playing the double, the cruelty of her face when she becomes a murderer \u2013 and then somebody told me she\u2019s Andie MacDowell\u2019s daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I was so proud in a way. Right on! We daughter-ofs!\u201d It\u2019s an obvious cue for a delicate question, one that can draw brittle responses from other sons- and daughters-of, to borrow Rossellini\u2019s phrasing. As the daughter of not just Bergman, but revered Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini, is she offended by the discourse around the term \u201cnepo baby\u201d? She frowns, and asks me to repeat the words. After a second, she laughs. \u201cOh, nepo like nepotism? That\u2019s very funny.\u201d Perhaps the term isn\u2019t quite as prevalent as I thought. This aside, she has mixed feelings on the subject, having found inherited celebrity something of a double-edged sword at the outset of her career. \u201cOf course it opens the door, because people are curious to see you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that it was an advantage. The judgment is much more severe, and you don\u2019t have time to grow.\u201d She thinks back to the first substantial film role she had, three years after her fleeting appearance in A Matter of Time, in 1979\u2019s The Meadow, a solemn social-realist romance by fraternal Italian directing duo Paolo and Vittorio Taviani. The project was a prestigious one \u2013 the brothers had won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes with their previous film, Padre Padrone \u2013 and many critics, particularly on home turf in Italy, were not kind. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bad film, and I didn\u2019t do a bad job, now that I look back,\u201d she says with a shrug. \u201cBut there were big expectations, and the reviews were excruciating. I stopped and said, I\u2019m not going to be an actress.\u201d Bar a quirky appearance as herself in the 1980 Roberto Benigni comedy In the Pope\u2019s Eye, she kept her word for six years, as a modelling career beckoned instead, and her personal life got complicated. A three-year marriage to Martin Scorsese, ending in 1982, didn\u2019t tempt her back into the movies; a second marriage, to fellow model Jon Wiedemann, was also short-lived, but gave her her daughter Elettra \u2013 once a model, in the family tradition, now a food writer. Elettra was born less than a year after Bergman\u2019s death from breast cancer in 1982. Amid her grief and the travails of new motherhood, Hollywood came calling: when offered her first American film, the glossy 1985 dance drama White Nights, Rossellini finally felt ready to take on the career her mother had wanted for her. She recalls: \u201cMama said, it\u2019s ridiculous that you\u2019re not trying to act, just because you feel that you\u2019ll be compared with me. You\u2019ll be compared with me at the beginning. And then they\u2019ll forget. And she was right. But at the beginning, it was tough.\u201d She positively beams with pride when talking about her parents, and still pores over the films they made: she delights in pointing out that she\u2019s wearing her mother\u2019s jewellery from the shoot of Journey to Italy, the gorgeous, bittersweet marital drama that Bergman and Rossellini made together when their daughter was a mere toddler. I ask at what age Rossellini became aware that her mother was a star; the realisation was a slow one. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a little girl, you don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought that parents were just famous, you know? I remember going to school and asking my friends, is my mum as famous as Joan Crawford? What about Greta Garbo? I didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d Rossellini\u2019s own daughter grew up accustomed to seeing her mother\u2019s face on billboards, though did not immediately connect that with celebrity. \u201cWhen I did the Lanc\u00f4me ads, they were everywhere, in every airport. And my daughter was going to school, she was five or six, and they were teaching the children to remember their last name and their address just in case they got lost. So they asked Elettra: if you\u2019re lost, what do you do? And she said, well, I will sit under Mama\u2019s poster and she will find me. She thought all advertisements were posters of mothers and fathers, in case their children got lost.\u201d It\u2019s a source of sadness to Rossellini that neither of her two children \u2013 she adopted her son, Roberto, in 1993 \u2013 ever met her parents, though she finds that classic films can function in much the same way as family albums. \u201cWhen my daughter was maybe 10 or so, and she was asking about her grandmother, and I said, let me find her. So I just turned on the TV and there she was, in Anastasia.\u201d Rossellini\u2019s most celebrated screen role, as an abused nightclub singer in David Lynch\u2019s suburban nightmare Blue Velvet, cued a five-year relationship with Lynch himself; in the mid-1990s, she was engaged to Gary Oldman for two years before they broke up. After such a run of high-profile romances, however, she\u2019s been happily unpartnered for the past 25 years. Did she make a conscious decision to remain single? She shakes her head. \u201cI think that\u2019s just how life panned out. I had children and it was difficult to have a relationship with a man who was not the father. And I started thinking, OK, I\u2019ll take care of the children and then when they\u2019re grown up, I\u2019ll be available for a partner. But then I found, I have to say, the great serenity of being single.\u201d She pauses, as if to savour the words. \u201cAnd if I hadn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think I would have been able to do all that I\u2019ve done. I have freedom of movement.\u201d \u201cMaybe if I\u2019d found somebody and fallen in love,\u201d she says airily, not finishing the thought. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t look for a partner just to not be alone, because I wasn\u2019t alone. When you\u2019re with somebody, you become very vulnerable to the ups and downs of the other person. So I was able to keep an evenness and a concentration that allowed me to study, to get a master\u2019s degree in my 50s. I could just zero in on what I had wanted to do when I was 14.\u201d We are talking, again, about that ethology degree \u2013 which she eventually put to use in 2013 by buying and managing a 28-acre farmstead, 60 miles from New York City in Long Island. A conservation-minded community space where animals \u2013 including poultry, sheep and goats \u2013 are reared but never slaughtered, Mama Farm was born of weekend trips to the countryside with her children. \u201cThen a piece of land came available and somebody suggested, why don\u2019t you buy it and make a farm and take it away from the developer? And I did. It was ignorance and optimism. I didn\u2019t know how hard it was. It\u2019s still very hard.\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have a lot: I don\u2019t want to die and have my children be like, Oh my God, what do we do with 5,000 sheep?\u201d Rossellini\u2019s life is a happy balance of family, farming, film and other, more particular passions: she\u2019s excited to begin touring her self-written one-woman show, Darwin\u2019s Smile \u2013 \u201cabout the expression of emotion of actors and animals\u201d \u2013 in France. For someone who has long been the face of anti-ageing products, she\u2019s decidedly pro-ageing herself. \u201cYou know, you get wrinkles and you get fat and you lose a kind of beauty \u2013 that is true,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they never talk about the freedom that comes with that. More than freedom, a lightness. When you\u2019re young, you have so many things to prove. You have to prove that you are intelligent, that you\u2019re financially independent, that you\u2019re a good parent. There are so many obligations. And when you\u2019re old, you\u2019re not proving yourself any more. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m that intelligent or not. I am who I am. You start to say, if I don\u2019t do what I want to do now, I will never do it. And life becomes more fun.\u201d Conclave opens in UK cinemas on Friday 29 November",

      "body": "<p><strong>Sunday plans?</strong> My daughter often comes over, which is nice. If not, I\u2019ve got the cat, Ziggy Stardust. I\u2019ll get something to read and that\u2019s about it. I try to do as little as possible.</p> <p><strong>How\u2019s Ziggy?</strong> She just likes to cuddle. She\u2019ll wake me up at bonkers o\u2019clock, so I never get a lie in. She\u2019s always hungry. If it\u2019s sunny, I feel guilty that I should get out the house. If it\u2019s miserable, I\u2019ll go back to bed and watch stuff I\u2019ve recorded or missed.</p> <p><strong>Sunday brekkie?</strong> I\u2019m never really hungry in the morning. I do like a cheese toastie \u2013 I\u2019m well known for not being able to do anything in the kitchen. I\u2019ll tend to buy something on the go, like a good salad. I\u2019m more of a nibbler. Cheese and crackers are always nice.</p> <p><strong>Sundays growing up?</strong> We did occasionally go to church, but mostly because the neighbours went, so my mum felt we had to. Then we\u2019d go to Grandma\u2019s for Sunday lunch while she watched the wrestling. Grannies love wrestling! My grandma <em>loved</em> wrestling. You could never say that it was acting. She\u2019d say, \u2018No, Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks are real.\u2019 And we\u2019d think: \u2018Bless you, grandma.\u2019</p> <p><strong>Sunday exercise?</strong> I used to run, but my knees are playing up now that I\u2019m 53. And I used to do spin classes, but I now don\u2019t have any gyms near me.</p> <p><strong>Sunday housework?</strong> Every day is a house-proud day. I hoover every day. I mop every day.

I try to do as little as possible. How\u2019s Ziggy? She just likes to cuddle. She\u2019ll wake me up at bonkers o\u2019clock, so I never get a lie in. She\u2019s always hungry. If it\u2019s sunny, I feel guilty that I should get out the house. If it\u2019s miserable, I\u2019ll go back to bed and watch stuff I\u2019ve recorded or missed. Sunday brekkie? I\u2019m never really hungry in the morning. I do like a cheese toastie \u2013 I\u2019m well known for not being able to do anything in the kitchen. I\u2019ll tend to buy something on the go, like a good salad. I\u2019m more of a nibbler. Cheese and crackers are always nice. Sundays growing up? We did occasionally go to church, but mostly because the neighbours went, so my mum felt we had to. Then we\u2019d go to Grandma\u2019s for Sunday lunch while she watched the wrestling. Grannies love wrestling! My grandma loved wrestling. You could never say that it was acting. She\u2019d say, \u2018No, Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks are real.\u2019 And we\u2019d think: \u2018Bless you, grandma.\u2019 Sunday exercise? I used to run, but my knees are playing up now that I\u2019m 53. And I used to do spin classes, but I now don\u2019t have any gyms near me. Sunday housework? Every day is a house-proud day. I hoover every day. I mop every day. I change my sheets every two days. I have to feel clean to feel comfortable. Sunday evening? I\u2019ll usually end up bingeing a box set, because I\u2019ve got insomnia. The problem with finishing the whole thing at 4am is that you have nothing to watch next week. Younger Sundays?

      "bodyText": "Victorian Labor may field a candidate in the upcoming byelection for the inner Melbourne seat of Prahran, after the resignation of former Greens MP Sam Hibbins following his admission of an affair with a staffer. Hibbins on Saturday announced he would resign as the member for Prahran just three weeks after he quit the Greens due to a \u201cconsensual relationship\u201d with a staff member on his team, which was a breach of the party\u2019s rules. Hibbins has already tendered his resignation with the speaker, Maree Edwards, who has 30 days to issue a writ for a byelection and set its timeline. The byelection will probably be held in late January or early February but parties have just weeks to decide whether to run. The Liberal MP, Evan Mulholland, told reporters on Sunday said he \u201cfully expects\u201d his party will field a candidate in the seat, which he said had \u201cnot been served well by either the Greens or the Labor party\u201d. Labor figures met on Sunday to discuss whether to field a candidate but will likely make a decision when its administrative committee meets on Tuesday. Some members had concerns about the high cost of running a campaign in a non-government seat, while others said they should work to prevent the Liberals from picking it up. Most members agreed that if Labor performed poorly, it would be considered a \u201creferendum\u201d on the government, which would not be helpful ahead of the 2026 poll. \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth the risk,\u201d one MP said. However, another said: \u201cWe\u2019re a major political party, we shouldn\u2019t be picking and choosing which elections we contest and which we sit out.\u201d The premier, Jacinta Allan, said it was a matter for the party\u2019s administration. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Prahran, which takes in the eponymous suburb as well as South Yarra and Windsor, has previously been held by both major parties before Hibbins won it in 2014 in a three-way contest that took the Victorian Electoral Commission more than a week to declare. Since then, Hibbins has increased his margin to 12% against the Liberals, but the Greens have recently performed worse than expected at local government elections and in the Queensland state poll. Ben Raue, an electoral analyst and founder of the Tally Room, said the byelection was \u201cuncharted territory\u201d for the Greens as it was the first time one of their MPs had resigned midterm. \u201cThe Greens tend to win these seats and hold them with the same person, who they really build their support around,\u201d Raue said. \u201cBut the problem with that approach is if that MP screws up really badly, it doesn\u2019t just hurt them, it hurts the brand.\u201d Hibbins, who is married and has two young children, said on Saturday he was resigning to put his family\u2019s \u201cwellbeing and safety\u201d first. \u201cIt has been an extremely difficult time for us as the public disclosure of what was a private matter has taken a significant toll on our family\u2019s mental health,\u201d Hibbins said. He claimed that since he left the Greens there had been unauthorised access to his office, during which personal items including baby photos were \u201cvandalised with offensive and threatening graffiti\u201d. It is understood Hibbins was informed of the vandalism inside his office by parliamentary services on 11 November and reported it to police. Victoria police would not confirm whether the incident had been reported, citing privacy laws. The Greens said the party did not believe any of its staff or MPs were involved in the alleged vandalism and they did not have access to Hibbins\u2019 office after he left the party. In a statement, the Greens leader, Ellen Sandell, said she was glad Hibbins had resigned from parliament.",

Adshead is the author of a genuinely mind-changing book, The Devil you Know, about her work in rehabilitating those individuals incarcerated for the most monstrous acts \u2013 serial killers, child sex abusers, perpetrators of gang violence. Her work starts from the fundamental belief that the capacity for such \u201cinhuman\u201d acts is actually a human part of all of us; her case studies make a powerful counterweight to those strident voices who believe prison exists only to punish \u201cevil\u201d, confronting the consequent scandal of our reoffending statistics.

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.rochdaletownhall.co.uk/themartletkitchen\">The Martlet</a>, Rochdale Town Hall, OL16 1AZ. Lunch plates \u00a310; main courses \u00a314 \u2013 \u00a321; desserts \u00a35; afternoon tea \u00a321. Evening menu: three courses \u00a335. Wines from \u00a322 a bottle</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s easy to imagine the ways by which the Martlet in Rochdale could have gone so very wrong; how the perceived demands of civic responsibility and the innate grinding conservatism of bureaucracy could have resulted in a dull, mediocre offering for the town. It wouldn\u2019t even have been worth rolling your eyes at. It would have been understandable. The Martlet is a new restaurant inside Rochdale\u2019s magnificent Town Hall. Since 2021, the building has undergone an equally magnificent restoration, to bring this slab of Victorian gothic revival by William Henry Crossland, into a golden, glowing focus. There is finely chiselled stonework, stained-glass windows and wood-panelled chambers with intricate foliage-strewn wall coverings recalling the work of William Morris. Ceiling panels are decorated with branch and leaf, upon which perch fully plumed peacocks and illustrations of the martlet, a mythical bird that was forever on the wing. Whatever you do, make time to drift slack-jawed through these chambers. Perhaps while wearing a pale, lace-fringed linen smock dress and kohl eyeliner. I could rock that look.</p>    <p>Such a new civic amenity needed some sort of food and drink outlet. They could have installed a modish and frankly annoying pan-European small plates bistro that nobody wanted. Or it could have been a bog-standard coffee and cake job. The Martlet does have the latter covered. There is good coffee and cake available here. But it is so much more. It\u2019s a broad offering drawing on the heritage of Greater Manchester in a smart, witty and generous way, and all at the sort of prices that will make those used to shaking down their bank accounts for a bit of lunch, sigh deeply. Head chef Darren Parkinson grew up locally and trained at Hopwood Hall College just four minutes\u2019 walk away, before a career which took him to France, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jan/19/foodanddrink.shopping3\">Winteringham Fields</a> in Lincolnshire and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/26/shibden-mill-inn-halifax-more-than-another-food-pub-jay-rayner\">Shibden Mill Inn</a> near Halifax. Now he\u2019s back home with a menu that touches many bases. You can come early for a full English, or a Bombay breakfast of fried eggs, mango chutney, onion bhajis and flatbreads. At lunchtime there\u2019s a list of platters for \u00a310, a couple of which have the echo of that imagined small plates bistro. There\u2019s a soft herb risotto with truffled nuts and pecorino, or a salad of pickled beetroot, radishes and goat\u2019s cheese dressed with white balsamic. Substitute tofu to make it vegan.</p>    <p>It all sounds lovely, but I\u2019m here for the boulder of breadcrumb-crusted Scotch egg, made with Bury black pudding, with the heft of white pepper. Cut in and the yolk runs away. Underneath is a thick bed of their own piccalilli, which has crunch and softness, sweetness and acidity. It\u2019s a class piece of work. Or get the sausage roll, which arrives sliced into five finger-ready pieces. The puff pastry is as inflated as a peacock\u2019s tail feathers, and each piece is topped by a properly spicy curry sauce ketchup. Swipe away at any that\u2019s left over with the very good chips. To one side of the menu is a panel entitled Rochdale Town Hall Classics, all for \u00a314. Alongside fish and chips, which come with Manchester caviar (mushy peas, of course), there\u2019s a bacon chop with more of the Bury black pudding and, joy of joys, a rag pudding.</p>    <p>If you\u2019ve not encountered one before, it\u2019s a parcel-shaped pie, named because of the way the suet pastry is hand-folded over the filling to make it look like a bundle of the cotton rags which once underpinned the region\u2019s industrial economy. It encloses a thick, gooey filling of both braised and minced beef. The flaky pastry has the crack you get only with animal fats and it sits in a knee-depth reservoir of gravy so glossy you could check your hair and make up in the reflection. With it are crisp-edged hasselback potatoes and minted garden peas, with more depth and maturity than their petit brethren. (A quick aside: the first time I met the great Manchester chef Rob Owen Brown, I asked him why he listed his grilled Barnsley chop as coming with little peas. \u201cBecause you\u2019re in Manchester,\u201d he said, tartly. \u201cThey\u2019re not petit pois. They\u2019re little peas.\u201d)</p> <p>From the grills section comes a Gloucester Old Spot pork chop for \u00a317, which more than matches the rag pudding for value. It is the thickness of a copy of Jilly Cooper\u2019s <em>Rivals</em> and just as satisfying.

      "bodyText": "The Martlet, Rochdale Town Hall, OL16 1AZ. Lunch plates \u00a310; main courses \u00a314 \u2013 \u00a321; desserts \u00a35; afternoon tea \u00a321. Evening menu: three courses \u00a335. Wines from \u00a322 a bottle It\u2019s easy to imagine the ways by which the Martlet in Rochdale could have gone so very wrong; how the perceived demands of civic responsibility and the innate grinding conservatism of bureaucracy could have resulted in a dull, mediocre offering for the town. It wouldn\u2019t even have been worth rolling your eyes at. It would have been understandable. The Martlet is a new restaurant inside Rochdale\u2019s magnificent Town Hall. Since 2021, the building has undergone an equally magnificent restoration, to bring this slab of Victorian gothic revival by William Henry Crossland, into a golden, glowing focus. There is finely chiselled stonework, stained-glass windows and wood-panelled chambers with intricate foliage-strewn wall coverings recalling the work of William Morris. Ceiling panels are decorated with branch and leaf, upon which perch fully plumed peacocks and illustrations of the martlet, a mythical bird that was forever on the wing. Whatever you do, make time to drift slack-jawed through these chambers. Perhaps while wearing a pale, lace-fringed linen smock dress and kohl eyeliner. I could rock that look. Such a new civic amenity needed some sort of food and drink outlet. They could have installed a modish and frankly annoying pan-European small plates bistro that nobody wanted. Or it could have been a bog-standard coffee and cake job. The Martlet does have the latter covered. There is good coffee and cake available here. But it is so much more. It\u2019s a broad offering drawing on the heritage of Greater Manchester in a smart, witty and generous way, and all at the sort of prices that will make those used to shaking down their bank accounts for a bit of lunch, sigh deeply. Head chef Darren Parkinson grew up locally and trained at Hopwood Hall College just four minutes\u2019 walk away, before a career which took him to France, Winteringham Fields in Lincolnshire and the Shibden Mill Inn near Halifax. Now he\u2019s back home with a menu that touches many bases. You can come early for a full English, or a Bombay breakfast of fried eggs, mango chutney, onion bhajis and flatbreads. At lunchtime there\u2019s a list of platters for \u00a310, a couple of which have the echo of that imagined small plates bistro. There\u2019s a soft herb risotto with truffled nuts and pecorino, or a salad of pickled beetroot, radishes and goat\u2019s cheese dressed with white balsamic. Substitute tofu to make it vegan. It all sounds lovely, but I\u2019m here for the boulder of breadcrumb-crusted Scotch egg, made with Bury black pudding, with the heft of white pepper. Cut in and the yolk runs away. Underneath is a thick bed of their own piccalilli, which has crunch and softness, sweetness and acidity. It\u2019s a class piece of work. Or get the sausage roll, which arrives sliced into five finger-ready pieces. The puff pastry is as inflated as a peacock\u2019s tail feathers, and each piece is topped by a properly spicy curry sauce ketchup. Swipe away at any that\u2019s left over with the very good chips. To one side of the menu is a panel entitled Rochdale Town Hall Classics, all for \u00a314. Alongside fish and chips, which come with Manchester caviar (mushy peas, of course), there\u2019s a bacon chop with more of the Bury black pudding and, joy of joys, a rag pudding. If you\u2019ve not encountered one before, it\u2019s a parcel-shaped pie, named because of the way the suet pastry is hand-folded over the filling to make it look like a bundle of the cotton rags which once underpinned the region\u2019s industrial economy. It encloses a thick, gooey filling of both braised and minced beef. The flaky pastry has the crack you get only with animal fats and it sits in a knee-depth reservoir of gravy so glossy you could check your hair and make up in the reflection. With it are crisp-edged hasselback potatoes and minted garden peas, with more depth and maturity than their petit brethren. (A quick aside: the first time I met the great Manchester chef Rob Owen Brown, I asked him why he listed his grilled Barnsley chop as coming with little peas. \u201cBecause you\u2019re in Manchester,\u201d he said, tartly. \u201cThey\u2019re not petit pois. They\u2019re little peas.\u201d) From the grills section comes a Gloucester Old Spot pork chop for \u00a317, which more than matches the rag pudding for value. It is the thickness of a copy of Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals and just as satisfying. There is a seared ribbon of fat at its back, guaranteed to sustain you through a Rochdale winter, and it comes with cherry tomatoes, roasted on the vine until they are just about to burst lasciviously from their skins. There are wedges of sweet-sour apple which maintain their structural integrity and a goblet of thick-cut chips. There are roasted carrots and portobello mushrooms and another of the meaty sauces the kitchen has nailed.

      "body": "<p>Sonia Sodha makes an excellent point about the assisted dying bill in saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we can prevent people choosing assisted suicide because they feel they are a burden or would rather pass money on to their kids than spend it on care.\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/17/the-assisted-dying-debate-charles-falconer-and-the-observers-sonia-sodha-tackle-the-issues\">The assisted dying debate: Charles Falconer and the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s Sonia Sodha tackle the issues</a>, Focus) We couldn\u2019t, and that deserves more attention. </p> <p>Huge numbers of Britons would die voluntarily, refusing to be a trouble to others and to burden the state, if assisted dying became legal. We live in a society acutely aware of the pressures faced by the NHS, and the sense of being a burden would be felt the most keenly by the most helpless. If the assisted dying bill were to pass, they would know that all they had to do to end the feeling of guilt would be to die. The only sufficient safeguard for the vast majority of us is the law as it stands. It also motivates us to ask for better palliative solutions \u2013 and motivates the medical community to seek them.<br><strong>Marina Bowder</strong><br>Steventon, Abingdon, Oxfordshire</p> <p>As leaders of faith communities we wish to express our concern at the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, which will be debated by MPs on 29&nbsp;November. We are aware of how complex and weighty this topic is. There are many dimensions to the bill, all of them of great ethical and practical importance. We hold in prayer all those across our country who may be personally affected, and our representatives in parliament with profound decisions before them.</p> <p>Part of the role of faith leaders in communities is to provide spiritual and pastoral care for the sick and for the dying. We hold the hands of loved ones in their final days, we pray with families both before and after death. It is to this vocation that we have been called, and it is from this vocation that we write.</p> <p>Our pastoral roles make us deeply concerned about the impact the bill would have on the most vulnerable, opening up the possibility of life-threatening abuse and coercion. This is a concern we know is shared by many people, with and without faith.</p> <p>In the UK, it is estimated that 2.7 million older people have been subjected to abuse; many of these may also be vulnerable to pressure to end their lives prematurely. Disability campaigners and those working with women in abusive relationships have also highlighted the danger of unintended consequences should the law be changed. The experience of jurisdictions that have introduced similar legislation, such as Oregon and Canada, demonstrate how tragic these unintended consequences can be. Promised safeguards have not always protected the vulnerable and marginalised.</p> <p>Even when surrounded by loving family and friends, people towards the end of their life can still feel like a burden. This is especially the case while adult social care remains underfunded. In this environment, it is easy to see how a \u201cright to die\u201d could all too easily end in feeling you have a duty to die.</p> <p>We are convinced that the current law provides much greater security for those who are vulnerable than the bill before parliament. A bill which MPs will have had only three weeks to scrutinise before they vote on it. The most effective safeguard against life-threatening coercion or abuse is to keep the law as it is.</p> <p>In supporting the state of the current law, we do not deny that some people experience a painful death, though we welcome the fact that these deaths are far less common than they used to be due to advances in palliative care.</p> <p>Over decades, we have witnessed how compassionate care, along with the natural processes of dying, allow those at the end of their life to experience important moments. We have seen relationships repair and families reconcile. We have seen lives end in love. Much can be lost by cutting these processes short.</p> <p>We believe that a truly compassionate response to the end of life lies in the provision of high-quality palliative care services to all who need them. While there are many examples of excellent palliative care in this country, it remains worryingly underfunded. Investment in palliative care is the policy of a truly compassionate nation. It is the way to ensure that everyone in society, including the most vulnerable, receive the care they deserve at the end of life.</p> <p><strong>Dame Sarah Mullally</strong>, Bishop of London, Church of England lead bishop on health and social care, and former Chief Nursing Officer; <strong>Cardinal Vincent Nichols</strong>, Archbishop of Westminster; <strong>Sir Ephraim Mirvis</strong>, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth; <strong>Sayed Abdul Saheb Al-Khoei</strong>, Secretary General of Al-Khoei Foundation; <strong>Angaelos</strong>, Archbishop of London, Coptic Orthodox Church; <strong>Qari Asim</strong>, Imam and Chair of MINAB (Mosques and Imams Advisory Board); <strong>Glyn Barrett</strong>, National Leader of Assemblies of God; <strong>Anil Bhanot</strong>, Managing Trustee of the Hindu Council UK; <strong>Gavin Calver</strong>, CEO of Evangelical Alliance; <strong>Helen Cameron</strong>, President of the Methodist Conference and Moderator of the Free Churches Group; <strong>Malcolm Deboo</strong>, President, Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe; <strong>Joseph Dweck</strong>, Senior Rabbi of the Spanish and Portuguese Sephardi Community; <strong>Pinchas Hackenbroch</strong>, Chair of the Rabbinical Council of the United Synagogue; <strong>Ross Hendry</strong>, CEO of CARE (Christian Action, Research and Education); <strong>Trevor Howard</strong>, Executive Vice-Chair of the Board, Churches in Communities International; <strong>Andrew John</strong>, Archbishop of the Church in Wales; <strong>Nikitas Lulias</strong>, Archbishop of Great Britain, Greek Orthodox Church; <strong>Paul Main</strong> and <strong>Jenine Main</strong>, Territorial Leaders of The Salvation Army in the United Kingdom and Ireland; <strong>Patrick McKinney</strong>, Bishop of Nottingham, Roman Catholic Church; <strong>Zara Mohammed</strong>, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain; <strong>Bhai Sahib Mohinder Singh Ahluwalia</strong>, Spiritual Leader and Chair, Guru Nanak Nishkam Sewak Jatha; <strong>Trupti Patel</strong>, President of the Hindu Forum of Britain; <strong>Mark Pugh</strong>, General Superintendent of Elim Pentecostal Churches; <strong>Mehool Sanghrajka</strong>, Chair of the Institute of Jainology; <strong>Bogoda Seelawimala</strong>, President of Sri Lankan Sangha Sabha of Great Britain; <strong>Lord Singh of Wimbledon</strong>, Director of the Network of Sikh Organisations UK; <strong>Jonathan Wittenberg</strong>, Senior Rabbi of Masorti Judaism; <strong>Mar Awraham Youkhanis</strong>, Bishop of London, Assyrian Church of the East. </p> <p>The worry that assisted dying legalisation might allow people to be \u201ccoerced, pressured or nudged into killing themselves\u201d is misplaced. </p> <p>Legalisation makes this less likely because it brings openness and requires two doctors and a judge to be sure that the terminally ill patient genuinely wants to die a few months early. Contrast that with the current situation where any assisted dying has to be given in secret with no professional approval or oversight. Generally, people giving assistance are not prosecuted, so the current law does not stop assisted dying from happening, it just prevents safeguards from being in place.<br><strong>Richard Mountford</strong><br>Hildenborough, Kent</p> <p>We write in support of the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill 2024. Our current law does not serve to safeguard the sanctity of life. By criminalising assisted suicide, it can cause people to end their lives before they require help to do so. Our law does not protect weak and vulnerable people: it requires people to take decisions about their end of life out of sight, alone and without the help of professionals. It encourages dangerous and traumatic attempts at suicide and denies many people dignity and autonomy in how they live out their final months of life.</p> <p>The bill will protect the vulnerable and the sanctity of life much more effectively than our current law. It will allow terminally ill people in the last six months of their life to make free, informed and settled decisions about their end of life through a robust process involving two doctors and a judge. The bill will strengthen the role of the criminal law: assisting suicide will remain an offence other than where assistance is offered through the new formal process. New offences will also be created. There is no reason to suppose litigation will broaden the ambit of the bill: every decision of the European court of human rights and of our domestic courts has said that this is an area which is a matter for parliament in which courts will not interfere.</p> <p>It is time for the sake of the vulnerable, for the sake of safeguarding the primacy of human life, and for the sake of constitutional good order that the law is reformed, and that decisions about end of life are brought out of the shadows.</p> <p><strong>Alex Goodman KC</strong>; <strong>Lord Falconer PC KC; Lord Ken Macdonald KC; Sir Max Hill KC; Lord Pannick KC; Richard Drabble KC; James Maurici KC; Carine Patry KC; Stephanie Harrison KC; Sonali Naik KC; Tim Owen KC; David Wolfe KC; Phillippa Kaufmann KC; Nick Armstrong KC; Chris Buttler KC; Zoe Leventhal KC; Stephen Cragg KC; Joe Middleton KC; Adam Straw KC; Philip Havers KC; Michael Mansfield KC; Professor Philippe Sands KC; Jolyon Maugham KC; Rebecca Hill; Maria Scotland; Alice Goodenough; Susan Ring; Sue Willman; Toufique Hossain; Jamie Beagent; Richard Stein; Dan Rosenberg; Charlotte Beck; Chris Bishop; Rachel Fletcher; Sara Chandler KC; Andrea Coomber KC; Prof Richard Moorhead</strong></p> <h2 data-note-id=\"2a606e00-0ed9-4bee-b76c-fad0a165d992\" data-type=\"subhead\">More should follow Welby</h2> <p>I read Helen King\u2019s article about safeguarding with sadness and weary familiarity (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/17/cover-up-of-child-abuse-in-church-of-england-tried-to-protect-the-work-of-twisted-theology\">Cover-up of child abuse tried to \u2018protect the work\u2019 of a twisted theology\u2019\u2009</a>\u201d, Focus)</p> <p>I am a member of my church\u2019s governing committee and was once a victim of sexual abuse by a predatory man who abused his church connections and my mother\u2019s good nature to target me.</p> <p>For too long, the shame of sexual abuse has stuck to innocent victims.

We are aware of how complex and weighty this topic is. There are many dimensions to the bill, all of them of great ethical and practical importance. We hold in prayer all those across our country who may be personally affected, and our representatives in parliament with profound decisions before them. Part of the role of faith leaders in communities is to provide spiritual and pastoral care for the sick and for the dying. We hold the hands of loved ones in their final days, we pray with families both before and after death. It is to this vocation that we have been called, and it is from this vocation that we write. Our pastoral roles make us deeply concerned about the impact the bill would have on the most vulnerable, opening up the possibility of life-threatening abuse and coercion. This is a concern we know is shared by many people, with and without faith. In the UK, it is estimated that 2.7 million older people have been subjected to abuse; many of these may also be vulnerable to pressure to end their lives prematurely. Disability campaigners and those working with women in abusive relationships have also highlighted the danger of unintended consequences should the law be changed. The experience of jurisdictions that have introduced similar legislation, such as Oregon and Canada, demonstrate how tragic these unintended consequences can be. Promised safeguards have not always protected the vulnerable and marginalised. Even when surrounded by loving family and friends, people towards the end of their life can still feel like a burden. This is especially the case while adult social care remains underfunded. In this environment, it is easy to see how a \u201cright to die\u201d could all too easily end in feeling you have a duty to die. We are convinced that the current law provides much greater security for those who are vulnerable than the bill before parliament. A bill which MPs will have had only three weeks to scrutinise before they vote on it. The most effective safeguard against life-threatening coercion or abuse is to keep the law as it is. In supporting the state of the current law, we do not deny that some people experience a painful death, though we welcome the fact that these deaths are far less common than they used to be due to advances in palliative care. Over decades, we have witnessed how compassionate care, along with the natural processes of dying, allow those at the end of their life to experience important moments. We have seen relationships repair and families reconcile. We have seen lives end in love. Much can be lost by cutting these processes short. We believe that a truly compassionate response to the end of life lies in the provision of high-quality palliative care services to all who need them. While there are many examples of excellent palliative care in this country, it remains worryingly underfunded. Investment in palliative care is the policy of a truly compassionate nation. It is the way to ensure that everyone in society, including the most vulnerable, receive the care they deserve at the end of life.

The worry that assisted dying legalisation might allow people to be \u201ccoerced, pressured or nudged into killing themselves\u201d is misplaced. Legalisation makes this less likely because it brings openness and requires two doctors and a judge to be sure that the terminally ill patient genuinely wants to die a few months early. Contrast that with the current situation where any assisted dying has to be given in secret with no professional approval or oversight. Generally, people giving assistance are not prosecuted, so the current law does not stop assisted dying from happening, it just prevents safeguards from being in place. Richard Mountford Hildenborough, Kent We write in support of the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill 2024. Our current law does not serve to safeguard the sanctity of life. By criminalising assisted suicide, it can cause people to end their lives before they require help to do so. Our law does not protect weak and vulnerable people: it requires people to take decisions about their end of life out of sight, alone and without the help of professionals. It encourages dangerous and traumatic attempts at suicide and denies many people dignity and autonomy in how they live out their final months of life. The bill will protect the vulnerable and the sanctity of life much more effectively than our current law. It will allow terminally ill people in the last six months of their life to make free, informed and settled decisions about their end of life through a robust process involving two doctors and a judge. The bill will strengthen the role of the criminal law: assisting suicide will remain an offence other than where assistance is offered through the new formal process. New offences will also be created. There is no reason to suppose litigation will broaden the ambit of the bill: every decision of the European court of human rights and of our domestic courts has said that this is an area which is a matter for parliament in which courts will not interfere. It is time for the sake of the vulnerable, for the sake of safeguarding the primacy of human life, and for the sake of constitutional good order that the law is reformed, and that decisions about end of life are brought out of the shadows.

For too long, the shame of sexual abuse has stuck to innocent victims. It belongs to the perpetrators, and those who could have stopped them but didn\u2019t. Let\u2019s hope this unprecedented decision of an archbishop to resign leads to others named in the Makin report to have the decency to follow Justin Welby\u2019s lead. Instead of making prompt and necessary changes to improve safeguarding, I fear the Church of England will revert to its usual agonisingly slow decision-making processes that don\u2019t seem to serve anyone. I hope I am proved wrong. Name and address supplied Farmers and inheritance tax Will Hutton articulated the good reasons why this tax should be introduced (\u201cFarmers have hoarded land for too long. Inheritance tax will bring new life to rural Britain\u201d, Comment). As always, farmers are never happy. While in the EU, they complained all the time about how the EU was not in their best interests. A large proportion of farmers then voted for Brexit. They are still not happy about any restrictions to exports. They are also not happy with the new system of funding for farmers. Now they are complaining about the introduction of inheritance tax. We all have to contribute to society and the reforms Labour is introducing will go towards the benefit of all people. Edna Johnston Newmarket, Suffolk As a farmer, I have worked seven days a week, rarely taken holidays, have had to rely on diversified income streams to pay the mortgage and any surplus has been invested in the farm, which was ultimately going to be sold to provide a house and a pension. At 80 acres, it is probably worth in excess of \u00a31m, but it is more of a lifestyle than provider of a living. As a first-generation farmer, I could never have afforded to increase the acreage sufficiently to create a viable operation, and operating with scattered fragments of land is inefficient. I would like to invite Hutton to spend some time on the farm. Jonathan Murray Westerdale, Whitby, North Yorkshire The curse of celebrity authors In regard to Catherine Bennett\u2019s article, the huge advances paid to celebrity \u201cauthors\u201d drains the pool of money that publishers have to pay other, full-time authors (\u201cThere is a moral in Jamie Oliver\u2019s story of stereotypical folk, just not one he intended\u201d, Comment). I made a reasonable living writing more than 100 books for children, but couldn\u2019t do it now because the money offered to middle-ranking authors has shrunk as the advances paid to celebrities have risen. When I retired I was being offered the same advances as at the start of my career 35 years earlier. Richard Platt Hastings, Kent Oxford tutors\u2019 gig economy Anna Fazackerley is right about the Uberisation of academic staff (Oxford relying on \u2018Deliveroo-style\u2019 contracts with most tutorials not taught by full-time staff, News). Three main factors are at work. One, the corporatisation of the university has replaced the horizontal \u201crepublic of tutors\u201d with a gulf between highly paid professors and senior managers and a reserve army of staff on casual contracts. Two, the sleight of hand that allows the temporary replacement of a permanent academic whose six or eight hours\u2019 tutorial teaching per week (plus two courses of university lectures per year) is counted as full time, while the equivalent offer by non-permanent academics is counted as part time. Three, colleges do not recognise the University and College Union. Robert Gildea, Professor Emeritus of Modern History University of Oxford A single market is the key The lesson from Brexit for any government is the danger in making undeliverable promises and raising false hopes (\u201cCloser ties with the EU is lever for economic growth\u201d, Editorial). Labour needs to be transparent about the realistic, achievable economic benefits of its planned reset with the EU. As the editorial states, \u201cachieving sufficient alignment to have meaningful impact on GDP could take years\u201d. Whereas alignment is imperative, the economic benefits, although worthwhile, will inevitably be small in relation to the real game-changer: rejoining the single market or customs union. David Newens Great Linford, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire Tackling social anxiety Social anxiety and shyness are on a continuum: the former is more intense and persistent (\u201cAsk Philippa: I find it hard to make friends \u2013 now my daughter does, too\u201d, Observer Magazine, 10 November). For those experiencing such problems, there are treatments available, including within the NHS Talking Therapies programme, and cognitive behavioural therapy. People with social anxiety do not usually lack social skills, but anxiety can prevent them from expressing themselves naturally in situations they find difficult. We believe there should be more awareness of this treatable mental health problem. Sarah Peacey, trustee, Social Anxiety Alliance, London N14 All at sea in the Colosseum Wendy Ide thinks the idea of sharks in the Colosseum is silly (Gladiator II review \u2013 Paul Mescal fends off sharks, rhinos and a scenery-chewing Denzel Washington, New Review). However, aquatic games (naumachia) were common in Roman amphitheatres, although they were generally naval battles. The Romans weren\u2019t familiar with sharks; catching and transporting them to Rome would have been problematic, but no harder than flooding and draining the Colosseum.

Using Candide\u2019s experiences, Voltaire critiques the overly optimistic philosophy of the time. Like Candide, you too speak of a world marred by destruction and cruelty, and you are not mistaken. Although the forms of absurdity may change, the essence remains: human folly and suffering.</p> <p>Candide\u2019s master is Pangloss who argues that \u201cAll is for the best in the best of all possible worlds,\u201d of which Voltaire takes a dim view. You, like Candide, are not comforted by this hollow optimism. The death of nature, the cruelty of men, increasingly extreme weather, these are not trifles to be dismissed with the wave of a philosophical hand. </p> <p>I cannot offer you the false balm of easy answers. What I can offer, however, is this: the world has ever been thus. The great and the small, all have trampled on one another in their greed, ignorance and pursuit of power.

      "bodyText": "The question I am finding it ever more difficult to be in this nasty world. Everything that I cherish is being destroyed and there is nowhere to go to find solace. I\u2019ve always loved nature \u2013 but when I go for a walk now, I see every ash tree dying, I hear the loss of birdsong, I see how few insects there are. When I read the news, I just cannot comprehend how cruel humans are able to be, racism, misogyny, religious hate, cruelty to animals\u2026 The list is endless. I work in climate change and am having to pretend every day that there is still a chance we can prevent catastrophic climate change. I find it ever harder to be around people who don\u2019t get just how bad things are. I don\u2019t have kids and am single. I can\u2019t talk to my family about it because they are rightwing, wealthy climate sceptics. They patronise me (despite the fact I\u2019m nearly 60 and a chief executive). If I look to the future, I imagine how difficult it is going to be when food supplies are more affected by environmental crisis. People fought over toilet rolls during Covid \u2013 multiply that by 100 and apply it to food. I don\u2019t want to face all this horribleness on my own. I\u2019ve had lots of chances at relationships, but don\u2019t want fear of the future to be the basis of one. In the meantime, I am trying to keep a lid on it, trying to dissociate my feelings, pretending all the bad stuff isn\u2019t happening. When what I really want to do is scream my head off at everyone. Planet Earth is so beautiful, so incredible, I cry with the pain of what we are doing to it and to each other. How am I supposed to remain feeling in this fucked up world? Philippa\u2019s answer In his novel Candide, or Optimism, first published in 1759, Voltaire tells us of a young man who experiences a great deal of hardship and suffering. Using Candide\u2019s experiences, Voltaire critiques the overly optimistic philosophy of the time. Like Candide, you too speak of a world marred by destruction and cruelty, and you are not mistaken. Although the forms of absurdity may change, the essence remains: human folly and suffering. Candide\u2019s master is Pangloss who argues that \u201cAll is for the best in the best of all possible worlds,\u201d of which Voltaire takes a dim view. You, like Candide, are not comforted by this hollow optimism. The death of nature, the cruelty of men, increasingly extreme weather, these are not trifles to be dismissed with the wave of a philosophical hand. I cannot offer you the false balm of easy answers. What I can offer, however, is this: the world has ever been thus. The great and the small, all have trampled on one another in their greed, ignorance and pursuit of power. In the end, Voltaire decided, we are left with but one solution: to cultivate our own garden. I do not mean this literally, though your love of nature might lend itself well to such a task. I mean, rather, that you must focus on what is within your power. The world, with all its evils, is vast and terrible, but there is a corner of it that you can tend, that you can preserve with your heart and your mind. The despair you feel because of the dying of the ash trees and the lessening of birdsong, the dwindling number of insects, these are the signs of your capacity to love the world. Do not deny that love. Let it be the fire that drives you to act, not the burden that crushes you. Yes, we face a calamitous future, but does that not make our efforts, however small, even more necessary? As for the cruelty of men and your mention in your longer letter of your horror at the likes of Trump, well, what is a tyrant but a grotesque clown, a farcical reflection of humanity\u2019s darker nature? He, like all despots, will pass. The earth will continue, wounded perhaps, but enduring. As well as Pangloss the optimist, there is another character in the novel, Martin. He surrenders to despair, just like you are doing at the moment. I do not offer you Pangloss\u2019s optimism but, and this is the important bit, do not surrender to despair like Martin the pessimist does. Martin\u2019s pessimism stems from his life experiences. He has suffered greatly, which reinforces his belief that life is dominated by suffering rather than joy. Instead, I urge you, like Candide, to find your own way, to act where you can and to care deeply for those who share your values. The world will continue to be absurd, but you, with all your passion, your intellect, and your sorrow, can still make your corner of it more bearable.

      "body": "<p>With Donald Trump the very meaning of words is up for negotiation. What does he really mean when he promises to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d? When he pledges to end the Russo-Ukrainian war in one day?</p> <p>His supporters say they don\u2019t take him literally but seriously \u2013 but who decides what \u201cserious\u201d is? The very ambiguity can be part of Trump\u2019s appeal. There\u2019s something exhilarating in the sense one is in an exclusive negotiation with the president to define reality. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s welcoming you backstage from the reality show of politics to the discreet board room where meaning is made.</p> <p>Thus both pro-Palestinians and supporters of Israel annexing the West Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/17/rightwing-settlers-in-israel-welcome-dream-team-of-trump-and-his-hardline-appointments\">voted for Trump</a>, each perfectly aware he was playing footsie with the other, but each hoping they can strike a deal with him. Meanwhile leaders in Moscow, Kyiv and across the world are wondering how they will make sense of Trump\u2019s promise to wrap up one of the greatest conflicts in Europe since the second world war.</p> <p>Trump speaks of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/09/trump-world-order-election-win-fears-combustible-us-foreign-policy\">peace through strength</a>\u201d, \u201cwinning\u201d and putting \u201cAmerica first\u201d. But does \u201cstrength\u201d come from America acting as benign protector? It could, for example, mean guaranteeing air defence for Ukraine so that nuclear facilities are safe from stray Russian bombs, thus stopping a potential nuclear catastrophe from devastating the world. Or does \u201cstrength\u201d mean forcing Ukraine to give up its sovereignty?</p> <p>In Moscow no one is in any huge rush to deal. Putin feels he\u2019s winning on the battlefield. The economy is starting to sweat \u2013 food prices up 9% every month; interest rates at over 20% \u2013 but it\u2019s not in crisis yet. Putin will run out of some critical Soviet era military equipment towards the end of 2025; so he might start negotiations early next year but keep fighting until closer to the end of it, increasing attacks on civilians whenever the negotiations don\u2019t go the way he likes.</p> <p>How will Trump deal with these negotiations Putin-style? Russia has always demanded a demilitarised Ukraine under the Kremlin\u2019s de facto political control. There are people around Trump who might agree to this \u2013 especially if Russia severs its military relationship with China. But would Putin ditch his strategic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/16/vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-announce-plans-strengthen-military-ties-beijing\">partnership with Xi</a> for an erratic America?</p> <p>Even sacrificing contacts with Tehran might be a poor deal for Putin. He could, however, see in Trump and his entourage a version of his own kleptocracy. Maybe a mysterious bidder will offer outlandish sums for a Trump golf course? Or help Elon Musk fly to Mars? One would hope that in such a case it\u2019s Putin who would be delusional.</p> <p>And what can Ukraine offer? In leaked memos from Zelenskyy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/trump-zelenskyy-meet-high-stakes-ukraine-talks-new-york\">meeting with Trump before the election</a>, the Ukrainian president stressed Ukraine\u2019s vast stores of critical minerals that Americans lack, such as titanium, which is used for everything from rockets to joint replacements. But is this enough of a carrot to inspire Trump?</p> <p>Whether the fighting pauses this year or not, Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty depends on its being armed to the teeth. For the next two years at least, argues Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute, this will be hard without American artillery and logistics.</p> <p>Though Trump has said he will bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, the people who he might actually end up negotiating with in earnest are the Europeans and Britain. We are the ones who can offer something interesting. Trading incentives for America. Greater spending on Nato. More pressure on Iran. \u201cPeacekeeping\u201d boots on the ground inside Ukraine. Help in the upcoming US economic skirmishes with China.</p> <p>If the EU and UK seize the $300bn of Russian state assets sitting in Euroclear, money Putin has long written off, we can bring serious funding to the table.

      "bodyText": "With Donald Trump the very meaning of words is up for negotiation. What does he really mean when he promises to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d? When he pledges to end the Russo-Ukrainian war in one day? His supporters say they don\u2019t take him literally but seriously \u2013 but who decides what \u201cserious\u201d is? The very ambiguity can be part of Trump\u2019s appeal. There\u2019s something exhilarating in the sense one is in an exclusive negotiation with the president to define reality. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s welcoming you backstage from the reality show of politics to the discreet board room where meaning is made. Thus both pro-Palestinians and supporters of Israel annexing the West Bank voted for Trump, each perfectly aware he was playing footsie with the other, but each hoping they can strike a deal with him. Meanwhile leaders in Moscow, Kyiv and across the world are wondering how they will make sense of Trump\u2019s promise to wrap up one of the greatest conflicts in Europe since the second world war. Trump speaks of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d, \u201cwinning\u201d and putting \u201cAmerica first\u201d. But does \u201cstrength\u201d come from America acting as benign protector? It could, for example, mean guaranteeing air defence for Ukraine so that nuclear facilities are safe from stray Russian bombs, thus stopping a potential nuclear catastrophe from devastating the world. Or does \u201cstrength\u201d mean forcing Ukraine to give up its sovereignty? In Moscow no one is in any huge rush to deal. Putin feels he\u2019s winning on the battlefield. The economy is starting to sweat \u2013 food prices up 9% every month; interest rates at over 20% \u2013 but it\u2019s not in crisis yet. Putin will run out of some critical Soviet era military equipment towards the end of 2025; so he might start negotiations early next year but keep fighting until closer to the end of it, increasing attacks on civilians whenever the negotiations don\u2019t go the way he likes. How will Trump deal with these negotiations Putin-style? Russia has always demanded a demilitarised Ukraine under the Kremlin\u2019s de facto political control. There are people around Trump who might agree to this \u2013 especially if Russia severs its military relationship with China. But would Putin ditch his strategic partnership with Xi for an erratic America? Even sacrificing contacts with Tehran might be a poor deal for Putin. He could, however, see in Trump and his entourage a version of his own kleptocracy. Maybe a mysterious bidder will offer outlandish sums for a Trump golf course? Or help Elon Musk fly to Mars? One would hope that in such a case it\u2019s Putin who would be delusional. And what can Ukraine offer? In leaked memos from Zelenskyy\u2019s meeting with Trump before the election, the Ukrainian president stressed Ukraine\u2019s vast stores of critical minerals that Americans lack, such as titanium, which is used for everything from rockets to joint replacements. But is this enough of a carrot to inspire Trump? Whether the fighting pauses this year or not, Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty depends on its being armed to the teeth. For the next two years at least, argues Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute, this will be hard without American artillery and logistics. Though Trump has said he will bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, the people who he might actually end up negotiating with in earnest are the Europeans and Britain. We are the ones who can offer something interesting. Trading incentives for America. Greater spending on Nato. More pressure on Iran. \u201cPeacekeeping\u201d boots on the ground inside Ukraine. Help in the upcoming US economic skirmishes with China. If the EU and UK seize the $300bn of Russian state assets sitting in Euroclear, money Putin has long written off, we can bring serious funding to the table. Trump does not need to spend any more money on Ukraine \u2013 we can buy the weapons. America can even make a profit while securing peace in Europe. Trump would be able to show how he got those parasitic Europeans to cough up, prove his detractors wrong by rebooting America\u2019s most traditional alliances \u2013 all while putting \u201cAmerica first\u201d.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jacob-elordi\">Elordi</a></strong>, I wouldn\u2019t be mad,\u201d says <strong>Milla</strong>, one of the spectators of Saturday\u2019s Jacob Elordi lookalike competition, which is occurring on the lawn of the State Library of Victoria in the middle of a heatwave. The only thing hotter than the weather, apparently, is Australian actor Jacob Elordi.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The dating pool in Melbourne is not that great. I think that he is a very attractive man, and if you look like him, then you are also an attractive man.\u201d Another spectator, fanning themselves furiously as they wait for the contest to start, tells me that while they aren\u2019t a fan of his acting, they like \u201cfree events\u201d and want to \u201csee some hot guys\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, as time passes, it becomes increasingly clear that the couple of dozen attendees might be out of luck: there\u2019s not only a conspicuous absence of anyone who looks like Jacob Elordi, but any men at all to compete for the $50 prize.</p> <p>Elordi is not the first young handsome white man to have a look alike contest \u2013 in fact, in the great Australian tradition of being slightly behind every cultural trend, he joins the tail end of the phenomenon. The somewhat baffling movement, reminiscent of the flashmob debacle from the naughties but hornier and sillier, began in October with a <strong>Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet</strong> lookalike competition in New York. What started as an event poster affixed to a lone streetlight quickly went viral, with YouTuber Anthony Po eventually incurring a $500 fine for hosting the event, which featured not only more than 300 contestants and an arrest, but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet himself.</p> <p>In case you missed it, read <strong>Patrick</strong> <strong>Lenton\u2019s</strong> full write up on the Jacob Elordi look-a-like contest in Melbourne yesterday:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/23/jacob-elordi-lookalike-competition-melbourne-state-library\">\u2018I don\u2019t look like him at all, I\u2019m just tall\u2019: Jacob Elordi lookalike crowned in Melbourne</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-24T04:29:37.425Z\">at 4.29am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6742a21d8f086501868e86df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-24T04:01:21.215Z\">4.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Education minister orders review into school bullying</strong> </p> <p>A review has been ordered into bullying in Australian schools to stamp out the pervasive behaviour and better safeguard students.</p> <p>The federal education minister, <strong>Jason</strong> <strong>Clare</strong>, wrote to state and territory counterparts to push for a united effort to deal with bullying in classrooms and school yards.</p> <p>He recommended a short expert-led examination of current school procedures and best practice methods to address bullying.</p> <p>The study will be funded by the Albanese government and report back to education ministers with options on developing a national bullying standard.</p> <p>In the letter, Clare said the study would:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inform policies across jurisdictions and sectors to provide children and parents confidence that no matter where their child goes to school, if they\u2019re experiencing bullying, it will be managed in an appropriate way.</p> </blockquote> <p>It comes after Year 7 student <strong>Charlotte</strong> <strong>O\u2019Brien</strong>, 12, took her own life in September after allegedly being bullied at Sydney\u2019s Santa Sabina College.</p> <p>Clare conceded bullying doesn\u2019t just happen in schools but they were places where authorities could intervene and provide support for students.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Bullying is not on, anywhere, anytime, in any form.

Before we go, here are the major stories from Sunday: Labor has dropped its mis- and disinformation bill and announced it will put gambling ad reform on hold. The shadow communications minister has attacked the government for \u201ccraven inaction\u201d on gambling ads. Rising Tide has continued its protest with hundreds of people paddling out into the Port of Newcastle to block incoming coal ships. NSW police say they have arrested 138 protesters during the action. Indonesia has agreed to allow the surviving Bali Nine prisoners to return to Australia in a yet to be finalised deal between the two countries. Labor says the convicted drug smugglers would \u201clikely\u201d be required to serve out their sentences in Australia if returned. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has said a social media ban for under 16s will have no effect and will \u201cdrop them in the deep end\u201d when they turn 16; A Victorian pill-testing trail will begin at Beyond The Valley music festival this summer. We\u2019ll pick things up again tomorrow. Clearance rate ticks up on quieter weekend for auctions Auction activity has fallen this weekend with 2,577 auctions to be held. This is a drop on the 2,898 held last week, and a figure lower than the 2,949 auctions that occurred at the same time last year. Based on results collected so far, CoreLogic\u2019s summary found that the preliminary clearance rate was 65.3% across the country, which is higher than the 64.1% preliminary rate recorded last week but well above the 57.3% actual rate on final numbers. Across the capital cities: Sydney: 699 of 984 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 68.4% Melbourne: 784 of 1,111 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 65.2% Brisbane: 176 0f 233 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 56.8% Adelaide: 80 of 143 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 66.3% Canberra: 55 of 91 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 52.7% Tasmania: No auctions held. Perth: Six of 15 auctions held. All eyes on CPI data as inflation fight continues Inflationary pressures in the economy likely stabilised at the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s target range last month, data due this week could show. But progress on underlying measures, which strip away volatility and are the focus of the central bank, is tipped to be less subdued and consistent with interest rates staying on hold at the next board meeting in December. The October consumer price index numbers from the Australian Bureau of Statistics due on Wednesday will be watched closely. While not as comprehensive as the quarterly releases, the monthly numbers still provide a steer on the potency of price pressures. Australians might hear more on the outlook for interest rates on Thursday, when the RBA governor Michele Bullock gives a speech at the annual CEDA Conference in Sydney. Other data to be released by the ABS includes quarterly updates on construction work, due on Wednesday, and business investment, on Thursday. - AAP \u2018I don\u2019t look like him at all, I\u2019m just tall\u2019: Jacob Elordi lookalike crowned in Melbourne \u201cIf I saw someone who looked like Jacob Elordi, I wouldn\u2019t be mad,\u201d says Milla, one of the spectators of Saturday\u2019s Jacob Elordi lookalike competition, which is occurring on the lawn of the State Library of Victoria in the middle of a heatwave. The only thing hotter than the weather, apparently, is Australian actor Jacob Elordi. The dating pool in Melbourne is not that great. I think that he is a very attractive man, and if you look like him, then you are also an attractive man.\u201d Another spectator, fanning themselves furiously as they wait for the contest to start, tells me that while they aren\u2019t a fan of his acting, they like \u201cfree events\u201d and want to \u201csee some hot guys\u201d. Unfortunately, as time passes, it becomes increasingly clear that the couple of dozen attendees might be out of luck: there\u2019s not only a conspicuous absence of anyone who looks like Jacob Elordi, but any men at all to compete for the $50 prize. Elordi is not the first young handsome white man to have a look alike contest \u2013 in fact, in the great Australian tradition of being slightly behind every cultural trend, he joins the tail end of the phenomenon. The somewhat baffling movement, reminiscent of the flashmob debacle from the naughties but hornier and sillier, began in October with a Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet lookalike competition in New York. What started as an event poster affixed to a lone streetlight quickly went viral, with YouTuber Anthony Po eventually incurring a $500 fine for hosting the event, which featured not only more than 300 contestants and an arrest, but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet himself. In case you missed it, read Patrick Lenton\u2019s full write up on the Jacob Elordi look-a-like contest in Melbourne yesterday: Education minister orders review into school bullying A review has been ordered into bullying in Australian schools to stamp out the pervasive behaviour and better safeguard students. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, wrote to state and territory counterparts to push for a united effort to deal with bullying in classrooms and school yards. He recommended a short expert-led examination of current school procedures and best practice methods to address bullying. The study will be funded by the Albanese government and report back to education ministers with options on developing a national bullying standard. In the letter, Clare said the study would: Inform policies across jurisdictions and sectors to provide children and parents confidence that no matter where their child goes to school, if they\u2019re experiencing bullying, it will be managed in an appropriate way. It comes after Year 7 student Charlotte O\u2019Brien, 12, took her own life in September after allegedly being bullied at Sydney\u2019s Santa Sabina College. Clare conceded bullying doesn\u2019t just happen in schools but they were places where authorities could intervene and provide support for students. Bullying is not on, anywhere, anytime, in any form. Just like we are taking action to help stop bullying on social media, we also can do more where children are face to face. - AAP Meta is \u2018reckless\u2019 in \u2018need-to-know situations\u2019, Canada warns Australia as it braces for early bushfire season Twelve months on from Canada\u2019s worst-ever wildfire season unfolding during a news blackout on Facebook, the nation has warned Australia about Meta\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d behaviour during \u201cneed-to-know situations\u201d. An early start to Australia\u2019s bushfire season is looming for swaths of the country, with large parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory, the south-west of Victoria and south-east corner of South Australia facing higher risk, according to an official assessment in September. In August 2023, negotiations between the tech company and Canada\u2019s government broke down as Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals doggedly pursued news bargaining deal C-18, known as the Online News Act \u2013 similar to the one struck in Australia in 2021 following a seven-day news blackout. The breakdown in negotiations resulted in Meta blocking all news sources on Facebook in Canada \u201crecklessly and dangerously\u201d as all 10 provinces and three territories in the country burned, Canada\u2019s heritage minister, Pascale St-Onge, told Guardian Australia. Facebook is leaving disinformation and misinformation to spread on their platform, while choosing to block access to reliable, high-quality, independent journalism. Facebook is just leaving more room for misinformation during need-to-know situations like wildfires, emergencies, local elections and other critical times for people to make decisions on matters that affect them. For more on this story, read the full report by Guardian Australia\u2019s Tory Shepherd: Construction firm involved in sediment breach says it takes environmental responsibilities \u2018seriously\u2019 As noted in an earlier post, Adco, a construction firm, is facing the maximum $30,000 fine issued by the NSW EPA after endangering a rare fish. Adco\u2019s managing director Neil Harding tells Guardian Australia that the firm \u201ctakes its environmental responsibilities seriously and responded vigilantly at all times to address identified erosion and sediment issues, in partnership with its specialist consultant and civil works subcontractor\u201d. The company said it had taken \u201cexpert advice\u201d from the outset of the school project to minimise the risk of sediment releases. However the project \u201cwas impacted by the extreme rainfall events in the half of 2024 and other extenuating circumstances\u201d, and the firm had installed additional stormwater filtration treatment works. \u201cWe are now in the process of reviewing the EPA\u2019s determination and will respond in due course,\u201d he said. Protest group Rising Tide says it has successfully turned back a coal ship from the Port of Newcastle Hundreds of people have been taking part in a week-long protest at the Port of Newcastle, one of the biggest coal export ports in the world, to protest Australia\u2019s continued export of fossil fuels and to call for a fossil fuel export tax. The group says more than 100 protesters have occupied the shipping channel in Newcastle Harbour as a climax to the week-long protest. The protest coincides with the conclusion of negotiations at the COP meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan. Police have made over 100 arrests. Newcastle local and Rising Tide organiser Alexa Stuart said the success came despite attempts by the New South Wales government \u201cto shut down our peaceful blockade\u201d. We are taking urgent action because the problem is urgent. Right now, Australians are facing increasing floods, bushfires, heatwaves, and rising sea levels are already washing away communities in the Torres Strait. We have drawn a clear line in the sand here on the shores of Newcastle Harbour. The people are rising, and we won\u2019t stop until the Albanese Government stops approving climate-wrecking coal and gas which threatens our lives and those of future generations. Naomi Shine, who survived the 2022 Lismore flood, said that experience motivated her to participate. I\u2019m here to say no to coal. I\u2019m fed up with government inaction. They are totally captured by the fossil fuel industry. Our communities deserve better. The only hope I get is getting together with people to say no to fossil fuels and yes to life. Victorian premier says her \u2018heart breaks\u2019 for young Victorian women who died in Laos Allan is also asked about the deaths of two young Victorian women who died while holidaying in Laos from a suspected methanol poisoning. She says: My thoughts, sympathies and heart breaks for Holly [Bowles] and Bianca [Jones\u2019] families and friends and loved ones. It is just heartbreaking to see the tragic death of these two beautiful, vibrant young women who were on an adventure of a lifetime. To have it end in this tragic and terrible way is deeply distressing. It has been distressing for many members of the Victorian community to read and hear the news coming out of Laos and Thailand, and I would fully support whatever steps need to be taken for this to be fully investigated. Obviously, these are matters that will be led by the Department of Foreign Affairs, and our focus will be on supporting Holly and Bianca\u2019s family, they\u2019ve got a really, really awful time ahead of them as they prepare to say goodbye to their beautiful young women. And so where we can provide support for their family, we stand ready to do so. Possibility of Labor candidate at Prahran byelection is up to federal Labor party, Allan says Jacinta Allan is asked about a byelection in the seat of Prahran, which was sparked yesterday by ex-Greens MP Sam Hibbins, who resigned after an affair with a staffer. She says: In terms of the circumstances that have brought us to seeing a byelection in Prahran, that is obviously a question for the Greens political party and their departing member for Prahran. Ultimately, it will be up to the Prahran electorate to determine who represents them \u2013 who replaces the outgoing former Greens representative, Sam Hibbins \u2013 in that seat. Asked whether she would like to see Labor run a candidate, she says: Those decisions are a matter for the Australian Labor party \u2026 We have a significant majority already in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. She goes on to say she is focused on \u201cgetting on with the job the Victorian community elected us for\u201d. When Hibbins resigned on Saturday, he said he had referred \u201cunauthorised access\u201d to his parliament office to police and parliamentary services. He allegedly said \u201cpersonal items, including family and my children\u2019s baby photos, were vandalised with offensive and threatening graffiti\u201d. Asked whether this concerned her, Allan said: I don\u2019t know the circumstances behind those claims that have been made. Obviously, every individual who works in the parliamentary precinct, whether you\u2019re a member of parliament or a member of staff, everyone deserves the right to a safe and respectful workplace. Everyone deserves that, and we are strengthening that framework; we are soon to appoint \u2026 the first of the parliamentary integrity commissioners who will oversee a much strengthened, accountability framework for members of parliament. David Coleman, who wouldn\u2019t normally get this much time in front of a camera, is using this press conference to flay the Albanese government for their end of year approach. The end of the year is coming, not with a bang but with a whimper. We have seen today the misinformation bill die its inevitable death. We have seen the prime minister leak to the media his craven inaction on gambling advertising, and we see a whole range of other legislation that is just all over the place. People have to ask the question: what is the point of the Albanese government? What do they stand for? Coleman repeatedly sought to frame the Albanese government as \u201cweak\u201d and indecisive, in contrast with the \u201cstrong\u201d and decisive leadership of Peter Dutton who is \u201cwiling to stand up and take a firm position and say what he would do.\u201d PM \u2018cowers in the corner\u2019 on issue of gambling, shadow communications minister says Coleman has also accused Anthony Albanese of being \u201cscared\u201d of confrontation after he abandoned an effort to make changes to the rules that govern gambling advertising. He is scared of gambling advocates like Tim Costello. He is scared of the AFL, the NRL and the media companies. So what does he do? He cowers in the corner and does nothing, and that is a shocking indictment on the weakness of this prime minister. Most people in Australia accept that there is a need for action on gambling advertising. Shadow communications minister says disinformation and misinformation bill \u2018should never have been put forward\u2019 The shadow communications minister, David Coleman, has welcomed the withdrawal of the government\u2019s disinformation and misinformation bill, but says it should never have been introduced. This bill should never have been put forward. The fact the government spent 18 months trying to get this attack on free speech to become the law of Australia is a disgrace so it tells you everything you need to know about the values of this government. This is a bill that united pretty much everyone in Australia in opposition. Australia has no constitutionally protected right to free speech, but Australians do have an implied right to political communication. New South Wales police say they have arrested over 100 people who have attended a protest organised by Rising Tide in Newcastle. Police report 138 arrests for refusing to comply with a direction to move away from the channel and say the police operation remains ongoing. For their own safety and that of the other users of the port, police request that people refrain from entering the harbour with the intention to obstruct other users of the port. We also encourage all participants to follow the directions of police. Police say they will take a \u201czero-tolerance approach to actions which threaten public safety and the safe passage of vessels.\u201d Allan is asked how police will monitor Beyond the Valley. She says: I know that the Department of Health and Victoria police have been working very, very closely together to implement this trial. The legislation provides for access to the pill testing service to be provided in a confidential way, in a legal way outside of that service, the responsibilities of Victoria police remain in place, and it remains illegal to be in possession or to take illicit drugs. But this is also something that we know has worked in Queensland ... we know that this can be achieved where you continue to respect the operational decisions of Victoria Police but provide a safe and legal space for this pill testing to be provided. Pill testing to be offered at 10 music festivals over next two summers Victorian mental health minister, Ingrid Stitt, says over the course of the 18-month trial, pill testing services will be offered at five festivals this summer and five in 2025-26. She\u2019ll have a list of all festivals this summer \u201csoon\u201d: Stitt says: My department\u2019s been working closely with the festival organisations and peaks, and we\u2019ve been trying to make sure that we\u2019ve got a good mix of different sorts of festivals, both regional and metropolitan, bearing in mind that this is a trial, and we want to make sure that we\u2019re broadly testing how this will go in different settings. Pill testing chief say teams will be able to identify \u2018almost anything\u2019 Cameron Francis, chief executive of The Loop Australia, is talking through how pill testing will work at Beyond The Valley. He says the team will work from 1pm to 7pm each day of the four-day festival using equipment that can \u201cidentify and quantify almost anything that comes forward\u201d. He says: The equipment we\u2019ll be using down here in Victoria means we can test basically everything. So we\u2019ll be using equipment that can identify and quantify all kinds of substances \u2013 pills, powders, liquids. Two types of equipment will be used \u2013 four infrared machines and two GC-MS machines (or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). Francis says the former is speedy while the latter can detect even small amounts of deadly substances. He says: The infrared instrument is very quick. It can get us a result in a couple of minutes. It\u2019s not able to quantify though. It can\u2019t tell us purity, and if we get below 5% concentration, we might not be able to detect traces. So because of that, we\u2019re using portable GC-MS on site at the festival. That\u2019s really advanced equipment that is used in sort of military settings. It\u2019s really advanced and it can detect basically anything that we might be trying to find there. So using a combination of equipment means that we\u2019ll be able to detect pretty much anything that comes forward. He says MDMA purity is the group\u2019s \u201cbiggest concern\u201d over the summer. We know that globally, MDMA purity has increased, and we know that when that purity increases, there\u2019s risks of overdose. So the GC-MS will be focused on our MDMA purity so we can give people that accurate information to try and reduce the risks of overdose. More on Beyond The Valley pill testing In 2019, a 20-year-old man died in hospital days after suffering a suspected drug overdose at the Beyond The Valley festival. While there were fewer events in the following years due to Covid, paramedics responded to more drug overdoses at festivals in the first three months of this year than during all of 2023. At least one young person died, and eight people were placed in medically induced comas, due to overdoses over the summer. Victoria\u2019s mental health minister, Ingrid Stitt, says We\u2019re really delighted that we will be out at Beyond The Valley as the first festival for drug checking. It is a very large festival, and it\u2019s important that during this trial, we actually test how the operation is going in lots of different settings. The four-day festival at Beyond The Valley is a really great example of where we have a very large scale music festival across four days, and we can provide this as an additional service to the already comprehensive first aid and medical infrastructure that is in place at Beyond The Valley, a very experienced music festival in Australia. Beyond The Valley music festival will be the first in the state to trial a pill testing service. The Victorian government has announced Beyond The Valley music festival will be the first in the state to trial a pill testing service. The premier, Jacinta Allan, says the four-day festival, located in the Golden Plains shire, will be the \u201clargest-ever event\u201d in Australia to provide access to pill testing. The festival runs from 28 December until 1 January, with about 35,000 expected to attend. A consortium \u2013 made up of the Youth Support and Advocacy Service, The Loop Australia and Harm Reduction Victoria \u2013 will provide the service, with support from Melbourne Health, Youth Projects and Metabolomics Australia (part of the University of Melbourne). Allan says the service will be completely confidential and will use \u201cworld-leading technology\u201d to test pills, powders and liquids for the presence of deadly substances. She says a fixed pill testing site will also be established and open by mid-2025 in inner Melbourne, close to nightlife and public transport. Pill testing will become permanent in Victoria after the 18-month trial. Nine other festivals will be selected over the coming months for on-site pill testing. Allan says: If a young person has a pill in their hand, they\u2019re intending to take it. We know that pill testing saves lives. We know too, and I firmly believe this, that young people deserve to have access to health-focused information to help support them, to help give them the right advice, to help get them to make perhaps a better choice that supports them and their friends. And if young people are looking for this advice, we should provide this advice to them. This is just a simple and common sense way that we can support young people and we know can help save lives. Michaelia Cash says Albanese should \u2018stand up and explain\u2019 details of potential Bali Nine deal with Indonesia The shadow attorney-general, Michaelia Cash, says the Albanese government should explain the status of any deal with Indonesia that could allow the remaining members of the Bali Nine drug smugglers to return to Australia, with senior members of the government staying quiet at this stage. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday morning, Cash said: Given it is such a significant decision, I think it\u2019s almost inexplicable that Mr Albanese has not stood up in front of the Australian people and explained exactly what he\u2019s done. Guardian Australia understands the government is not talking about any potential arrangement that may be in the works, due to the sensitive nature of the issue, despite Reuters reporting an Indonesian minister said a deal was in the works and could include the repatriation of Indonesian prisoners held in Australia. Ministers Don Farrell and Stephen Jones have declined to weigh in during media appearances over the last 24 hours. Cash said the government should be speaking publicly about the situation. Given this seems to have escalated over the last 24 hours, it is now for prime minister Albanese to stand up in the front of the Australian people and say, What is the deal? What has he extracted in relation for the deal? What is Australia giving up in relation to the deal? How much is it going to cost the Australian taxpayer? Will they continue to serve their prison sentences because they have been sentenced to life imprisonment in Indonesia? Will they continue to serve them out in Australia \u2013 and if not, why not? Government sources said such negotiations were often sensitive and delicate. Adding to the tension is the fact Australia doesn\u2019t have a prisoner transfer agreement with Indonesia, which could make any prisoner swap quite legally challenging. The trade minister, Don Farrell, speaking to Sky News on Sunday morning, said the government was in discussion with its Indonesian counterparts to hammer out the detail concerning how the surviving Bali Nine might be returned to Australia. Farrell said the prisoners will continue to serve their sentences in Australia. The proposal isn\u2019t, as I understand it, to release these people. They would continue to serve their sentence, except they\u2019re serving them in Australia. - AAP NSW EPA fines construction firm for possible wipe-out of ancient fish Back in February, we reported on the bungled construction work at a government high school that may have snuffed out a fish with a 90m-year heritage in the Sydney region. The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority tells us (exclusively) they have slapped the Forest high school contractor ADCO Constructions with a maximum penalty of $30,000 for discharging sediment-laden water into the local stormwater system that flowed into the Curl Curl Creek. We\u2019ve asked the EPA if they know what happened to the last remaining climbing galaxias freshwater fish in that creek. Locals, such as Malcolm Fisher, from the Save Manly Dam Catchment Committee, say the Galaxias brevipinnis is cryptic and may have perished. \u201cWater pollution incidents of this nature have the potential to jeopardise their delicate natural habitat,\u201d said Jason Gordon, the EPA\u2019s executive director of operations. At the time of the incident, adequate onsite pollution controls were not in place at the construction site, which is unacceptable. As for the impacts, the agency \u201chas not received any reports\u201d the fish has been harmed, but Fisher (an apt name) says it would be better if the EPA actually studied the damage. Also, that $30,000 fine might be more better spent on helping to rehabilitate the creek and protecting remaining the wildlife rather than bolstering EPA\u2019s coffers. Michael Regan, the independent state MP for the area, agreed, saying the fine proceeds should be invested back into environmental projects at Manly Dam. \u201cManly Dam is a jewel of the northern beaches and I take any threat to the environmental values of the dam extremely seriously,\u201d said Regan, who was formerly the region\u2019s mayor. As intense rain events become more frequent with climate change, we need to increase sediment run-off protections in our planning system approvals. Guardian Australia approached ADCO for comment. A few high profile figures will be at Sunday\u2019s Rising Tide protests in Newcastle \u2013 former Socceroos captain Craig Foster and author Melissa Lukashenko. The federal Greens leader, Adam Bandt, will also join the protest, alongside federal Greens senator David Shoebridge and NSW legislative council member Sue Higginson. Man arrested over alleged Nazi salute in Sydney A man has been arrested for displaying a Nazi salute after he allegedly attempted to interrupt a protest march in Newtown, Sydney with the gesture and other threats on Saturday. Police attending the planned rally arrested the 20-year-old man, who was not associated with the event, after he allegedly stepped in front of the march to make the salute and make threats to the participants. He has been charged with knowingly display by public act Nazi symbol without excuse and make a gesture in a public place that is a Nazi salute. The man was granted strict conditional bail to appear before Newtown local court on 14 January 2025. Melbourne gets a soaking as cool change sweeps south-east South-eastern Australia is off to a wet start on Sunday with Melbourne being drenched. The rains follow a cool change moving eastwards across the country, ending the hotter temperatures that stretched from the south-east to the centre of the continent. The mercury in Melbourne is expected to reach 22C on Sunday, with heavy rain. Hobart was similarly cool but dry with temperatures expected to reach 20C. Meanwhile, hotter temperatures are expected to persist further north towards Sydney and through parts of New South Wales. The mercury is expected to remain high across much of the rest of the country with Brisbane forecast to hit 28C, Darwin to reach 32C with storms and Perth hitting a toasty 33C. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, says the government will not bring its misinformation and disinformation bill to the upper house as \u201cit is clear that there is no pathway to legislate this proposal through the Senate\u201d. In a statement on Sunday, Rowland said the Coalition had chosen \u201cto place partisanship above any attempt to navigate the public interest\u201d despite having \u201ccommitted to legislating safeguards when in Government\u201d. The Government invites all Parliamentarians to work with us on other proposals to strengthen democratic institutions and keep Australians safe online, while safeguarding values like freedom of expression. It is incumbent on democracies to grapple with these challenges in a way that puts the interests of citizens first. Rowland said going forward the government will focus on legislating to strengthen existing offences targeting the sharing of non-consensual and sexually explicit deepfakes, truth in advertising for elections reforms, and regulation of artificial intelligence. Mis and disinformation is an evolving threat and no single action is a perfect solution, but we must continue to improve safeguards to ensure digital platforms offer better protections for Australians. The Australian government is staying mum at this stage on reports the remaining members of the Bali Nine will be allowed to return home and leave Indonesian prison. Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong\u2019s offices are not giving comment at this point. We understand the Albanese government has been advocating for their release for some time, with appeals made to Indonesian presidents Widodo and Subianto, including as recently as last week from Albanese directly. The government is unlikely to make public comment while those conversations continue. Government minister Stephen Jones said yesterday at a press conference that he was aware of reports but declined to comment. I can confirm that the Albanese government has been consistently advocating for the cases of the Bali Nine. This included conversations with former President Widodo and President Prabowo on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Peru recently. I don\u2019t intend to comment further on these issues, but I can confirm that the Albanese government has consistently advocated for the cause of these men. Two bits of news from the communications portfolio this morning. Michelle Rowland says the government will drop entirely its bill on mis- and disinformation, which had attracted no new support in the Senate, and was about to fail (more on that shortly). The bill will be dropped after Rowland conceded it would not pass. Separately, the wait for the government\u2019s gambling ad legislation will continue. That reform won\u2019t be seen this week of parliament, Guardian Australia understands, and it\u2019s unclear when it will finally be seen. The government has been equivocating over how to respond to the report from the late Labor MP Peta Murphy, who had called for a total ban on online gambling ads \u2013 but a year and a half on, the government\u2019s response is still in the \u201cto be confirmed\u201d column. \u2018Cruel and heartless\u2019 for Coalition to question bringing Bali Nine members home, Hanson-Young says Hanson-Young finishes up the interview by reacting to comments from the Coalition questioning the wisdom of the government\u2019s move to secure the return of the Bali Nine to Australia. I mean \u2013 cruel and heartless, frankly. Cruel and heartless. And if you want a glimpse of what a Peter Dutton government will look like, this is it. Don\u2019t be fooled by Dutton in lamb\u2019s clothes. And that\u2019s a wrap. Greens dropping climate trigger demand on nature positive laws about \u2018getting some good stuff done\u2019 Asked about the Greens\u2019 change of tack on the introduction of the government\u2019s nature positive laws \u2013 where the party has dropped its demand for a climate trigger to be introduced, a proposal that the Labor government has refused \u2013 Hanson-Young says the party is aiming to be pragmatic. You can work with the Greens to get some good stuff done, or you can work with Peter Dutton that will empower him and give him more of a platform. And I think that that is dangerous. The senator says the Greens want the government to commit to ending native forest logging to secure their support. We\u2019ve put aside our demands around the climate trigger because it was very clear that the prime minister was not going to budge on that. So you had to win votes in WA. Fight at the election and we\u2019ll come back after the new parliament. But if you want a watchdog in place, give them rules to implement to protect nature. Hanson-Young says she is concerned that if the government doesn\u2019t come to the table, there is a chance Anthony Albanese may no longer be prime minister after the next election. Let\u2019s make sure that there are laws in place that actually protect nature before it is gone. Hanson-Young: Labor and Coalition \u2018squibbing it\u2019 by prioritising social media ban over gambling reform On news that the government is seeking to abandon the misinformation and disinformation bill \u2013 my colleague Josh Butler has more on that shortly \u2013 Hanson-Young says she welcomes the decision to withdraw the bill. The senator says the bill was poorly designed, contained carve-outs for news media and would result in \u201cputting Elon Musk in charge of truth\u201d. We\u2019ve got to get back to the real problem. And that is how these companies profit off the dangerous posts. You want to stop the dangerous posts spreading like wildfire \u2013 hit them where it hurts, and that\u2019s the dollar. On gambling ads, Hanson-Young says Labor and the Coalition are \u201csquibbing it\u201d by refusing to address \u201cthe harm that is done to Australian families every year because of gambling addiction\u201d. The government and the opposition are ramming through a ban on social media that was introduced on Thursday. We\u2019ve got a joke of a Senate inquiry for three days tomorrow. But they can\u2019t do gambling. I mean, really \u2013 talk about priorities. \u2018This is so that the oldies can feel like the prime minister cares about their kids\u2019 Hanson-Young says the urgency behind the social media ban is political. The prime minister wants to end the year with Peter Dutton to say, look, folks, you won\u2019t have kids sitting on their phones at Christmas. That\u2019s what is going on here. And I was listening to a very astute, the words of a very astute 15-year-old this morning who said, you know, this is so that the oldies can feel like the prime minister cares about their kids. Hanson-Young says that those behind the push for the social media ban do care but the policy itself was \u201cfool\u2019s gold\u201d. Hanson-Young: Australia should \u2018have the guts\u2019 to prohibit tech companies selling personal data to advertisers Asked about research that suggest social media is having a negative impact on the mental health of teenage that is leading to more hospitalisation, Hanson-Young says it is necessary to \u201cengage with young people, put in place safe places online for them\u201d. Yes, we have to deal with the mental health issues. Yes, we have to deal with social isolation. Yes, we have to make sure that young people know when something is wrong and raise a hand and say \u201ccan someone come and help me\u201d. But you don\u2019t do that by prohibition. The senator says that dealing with the issue requires \u201ctaking away the profitability of the tech companies\u201d. To achieve this, Hanson-Young says she wants to \u201cprohibit the scraping and the collection of the data of all young people that is then sold to advertising\u201d to \u201cstop that dangerous content being rammed down their throats\u201d. Hanson-Young says what is needed is to impose a duty of care on social media companies to protect kids. Australia should work out how we make these platforms safer for everybody. Really hit these tech companies where it hurts. That\u2019s their business model. Have the guts to do that. Have the guts to hold them to account. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young says the government\u2019s social media ban for kids under 16 is a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d that \u201cwon\u2019t make being on the internet for kids or young people safe, or anyone, for that matter.\u201d I\u2019m a mum. I\u2019ve got a teenage daughter. She just graduated this week from year 12. Hi, darling. I know what it\u2019s like to be as a parent, trying to work out where the limits are. How do you educate? How do you put in place some safety mechanisms? How do you have a conversation with your kids about what is going on and are they able to see the red flags? But just kicking young people off social media until they\u2019re 16 and then dropping them in the deep end with no guardrails, no lifeguards, no skills to deal with it, is really not the answer. Hanson-Young says \u201cwe\u2019ve got to do better at making online safer for everyone\u201d but that \u201cprohibition isn\u2019t going to help that\u201d. Indonesia has agreed to return to Australia the five remaining members of the so-called Bali Nine drug smuggling ring who are currently serving life sentences in the south-east Asian country, an Indonesian minister said on Saturday. It will also seek the repatriation of Indonesian prisoners held in Australia, the law minister, Supratman Andi Agtas, told Reuters on Saturday. Anthony Albanese raised the prisoner issue during a meeting with Indonesia\u2019s president, Prabowo Subianto, on the sidelines of the Apec summit in Peru, the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, said in a press conference on Saturday. Earlier this week, Indonesia confirmed Mary Jane Veloso, a Filipina woman on death row for drug trafficking in a separate case, would be allowed to serve the rest of her sentence in her home country. She was alone among a group of condemned convicts to receive a last-minute stay of execution in 2015 after Philippine officials asked Indonesia to let her testify against members of a human- and drug-smuggling ring. The rest, including two ringleaders of the Bali Nine, were executed by firing squad. \u201cThis is the president\u2019s discretion, but in principle, the president has agreed on humanitarian grounds,\u201d Supratman said. France has also requested the repatriation of a prisoner, he said. Jakarta has no set procedures regarding international prisoner transfer but will work on the matter as soon as possible, Supratman said, stressing that the counterpart country must recognise Indonesia\u2019s judicial process. This is important to maintain a good relationship with friendly countries. But this is also in our interest because we have prisoners abroad. \u2013 Reuters A planned blockade of the world\u2019s biggest coal port is stretching into a third day after multiple people involved in a paddle protest were arrested and removed from their kayaks on Saturday. Officers told protesters to move away from a shipping channel due to safety concerns after they tried to disrupt coal ships at the Port of Newcastle. A woman, 26, and two men, 27 and 59, were arrested on Saturday and charged with not complying with a direction by an authorised officer relating to safety. Several others were \u201cassisted by police when they struggled to return to shore\u201d, police said. Event organiser Rising Tide claimed a total of nine people were arrested on Saturday. An 84-year-old great-grandmother, 16-year-old student and a doctor were among those pulled from their kayaks by police after they went out into shipping lanes, the group said. NSW police said their operation would continue on Sunday and warned they had a \u201czero-tolerance approach\u201d to actions that threatened the safe passage of vessels, with unlawful activity attracting fines and imprisonment. - AAP The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young will speak to the ABC Insiders host, David Speers, this morning. The shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, has also appeared on Sky News. We will bring you all the latest as it happens. And welcome to another Sunday Guardian live blog. The surviving members of the Bali nine will return home to Australia in a deal brokered by Anthony Albanese on the sidelines of Apec, the Indonesian law minister, Supratman Andi Agtas, told Reuters. The five remaining members of the group are currently serving life sentences and will likely be expected to continue to serve a portion of their sentence in Australia. Three people have been charged in protests at the Port of Newcastle seeking to block the export of coal. Two men and a woman have been granted conditional bail. Thousands are expected to join a flotilla as protests continue on Sunday morning. I\u2019m Royce Kurmelovs and I\u2019ll be taking the blog through the day. With that, let\u2019s get started ...",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. Here\u2019s Tom Dart\u2019s full report off Orlando\u2019s final win. So ends a banner season for the NWSL, which has far outlived its predecessor leagues in the USA and is now poised to outspend most European clubs for the world\u2019s top talent. The league has strong owners (in most cities) and solid facilities, and it has agreed with its players union to shore up the salaries that were once barely at \u201cstipend\u201d level. Next year\u2019s favorites would likely be the Spirit. But the California teams will surely roar back into contention, Kansas City has world-class talent, and Gotham FC has the front office to ensure contender status for years to come. Thanks for following along tonight. See you next time. Give credit first to Orlando, especially goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse and the indomitable attack of Banda and Marta. This game was decided by two outstanding plays \u2013 Banda\u2019s smooth finish and Moorhouse\u2019s point-blank save. The first word that springs to mind for Washington is \u201cunlucky.\u201d Croix Bethune, Andi Sullivan and Ouleymata Sarr were out injured. Some of the officiating in this final was \u2026 we\u2019ll say \u201cidiosyncratic.\u201d At the same time, watching the last 40 minutes in particular, it felt like the Spirit could\u2019ve spent the next week dribbling at Pride defenders and still not getting anything in the net. It just wasn\u2019t happening tonight for whatever reason. Ashley Hatch in particular struggled, getting only a few touches and squandering them, though one clanged off the post. Her young teammates will have games in which they make better decisions on the ball or make better runs. So for neutrals, that probably wasn\u2019t a lot of fun, given the sense of inevitability through so much of the game after the controversial goal. For Spirit fans, it\u2019s a dagger to the heart. But the Pride are a superb team, assembled by their sharp VP Haley Carter and coach Seb Hines. And if they want to celebrate by yelling, \u201cI\u2019m going to Disney World,\u201d they don\u2019t have to go very far. Well, that was a soccer game. Kingsbury gets a head to it. A lunging teammate accidentally plays it out. Goal kick. We\u2019re in minute 9. Credit to the ref for adding the stoppage time to stoppage time. 90 min +7: Frantic Spirit attack here. Rodman wins a corner. Kingsbury comes forward. Christina Unkel says it\u2019s not a foul. I have no idea how she arrived at that conclusion. 90 min +5: Surely that\u2019s a penalty? Kouassi is brought down in the penalty area. Replay shows \u2026 yes, that\u2019s a foul. Surely this is being checked \u2026 90 min +4: Banda is down for unknown reasons after tangling with Carle. I think she initiated most of that. Marta doesn\u2019t seem to mind that more time is ticking off the clock. Cynical stuff here. 90 min +2: If the whistle blows after six minutes of stoppage time, remember how much time the Spirit lost tending to Hatch there. Rodman gets the ball forward and passes to Silano, who drags a shot well wide. 90 min: We\u2019ll have six minutes of stoppage time, and Spirit supporters believes it should start with a penalty kick. They chant \u201cVAR.\u201d But there\u2019s nothing in it. Hatch and Gautrat were leaning on each other and slipped. Now Hatch is taking a lot of time on the ground, and Marta comes up to yell at the ref for \u2026 allowing the Spirit to waste time while down a goal in stoppage time? What? Does this make any sense? 89 min: Rodman centers it to Carle, but the onrushing Spirit player can\u2019t handle it. McKeown hits a soft back pass toward Kingsbury, who has to play it awkwardly away from Banda. 88 min: Kouassi takes an ill-advised shot. Two defenders had covered every angle to the goal, and she doesn\u2019t even knock the ball off them for a corner. 86 min: Orlando brings in some subs. One-time USWNT phenom Morgan Gautrat replaces Angelina. Carson Picketts replaces Abello. 85 min: Washington keep hammering away. Santos has a decent go at it from just inside the area. The rebound eludes all the pressing Spirit players. Can they conjure one more late equalizer this season? 84 min: It\u2019ll be another corner to the Spirit, as Kouassi slams the ball off an Orlando defender\u2019s leg. This is low and easily cleared. 83 min: Orlando play ahead to Banda, who makes some nifty moves to relieve the pressure on the Pride and give them a brief spell of possession. 81 min: The Spirit play ahead to Rodman, who can\u2019t find a way past US teammate Sams but wins a corner kick. The corner kick lands in the top of the net. It just feels like it\u2019s not the Spirit\u2019s night. 80 min: All of the stats favor Washington. Shots: 16-8. Possession: 57-43. Shots on goal: 5-3. Total passes: 304-229. And so on and so on. It\u2019s still 1-0 Orlando. 78 min: Gabby Carle rushes forward and pings the ball off two Orlando defenders out of play. Inexplicably, it\u2019s a goal kick. Again \u2013 I referee a bit, and it\u2019s a very difficult job, but that\u2019s just not good. 76 min: Banda commits another foul \u2013 that\u2019s 16 by the Pride. A persistent infringement yellow card would be the last thing Orlando wants here. Spirit supporters are helpfully calling out how many seconds Moorhouse is holding on to the ball. Don\u2019t they know that Abby Wambach is the only person who has ever convinced a ref to call the seldom-called infraction on a goalkeeper keeping the ball too long? 74 min: We\u2019ve officially hit the late stages of the game. Kingsbury comes up from the Washington goal to take a free kick, and Orlando\u2019s Ally Watt is down \u201cinjured.\u201d She\u2019s replaced by Julie Doyle. Lena Silano has entered the game for Washington, replacing Morris. 73 min: While McKeown is treated, the camera picks out basketball Hall of Famer Grant Hill \u2013 oddly enough, a member of the Orlando ownership group even though he hails from Reston, Va., not far from DC. 70 min: The Spirit are winning every battle in midfield. The Pride are winning every battle in their own penalty area. McKeown is fouled and is down in apparent considerable pain. Banda gets yellow. 68 min (still): Krueger gets the ball in space down the left, but she rushes a pass that\u2019s too far ahead of anyone in yellow. 68 min: Another cross to Hatch, another header, too easily saved by Moorhouse. 66 min: Kouassi poses a threat on the right this time, and Emily Sams races back to play it out for a corner. The corner sails over everyone, but the Spirit reclaim possession. 65 min: Santos stretches out a foot to send a through ball to Hatch, but the ball gets tangled in the Spirit forward\u2019s feet, and she can\u2019t get a clean shot away. Uncharacteristic. Adriana heads out, replaced by Summer Yates. 64 min: Adriana holds the ball for an eternity. Orlando may have weathered the Spirit storm here. 61 min: First sub of the game \u2013 Gabby Carle replaces Metayer. Finally the first shot of the half from the Pride, but it\u2019s nowhere near. But the second one is considerably more dangerous, as Banda goes right at Carle and dishes the ball to Marta, whose diagonal shot rolls past the far post. 58 min: Metayer gets forward and sends in a cross that literally pings around among several defenders. Orlando break the other way, and McKeown does well to hold off Banda despite some rather blatant foul attempts by the game\u2019s lone scorer. But the Spirit earn a free kick in the other half. Moorhouse does well to leap and collect the ball in traffic. 56 min: Morris finds a channel to run through with the ball, but she can\u2019t slip a pass to Rodman. Dominant display from the Spirit since halftime, but they still have nothing to show for it. 53 min: The Spirit are playing like circling sharks now. There are almost too many yellow-shirted players lining up to take shots within the Orlando penalty area. One shot deflects wide for a corner; the ensuing shot on that corner goes wide. 49 min: Free kick to the Spirit, almost on the end line a few yards outside the penalty area. Hatch rises to meet it, but her glancing header is too glancing. (Is \u201ctoo glancing\u201d actually proper English usage? It should be.) Metayer commits a petulant foul with a late tackle on Adriana as the Pride counter. 47 min: HUGE SAVE BY MOORHOUSE! My goodness, how did the Orlando keeper stop that one? Great work by Rodman to battle on the flank, and a cross finds Kouassi rising above the crowd. Her header is goalbound to Moorhouse\u2019s right, but it\u2019s punched away with a lightning-quick reaction save. Second half is underway \u2026 Washington\u2019s fans traveled well for this one. I live in the DC metro area \u2013 Spirit supporters will not be happy if this ends 1-0. Though the Spirit may feel aggrieved on the goal, they can only blame themselves for not getting more shots on target. Only one of their eight shots has required a save. Hatch\u2019s header off the post was their best chance by a wide margin. On the balance of the season, Orlando have been the best team in the NWSL. They\u2019d certainly be worthy champions. But we have to hope there\u2019s another goal in this one, one way or the other. It\u2019d be a pity to end such a great season on such a dubious decision. 45 min +4: We\u2019ll have five minutes of desultory action in stoppage time. Online reaction to the non-call in the buildup to the Orlando goal can best be described as \u201chuh?\u201d 44 min: CHANCE FOR WASHINGTON. We haven\u2019t mentioned Ashley Hatch much in this game, but she nearly equalized there, putting a header off the post on a Washington corner. A few seconds later, Rodman wins the ball and blazes a trail through midfield before shooting high. 43 min: Marta shows her brilliance once again, finding a sliver of space past Krueger to fire toward goal from an acute angle. Probably wouldn\u2019t have gone in from that angle, but it would\u2019ve traversed through the penalty area about a foot from the goal line, so Kingsbury does well to swat the ball away. 42 min: Yellow card to Hal Hirshfelt for having her studs out on a late challenge. Hard to argue with that one. 41 min: Veteran referee Christina Unkel often sheds a good bit of clarity on refereeing decisions on NWSL broadcasts, but I can\u2019t follow this explanation in the least. It\u2019s a \u201csimple foul,\u201d which means it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of being overturned by VAR? Did I get that right? The Spirit rallied in the semifinal. Can they do it again? Rodman gets her head to a long, high cross, but she can\u2019t direct it on frame. Angelina gets away with a rather blatant shove, but that shouldn\u2019t detract from the quality of Banda\u2019s finish here. She cuts back against Morgan and rips the shot off the outside of Kingsbury\u2019s shin and in. Against the run of play, and perhaps a bit unfair given the shove, but it\u2019s a good example of what Banda can do. 35 min: The Spirit dial up the pressure and force Orlando to make some awkward passes very deep in their own end. Washington eventually take possession at midfield but can\u2019t unlock the Pride defense. 33 min: CHANCE FOR WASHINGTON! Kouassi ventures to the top of the penalty area and unleashes a shot that zips just wide. The Spirit follow up with a high cross that Moorhouse can barely grab out of the sky. An Orlando counterattack sees a player without the ball hitting the ground, but no replay is shown to let us know how that happened. 31 min: NOW Abello has a card for clipping the heels of the racing Rodman. Orlando coach Seb Hines believes it was a dive, and he might have a point. But she should have seen yellow for her last challenge, so it evens out. 29 min: Marta\u2019s free kick is too short to pose any questions of the Spirit defense. 26 min: Bit of a lull at the moment. I\u2019ve found no comment on the Rodman no-call on referee forums \u2013 everyone is either not watching or too riveted to talk. But NOW Rodman is fouled, and Jonatan Giraldez wants a card. He has a point. Whether you call it by the old-fashioned \u201cprofessional foul\u201d or the snazzier \u201cSPA\u201d (stopping a promising attack), that fit the bill. Instead, after the Spirit\u2019s free kick fizzles, Kouassi is the first player booked for an armbar on Banda to stop the Pride\u2019s counterattack. 24 min: Another attempt to work the ball down the left with Kouassi, and it\u2019s just not quite working for the Spirit. 22 min: Free kick to the Spirit farther back toward midfield, and it ends up with McKeown in all sorts of space in the Orlando penalty area. Moorhouse has to stretch a bit for the crucial interception. 20 min: Rodman tries to draw a foul, convincing our TV commentary team but not the referee. As a very, very low-level referee myself, I\u2019m also not convinced. Seemed to me that she kicked the ball forward and then tried to fall over Abello, who has every right to stand her ground. I\u2019ll check the referee forums shortly and report back. 18 min: Rodman tries a cross from the right, but it seems a bit ambitious. The still-young Spirit player is one of the best defensive forwards in the game, and she races back with a perfectly timed slide tackle to break up an Orlando counterattack. 17 min: Morris slices into the Orlando defense from the right flank, but her pass finds no one. 15 min: SHOT BY MARTA! Banda is off to the races in the middle of the field, and four yellow shirts converge on her. The Zambian player slips the ball to her right for Marta, who cuts back onto her left foot and shoots, but it\u2019s straight at Kingsbury. 13 min: The Spirit seem determined to run the attack through Kouassi on their left wing, and the Pride are having none of it. Krueger, a reliable US national teamer when given the chance on and off in her career, joins in. 11 min: We have a Pride player down \u2013 it\u2019s Cori Dyke, who slid into Kouassi\u2019s legs and wound up getting the worst of it. The magic spray is duly sprayed, and Dyke will play on. 10 min: Orlando allow Washington to knock the ball around a bit in their own half, but then they pounce and force a turnover. The Spirit quickly win it back, but Watt neatly strips the ball from Kouassi and is immediately fouled. 8 min: Now a corner kick for the Spirit, and the Pride struggle to get the ball clear. It\u2019s eventually played out for a goal kick. No early goal here, but it\u2019s also not the ultraconservative action we too often see in cup finals. 6 min: Another Pride attack on the same flank, but the Spirit win the ball and force the action the other way before getting a free kick deep in their own half. Trinity Rodman apparently has an issue with a contact lens. 4 min: Orlando fight back with Banda and then Adriana trying to get a cross past Metayer. The Washington right back wins the duel but bundles the ball out of play for a Pride corner kick. 2 min: It\u2019s a promising attack for the Spirit, with Hatch pestering the Orlando defense and Krueger getting forward. Kouassi\u2019s cross is rather tame in the end. 1 min: The first 60 seconds of the match have taken place near the far sideline 10-20 yards past midfield in the Spirit half of the field. The referee is Alyssa Nichols. Kickoff \u2026 In all my years writing about sports, I\u2019m pretty sure this is the first time the national anthem singer is someone I saw performing just a couple of months ago \u2013 it\u2019s the great Melissa Etheridge. Sounds terrific. At age 38, Marta has had her best season in several years. She was named to the NWSL\u2019s Best XI for just the second time. She\u2019s joined on the Best XI by Barbra Banda, who has managed to replicate her torrid goal-scoring pace on the international scene with Zambia in her first season in the NWSL. Two Pride players made the Second XI \u2013 defender Kerry Abello and English goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse. GK: Moorhouse D: Abello, Kylie Strom, Emily Sams, Cori Dyke M: Adriana, Haley McCutcheon, Angelina, Ally Watt F: Banda, Marta Goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury has long has a devoted band of supporters making the case for her inclusion in the national team, and her semifinal heroics certainly won\u2019t silence them. Get used to seeing Hal Hirshfelt in the mix for a spot in the USA\u2019s central midfield. The rookie from Clemson has been a steady force in the spot for the Spirit. She was named to the NWSL Second XI, as was defender Tara McKeown. Cote d\u2019Ivoire forward Rosemonde Kouassi isn\u2019t on the same level of prominence as some of the other top African players who have made such an impact on the league, but she is a fierce presence up front. The Spirit placed three players on the NWSL Best XI, but Croix Bethune missed the last several weeks of the season and is out for the playoffs after one of the most unusual injuries in soccer history, tearing her meniscus while throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at a Washington Nationals baseball game. The other two, defender Casey Krueger and forward Trinity Rodman, missed time with injuries in the last few weeks but have successfully returned. GK: Kingsbury D: Krueger, Esme Morgan, McKeown, Paige Metayer DM: Hirshfelt, Makenna Morris AM: Kouassi, Leicy Santos, Rodman F: Ashley Hatch One of the game\u2019s greatest ever, showing dazzling form despite her advanced age. A gaggle of emerging talents. That would be Marta, the Brazilian great and longtime cornerstone of the Orlando Pride, and the Washington Spirit, which selected shrewdly in what turned out to be the final NWSL draft. They\u2019ll face off in the final of what has been a breakthrough season for the NWSL, which started a little more than a decade ago with tentative, thrifty steps but now spends freely to bring in many of the world\u2019s top players. Orlando should be favored over injury-plagued Washington, but the Spirit have used a deep roster and steady resolve to make it to this point. This has the makings of a classic. Enjoy. Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Megan Swanick\u2019s lookahead to Saturday\u2019s final.",

Pat McFadden, whose portfolio includes national security, will tell a Nato cybersecurity conference in London that Moscow \u201cwon\u2019t think twice about targeting British businesses\u201d, according to excerpts of his address released on Sunday by his ministry.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia\u2019s Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters. </strong>The source, who is on Ukraine\u2019s general staff, said Russia had deployed about 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv\u2019s forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cAt most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,\u201d the source said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin on Saturday signed a law that allows those who sign up to fight in Ukraine</strong> <strong>to write off unpaid debts worth almost $100,000</strong>.

      "bodyText": "The French foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, has told the BBC in an interview that western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia, and \u201cnot set and express red lines\u201d. Barrot\u2019s comments are significant, coming a few days after US and UK long-range missiles were used in that way for the first time. Barrot said that Ukraine could fire French long-range missiles into Russia \u201cin the logics of self-defence\u201d, but would not confirm if French weapons had already been used. \u201cThe principle has been set \u2026 our messages to President Zelenskyy have been well received,\u201d he said. France has supplied Ukraine with the Scalp missile, which is identical to the British-supplied Storm Shadow that Ukraine has reportedly already used inside Russia. Russia is \u201cexceptionally aggressive and reckless in the cyber realm\u201d and \u201cno one should underestimate\u201d the threat to Nato, a senior UK minister will warn in a speech on Monday. Pat McFadden, whose portfolio includes national security, will tell a Nato cybersecurity conference in London that Moscow \u201cwon\u2019t think twice about targeting British businesses\u201d, according to excerpts of his address released on Sunday by his ministry. Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia\u2019s Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters. The source, who is on Ukraine\u2019s general staff, said Russia had deployed about 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv\u2019s forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cAt most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,\u201d the source said. Vladimir Putin on Saturday signed a law that allows those who sign up to fight in Ukraine to write off unpaid debts worth almost $100,000. The legislation will allow those who sign a one-year contract to fight in Ukraine after 1 December to free themselves of existing bad debts. It also covers their spouses. Putin has threatened to launch more strikes using an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile as Ukraine decried the testing of the nuclear-capable weapon on its territory as an \u201cinternational crime\u201d. Speaking at a defence conference on Friday, Putin contested US claims that Russia possessed only a \u201chandful\u201d of the high-speed ballistic missiles, saying that the military had enough to continue to test them in \u201ccombat conditions\u201d and would put them into serial production. \u201cThe tests [of the missile system] have passed successfully, and I congratulate you all on that,\u201d Putin said, according to the Interfax news agency. The US president-elect, Donald Trump, is considering making Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, a special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to four sources familiar with the transition plans. Grenell, who served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to Germany and was acting director of national intelligence during Trump\u2019s 2017-2021 term, would play a key role in Trump\u2019s efforts to halt the war if he is ultimately selected for the post. While there is now no special envoy dedicated solely to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Trump is considering creating the role, according to the four sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is making a diplomatic trip to Europe that includes a meeting of foreign ministers from the leading industrialised nations that will focus on the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. The state department said Blinken would participate in group of seven and bilateral meetings outside Rome on Monday and Tuesday. It comes as the Biden administration winds down amid concerns that Donald Trump\u2019s team may substantially alter US foreign policy. Russia has included the territories it occupies in Ukraine in its recent greenhouse gas inventory report to the United Nations, drawing protests from Ukrainian officials and activists at the Cop29 climate summit this week. The move by Moscow comes as Vladimir Putin eyes potential peace deal negotiations with Trump that could decide the fate of Russian-occupied territory, Reuters reported. \u201cWe see that Russia is using international platforms to legalise their actions, to legalise their occupation of our territory,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s deputy environment minister Olga Yukhymchuk told Reuters. Russian drone and missile attacks have damaged 321 Ukrainian port infrastructure facilities since July 2023, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday. Twenty merchant ships belonging to other countries were damaged by Russian strikes, he added. Ukraine\u2019s air defence units destroyed more than 10 Russia drones that were targeting Kyiv in an overnight drone attack, Ukraine\u2019s military said on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Meanwhile Russia\u2019s air defence systems destroyed 34 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said in a post on its Telegram messaging app on Sunday. Putin signed into law a bill banning adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legal. Since sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin leader has repeatedly characterised the west as \u201csatanic\u201d and accused it of trying to undermine Russia by exporting liberal ideologies.",

The commitment from developed countries of $300bn per year by 2035 primarily from bilateral and multilateral sources of public finance is an important advance on current levels, but falls short significantly of the at least $390bn a year by 2035 which our work shows would be required to deliver the goals of the Paris agreement.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important that work starts immediately on the urgency of delivery, the quality of and access to finance, and reducing the cost of capital. Therefore we welcome the emphasis in the agreement on the new goal on delivery, monitoring and transparency. It is crucial to work together to begin ramping up financial support from all sources immediately to assist developing countries in making stronger pledges for action.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mary Robinson</strong>, the former UN envoy and senior climate figure said: \u201cCop29 in Baku has been one of the most difficult Cops I can remember.

Strangled by the second highest attendance of fossil fuel lobbyists on record in Baku and with progress simultaneously blocked by oil and gas producer voices at G20 in Rio, this COP has taken us dangerously backwards on collective climate action as extreme weather events take their toll.</p> <p>\u201cIt also raises the stakes acutely on the next round of NDCs, which will have to seize the moment if we are to have the slimmest chance of keeping to 1.5C this decade. It will also put a huge amount of pressure on Brazil and their Presidency of COP30 next year. Governments will need to submit ambitious NDCs and show how they can really deliver. An orderly transition to avoid climate chaos and financial meltdown is possible, but the time for it to happen is quickly ebbing away. The time for any more backsliding has passed.</p> <p>\u201cThe suggestion that \u201cdecarbonising\u201d the extraction and processing of fossil fuels will solve climate change is essentially a myth. Fossil fuels must be phased out to meet our climate goals. Action on operational oil and gas emissions \u2013 especially methane - is also critical. Yet current corporate targets have significant shortcomings, and thus underestimate the impact of corporates\u2019 activities: generally they do not fully reflect methane\u2019s role in driving short term warming and almost universally exclude emissions from non-operated assets in which companies have an equity stake.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6742092d8f08849211a433c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrick-greenfield\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T17:00:14.346Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our colleagues in Baku are reporting that the current events in the plenary are pretty surreal and reflect the state of negotiations here in Baku.

Whatever finance is provided by the rich world must be regarded in light of that ongoing effort, according to the UN\u201ds development chief.</p> <p>Campaigners have repeatedly reminded delegates here that what developing countries are seeking is not charity. Developed countries caused the climate crisis through their burning of fossil fuels, and developing countries are now spending billions every year on boosting renewable energy, reshaping their economies, and trying to adapt their infrastructure to the impacts of extreme weather. </p> <p>According to the International High Level Expert Group on climate finance, made up of leading economists, by 2030 developing countries excluding China can be expected to spend about $1.4 trillion a year from their own budgets on climate-related activities.</p> <p>I caught up with Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, earlier in these talks, ahead of the current wrangles over texts at Cop29. \u201cDeveloping countries are actually investing hundreds of billions of dollars a year already from their own taxpayers\u2019 revenue, in climate action. It wouldn\u2019t hurt or harm anyone on the other side of the table to acknowledge that. Because it kind of creates a more level playing field, and we get away from the zero sum game psychology.\u201d</p>    <p>The figures involved might seem large, but are not in terms of the total global economy, he added.</p> <p>\u201cThe $1.3 trillion [that is the figure representing the total finance flows to developing countries from the rich world by 2035, likely to be agreed at Cop29] is not an irrational order of magnitude, when looking at climate finance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s out of this world. It would allow a world of 8bn people to accelerate and raise their levels of ambition in decarbonising their economies.\u201d</p> <p>The money would not all be coming from developed country taxpayers, he added. \u201cChina, India and the emerging economies are essentially financing their climate transitions out of their own resources, their taxpayers\u2019 money plus significant private sector and capital market investments. We need to help the public understand that this is not talking about $1.3 trillion of taxpayers\u2019 money from the Global North, being syphoned out and invested in the developing countries or the Global South.\u201d</p>    <p>Money from public financial institutions in the developed world that goes towards climate finance would also help to \u201cmobilise\u201d large amounts of private sector investment, he added. \u201cIt is guaranteed to have a remarkable multiplier function in terms of additional capital that will mobilise to make these transitions happen. And again, this is not imagined. We already have a decade behind us where we have invested trillions in renewable energy infrastructure and expansion of clean energy production, that in significant parts was financed by the private sector, by enterprise, by investors, by capital markets.\u201d</p> <p>More money was also needed on adaptation, Steiner said. \u201cAdaptation is essentially a tax on development. They have to spend money to stay in the same place because they can\u2019t invest in expanding the infrastructure, education, digitalisation, because they\u2019re essentially having to protect their current development assets from either destruction or even having to invest in earlier recovery and reconstruction. Take Pakistan; one flood event cost $30bn, probably much more even if you take the cumulative damage.\u201d</p> <p>He also warned against too much private finance being provided in the form of loans that could push countries deeper into debt. \u201cThese are debts that are in a sense being accumulated on top of an already unsustainable debt in many of these economies. And that\u2019s why we need to push as hard as possible, that for those countries, if you want them to pivot forward, that a significant amount of that funding and financing is actually more than just concessional. It should be grant based or close to being the equivalent of grant based financing.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T14:52:26.408Z\">at 2.52pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6741e1688f087ff7bcc43f6b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T14:13:01.711Z\">2.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'We are still taking part in the process' say AOSIS</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fiona Harvey</strong> and <strong>Patrick Greenfield</strong></p> <p>The Alliance of Small Island States has just sent out a statement saying that they are still taking part in the process.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cLet me make it clear that the Alliance of Small Island States remains committed to this process and are here in the spirit of good faith in multilateralism to secure the best deal that will protect not just us, but the world from the worst impacts of climate change.</p> <p>\u201cWe have presently removed ourselves from the stalled NCQG discussions, which were not offering a progressive way forward.

For instance, helping people in poor countries to use solar cookstoves can reduce their dependence on firewood \u2013 which cuts emissions and helps keeps forests standing.</p> <p>I spoke to Eamon Ryan, the Irish environment minister who is co-chair of the adaptation work here at Cop29, ahead of the draft texts which are now being argued over.</p> <p>\u201cAs we can already see, devastating climate change is coming, even if we stop emissions tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to prepare. And we need to do that particularly in developing countries, because they are the ones being hit most and they are least able to prepare. Many of them also have very small emissions.\u201d</p> <p>Adaptation had often been an afterthought at Cops, he added. \u201cThis whole process has tended to focus on emissions, rightly in some ways, but hasn\u2019t put adaptation centre stage.\u201d</p> <p>The most vulnerable countries are most in need of finance for adaptation, but most climate finance has gone towards middle income countries or those already able to adapt.</p> <p>Adaptation is not one of the most controversial issues at Cop, as most countries agree it should have more focus. The issue of \u201ctransformational adaptation\u201d has also caught people\u2019s imagination, Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a more radical, a more systemic approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to progress that. We need to ensure that is now worked on. I think it\u2019s going to be quite big in future.\u201d</p> <p>He said it was important for Cop29 to recognise the vital role of adaptation in tackling the climate crisis. \u201cOur job is to make sure we keep it centre stage,\u201d he said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T11:05:48.401Z\">at 11.05am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6741b1938f086501868e8083\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T10:46:33.250Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Patience appears to be wearing thin in the final stages of negotiations.

Finance that is provided comes from developed country governments or publicly funded institutions in the form preferably of grants, and highly concessional loans \u2013 loans at very low rates of interest.</p> <p>Finance that is mobilised can include private sector co-investing with governments.</p> <p>So the EU provides about $30bn of climate finance every year \u2013 but it mobilises a further $7bn through private sector co-investing.</p> <p>Poor countries, quite reasonably, want their climate finance in the form of grants, to avoid getting further into debt. But some countries are deeply reluctant to provide money in this way. France, for instance, through its AFD (Agence Francaise de Developpement) historically provides nearly all its climate finance in the form of loans.</p> <p>The reasoning behind this is that it gives recipient countries more incentive to spend the money in the most efficient way, and gives the providing country some form of accountability over how the money is spent. (It is also treated differently in the developed country\u2019s own budgets and accounting.) The big downside is that it counts towards debt for developing countries, which is why many rich countries are more willing to talk about grants, and deals such as \u201cdebt for climate swaps\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s also important to note that the habit of preferring loans is not confined to developed countries \u2013 China also provides most of its \u201csouth-south\u201d cooperation in the form of loans, on which developing countries are currently paying more than $300bn a year in interest alone.</p> <p>At Cops, there are no hard and fast definitions of climate finance. That is partly in order to give both donors and recipients some degree of flexibility. It is also because there is little agreement on what such a definition should be. If climate finance had to be defined, several participants told the Guardian, this Cop would have to go on for months longer rather than (hopefully) mere hours.</p> <p>What definitions there are go back to the 1992 UNFCCC, the Paris agreement of 2015, and decisions of various Cops in between.</p> <p>For instance, article 11 of the UNFCCC states: \u201cA mechanism for the provision of financial resources on a grant or concessional basis, including for the transfer of technology, is hereby defined. It shall function under the guidance of and be accountable to the Conference of the Parties, which shall decide on its policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria related to this Convention. Its operation shall be entrusted to one or more existing international entities.\u201d</p> <p>And in the Cancun accords of 2010, paragraph 98 states: \u201cRecognises that developed country Parties commit, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries; 99. Agrees that, in accordance with paragraph 1(e) of the Bali Action Plan, funds provided to developing country Parties may come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources; from Decision 1/CP.16.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6741a5388f087ff7bcc43dc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/damiancarrington\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T09:59:58.623Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Social media boosters for Azerbaijan\u2019s authoritarian regime are working the weekend, praising President Ilham Aliyev for his \u201cstrong political will\u201d which \u201cplayed a decisive role in our success today\u201d.</p>    <p>That will confuse the delegates at Cop29, who remain a long way from any success, and who also remember Aliyev\u2019s extraordinarily undiplomatic statements at the start of the summit.

This makes a massive difference to the scale of finance being discussed.</p> <p>In 2009, developed countries agreed that by 2020, they would collectively mobilize $100bn per year to support developing countries\u2019 decarbonization and adaptation plans. <a href=\"https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/\">US dollar inflation was 20.6% </a>in this time period.</p> <p>But when monitoring contributions, inflation was not taken into account, the OECD confirmed to the Guardian. As a result, the target became easier to meet over time, though countries met it late.</p> <p>The Cop29 draft texts released on Friday set a new proposed finance goal: $250bn by 2035. But they will not rise over time to keep pace with inflation.</p> <p>This has a very big impact on numbers, as the analysis shows below.</p> <p>$100bn in 2009 dollars would equal $145.3bn today if we adjust for US inflation in this time period.</p> <p>Returning to the proposed $250bn target, that becomes $345bn if we assume the average annual inflation rate of the US of 2.38% over the last 15 years, according to a back-of-the-napkin calculation from my colleague Patrick Greenfield.</p> <p>\u201cAgreeing a figure of $250 billion mobilised per year by 2035 would not only be inadequate but shameful. Adjusted for inflation, it represents virtually no increase in public finance from developed countries beyond the $100 billion commitment made 15 years ago,\u201d Salom\u00e9 Lehtman, project and advocacy advisor at Mercy Corps, said.</p> <p>And $390bn annually \u2013 the number <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/19/it-is-feasible-climate-finance-wont-burden-rich-countries-say-economists\">proposed</a> in a study by top academics as fair and in line with the Paris agreement \u2013 would in 2035 be $538bn in today\u2019s money, assuming the same rate of inflation.</p> <p>\u201cTargets will need to adjust for inflation over time,\u201d Amar Bhattacharya, the executive secretary of the UN\u2019s independent high-level expert group on climate finance and co-author of the study, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Put another way, the proposed $250bn target for 2035 is really a $197.6bn target, assuming the same inflation rate. This means the target is not even a doubling.</p> <p>\u201cThe proposed climate finance goal in the latest text is an embarrassment,\u201d said Collin Rees, a manager at the climate justice NGO Oil Change International, who shared calculations from the IMF with the Guardian.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674197138f087ff7bcc43d83\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dharna-noor\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T09:06:51.664Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As we await new Cop29 draft texts on Saturday morning, I chatted to Thoriq Ibrahim, climate, energy and environment minister for the Maldives, who is leading negotiations for the small island nation.</p> <p>Yesterday\u2019s drafts were \u201ctotally unacceptable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The $250bn goal put forth for climate finance was \u201cabsolutely not at all adequate,\u201d he said, and \u201cbarely an improvement\u201d on the $100bn goal set in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the $250 billion with inflation, it\u2019s almost same goal,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Rich countries have privately agreed to up the goal to $300bn, the Guardian learned this morning.</p> <p>The minister said he could not comment on whether that figure would be acceptable until it is officially on the table.</p> <p>But the number is not the only concern for vulnerable countries, he said.

They said the offer of $250bn coming from rich countries, with few safeguards over how much would come without strings attached, was much too little.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T09:12:11.434Z\">at 9.12am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6741842b8f087ff7bcc43d15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T07:56:40.697Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) went to Moscow to talk to Russia about oil yesterday, as delegates in neighbouring Azerbaijan struggled to bring the climate conference to a close.

The current text is full of false solutions and empty promises. The money from the Global North countries needed to pay back their climate debt is still nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>Those in power are worsening the destabilisation and destruction of our life supporting ecosystems.

      "bodyText": "After a lengthy speech by Simon Stiell and an even longer one by Mukhtar Babayev, the plenary is drawing to a close. My colleagues in Baku have written about developments this evening here: We will have more coverage and reaction in the coming days, but we\u2019ll end the liveblog here. Thanks for reading, and especially to those of you who got in touch by email or social media. See you in Belem! Juan Carlos Monterrey G\u00f3mez, Panama\u2019s special representative for climate change and who gave a barnstorming speech earlier in Cop29, says the global temperature target of 1.5C is dead with the level of climate finance agreed. He said developing nations had to accept the deal though, because Cop is the only forum for them to pursue the climate action so desperately needed. \u201cI think 1.5C was at the intensive care unit and it feels like that bed just broke and it fell on the floor. So we\u2019re probably not going to be able to reach 1.5C based on this very low level of finance being provided by the developed world. That means death, that means misery, for our countries.\u201d \u201cThe gavel was hit way too fast and our heart goes out to all those nations that feel like they were walked over. Developed nations always throw text at us at the last minute, shove it down our throat, and then, for the sake of multilateralism, we always have to accept it, otherwise the climate mechanisms will go into a horrible downward spiral, and no one needs that. This is the only space that we have to negotiate and to work towards our common goals. We accepted the text because we could not leave Baku without a text, but we\u2019re not satisfied whatsoever.\u201d In his closing remarks Babayev said \u201cwe have reached the end of a defining chapter in the climate crisis\u201d He thanked everyone involved from negotiators to activists to \u201cthousands of volunteers\u201d to major applause. \u201cSince the beginning of this journey, people doubted Azerbaijan could deliver,\u2019 he said, adding that they \u201chosted one of the largest cops with only 11 months to prepare\u201d. Deals made at Cop29 will \u201cmean more coal plants decommissioned\u201d and more \u201cwind plants build\u201d he said. On finance, he said \u201cwe had many difficult conversations\u201d and insisted the presidency pushed countries to be ambitious. He ended by telling viewers: \u201cNever forget the power of your contribution\u201d and that \u201cprotecting the planet is an act of solidarity\u201d. \u201cIndia called out on how the decision let down peoples of the developing world, but was ignored when it objected, it was outrageous,\u201d said Meena Raman, a veteran Cop observer and head of programmes of Third World Network. \u201cThe goal is paltry and does not guarantee any provision as it only about mobilisation. It is a great escape by developed countries of their obligation to clearly indicate what they will provide. [This deal] is nothing to cheer about: it is inadequate and insufficient to meet the needs and priorities of developing countries. \u201cThis deal is the result of big bullying by developed countries to escape their obligations by a smoke and mirror decision that is unclear on what will be delivered. The US, who Trump has said is exiting the Paris agreement, had a huge influence in crafting a decision that is hollow and full of loopholes that shifts responsibility to developing countries through their own efforts. It is a do-it-yourself pact.\u201d Amar Bhattacharya, Vera Songwe and Nicholas Stern, the leading economists and chairs of the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance, have released a statement welcoming the finance agreement: \u201cIt is important that work starts immediately on scaling up external finance from all sources for developing countries towards a target of $1.3tn per year by 2035. The commitment from developed countries of $300bn per year by 2035 primarily from bilateral and multilateral sources of public finance is an important advance on current levels, but falls short significantly of the at least $390bn a year by 2035 which our work shows would be required to deliver the goals of the Paris agreement. \u201cIt is important that work starts immediately on the urgency of delivery, the quality of and access to finance, and reducing the cost of capital. Therefore we welcome the emphasis in the agreement on the new goal on delivery, monitoring and transparency. It is crucial to work together to begin ramping up financial support from all sources immediately to assist developing countries in making stronger pledges for action.\u201d Mary Robinson, the former UN envoy and senior climate figure said: \u201cCop29 in Baku has been one of the most difficult Cops I can remember. It came very close to failure and it has ended with a disappointing deal. But it is a deal the world can build on in 2025. \u201cThe $300bn per year committed by 2035 by rich countries at Cop29 falls $90bn short of the amount needed to implement the Paris agreement. This is nowhere near enough to support developing countries. But the intention in the deal to generate at least $1.3tn from a wider range of sources is right. This is an investment, not a handout. \u201cCop29 was weak in transitioning away from fossil fuels. Oil-rich countries must see that their efforts to delay the inevitable will fail. The green energy transition has gained unstoppable momentum, driven by competitive prices and market demand.\u201d Some developed countries have made barely veiled swipes at Saudi Arabia over its obstruction of the text including an explicit restatement of some of what was agreed in Dubai last year \u2013 particularly, goals of transitioning away from fossil fuels, tripling renewable energy by 2030 and doubling energy efficiency by the same year. Instead, the text just refers to paragraph 28, in which the transition commitment was made, calling on countries \u201cto contribute to the global efforts referred to in paragraph 28\u201d. Speaking on behalf of the umbrella group of developed countries, Australia said it was disappointed that some countries had \u201cstalled or stymied discussion\u201d on those issues. But they said that countries were accelerating towards the global goal of net zero emissions and moving to capture the economic opportunities of renewable energy to create jobs for their communities. Switzerland said Cop29 fell short on \u201cmeaningful ambition\u201d and it regretted the text \u201chad been watered down by some\u201d. \u201cWe can and must do better next year,\u201d they said. Pakistan says the decisions reflected the spirit of multilateralism, but it would leave Baku \u201cwith mixed feelings and a heavy heart\u201d as the goals put forward by demonstrated countries do not match needs of developing countries. Its representative said it had faced devastating floods and heatwaves and melting glaciers, and too much climate finance was being given as loans. It meant the climate crisis was \u201cconverting into a debt crisis\u201d. \u201cWe demand climate justice. It isn\u2018t charity. It\u2019s a moral obligation.\u201d Harjeet Singh, a highly regarded campaigner at Cops and at the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, says the fight will have to go on: \u201cAt Cop29, developed nations once again coerced developing countries into accepting a financial deal woefully inadequate to address the gravity of our global climate crisis. The deal fails to provide the critical support required for developing countries to transition swiftly from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy systems, or to prepare for the devastating impacts of the climate crisis, leaving them severely under-resourced. \u201cWe must persist in our fight, demanding a significant increase in financing and holding developed countries to account for delivering real, impactful actions.\u201d After Babayev gavelled through the global stocktake, a negotiator from Chile registered his disapproval. \u201cIn our view the text that we have in front of us lacks a number of very important elements,\u201d he said, arguing it does not reflect the tools needed to inform climate plans (NDCs). \u201cIn our view the text does not enjoy consensus,\u201d he said. A Fiji negotiator said that in negotiations around the global stocktake, his nation has been asked to \u201cignore our needs\u201d and \u201cstep backward.\u201d A Canadian minister also registered his disappointment, as did an Australian negotiator. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who at the start of Cop29 said the climate crisis had made 2024 \u201ca masterclass in human destruction\u201d, expressed disappointment: \u201cDeveloping countries swamped by debt, pummelled by disasters, and left behind in the renewables revolution, are in desperate need of funds. I had hoped for a more ambitious outcome \u2013 but this agreement provides a base on which to build. It must be honoured in full and on time. Commitments must quickly become cash. All countries must come together to ensure the top-end of this new goal is met.\u201d Simon Stiell, the UN\u2019s top climate official, said: \u201cIt has been a difficult journey, but we\u2019ve delivered a deal. This new finance goal is an insurance policy for humanity, amid worsening climate impacts hitting every country. But it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time. No country got everything they wanted, and we leave Baku with a mountain of work still to do. We need to redouble our efforts on the road to Bel\u00e9m [Cop30 in 2025].\u201d Former US vice-president Al Gore, who has been a prominent voice on climate matters for decades, has weighed in: While the agreement reached at Cop29 avoids immediate failure, it is far from a success. On the key issues like climate finance and the transition away from fossil fuels, this is \u2014 yet again \u2014 the bare minimum. We cannot continue to rely on last-minute half measures. Leaders today shirk their responsibility by focusing on long-term, aspirational goals that extend far beyond their own terms in office. To meet the challenge of our time, we need real action at the scale of months and years, not decades and quarter-centuries. This experience in Baku illuminates deeper flaws in the Cop process, including the outsized influence of fossil fuel interests that has hobbled this process since its inception. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been particularly obstructive. Putting the future of humanity at severe risk in order to make more money is truly disgraceful behaviour. Reforming this process so that the polluters are not in effective control must be a priority. On climate finance, our primary task in the coming years must be to not only fulfil and build upon the financial commitments agreed to at Cop29, but to unleash even larger flows of affordable and fair private capital for developing countries. Ultimately, coming out of Cop29, we must transform disappointment into determination. We can solve the climate crisis. Whether we do so in time to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement will depend on what comes next. Wopke Hoekstra, the EU commissioner for climate action, has a far more positive take on the Cop29 deal, and it is received with zero applause, unlike the angry speeches from India and Nigeria. \u201cWe all know how very, very difficult this was, and yet we do feel that the result of today is actually exceptionally important. We are living in a time of truly challenging geopolitics so seeing a deal truly is exceptional.\u201d \u201cIn my view, Cop29 will be remembered as a start of a new era for climate finance and we have worked hard with all of you to ensure that there is significantly more money on the table. We\u2019re tripling the $100bn goal, and we feel it is ambitious, it is needed, it is realistic and it is achievable.\u201d Hoekstra also alludes to the row over whether countries like China and Saudi Arabia should contribute to climate finance, despite being classed as developing in UN climate talks: \u201cIt is also a matter of fairness and of importance to us that all those with the ability to do so should contribute, and therefore it is good that we enlarge the contributor base on a voluntary basis.\u201d On the lack of explicit mention of last year\u2019s commitment to \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels, he says: \u201cIt is less than what we have liked, but it is better than we feared.\u201d Babayev has gavelled through the mitigation and implementation work programme to relatively feeble applause. Meanwhile, reaction to the finance deal continues to pour in. \u201cThe gap between this climate finance commitment and what\u2019s needed is so big you could see it from space,\u201d said Ben Goloff, senior climate campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cIt\u2019s richly ironic that the United States and other wealthy, polluting nations can come up with funds for almost anything except helping poor countries cope with the climate chaos they\u2019ve caused. Kicking the deadline to 2035 adds insult to the injury of a paltry $300bn, a fraction of the trillions needed. The Biden administration should be going out with at least a signal of its moral climate commitment, not copping out ahead of the Trump 2.0 disaster.\u201d Malawi\u2019s negotiator said that for his country and other members of the Least Developed Countries bloc, the finance goal is \u201cnot ambitious.\u201d Rich nations have not committed enough public finance to the developing world, he said: \u201cThe figure is far less than what we need.\u201d He said the text also does not include support for loss and damage. \u201cAs such we also want to register our reservation to accept this proposal as it stands,\u201d he added. The UK\u2019s energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who has seemingly been everywhere at these talks, said: This is a critical eleventh hour deal at the eleventh hour for the climate. It is not everything we or others wanted but is a step forward for us all. It\u2019s a deal that will drive forward the clean energy transition which is essential for jobs and growth in Britain and for protecting us all against the worsening climate crisis. \u201cThe new finance goal rightly reflects the importance of going beyond traditional donors like Britain, and the role of countries like China in helping those on the frontline of this crisis. If this finance is used in the right way, it could cut the equivalent emissions of one billion cars and could protect nearly a billion people from the impacts of climate change. Today\u2019s agreement sends the signal that the clean energy transition is unstoppable. It is the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century and through our championing of it we can help crowd in private investment. There is much more work to do if we are to keep 1.5C within reach and prevent climate catastrophe. We\u2019ve pushed for ambition in Baku and have restored the UK back to a position of global climate leadership. We will keep up the pace, working with other countries before the world meets again in Brazil for Cop30. Only by doing this can we keep future generations safe and reap the benefits of the clean energy revolution. More reaction: Tina Stege, climate envoy for the highly vulnerable Marshall Islands, said: \u201cWe came in good faith, with the safety of our communities and the well-being of the world at heart. Yet, we have seen the very worst of political opportunism here at this COP, playing games with the lives of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. Fossil fuel interests have been determined to block progress and undermine the multilateral goals we\u2019ve worked to build. This can never be allowed to happen. Despite the barriers, we\u2019ve fought hard and secured something for our communities. We are leaving with a small portion [$300bn] of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need. It isn\u2019t nearly enough, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d \u201cCountries seem to have forgotten the reason why we are all here. It is to save lives. It is to save lives. We have to work hard to rebuild trust in this vital process. Avinash Persaud, an expert on climate finance at the Inter-American Development Bank, takes a realistic view: \u201cIt was hard fought over, but at $300bn per year led by developed to developing countries, we have arrived at the boundary between what is politically achievable today in developed countries and what would make a difference in developing countries.\u201d Here comes Nigeria, just as strong as the countries before it. Its delegation representative said the gavelling through of the climate finance goal was \u201can insult to what the convention says\u201d and $300bn a year by 2035 was a \u201cjoke\u201d. She noted that developed countries had the largest share of current and historic emissions and had agreed they had a responsibility to act, and that meant climate finance. \u201cI think we should rethink of it. We have a right as countries to decide if we accept this or not. I\u2019m saying we do not accept this. \u201cIt\u2019s 3am and we\u2019re going to clap our hands and say this is what we\u2019re going to do. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Again, the president said the objection would be noted. In an impassioned speech, Bolivia\u2019s negotiator says that the climate finance text just gavelled through \u201censhrines climate injustice.\u201d The deal \u201cconsolidates an unfair system\u201d where developed countries do not comply with their responsibilities to the global south, he said. Those rich nations, he said, leave developing countries with \u201cvery limited resources\u201d to meet their climate goals, he said. And though they do not provide sufficient climate finance, they do spend big to produce fossil fuels and make \u201cmassive business deals.\u201d He said global north countries focus on human rights abuses in their regions but inflate their military budgets and fund violence, including \u201cgenocide in Palestine.\u201d The crowd applauded wildly. Babayev said their dissent will be noted in the report. More reaction from the NGOs. Mostly fairly gloomy. Mike Childs, head of policy at the UK Friends of Earth, gives credit to the UK delegation for playing a productive role. \u201cBut these latest international talks failed to solve the question of climate finance - instead they have again kicked the can down the road. Developing countries are being hammered by climate extremes now, predominantly fuelled by the current and historic polluting activities of rich nations, like the UK. The problem of how to provide the trillions needed to support the countries being hardest hit by a crisis they\u2019re least responsible for remains. Without this investment, which must be unlocked by wealthy countries stepping up to do their fair share, there can be no climate justice. Friederike R\u00f6der, Vice President, Global Policy and Advocacy, Global Citizen \u201cCOP29 has ended with an agreement on climate finance that fails to rise to the urgency of addressing the global climate crisis. \u201cToday, it is clear that the final COP29 agreement on the NCQG falls woefully short of meeting the pressing climate challenges of today, let alone the escalating challenges of tomorrow. \u201cHowever, we welcome the agreement on a Roadmap to Bel\u00e9m, which sparks a faint glimmer of hope. This must become a catalyst for real, transformative action India has responded furiously to the climate finance goal being quickly gavelled through by the president, saying it is a \u201cpaltry sum\u201d and it was not given the opportunity to express its strong opposition to it. In a fiery address, Chandni Raina, the Indian representative said: \u201cIndia opposes the adoption of this document and please take note of what we have just said from the floor of this room. We seek a much higher ambition from the developed countries.\u201d \u201cWe had informed the president we had informed the secretariat that we wanted to make a statement prior to any decision on the adoption but however - and it\u2019s for everyone to see \u2013 this has been stage managed and we are extremely disappointed with this incident. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what you have done \u2026 gavelling and trying to ignore parties from speaking does not behove the UN system and we would want you to hear us \u2026 we absolutely object to this unfair means of adoption.\u201d She was scathing of developed countries for failing to act to address the climate crisis, and said they should agree to advance their net zero targets and become net negative soon after. She said there was a lack of trust in the system. \u201cUnfortunately, the paper on the NCQG does not inspire trust that we will come out of this grave problem of climate change.\u201d The president said India\u2019s position would be noted, but the acceptance of the climate goal stands. Mohamed Adow, at Power Shift Africa and a key voice at Cops, says the Cop29 finance deal is a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d of people and planet. \u201cThis Cop has been a disaster for the developing world. It\u2019s a betrayal of both people and planet, by wealthy countries who claim to take climate change seriously. \u201cRich countries have promised to \u201cmobilise\u201d some funds in the future, rather than provide them now. The cheque is in the mail. But lives and livelihoods in vulnerable countries are being lost now. \u201cThe rich world staged a great escape in Baku. With no real money on the table, and vague and unaccountable promises of funds to be mobilised, they are trying to shirk their climate finance obligations. Leaving the world without the resources needed to avert climate catastrophe. \u201cThis has been a shamefully led summit by Azerbaijan which deserves to be a global embarrassment for the wealthy countries and the Cop president that facilitated them to dodge their obligations. The first to speak after the gavelling through of the finance goal, just before the representative from India, was a negotiator for Cuba. He said he \u201cprofoundly regrets the insufficient outcomes\u201d of the finance negotiations. The \u201cscope of the decision,\u201d he said, shows developed countries\u2019 desire to \u201crenounce\u201d their responsibility to developing nations. That responsibility is legally binding, he said. The finance goal does not rectify the \u201ccontinued dynamic of environmental colonialism,\u201d he went on. And he said it provides \u201cno guarantees of sufficient support\u201d for developing countries\u2019 climate action plans (NDCs) His country has a \u201cfirm commitment to continue dialogue\u201d on this issue, he said. And about rich countries, he said, \u201ctheir climate debt must be paid.\u201d He spoke two gong hits over his allotted time. Many stood, cheered, whooped and yelled in response. The Indian representative is speaking now and is absolutely furious. She accuses the presidency of gavelling through the deal over people\u2019s objections. She has called the deal \u2018stage-managed\u2019 to whoops and hollers from other representatives. Reactions to the deal and the way it was made are already coming in: Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO, World Resources Institute: \u201cDespite major headwinds, negotiators in Baku eked out a deal that at least triples climate finance flowing to developing countries. The $300 billion goal is not enough, but is an important downpayment toward a safer, more equitable future. The agreement recognizes how critical it is for vulnerable countries to have better access to finance that does not burden them with unsustainable debt. And opens the door for a broader set of countries to contribute. \u201cThe poorest and most vulnerable nations are rightfully disappointed that wealthier countries didn\u2019t put more money on the table when billions of people\u2019s lives are at stake. According to leading economists, $300 billion by 2035 does not meet the scale of what developing countries need to pursue a low-carbon economy and protect their citizens from mounting droughts, floods, and wildfires. We have a deal. The COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev has just brought down his gavel on a financial deal which no one is very happy with but which is, nonetheless, a deal. As Babayev gavelled through the deal there was long standing applause, cheering, whistling. negotiators embracing. The plenary has resumed. As provisions on gender were gavelled through \u2014 reportedly a tense subject throughout Cop29 \u2014 the crowd broke out in applause. My colleague Dharna Noor is inside the plenary hall, where discussions were supposed to resume. She reports: More than half an hour ago, attendees took their seats once again, expecting the plenary to reconvene. Now, at 2:15 am, anxious delegates are milling about, civil society groups are chatting loudly, and some are even falling asleep. The Climate Group, which works with big business and state and regional governments, is not usually outspoken, really does not like the deal on the table in Baku. The group\u2019s Dr Champa Patel, said: \u201cWith this paltry $300bn a year commitment, Cop29 has slammed the door in the face of developing countries. Azerbaijan\u2019s lack of leadership didn\u2019t help, neither did emboldened petrostate interests. \u201cTo make matters worse, the [$300bn] target has no clear percentage for how much of this funding should be grants or concessions rather than loans. The science is simple: trillions - not billions - are needed every year. Showing little leadership, developed countries instead reinforced a broken fossil fuel-based model. \u201cTrue climate justice demands bold action: ending fossil fuel subsidies, taxing the wealthiest, and redesigning global financial systems to deliver trillions in climate finance every single year. Brazil [the next host nation] now has an almighty task on its hands. Cop30 must deliver transformative action, not recycled or failed promises. Anything less risks making these negotiations irrelevant in the fight for a liveable future.\u201d While the new climate finance text \u201ccalls\u201d on \u201call actors\u201d to scale up finance to developing countries to at least $1.3tn a year by 2035, it only \u201cdecides to set a goal\u201d of at least $300bn a year by 2035, \u201cwith developed countries taking the lead\u201d. In an attempt to provide reassurance that progress to the $1.3tn will happen, the text \u201cdecides to launch the \u2018Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T\u2019, aiming at scaling up climate finance to developing countries to support low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development pathways and implement nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans, including through grants, concessional and non-debt-creating instruments, and measures to create fiscal space, taking into account relevant multilateral initiatives as appropriate\u201d. That very long sentence may not be that reassuring. One civil society observer, Brandon Wu at ActionAid USA, called it: \u201cmeaningless gibberish, like some finance bros vomited a bunch of random words that sound cool\u201d. You can see the new texts here: On climate finance, a first read reveals: As flagged this morning, the core climate finance goal to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis has been lifted to $300bn a year by 2035, up from $250bn. This was the figure on the table when poor and vulnerable countries walked out of a meeting on Saturday afternoon, wanting 30% of funding dedicated to meeting their needs. That hasn\u2019t happened but there are now more specific references to the least developed countries and small island states. It says the finance goal needs to especially \u201creflect the evolving needs and priorities\u201d of these groups of countries as they are \u201cparticularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have significant capacity constraints\u201d. It\u2019s an indication they should be favoured. We\u2019ll know soon how they react. The text says developed countries will be \u201ctaking the lead\u201d. Others will have their voluntary efforts recognised. The broader $1.3tn goal remains in. It calls on \u201call actors\u201d to work together to scale up at least $1.3tn in funding from public and private sources by 2035. On the thorny question of the role of the major emerging economies who were not considered developed when climate summits began in the 1990s - including China, India, Saudi Arabia and other gulf states - it says \u201cencourages developing countries to make contributions on a voluntary basis\u201d. The text recognises that parties can count \u201cclimate-related outflows\u201d and \u201cclimate-related finance\u201d mobilised by multilateral development banks towards achievement of the $300bn goal. Watch this one closely - it might be a sticking point with the Indians, in particular. The text says the funding needs to be made alongside \u201cmeaningful and ambitious\u201d emissions cuts and adaptation action. The new text on the UAE dialogue on implementing the global stocktake (GST) outcomes is out \u2013 the GST is where the commitment to \u201ctransitioning away from fossil fuels\u201d was made last year at Cop28. The new text does not explicitly mention the transition away from fossil fuels, as many countries wanted, but oil-rich Saudi Arabia and allies did not. Instead, it only refers to paragraph 28, in which the transition commitment was made: \u201cReaffirms the need for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5C pathways and calls on [countries] to contribute to the global efforts referred to in paragraph 28.\u201d That may be seen as backsliding on the commitment. The text also gives a boost to fossil gas, referred to as \u201ctransitional fuels\u201d. It says: \u201cReaffirms that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while ensuring energy security.\u201d We\u2019ll see what nations make of that when the plenary begins. My colleagues Fiona Harvey and Dharna Noor are inside the plenary as ministers and delegates gather in groups to discuss the official texts that are now being released by the presidency before the plenary re-starts. Britain\u2019s Ed Miliband is in conversation with the Germans. It sounds like at least some progress has been made. Juan Carlos Monterrey G\u00f3mez, Panama\u2019s climate envoy, told the Guardian the package on the table is \u201cnot perfect, but it\u2019s something, and we need something. I see the light.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m back to being optimistic.\u201d Adam Morton and Dharna Noor Well. This is confusing. And everyone is genuinely confused. The Cop29 president Mukhtar Babayev started the plenary by announcing people who have been elected to positions in UNFCCC-related bodies. Lots of rounds of applause. Delegates in blazers and activists in keffiyehs continued to trail in as he spoke. Germany\u2019s Jennifer Morgan walked around in the back of the hall and stopped to talk to Rachel Kyte, the UK climate envoy. After that an abrupt announcement that the plenary would be resumed later tonight. There were looks of confusion on the floor, and the crowd burst out in chatter. Attendees began to whisper in confusion The president then switched his microphone back on and said that they will need 20-25 minutes to finalise the documents. Someone in the crowd shouted \u201cwhat!\u201d And we\u2019re waiting again. Yet more announcements and gavelling from the Cop29 president Mukhtar Babayev, as another round of agreements goes through. Delegates are now gathered in the plenary, but without an official text. This appears to be a high-risk strategy by the presidency, because it\u2019s not clear that there is consensus on a potential deal here. Delegates seemed as confused as observers as they piled in. Ed Miliband and Sue Biniaz were among the first to arrive, spotted deep in conversation in the plenary hall quite a while before other delegations started to arrive. Many were clutching pieces of paper that appeared to be the new text which is being handed around, but hasn\u2019t yet been published on the UNFCCC web site. Many presidencies try unorthodox manoeuvres in the final stages of a Cop. For instance, at Sharm El-Sheikh, the Egyptians started inviting delegations in one by one to view a putative text, but as the delegations pointed out, it was impossible to tell whether they were all seeing the same text. The Egyptians were widely criticised for that one. Whether this plenary is just the start of another round of intense negotiations, rather than an end point, is hard to tell so far. Is it the beginning of the end? Or just the end of the beginning? The closing plenary has now been announed for 1230 Baku time \u2013 that\u2019s in about 20 or so minutes. Of course, this could turn out to be yet another false alarm. The puzzlement continues as delegates head back into the plenary, even though the new text does not seem to have been published. It seems as if drafts may have been circulating, however. Marc Daalder, the Senior Political Reporter at newsroom.co.nz, says the text which is circulating is a leak not a draft. \u201cIt\u2019s leaked, not public, but includes US$300b by 2035 and a \u201cBaku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap\u201d which would see further work over the next year on how the outer finance layer of US$1.3 trillion might be achieved.\u201d Everyone is extremely tired at this point. Reports of possible progress at #Cop29 from Evans Njewa, chair of the Least Developed Countries group and Malawi\u2019s climate chief. He said at 10pm Baku time that the LDC has agreed a text on climate finance with developed nations and given this to the Cop presidency. The sum of money promised to poor, vulnerable nations by rich countries is the key issue for Cop29. The LDC group walked out of a meeting earlier, frustrated by a lack of progress. \u201cTwo or three hours ago, we called for a temporary suspension of the meeting because we felt that the deal that we were being given was not good enough to save our people.\u201d We [the LDC group] are serving over 1 billion people in 45 countries in the world, and we need to get an ambitious deal here regarding climate financing was to support climate action, help people move out of poverty, get food security. We have met with countries like the US, UK, Germany and others and we have agreed on language that we have given to the presidency. He will be looking into that in the next few minutes, and we hope we\u2019ll get what we are looking for.\u201d Njewa said the negotiations on climate finance have been going on for three years. \u201cWe have met 11 times, and then we set up another process, and met three times, and we presented all our issues and positions to the leaders, to the chairpersons, the Cop presidency. But then we thought that things got diluted and last night, this morning, some things were taken out by other [countries]. We just wanted to say, please remember, this is what we presented.\u201d Following our colleague Adam Morton\u2019s post earlier on that Chris Bowen, the Australian environment minister, was on his way home, it turns out that the New Zealand Climate Change Minister Simon Watts actually left on Friday, the New Zealand newsroom is reporting. Watts apparently had a scheduled trip to Antarctica. However, New Zealand\u2019s head of delegation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade official Todd Croad, is still in Baku. \u201cUnfortunately we\u2019re in a situation now where we have a deadlock,\u201d Marina Silva, the Brazilian minister of the environment and climate change, said in a press conference on Saturday night. Some compromises have been reached, including on carbon markets and adaptation. But \u201cthere are some remaining issues which are crucial,\u201d she said, including efforts to foster a just transition, the global stocktake, and the key issue for Cop29: climate finance. It was \u201conly yesterday,\u201d she said, that negotiators had access to a proposed \u201cquantum\u201d \u2013 a core climate finance goal for rich nations to provide developing countries, she said. \u201cWe still have some issues which need to be properly addressed,\u201d she said. Negotiators have shifted their focus to other topics, but \u201cwe need to focus on what is essential in this Cop and not other topics,\u201d she said. A crucial hurdle at the summit, said Silva, has been the lack of \u201ccentral leadership,\u201d though she added, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it was just an issue of the presidency.\u201d She said Brazil came to Cop29 with an \u201copen heart\u201d and an \u201cambitious NDC\u201d that was aligned with the 1.5C target, aiming to lead by example. She called for countries to put forth strong climate action plans before their February deadline. Some more reaction to the approval of Article 6. Sebastien Cross, the cofounder of ratings agency BeZero Carbon, said: Breaking the deadlock on two years of negotiations on Articles 6.2 and 6.4 is a watershed moment. Operationalising the effective trading of decarbonisation outcomes is essential if we stand a chance of meeting net zero goals. Unlike the carbon markets of the past, this Article 6 agreement is built on stronger foundations, leveraging advanced data and cutting-edge technology to ensure global carbon trading functions with more efficiency and transparency. Of course, further steps will need to be taken to implement Article 6 effectively \u2013 including the use of independent, risk-based ratings to bolster nation\u2019s confidence in leveraging market mechanisms to achieve their climate goals. But with proper implementation, Article 6 will unlock billions in capital flows, a large part of which will go towards developing nations, bringing benefits above and beyond decarbonisation. We are now just over 28 hours past the scheduled finishing time, meaning this is already the eighth biggest overrun in Cop history. It is extremely unlikely that it will be resolved within an hour, so is likely to pass Glasgow\u2019s 29 hours and 12 minutes at the least. With the approval of rules on carbon trading, the Paris agreement is finally complete just 9 years after the majority of the deal was struck. Carbon markets are one of the most controversial parts of environmental policy, with widespread evidence that they have been largely ineffective so far at reducing and removing carbon in the atmosphere. There had been major divisions between countries about how they should work. At Cop28 last year, the European Union blocked the agreement due to disagreements with the US about technical rules on the creation, trading and registry of carbon credits. Now, they have found compromise, potentially opening up a path for carbon to join oil, gold and other commodities on international markets in an attempt to reduce global heating. During the plenary one particular huddle formed at the edge of the meeting, in classic Cop style. Susana Muhamad, the Colombian environment minister, can be spotted at the heart of the group, along with US negotiator Sue Binaz US, African Group chair Ali Mohamed, and negotiators from other African countries. Governments have reached a deal on carbon markets at Cop29, paving the way for country-to-country carbon trading and the creation of a regulated global market to meet Paris targets. Further technical rules will need to be sorted in 2025 but this is a major boost to carbon trading proponents following years of controversy. If you would like to read more about what this all means, we prepared an explainer at the start of Cop29 on the good, the bad and the ugly of carbon markets. The Cop presidency have now suspended the meeting, without giving any further details. We are told it will be resumed \u201clater this evening\u201d. It\u2019s 9.33pm in Baku. Let\u2019s see how that goes. As the president keeps talking and confusion grows, John Podesta, the US climate envoy is now talking to various people on the floor. My colleague Dharna Noor has noticed him talking to the US delegation head Sue Biniaz who then headed out of the plenary room. And Marc Daalder notes on X that he has also gone over to to Kenya\u2019s seats to have a three-minute chat with African Group chair Ali Mohamed. While the plenary carries on, Carbon Tracker are concerned that the talks are about to collapse completely. Richard Folland, head of policy and engagement (and in Baku) said: \u201cWith the talks on the verge of collapse at the eleventh hour the outcome of this COP is deeply disappointing, shockingly so on the key climate finance objective and on accelerating the transition away from oil, gas and coal. Strangled by the second highest attendance of fossil fuel lobbyists on record in Baku and with progress simultaneously blocked by oil and gas producer voices at G20 in Rio, this COP has taken us dangerously backwards on collective climate action as extreme weather events take their toll. \u201cIt also raises the stakes acutely on the next round of NDCs, which will have to seize the moment if we are to have the slimmest chance of keeping to 1.5C this decade. It will also put a huge amount of pressure on Brazil and their Presidency of COP30 next year. Governments will need to submit ambitious NDCs and show how they can really deliver. An orderly transition to avoid climate chaos and financial meltdown is possible, but the time for it to happen is quickly ebbing away. The time for any more backsliding has passed. \u201cThe suggestion that \u201cdecarbonising\u201d the extraction and processing of fossil fuels will solve climate change is essentially a myth. Fossil fuels must be phased out to meet our climate goals. Action on operational oil and gas emissions \u2013 especially methane - is also critical. Yet current corporate targets have significant shortcomings, and thus underestimate the impact of corporates\u2019 activities: generally they do not fully reflect methane\u2019s role in driving short term warming and almost universally exclude emissions from non-operated assets in which companies have an equity stake.\u201d Our colleagues in Baku are reporting that the current events in the plenary are pretty surreal and reflect the state of negotiations here in Baku. Each climate summit, there are around three to four hours of incredibly boring procedural items that need to be approved by the plenary: reports from vitally important but obscure and little known meetings on complicated parts of the Paris agreement. This bit usually takes place once the main deal has been reached, my colleague Fiona Harvey explains, but given the plenary has nothing substantive to approve at the moment, the Cop29 president Mukhtar Babayev appears to have gathered countries for the marathon approval session first. Guardian reporter Dharna Noor, who is in the plenary hall, says delegates are leaning over to each other whispering between themselves, looking around in confusion about what is going on. Audience members are furiously trying to follow the name of texts and items that are being approved. There are giggles in the crowd as Babayev says he invites the gaveling through expressions of gratitude to Azerbaijan for Cop29. In the meantime, the Azeri presidency is hoping that once this to-do list has been sorted, countries might have resolved their differences on climate finance and other items. Marina Silva, the Brazilian minister of the environment and climate change, spoke from the floor, telling Cop it was \u201cnecessary to find the resources - finances - to comply with 1.5C. At Cop30, our objective will be to do what is needed to keep 1.5C in reach. At Cop30 in Belem, it will be a big challenge with effort from everyone here.\u201d Holding the summit in the Amazon rainforest, a region on the frontlines of the climate crisis, will be a \u201cturning point,\u201d she said. She pointed to the \u201cdifficult experience\u201d in Baku, and said the conference needed to arrive at a \u201cminimally acceptable result\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that before we arrive at cop30, we arrive at an agreement between the global north and south. The feeling of urgency is key with this goal.\u201d She urged solidarity, and said delegates were \u201creceiving a strong message each day from all of our citizens that we first need to realign with a sense of urgency and responsibility because we are the frontline that will save humanity from much suffering and save life on the planet\u201d. Belem would be the \u201cCop of Cops\u201d, she said, and countries must come with NDCs - nationally determined contributions - aligned with 1.5C as there was \u201cno more time to lose\u201d. \u201cMay we weave with the weavers of the Amazon and all the traditional peoples of the world\u2026so we can weave and trust so we can have a better world and better planet for all life and human kind.\u201d The mood was tense as Cop29 president Mukhtar Babayev kicked off the plenary shortly after 8 pm on Saturday. \u201cThe eyes of the world are focused on us. However, time is not on our side,\u201d he says, encouraging compromise. He asks countries to keep their interventions short: three minutes max. They are trying to approve procedural parts of the climate summit that have reached agreement. \u201cThis is the final stretch you have all been working very hard and I know that none of us want to leave Baku without a good outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, time is not on our side.\u201d Dharna Noor Meanwhile, reaction to the Guardian revelation that a Saudi Arabian delegate has been accused of directly making changes to an official Cop29 negotiating text, is coming in. It\u2019s not good for the already embattled Azerbaijan presidency. \u201cAppalling behaviour by Saudi Arabia. A reminder that the Cop President is accountable to every nation not to an obstructionist petrostate,\u201d said Catherine McKenna, former climate minister for Canada and chair of the UN group on net-zero emissions commitments. Harjeet Singh, climate activist and at the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said there was \u201can unholy alliance between the fossil fuel industry and wealthy producing nations\u201d. He said: \u201cClimate negotiations are already burdened by a deep trust deficit, and any move to weaken the commitment to phasing out fossil fuels will have catastrophic consequences. Prioritising the interests of this industry over the lives of hundreds of millions of vulnerable people is nothing short of a moral failure. We must condemn these actions and protect the integrity of the multilateral process before it is too late.\u201d Romain Ioualalen, at Oil Change International, said: \u201cIt was clear from day one that Saudi Arabia and other fossil fuel-producing countries were going to do everything in their power to weaken the landmark COP28 agreement on fossil fuels. At COP29, they have deployed obstructionist tactics to dilute action on the energy transition.\u201d \u201cWhile Saudi Arabia\u2019s obstructionism is undeniable, we can\u2019t forget that countries such as the US, Canada, or Australia are also expanding fossil fuel production and are being as obstructionist in the finance negotiations,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about editing text - it\u2019s about honoring commitments and protecting our collective future.\u201d As the delegates file into the main negotiating hall for the closing plenary, we have little idea what is going to happen following an afternoon of walkouts and disagreements. Time is of the essence. This could be a tactic from the Azeri president to force disagreements into the open and try to resolve them in front of the world, which is high risk. Let\u2019s see. As ministers and delegates enter the hall, they are greeted by activists holding signs telling the global north to pay up. Long queues of observers and the world\u2019s media are zig zagging out into the corridor. Delegates are now streaming into the plenary for what may be the final session of Cop. After some hours of discussion about whether the talks would continue into tomorrow, the opening of the meeting is an optimistic sign that perhaps, somehow, resolution can be found tonight. Running a UN climate Cop is hard - you have to get almost 200 nations to agree. But countries, like the Cop29 hosts Azerbaijan, volunteer for the job, and there is growing unhappiness about their performance. Earlier this week, Steven Guilbeault, Canada\u2019s Environment and Climate Change Minister spoke to Canada\u2019s National Observer. \u201cThe lack of ambition from the presidency so far is deplorable.\u201d \u201cI think it is possible to have ambitious agreements regardless of where [COPs] happen, but there needs to be a willingness on the part of the presidency and the host country to be looking out for the interests of the commons, and not their self-interest.\u201dOil and gas account for 90% of Azerbaijan\u2019s exports. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what the current presidency is doing, but they haven\u2019t shown the type of leadership we\u2019ve come to expect from a country that is hosting a COP,\u201d Guilbeault said. Today, German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said of one negotiating text: \u201cThe EU, along with the most vulnerable countries, small island states, the least developed countries as well as countries from Latin America and all other developed countries have clearly stated that the current text is unacceptable. We do not understand why the presidency is tabling a text in the end game that does not even attempt to balance interests.\u201d The Alliance of Small Island States, especially vulnerable to climate breakdown, also complained today of not being included properly in the talks after walking out of a key meeting in protest. \u201cWe have found ourselves continuously insulted by the lack of inclusion,\u201d said Cedric Schuster, Samoan chair of AOSIS. One activist, who could not be named, told the Guardian: \u201cThe good thing about [Azerbaijan] being an autocratic state is that you can have a total collapse here and leave with your popularity unscratched.\u201d Part of the blame for today\u2019s chaos rests with recalcitrant countries. But the nations still in the negotiating rooms will be reluctant to criticise the presidency with which they still have to work, making the public criticism so far significant. As momentum drains away again, people are settling in for what could be a long wait. One of the key challenges facing the summit now is whether it will lose quorum. Simon Evans at Carbon Brief has usefully broken down what that means, and what the implications could be. QUORUM: As the talks at #COP29 extend deep into overtime \u2013 amid chaotic scenes, confusion and walkouts by the LDCs and AOSIS \u2013 it\u2019s worth reviewing the UNFCCC rules of procedure: Two-thirds of Parties must be present for decisions to be made (130/195 parties to the Paris Agreement, or 132/198 for UNFCCC). COLLAPSE?: The risk is that even if there\u2019s willingness to keep talking, many parties will be catching their flights home. Eventually, there will be too few to reach quorum. (This just happened at the biodiversity COP16 talks in Colombia.) COP-BIS: If they lose quorum in Baku, our understanding is talks will have to be suspended pending a \u201cCOP-bis\u201d, from the Latin word meaning \u201ctwice\u201d or \u201cagain\u201d. This happened at COP6 in the Hague, in 2000, which concluded the following summer in Bonn, at COP6bis. The rumours of whether there will still be a plenary today continue. Early statements that the final plenary would happen at 1900 today were, as many feared, wrong. Now it could be eight, or even tomorrow. Malcolm Bryan Stufkens Stelgado, who is leading negotiations for Honduras, just strolled out of the negotiators meeting. \u201cNothing is happening in there,\u201d he said. The current goal for climate finance, he said, is not enough because it represents \u201cmoney that\u2019s already being mobilised,\u201d not new climate finance. There is \u201cno clarity\u201d as to where things will end up, he said. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s still going to be a long night.\u201d A Saudi Arabian delegate has been accused of directly making changes to an official Cop29 negotiating text, it can be revealed. Cop presidencies usually circulate negotiating texts as non-editable PDF documents to all countries simultaneously, which are then discussed. Giving one party editing access \u201crisks placing this entire Cop in jeopardy\u201d, said one expert. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is regarded by many as a persistent obstructor of action to cut the burning of fossil fuels at UN climate summits and has been described as a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d at Cop29. Earlier on Saturday, a document was circulated by the Azerbaijani presidency with updates to the negotiating text on the Just Transition Work Program (JTWP). This aims to help countries move to a cleaner and more resilient future, while reducing inequalities. The document was sent with \u201ctracked changes\u201d from the previously circulated version. In two cases, the document showed edits were made directly by Basel Alsubaity, at the Saudi Ministry of Energy, and the lead on the JTWP. It was not sent to other countries to edit, the Guardian was told. One of the changes deletes a section of text reading \u201cencourages parties to consider just transition pathways in developing and implementing NDCs, NAPs and LT-LEDSs that are aligned with the outcome of the first global stock take and relevant provisions of the Paris agreement\u201d. Catherine Abreu, director at the International Climate Politics Hub and Cop veteran, said: \u201cAll parties need to see presidency texts during this process as the negotiations proceed and this is generally done by circulating non-editable PDF documents to all parties simultaneously. \u201cGiving one party editing access to these documents, and a party known for its objective of rolling back the historic global agreement made last year to transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy and energy efficiency, suggests a worrying lack of independence and objectivity and clearly contravenes both the spirit and the rules of this process,\u201d she said. \u201cThis kind of behaviour from a presidency risks placing this entire Cop in jeopardy.\u201d Two groups \u2013 the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries walked out of key meeting on Saturday, saying they were not being consulted by the presidency. German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, speaking on Saturday before the editing revelation, said: \u201cWe are in the midst of a geopolitical power play by a few fossil fuel states. We will not allow the most vulnerable, especially the small island states, to be ripped off by the few rich fossil fuel emitters who have the backing, unfortunately, at this moment of the president [of Cop29].\u201d A 2023 report from the Climate Social Science Network concluded: \u201cOne nation has had an outsized role in undermining progress at global climate negotiations, year after year: Saudi Arabia. The fossil fuel giant has a 30-year record of obstruction and delay, protecting its national oil and gas sector and seeking to ensure UN climate talks achieve as little as possible, as slowly as possible. \u201cRiyadh\u2019s envoys are among the most active across all tracks of UN climate talks, frequently pushing back on efforts to curb fossil fuels\u201d, it said. \u201cDespite increased temperatures across Saudi Arabia and falling groundwater supplies, Riyadh has shown little sign of shifting strategy.\u201d The Cop29 presidency, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Saudi delegation have been contacted for comment. As we wait for the next development, it\u2019s worth reflecting on the fact that developing countries are already spending vast sums of their own money on tackling the climate crisis. Whatever finance is provided by the rich world must be regarded in light of that ongoing effort, according to the UN\u201ds development chief. Campaigners have repeatedly reminded delegates here that what developing countries are seeking is not charity. Developed countries caused the climate crisis through their burning of fossil fuels, and developing countries are now spending billions every year on boosting renewable energy, reshaping their economies, and trying to adapt their infrastructure to the impacts of extreme weather. According to the International High Level Expert Group on climate finance, made up of leading economists, by 2030 developing countries excluding China can be expected to spend about $1.4 trillion a year from their own budgets on climate-related activities. I caught up with Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, earlier in these talks, ahead of the current wrangles over texts at Cop29. \u201cDeveloping countries are actually investing hundreds of billions of dollars a year already from their own taxpayers\u2019 revenue, in climate action. It wouldn\u2019t hurt or harm anyone on the other side of the table to acknowledge that. Because it kind of creates a more level playing field, and we get away from the zero sum game psychology.\u201d The figures involved might seem large, but are not in terms of the total global economy, he added. \u201cThe $1.3 trillion [that is the figure representing the total finance flows to developing countries from the rich world by 2035, likely to be agreed at Cop29] is not an irrational order of magnitude, when looking at climate finance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s out of this world. It would allow a world of 8bn people to accelerate and raise their levels of ambition in decarbonising their economies.\u201d The money would not all be coming from developed country taxpayers, he added. \u201cChina, India and the emerging economies are essentially financing their climate transitions out of their own resources, their taxpayers\u2019 money plus significant private sector and capital market investments. We need to help the public understand that this is not talking about $1.3 trillion of taxpayers\u2019 money from the Global North, being syphoned out and invested in the developing countries or the Global South.\u201d Money from public financial institutions in the developed world that goes towards climate finance would also help to \u201cmobilise\u201d large amounts of private sector investment, he added. \u201cIt is guaranteed to have a remarkable multiplier function in terms of additional capital that will mobilise to make these transitions happen. And again, this is not imagined. We already have a decade behind us where we have invested trillions in renewable energy infrastructure and expansion of clean energy production, that in significant parts was financed by the private sector, by enterprise, by investors, by capital markets.\u201d More money was also needed on adaptation, Steiner said. \u201cAdaptation is essentially a tax on development. They have to spend money to stay in the same place because they can\u2019t invest in expanding the infrastructure, education, digitalisation, because they\u2019re essentially having to protect their current development assets from either destruction or even having to invest in earlier recovery and reconstruction. Take Pakistan; one flood event cost $30bn, probably much more even if you take the cumulative damage.\u201d He also warned against too much private finance being provided in the form of loans that could push countries deeper into debt. \u201cThese are debts that are in a sense being accumulated on top of an already unsustainable debt in many of these economies. And that\u2019s why we need to push as hard as possible, that for those countries, if you want them to pivot forward, that a significant amount of that funding and financing is actually more than just concessional. It should be grant based or close to being the equivalent of grant based financing.\u201d Fiona Harvey and Patrick Greenfield The Alliance of Small Island States has just sent out a statement saying that they are still taking part in the process. \u201cLet me make it clear that the Alliance of Small Island States remains committed to this process and are here in the spirit of good faith in multilateralism to secure the best deal that will protect not just us, but the world from the worst impacts of climate change. \u201cWe have presently removed ourselves from the stalled NCQG discussions, which were not offering a progressive way forward. We want nothing more than to continue to engage, but the process must be INCLUSIVE. If this cannot be the case, it becomes very difficult for us to continue our involvement here at COP29.\u201d Meanwhile ministers and country representatives are still leaving the meeting room after groups representing vulnerable nations walk out of finance talks. Many have nothing to say to the media as they shuffle past but a handful are speaking. Kevin Conrad, a delegate with Honduras, said \u201cAosis and LDCs walked out of the meeting saying that their needs weren\u2019t being considered. To be fair, everyone understands they are the most vulnerable but they are asking for very hard fixed numbers dedicated to them and there is a lot of resistance from developing countries. They are asking for 30% of all finance,\u201d he said. Ali Mohamed, from Kenya representing the Africa group, \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a deal where the developed world are made accountable for the delivery of grant based and concessional finance that is at least $600bn and the rest mobilised... Anything lower than that will not help the world tackle climate change.\u201d The Guardian understands many donor countries do not have a mandate to go above $300bn for the climate finance target. Lots of developing countries are pushing for far more. The G77 and China are pushing for at least $500bn, according to one source. Susana Muhamad, Colombia\u2019s environment minister, said: \u201cThe text is still not very clear. There is a divide on responsibilities. We need to make that very clear. The text should be clear. The responsibility should be clear and the quantum [the amount of climate finance on offer] should be stepped up.\u201d The summit is now well into overtime in Baku. The sun has set and there is still no sign of a deal. Delegates, especially those from developing countries, will need to start heading home to all corners of the Earth. The Guardian understands that the Azeri presidency is asking country representatives who are able to stay until Monday. But most nations will be long gone by then and there will likely not be enough negotiators in the room for a legitimate deal. Just two weeks ago, the same happened in Cali, Colombia; countries were negotiating well into the night on biodiversity targets when they ran out of time. A head count was called and there were not enough countries in the room, so the meeting ended abruptly in disarray. Behind the scenes, there are growing fears this could happen in Baku. Many delegates are here with their luggage ready for flights in the early hours of Sunday morning. Our understanding is that two thirds of the Parties to the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol, or the Paris Agreement would have to be present in order to be able to make a Cop decision. This is something to watch in the coming hours. It is not going well. Chris Bowen, the Australian minister for climate change, has already headed to the airport. He was booked to go today, so that he could get back to Australia in time to attend parliament on Monday. The rest of the Australia delegation is still here though. Adam Norton and Dharna Noor reports that John Podesta, the US climate envoy, has just left the meeting too. As he left, followed by a press pack and security, activists shouted \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cYou promised to pay your fair share\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this is the storm before the calm,\u201d Podesta told journalists. Jennifer Morgan, the German representative for international climate policy, also left, looking grim. When asked if she could comment, she refused. Patrick Greenfield and Fiona Harvey report: Two groups \u2013 the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries \u2013 have thrown down the gauntlet at a meeting. They\u2019ve now said they want a guaranteed 30% of climate finance, and then walked out of meeting room three. Speaking with journalists after walking out, representatives from Sierra Leone and Samoa expressed their frustrations with talks. \u201cWe have just walked out. We came to this Cop for a fair deal. We feel that we haven\u2019t been heard and there is a deal to be made. We are not being consulted. That\u2019s why we are here but we are here to negotiate. We walked out because at the moment, we don\u2019t feel that we are being heard,\u201d said the representative from Samoa. \u201cWe are the countries that are probably the most affected by climate change. Our countries have not contributed a lot but we are affected. That\u2019s why we are here to negotiate on behalf of our countries. We\u2019ve made our needs and wants known. We are being ignored. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve walked out,\u201d said the representative from Sierra Leone. Mohamed Adow of Power Shift addressed the press outside: What has happened here today is that the moral compass of the world, the most vulnerable countries, have walked out of the negotiations after they failed to honour the promises they had made to provide climate finance. The rich world has refused to honour their obligations. As a result the Least Developed Countries and the Alliance of Small Island States have walked out of the negotiations and say they cannot associate themselves with the draft which was put forward by the presidency. The Guardian understands that Aosis and the LDCs only walked out of the finance meeting, not Cop29 itself. More reaction to the news that the offer will be increased to $300bn from Laurie van der Burg, at Oil Change International: \u201cThis is embarrassing. The increase from $250 billion to $300 billion a year is not a meaningful increase from the previous $100 billion by 2020 goal that rich countries failed to meet. What\u2019s more, this is not debt-free finance. It allows rich countries to dodge the climate debt they owe to the Global South by relying on the private sector, creating a debt trap for countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis. Research is clear that the Global South needs trillions to meet climate goals, phase out fossil fuels, and to brace itself for and recover from climate impacts. \u201cRich countries must seriously step up and pay the trillions they owe to the Global South. They can raise over $5 trillion every year for climate action if they end fossil fuel handouts, tax the super rich, and change unfair global financial rules.\u201d \u201cWhat will I tell my children when I get back home? You left us for two weeks, for what? For nothing! Not even peanuts!\u201d As the talks limp on, with increasing anger and chaos on all sides, activist Tetet Lauron at COP29 calls out the despair of developing countries as the negotiations grind on. \u201cEnough with the lies. We see through you. This farce has been going on not just in the last two weeks but for the last thirty years. \u201cYou say this is crunch time? We\u2019ve passed that line long ago. Our people have been dying. Our people have been displaced. The climate crisis is upon us and we did not cause it.\u201d Meanwhile dozens of activists gathered in the Cop29 halls on Saturday afternoon, holding signs that said \u201cpay up or shut up and \u201ctrillions not billions.\u201d The protestors called on developing countries to \u201chold the line\u201d if they do not win a deal that represents their interests. \u201cNo deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d they chanted. At a media huddle after the protest, climate activist Brandon Wu from the NGO ActionAid said: \u201cThe reason that we\u2019re saying no deal is better than a bad deal is not just because of the number. A bigger number with the text that we have right now is just a bigger empty promise.\u201d The new text, he said, aims to address some of activists\u2019 concerns. But \u201cit\u2019s not good enough,\u201d he said, because it doesn\u2019t call for enough finance to be \u201cprovided\u201d instead of \u201cmobilized\u201d. In UN climate jargon, mobilized finance can include private sector co-investing with governments. My colleague Fiona Harvey wrote earlier this afternoon about the difference. Ministers and their staff are trying to get into a crucial meeting between heads of delegations here in Baku, which still has not begun. Only ministers/heads of delegation and a member of staff are allowed. I am waiting outside with Guardian colleagues and the rest of the world\u2019s media. Some staff have left their possessions inside but UN security is not letting anyone else in the room. Representatives from Malawi, Russia and elsewhere are stuck outside. Colombian environment minister Susana Muhamad just tried unsuccessfully to get an advisor through. There\u2019s a lot of waiting around and chaos in Baku, and it does not sound like much is being resolved in the meantime. A representative from Mali, the only one in the room, just had a lengthy back and forth with security about whether he\u2019d be allowed back in if he went to the toilet. In the end, the conclusion was that he would be. The UN climate chief Simon Stiell has had to come outside and tell security to get on with it. \u201cThe meeting will not start until everyone is ready,\u201d those waiting outside are told. Party delegates are deep in negotiations at the Cop29 conference center. Outside a meeting room, Panama\u2019s special representative for climate change, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez said his mood had changed in the past two hours of negotiations. \u201cI thought we were getting a deal about 2 hours ago,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening, I don\u2019t think no one knows what\u2019s happening.\u201d He said rich countries have failed to put forth an acceptable goal for climate finance. A draft text released yesterday placed the figure at $250bn by 2035, and he said the nations have not budged. \u201cIt\u2019s still $250 which is just ridiculous,\u201d he said \u201cIt feels like we just wasted the past two hours. Even if the goal increases to $300bn by 2035 \u2013 an increase to which the Guardian learned developed countries have agreed \u2014 he said that would not be enough. If the goal is that low, he said, countries should agree to meet it sooner. \u201c I cannot tell you what we\u2019re going to accept or not,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they want to go low then they also need to reduce the timeframe.\u201d Climate finance is a key issue for Panama, he said. Developed nations \u201cmust pay\u201d to help the global south cope with climate damages. \u201cIt\u2019s their responsibility. They must pay for it. We are the victims of this and it just keeps getting kicked and kicked and kicked. Fiona Harvey and Damian Carrington It\u2019s getting heated at Cop29 and German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has excoriated \u201cgeopolitical power play by a few fossil fuel states\u201d. \u201cWe are in the midst of a geopolitical power play by a few fossil fuel states. Their playing board is the backs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries. We as a European Union will not accept a deal that comes at the expense of those who suffer most from the effects of climate crisis. \u201cWe will not allow the most vulnerable, especially the small island states, to be ripped off by the few rich fossil fuel emitters who have the backing, unfortunately, at this moment of the President [of Cop29]. \u201cClimate finance and CO2 reduction are closely linked. We, as the EU, therefore increased our financing commitments until 2035. We are continuing to work on building bridges. We are living up to our responsibilities, including as historical CO2 emitters. What we are seeing here is the last stand by the old fossil fuel world. What we need now are conditions across continents for climate justice, for viable climate financing and for continuation of the path we took in Dubai [when nations agreed to \u2018transition away from fossil fuels\u201d, making clear, there\u2019s a vast majority of countries from all around the world believing that climate justice is in the benefit of all and that the strong shoulders carry the heaviest burden.\u201d Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is a persistent obstructor of action to cut the burning of fossil fuels at UN climate summits. It\u2019s been described as a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d at Cop29. It usually works behind the scenes. But on Thursday, Albara Tawfiq from the Saudi delegation told delegates at Cop29: \u201cThe Arab group will not accept any text that targets any specific sectors, including fossil fuels.\u201d No surprises here, but the draft text released on Friday included what can be read as confirmation that the Australia-Turkey stand-off over who will host Cop31 in 2026 will not be resolved in Baku and will be pushed into next year. The countries both announced their bids to host two years ago, and the public and private lobbying has escalated in recent weeks. Australia says it wants to host the event in partnership with Pacific island countries. The Australian climate change minister, Chris Bowen, stopped in Ankara on his way to Azerbaijan to try to persuade his counterpart, Murat Kurum, to step aside. And the issue was raised during a meeting between the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on the sidelines of G20 in Brazil last week. Australia is understood to have the support of at least 23 of the 29 members of the Western European and Others Group that will decide where the event is held, including the UK, US, Germany, France and Canada, but Turkey has doubled-down on its campaign. Its representatives have pointed to Australia\u2019s substantial coal and gas exports \u2013 it is the third-biggest fossil fuel exporter \u2013 and suggested a federal election due by May next year raises uncertainty over the Australian bid. Bowen responded publicly this week, telling the Guardian that \u201cclarity would be good for everyone involved\u201d \u2013 a diplomatic way of urging the Turkish to exit the race \u2013 and pointing out only six of 29 Cops have been held in the southern hemisphere. The last Cop in the Asia-Pacific was Bali in 2007. None of this has moved the needle. The draft text released Friday said a decision should be made no later than June, when diplomats hold a mid-year climate meeting in Bonn, but it is possible it may not be made until the world reconvenes in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil for Cop30. Spotted just now by my colleague Adam Morton, the EU commissioner Wopke Hoekstra, the US climate envoy John Podesta, the UK\u2019s net zero secretary of state Ed Miliband, and Australia\u2019s Chris Bowen are seen here deep in urgent conversation in the corridor at Cop29. Hallo, this is Bibi van der Zee, taking over from my colleague Ajit Niranjan. Everything is still on hold in Baku as the conference waits for a new draft text, following a wholesale rejection of the terms offered in the last one. The enormous gap between what developing countries have asked for and what developed countries are prepared to offer is very far from being bridged. In theory there will be a final plenary later today, but in practice who knows? We\u2019ll be bringing you all the updates as they come. If you\u2019re looking for a heartwarming story away from the frustration, boredom and tension of high-level climate negotiations, my colleague Patrick Barkham has a touching piece on a 12-year-old girl in Slovenia who is helping to bring back singing cicadas to the UK. Take a minute to tune out of Cop coverage and read it here. Adaptation often gets overlooked, but the new buzzword at Cop29 is \u201ctransformational\u201d adaptation. What this means is taking a holistic view of adaptation, and making sure it is addressed systematically by countries, instead of approaching it on an ad hoc, project by project basis. So for instance a country could take steps to overhaul its urban planning system to ensure that new buildings are not being constructed in areas vulnerable to flooding, or change its land use policies to ensure that forests are kept standing, which can protect against mudslides and flooding, and wetlands are intact, to hold more water when rains come, which can protect against drought. Some forms of adaptation can also help to reduce emissions, and some emissions reduction techniques can also help with adaptation. For instance, helping people in poor countries to use solar cookstoves can reduce their dependence on firewood \u2013 which cuts emissions and helps keeps forests standing. I spoke to Eamon Ryan, the Irish environment minister who is co-chair of the adaptation work here at Cop29, ahead of the draft texts which are now being argued over. \u201cAs we can already see, devastating climate change is coming, even if we stop emissions tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to prepare. And we need to do that particularly in developing countries, because they are the ones being hit most and they are least able to prepare. Many of them also have very small emissions.\u201d Adaptation had often been an afterthought at Cops, he added. \u201cThis whole process has tended to focus on emissions, rightly in some ways, but hasn\u2019t put adaptation centre stage.\u201d The most vulnerable countries are most in need of finance for adaptation, but most climate finance has gone towards middle income countries or those already able to adapt. Adaptation is not one of the most controversial issues at Cop, as most countries agree it should have more focus. The issue of \u201ctransformational adaptation\u201d has also caught people\u2019s imagination, Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a more radical, a more systemic approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to progress that. We need to ensure that is now worked on. I think it\u2019s going to be quite big in future.\u201d He said it was important for Cop29 to recognise the vital role of adaptation in tackling the climate crisis. \u201cOur job is to make sure we keep it centre stage,\u201d he said. Patience appears to be wearing thin in the final stages of negotiations. Speaking about the just transition work program, which tries to help countries move to a cleaner and more resilient future while decreasing inequalities, German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said: \u201cThe EU, along with the most vulnerable countries, small island states, the least developed countries as well as countries from Latin America and all other developed countries have clearly stated that the current text is unacceptable. We do not understand why the presidency is tabling a text in the end game that does not even attempt to balance interests.\u201d An agreement on carbon markets has all but been agreed, new texts indicate. They are at the draft decision stage, meaning that they are \u201cnot 100% but, like, 99%\u201d ready to go, according to Carbon Brief\u2019s Simon Evans. The deal will set out the rules for country-to-country carbon trading and provides for the creation of a regulated global market to meet Paris targets, although technical rules for how this works will be sorted out in 2025. If you would like to read more about what this all means, we prepared an explainer at the start of Cop29 on the good, the bad and the ugly of carbon markets. Climate campaigners do not appear to have been impressed by the prospect of a higher finance target of $300bn. Jasper Inventor at Greenpeace said the money that rich countries are understood to have agreed to overnight was \u201cstill not enough.\u201d \u201cWe are running out of time and a much better deal quickly needs to be put on the table to match the urgent and escalating needs of developing countries,\u201d he said. Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, said the overall number is \u201ceffectively meaningless\u201d because it doesn\u2019t say who should pay. \u201cWhere will the pressure be to deliver that number if it\u2019s not clearly stated to come from the rich world?\u201d he asked. Adow said: Developed countries here are trying to unpick the delicate balance agreed in the Paris Agreement. They want to remove any responsibility from themselves to provide climate finance and instead just have everyone making voluntary contributions to the pot. That would be a fundamental re-writing of the entire UN negotiation process and rip up previous COP agreements. Rich countries have caused the climate crisis. Ever since the first COP it has been recognised that they owe a climate debt to the countries of the global south, to help them cope with the climate crisis they have created. They must not be allowed to dodge that responsibility. As Cop29 grinds on, something to look out for is how much finance is \u201cprovided\u201d, and how much is \u201cmobilised\u201d. They might sound like the same thing, but not at a Cop. Finance that is provided comes from developed country governments or publicly funded institutions in the form preferably of grants, and highly concessional loans \u2013 loans at very low rates of interest. Finance that is mobilised can include private sector co-investing with governments. So the EU provides about $30bn of climate finance every year \u2013 but it mobilises a further $7bn through private sector co-investing. Poor countries, quite reasonably, want their climate finance in the form of grants, to avoid getting further into debt. But some countries are deeply reluctant to provide money in this way. France, for instance, through its AFD (Agence Francaise de Developpement) historically provides nearly all its climate finance in the form of loans. The reasoning behind this is that it gives recipient countries more incentive to spend the money in the most efficient way, and gives the providing country some form of accountability over how the money is spent. (It is also treated differently in the developed country\u2019s own budgets and accounting.) The big downside is that it counts towards debt for developing countries, which is why many rich countries are more willing to talk about grants, and deals such as \u201cdebt for climate swaps\u201d. It\u2019s also important to note that the habit of preferring loans is not confined to developed countries \u2013 China also provides most of its \u201csouth-south\u201d cooperation in the form of loans, on which developing countries are currently paying more than $300bn a year in interest alone. At Cops, there are no hard and fast definitions of climate finance. That is partly in order to give both donors and recipients some degree of flexibility. It is also because there is little agreement on what such a definition should be. If climate finance had to be defined, several participants told the Guardian, this Cop would have to go on for months longer rather than (hopefully) mere hours. What definitions there are go back to the 1992 UNFCCC, the Paris agreement of 2015, and decisions of various Cops in between. For instance, article 11 of the UNFCCC states: \u201cA mechanism for the provision of financial resources on a grant or concessional basis, including for the transfer of technology, is hereby defined. It shall function under the guidance of and be accountable to the Conference of the Parties, which shall decide on its policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria related to this Convention. Its operation shall be entrusted to one or more existing international entities.\u201d And in the Cancun accords of 2010, paragraph 98 states: \u201cRecognises that developed country Parties commit, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries; 99. Agrees that, in accordance with paragraph 1(e) of the Bali Action Plan, funds provided to developing country Parties may come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources; from Decision 1/CP.16.\u201d Social media boosters for Azerbaijan\u2019s authoritarian regime are working the weekend, praising President Ilham Aliyev for his \u201cstrong political will\u201d which \u201cplayed a decisive role in our success today\u201d. That will confuse the delegates at Cop29, who remain a long way from any success, and who also remember Aliyev\u2019s extraordinarily undiplomatic statements at the start of the summit. He doubled down on oil and gas being a \u201cgift from God\u201d and then accused France of brutal suppression and killings in the Pacific island region. France, which has supported Armenia in its conflict with Azerbaijan, then cancelled the attendance at Cop29 of its top climate official. Countries hosting Cops usually put aside bilateral disagreements in order to act as neutral brokers in the negotiations. The Guardian revealed in October an army of apparently fake social media accounts boosting Azerbaijan\u2019s hosting of Cop29 . Our reporters Dharna Noor and Patrick Greenfield have hit upon a problem that makes the sums of money on the table at Cop29 considerably smaller than people may first think. The proposed text on climate finance released at Cop29 makes no mention of inflation. This makes a massive difference to the scale of finance being discussed. In 2009, developed countries agreed that by 2020, they would collectively mobilize $100bn per year to support developing countries\u2019 decarbonization and adaptation plans. US dollar inflation was 20.6% in this time period. But when monitoring contributions, inflation was not taken into account, the OECD confirmed to the Guardian. As a result, the target became easier to meet over time, though countries met it late. The Cop29 draft texts released on Friday set a new proposed finance goal: $250bn by 2035. But they will not rise over time to keep pace with inflation. This has a very big impact on numbers, as the analysis shows below. $100bn in 2009 dollars would equal $145.3bn today if we adjust for US inflation in this time period. Returning to the proposed $250bn target, that becomes $345bn if we assume the average annual inflation rate of the US of 2.38% over the last 15 years, according to a back-of-the-napkin calculation from my colleague Patrick Greenfield. \u201cAgreeing a figure of $250 billion mobilised per year by 2035 would not only be inadequate but shameful. Adjusted for inflation, it represents virtually no increase in public finance from developed countries beyond the $100 billion commitment made 15 years ago,\u201d Salom\u00e9 Lehtman, project and advocacy advisor at Mercy Corps, said. And $390bn annually \u2013 the number proposed in a study by top academics as fair and in line with the Paris agreement \u2013 would in 2035 be $538bn in today\u2019s money, assuming the same rate of inflation. \u201cTargets will need to adjust for inflation over time,\u201d Amar Bhattacharya, the executive secretary of the UN\u2019s independent high-level expert group on climate finance and co-author of the study, told the Guardian. Put another way, the proposed $250bn target for 2035 is really a $197.6bn target, assuming the same inflation rate. This means the target is not even a doubling. \u201cThe proposed climate finance goal in the latest text is an embarrassment,\u201d said Collin Rees, a manager at the climate justice NGO Oil Change International, who shared calculations from the IMF with the Guardian. As we await new Cop29 draft texts on Saturday morning, I chatted to Thoriq Ibrahim, climate, energy and environment minister for the Maldives, who is leading negotiations for the small island nation. Yesterday\u2019s drafts were \u201ctotally unacceptable,\u201d he said. The $250bn goal put forth for climate finance was \u201cabsolutely not at all adequate,\u201d he said, and \u201cbarely an improvement\u201d on the $100bn goal set in 2009. \u201cIf you look at the $250 billion with inflation, it\u2019s almost same goal,\u201d he said. Rich countries have privately agreed to up the goal to $300bn, the Guardian learned this morning. The minister said he could not comment on whether that figure would be acceptable until it is officially on the table. But the number is not the only concern for vulnerable countries, he said. Small, vulnerable island nations have said they must be allocated at least $39 billion a year to cope with the costs of the climate crisis. No such provision was in yesterday\u2019s draft text, Ibrahim noted. \u201cWe raised this concern with the presidency,\u201d he said. \u201cThey listened, they said that they will be talking with the rest of the groups.\u201d Upon the release of yesterday\u2019s text, activists said that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d and said they had heard growing calls for a walkout. Ibrahim declined to comment on their remarks, but said: \u201cWe want to [leave] this Cop and go home with an acceptable, agreeable outcome, but one has to be on the table.\u201d Marching in silence with their arms crossed high, activists from around the world protested the draft deal at the Cop29 venue last night. \u201cPay up or shut up!\u201d the campaign group Demand Climate Justice said in a post on social media. Safa\u2019 Al Jayoussi from Oxfam described it as a \u201cshameful failure of leadership\u201d. \u201cThe Cop29 Presidency\u2019s top-down \u2018take-it-or-leave-it\u2019 approach has sidelined progressive voices,\u201d she said. Poor countries reacted with anger to a draft $250bn climate finance target on Friday, dismissing it as a \u201cjoke\u201d. It prompted a diplomatic effort behind the scenes to increase the offer from rich countries. The Guardian understands they agreed to bump the offer to $300bn. The new figure would still fall well short of what is being demanded by poor countries, who have done little to change the climate but suffer the brunt of violent weather. As negotiators hash out a final deal at Cop29, Palestinian officials and activists are reminding attendees about another crisis: Israel\u2019s siege of Gaza. \u201cThe Cop [meetings] are very keen to protect the environment, but for whom?\u201d said Ahmed Abu Thaher, director of projects and international relations at Palestine\u2019s Environment Quality Authority, who had travelled to Cop29 from Ramallah. \u201cIf you are killing the people there, for whom are you keen to protect the environment and to minimise the effects of climate change?\u201d Activists are calling the war on Gaza an \u201cecocide\u201d and demanding countries stop sending fuel to Israel. For more, check out my story from this morning. Negotiators have told our reporters on-the-ground that rich countries have agreed to up their offer on the crucial issue of climate finance. Read the full story from Adam Morton, Fiona Harvey and the rest of the team here. Major rich countries at UN climate talks in Azerbaijan have agreed to lift a global financial offer to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis to $300bn a year, as ministers met through the night in a bid to salvage a deal. The Guardian understands the Azeri hosts brokered a lengthy closed-door meeting with a small group of ministers and delegation heads, including China, the EU, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, the UK, US and Australia, on key areas of dispute on climate finance and the transition away from fossil fuels. It came as the Cop29 summit in Baku, which had been due to finish at 6pm Friday, dragged into Saturday morning. A plenary session had been planned for 10am but did not eventuate. The developing world reacted with anger to a draft $250bn climate finance target on Friday, dismissing it as a \u201cjoke\u201d and far below the amount that is needed to help the poor shift to a low-carbon economy and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. It prompted a diplomatic effort behind the scenes to increase the offer from developed nations. Multiple sources said the EU and several members of the umbrella group of countries including the UK, US and Australia had indicated they could go to $300bn in exchange for other changes to a draft text released on Friday. The Guardian understands that the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, was ringing round capitals to push for a higher figure. Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand were understood to be among the countries resistant to the $300bn figure late on Friday. A $300bn offer would still fall well short of what developing countries say is necessary, and would likely still draw sharp criticism if included in an updated text expected later on Saturday. But with some ministers booked to leave Baku in the hours ahead, countries face a decision on what they are prepared to accept. Several ministers from rich nations have argued that a deal may be easier now than next year, when Donald Trump will be US president and right-wing governments could be returned at elections in several countries, including Germany and Canada, and they do not want to make a commitment they cannot meet. Claudio Angelo, from Observat\u00f3rio do Clima in Brazil, said rich countries had \u201cclearly arrived to ditch their obligations\u201d. \u201cAfter three years of negotiations the first time we ever saw quantum in the text was yesterday,\u201d he said. He said $300bn in grant funding was \u201cway, way below\u201d what developing countries needed. \u201cRemember, many of them are already in deep debt,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have climate finance as the current text proposes will only entrap those countries more.\u201d According to the draft text of a deal circulated on Friday, developing countries would receive at least $1.3tn a year in climate finance by 2035, which is in line with the demands most submitted in advance of this two-week conference. But poor nations wanted much more of that headline finance to come directly from rich countries, preferably in the form of grants rather than loans. They said the offer of $250bn coming from rich countries, with few safeguards over how much would come without strings attached, was much too little. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) went to Moscow to talk to Russia about oil yesterday, as delegates in neighbouring Azerbaijan struggled to bring the climate conference to a close. The dialogue highlighted energy security and \u201cthe risk of underinvestment\u201d, according to OPEC. The group posted a video on social media last night, set to dramatic orchestral strings, with pictures of OPEC\u2019s secretary-general Haitham Al Ghais and Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Alexander Novak at the 9th meeting of the OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue. It said the two groups had examined oil market developments across short, medium and long-term horizons, and that \u201ckey topics included the ongoing climate change negotiations at Cop29.\u201d Russia, which is not a member of the 12-member group but is part of the larger OPEC+ alliance that pumps half the world\u2019s oil, said it will continue to be a \u201ckey player\u201d in the oil market. Earlier this week, Al Ghais echoed Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev\u2019s comments in praise of oil and gas. \u201cThey are indeed a gift of God,\u201d he told the Cop29 summit on Wednesday. It\u2019s looking like Cop29 may run way over time. The UN climate body which runs the talks with the host nation just told me: \u201cWhile the schedule is subject to change due to ongoing negotiations, the final plenary is expected to begin in the early afternoon between 1pm and 3pm (Baku time).\u201d They are also planning to have food outlets open after 8pm this evening and into the early hours of Sunday. The latest finishing Cop was in Madrid in 2019, as this chart from Carbon Brief shows \u2013 it finished at 1.55pm on the Sunday. All Cops are meant to end on Friday. The world\u2019s most famous climate campaigner, Greta Thunberg, does not attend Cops these days, and her post on X about Cop29 shows why. She says Cop29 is failing and it \u201cup to us as a global collective to take the action we so desperately need\u201d. As the COP29 climate meeting is reaching its end, it should not come as a surprise that yet another COP is failing. The current draft is a complete disaster. But even if our expectations are close to non-existent, we must never ever find ourselves reacting to these continuous betrayals with anything but rage. The people in power are yet again about to agree to a death sentence to the countless people whose lives have been or will be ruined by the climate crisis. The current text is full of false solutions and empty promises. The money from the Global North countries needed to pay back their climate debt is still nowhere to be seen. Those in power are worsening the destabilisation and destruction of our life supporting ecosystems. We are on track to experience the hottest year ever recorded, with the global greenhouse gases reaching an all time high just last year. The COP processes aren\u2019t just failing us, they are part of a larger system built on injustice and designed to sacrifice current and future generations for the opportunity of a few to keep making unimaginable profits and continue to exploit planet and people. With every negotiation, with every speech made by a world leader and with every agreement they sign, it becomes clear that it is up to us as a global collective to take the action we so desperately need and show where the leadership truly lies. They are not going to do it for us, as this COP29 yet again proves. As we wait for signs of movement in the negotiations, the conference centre is a ghost town this morning. Gone are the crowds of delegates and rammed food halls. The organisers are busy dismantling pavilions and the network of tents built around the Olympics stadium here in Baku. Competition for food, water and toilet roll is a growing issue. This morning, the New York Times ran a story about Singapore beer made from recycled toilet water on offer at Cop29. In a few hours, maybe that will start to seem appealing. Air conditioning units have been turned up to 30C in some areas, literally turning the heat up for negotiators. Everything about the venue is telling those that remain to get on with it, reach a deal and leave. But at the time of writing, no time for a plenary is listed on the TV screens. We continue to wait. As we wait for the new text to land it\u2019s worth looking back at the closing summary from yesterday, when the conference should have ended. Yesterday\u2019s closing summary: Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and twice a UN climate envoy, said rich country budgets were stretched amid inflation, Covid and conflicts including Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and warned that poorer countries might have to compromise. The UK government pledged \u00a3239m to tackle deforestation In an unusual intervention, the UAE stepped in and warned that the world must stand behind a historic resolution made last year to \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d as the Saudis tried to block the language. The draft text was published, but met a pretty hostile reception. It called for $1.3tn by 2035. Civil society called it \u201can absolute embarrassment\u201d Few countries have spoken up so far, but their reactions have been mixed. The Australian climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has responded to the latest text from the presidency, describing it as a \u201cgenuine attempt\u201d. But Amb Ali Mohamed, Kenya\u2019s Special Envoy for chair of the African Group of Negotiators called it as \u201ctotally unacceptable and inadequate.\u201d We are into overtime at Cop29 in Baku and we are still waiting for signs of compromise. It could be a very long Saturday in the Azeri capital, where a plenary is currently scheduled to take place at 10am local time. The developing world reacted with anger to a draft $250bn climate finance target yesterday, dismissing it as a \u201cjoke\u201d and far below the amount that is needed. Behind the scenes, a diplomatic effort is underway to increase the offering from rich nations to make sure the deal survives. The Guardian understands that the UN secretary general is ringing round capitals to push for a higher figure. The EU is among those open to $300bn but Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand do not want to raise the offer, it is understood. Let\u2019s see who budges, if anyone. Among donor countries, there is anxiety about what Donald Trump\u2019s return to the US presidency will mean for climate finance, and they do not want to overcommit to a figure they cannot deliver. This, combined with the potential of right wing governments in France, Germany, Canada and elsewhere, means that things are in the balance in Baku. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Cop29 climate conference, I\u2019m Ajit Niranjan. After a fortnight of negotiations, talks overran well past the Friday evening deadline as countries negotiated over what should appear in the agreed text. The key question is over climate finance: how much money should be provided to poorer countries by wealthier ones, and what form it should take. We will be bringing you all the latest developments as they happen. You can also get in touch with us at cop29@theguardian.com.",
