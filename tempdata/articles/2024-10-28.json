The demonstration outside the parliament in the city centre was organised by the country\u2019s pro-western opposition, which has refused to concede defeat and has accused the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party of election rigging. The pro-western Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, whose role is largely ceremonial, said on Sunday she did not recognise the official results and claimed the country had fallen victim to a \u201cRussian special operation\u201d aimed at pulling it back into Moscow\u2019s orbit and derailing its plan to join the European Union. \u201cThey stole your vote and tried to steal your future. But no one has the right to do that, and you will not allow it,\u201d Zourabichvili told the crowd on Monday, who waved EU and Georgian flags. She told Reuters that she believed \u201cthe methodology used and the support of most probably Russian FSB [federal security service] types is shown in this election.\u201d Russia rejected the allegations of election interference. The FSB, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, was unavailable for comment. At the protest, several opposition leaders demanded new elections, to be overseen by an international commission, and announced that their parties would not take up their seats in parliament, setting the stage for a prolonged political crisis. The country\u2019s electoral commission announced on Sunday that the increasingly authoritarian GD secured 54% of the vote, winning 89 seats in the parliament. Voters in the Caucasus country of almost 4 million people had headed to the polls on Saturday in a watershed election to decide whether GD, which has been in power since 2012 and steered the country into a conservative course away from the west and closer to Russia, should get another four-year term. The Georgian opposition contends that the ruling party has engaged in widespread election tampering, citing stark discrepancies between the initial results and an exit poll conducted by western pollsters that showed the ruling party winning only 40% of the vote. A preliminary report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said it \u201cnoted reports of intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters\u201d, calling the conduct of the election evidence of \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d in the country. The result thwarts the opposition\u2019s hopes for a united pro-western coalition of four blocs and in effect stalls the country\u2019s aspirations for EU integration. \u201cI am here because the government rigged the elections, stealing our voices and our right to choose our future,\u201d said Kato Bochorishvili, a 21-year-old economics student. \u201cWe want the world to know that we chose Europe, not Russia. I just hope the world can hear us,\u201d she said. Support for the pro-western opposition groups generally comes from urban and younger voters, who envision their political future with the EU. GD, led by the secretive billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, has made conservative and illiberal values central to its campaign, alongside saying that the pro-western opposition would pull Georgia into a conflict with Russia, similar to Ukraine\u2019s. The US and the European Union urged full investigations of the result of Saturday\u2019s election. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, criticised \u201cmisuse of public resources, vote buying, and voter intimidation\u201d, which he said \u201ccontributed to an uneven playing field\u201d. Matthew Miller, US state department spokesperson, later added that the US was in talks with European partners on what would be an appropriate body to investigate reports of violations. He added that Washington could take action if the government does not heed calls to \u201cwalk back its anti-democratic actions and return to its Euro-Atlantic path\u201d. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry condemned \u201csignificant irregularities\u201d and France also expressed concerns over \u201cirregularities observed before and during the vote\u201d, urging a full investigation. But western officials stopped short of declaring the election stolen or falsified and refrained from calling for a boycott of the results. Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesperson, said the election result was \u201cthe choice of the Georgian people\u201d and accused the west of trying to destabilise the situation. Georgia\u2019s prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, accused the opposition of attempting to \u201cshake the constitutional order\u201d, local media reported. He said his government remained committed to European integration. In a move that angered fellow EU leaders and the Georgian opposition, Viktor Orb\u00e1n landed in Tbilisi on Monday after becoming the first western leader to congratulate the ruling GD party for its \u201coverwhelming victory\u201d. Orb\u00e1n, who has recently cultivated close ties with the GD party, was spotted entering the Marriott Hotel just steps away from where the protest was taking place. It is not immediately clear where the Georgian opposition goes from here, with many in the country visibly frustrated by what they say is a lack of western support. The election results also suggest GD retains support from a core group of Georgian voters, particularly in industrial heartlands and conservative, poorer regions where economic progress has been slow and the appeal of Europe feels distant and faint. Last spring, tens of thousands of people already protested in Tbilisi to demonstrate against a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u2019\u201d bill that critics argued was designed to stifle the country\u2019s media and NGOs. But those protests gradually faded after a police crackdown and a series of arrests. Monday\u2019s demonstrations were significantly smaller, suggesting the protest movement lacks momentum. Anton Shekhovtsov, the director of the Vienna-based Centre for Democratic Integrity, said Europe\u2019s cautious response showed it did not \u201chave the spirit and consensus to openly challenge the Georgian government. Without any clear, explicit support either from the election monitoring missions or the EU, Georgians are left alone today in their fight for a European future.\u201d On Monday, some protesters appeared deflated. \u201cGeorgian Dream has already won,\u201d said Irma Khoperia, a 55-year-old artist. \u201cThey will never give up power voluntarily. They\u2019ll turn this country into a dictatorship.\u201d GD has been accused by critics at home and abroad of plans to move the country in an authoritarian direction after Ivanishvili vowed to ban all the leading opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers if his party was re-elected. Like others at the protest that night, Khoperia called on the west to sanction the GD leader and his party. \u201cWe would like the west to support us more. They should stand by our side and speak out against this vote theft,\u201d Khoperia said. Other protesters vowed to return to the streets until a new election was held. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, but I remain hopeful \u2013 otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Tekle Makashvili, a PhD student in Tbilisi. \u201cWe will keep fighting until this country is free again.\u201d",

In the middle of that series, Australia also managed to pull off a nine-goal win. Meanwhile in the 2024 series, the Diamonds have lost by 14, 11 and 18 and have not even looked competitive. They have suffered big defeats before \u2013 a 25-goal loss to New Zealand in 2005 in a match when Ellis tore her anterior cruciate ligament stands out \u2013 but a dig through the history of the Australian team uncovers very few losses with double digit margins.

Captain Liz Watson only managed six goal assists in her 35 minutes on court in Sunday\u2019s game, while also giving away three turnovers. Defensive stalwart Courtney Bruce recorded just one deflection and one gain in her 42 minutes, giving up 11 penalties and two turnovers. Paige Hadley \u2013 who has been part of the Diamonds set up for almost 12 years \u2013 stepped out of court with the ball after a hard-fought gain by her defenders in the third quarter, handing the ball straight back to the Silver Ferns, in a moment that was emblematic of the match.</p> <p>With two years before the Commonwealth Games and three years until the next Netball World Cup, it is not the worst time for the Diamonds to be facing a crisis. They hold a strong margin at the top of the world rankings list and can afford some losses as they experiment with their team and look for a way to reassert their dominance. Coach Stacey Marinkovich showed her willingness to experiment during Sunday\u2019s match, bringing in the relatively inexperienced Matilda Garrett and Rudi Ellis, along with debutante Georgie Horjus. While the changes did not pay off on the scoreboard, they at least indicate that Marinkovich is open to a changing of the guard. With only pride to play for in the final game of the series, there will be plenty of eyes on the Australian coach to see if she will start her struggling senior players from the bench and give the younger players the benefit of a clean slate, rather handing them than the almost insurmountable task of clawing back a deficit.</p> <p>Despite the unprecedented situation the Diamonds find themselves in, it is unlikely their era of dominance is over. For all the fears that surrounded the Constellation Cup loss in 2021, the team did not \u201cget used\u201d to losing \u2013 the will to win is too deeply embedded in Diamonds\u2019 culture to be lost forever. But how long it will take to dig themselves out of this hole remains to be seen and may come down to the courage to make risky selection calls while time is on their side. If those calculated risks are taken now, this series may become yet another minor slump that ultimately precedes glory.</p>",

With two years before the Commonwealth Games and three years until the next Netball World Cup, it is not the worst time for the Diamonds to be facing a crisis. They hold a strong margin at the top of the world rankings list and can afford some losses as they experiment with their team and look for a way to reassert their dominance. Coach Stacey Marinkovich showed her willingness to experiment during Sunday\u2019s match, bringing in the relatively inexperienced Matilda Garrett and Rudi Ellis, along with debutante Georgie Horjus. While the changes did not pay off on the scoreboard, they at least indicate that Marinkovich is open to a changing of the guard. With only pride to play for in the final game of the series, there will be plenty of eyes on the Australian coach to see if she will start her struggling senior players from the bench and give the younger players the benefit of a clean slate, rather handing them than the almost insurmountable task of clawing back a deficit. Despite the unprecedented situation the Diamonds find themselves in, it is unlikely their era of dominance is over. For all the fears that surrounded the Constellation Cup loss in 2021, the team did not \u201cget used\u201d to losing \u2013 the will to win is too deeply embedded in Diamonds\u2019 culture to be lost forever. But how long it will take to dig themselves out of this hole remains to be seen and may come down to the courage to make risky selection calls while time is on their side. If those calculated risks are taken now, this series may become yet another minor slump that ultimately precedes glory.",

Rodri, on the other hand, is here on crutches, which may tell its own story. Or there may be another twist in the tale, with France Football\u2019s countdown of the top 30 now under way.</p> \n  <p>The women\u2019s award is also being dished out tonight, with <strong>Aitana Bonmat\u00ed</strong> the favourite to retain her crown and continue Barcelona\u2019s dominance after Alexia Putellas won it in 2021 and 2022. Another Bar\u00e7a player, <strong>Caroline Graham Hansen</strong>, could be a contender alongside <strong>Mariona Caldentey</strong>, who left Catalonia to join Arsenal in the summer.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Time to sign off, I\u2019ll leave you with Nick Ames\u2019 web report on events in Paris. Thanks for reading along, it\u2019s been fun. Adios! Before we go, here\u2019s a reminder of all tonight\u2019s award winners, and the top 30 lists in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s awards. I\u2019d also like to pitch in with a late award, for the Sorest Losers \u2026 congratulations to Real Madrid. I\u2019ll let Sean Orlowicz give the speech. \u201cReally beautiful to see Real Madrid fans, supporters of the most successful club both historically and very recently, completely melt down over a meaningless individual award. What modern football fans seem to want more than anything \u2013 goals, attractive football, wins, trophies \u2013 is to be the downtrodden victim of some grand conspiracy.\u201d \u201cFor a game that hails itself as a team sport, it\u2019s a strange decision by Real to snub the awards on the basis that Vin\u00edcius would not win an individual prize, while the team and its manager actually won awards,\u201d writes Krishna. \u201cI have never cared one bit about this award, I think individual awards make no sense in a team sport, even more so when comparing players of different positions,\u201d says Adam Becker. \u201cThat said, the Real drama has sucked me in and I have been checking this blog every few minutes though. Was this all some kind of ploy to get people interested?\u201d Here\u2019s a nice video montage from Manchester City on what makes Rodri great: Last year, we ranked a Manchester City player as the best in the world \u2013 but it was Erling Haaland, with Rodri fifth. Will a Real Madrid player top our new chart in December, or will Florentino P\u00e9rez be boycotting the Guardian? Men\u2019s award: full ranking 1 Rodri (Manchester City/Spain) 2 Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior (Real Madrid/Brazil) 3 Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid/England) 4 Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid/Spain) 5 Erling Haaland (Man City/Norway) 6 Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (Real Madrid/France) 7 Lautaro Mart\u00ednez (Inter, Argentina) 8 Lamine Yamal (Barcelona/Spain) 9 Toni Kroos (Real Madrid/Germany) 10 Harry Kane (Bayern Munich/England) 11 Phil Foden (Man City/England) 12 Florian Wirtz (Leverkusen/Germany) 13 Dani Olmo (Barcelona/Spain) 14 Ademola Lookman (Atalanta/Nigeria) 15 Nico Williams (Athletic/Spain) 16 Granit Xhaka (Leverkusen/Switzerland) 17 Federico Valverde (Real Madrid/Uruguay) 18 Emiliano Mart\u00ednez (Aston Villa/Argentina) 19 Martin \u00d8degaard (Arsenal/Norway) 20 Hakan Calhanoglu (Inter/Turkey) 21 Bukayo Saka (Arsenal/England) 22 Antonio R\u00fcdiger (Real Madrid/Germany) 23 R\u00faben Dias (Man City/Portugal) 24 William Saliba (Arsenal/France) 25 Cole Palmer (Chelsea/England) 26 Declan Rice (Arsenal/England) 27 Vitinha (PSG/Portugal) 28 Alejandro Grimaldo (Leverkusen/Spain) =29 Mats Hummels (Roma/Germany) =29 Artem Dovbyk (Roma/Ukraine) Stanley Matthews, Denis Law, Bobby Charlton, George Best, Michael Owen, Cristiano Ronaldo \u2026 Rodri. Rodri\u2019s win is historic on many levels \u2013 he\u2019s the first Manchester City player to win the award (Shaun Goater was robbed, imo), and only the seventh man to win it while playing in the English league. He is also \u2013 and this is scarcely believable \u2013 the first Spanish player to win the men\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or since Luis Su\u00e1rez in 1960! Rodri is now talking to the hosts in English. \u201cI always try to improve every day, the level of my game, [playing] the modern holding midfielder role, playing further forward.\u201d What\u2019s he like off the field, they ask. \u201cI\u2019m just a normal guy, I enjoy sport, enjoy my profession. I try to be a good person, try to be a leader. I\u2019m a calm person, until I get upset. I\u2019d like to show the kids that you don\u2019t have to be crazy, you can be a normal guy, try to do your best.\u201d He says his injury is healing: \u201cFeeling much better \u2026 it\u2019s part of life, part of sport.\u201d He plans to rest and enjoy some time with his family, be positive and come back stronger. Will he sleep with the trophy tonight? \u201c100%!\u201d \u201cAn incredible night for me,\u201d he says in English before switching to Spanish. \u201cIt\u2019s a special day for me, my family and my country,\u201d and thanks his girlfriend, Laura. \u201cIt\u2019s our anniversary \u2013 she is the most important person in the world to me.\u201d He thanks his Manchester City teammates \u2013 \u201cfor me, this is the best club in the world\u201d \u2013 and his fellow Spain players for their Euro 2024 success. He tells Lamine Yamal he will win this award too one day, if he keeps working hard. Rodri also talks about failing a trial at 17, and thinking his career was over \u2013 but his parents told him to keep trying. Apologies that this is something of a brief summary, the feed was dubbed and farcically hard to hear in either language. It looks like Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior came second, with Jude Bellingham and Dani Carvajal in third and fourth. Three of the top four, four of the top six for Real \u2013 but not the big one. And the winner is \u2026 Rodri! He was a distant second favourite yesterday, but that all changed today and once he showed up and Real Madrid didn\u2019t, the writing was on the wall. But today\u2019s drama and pettiness aside, he\u2019s a deserving winner. These things are hard to judge across a single season, but he has won the Euros, scored a Champions League winner, and is the most vital cog in one of the world\u2019s best club teams. So the men\u2019s award will be won by either Manchester City\u2019s Rodri, or one of the Real Madrid trio of Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Dani Carvajal or Jude Bellingham. City legend George Weah is presenting the award. An omen? There is, of course, also the fact nobody from Real Madrid is in the building. Anyway, let\u2019s enjoy a reel of Weah\u2019s best bits, incuding that goal. He is also asked who his favourite current player is, and he points out Harry Kane, who looks genuinely chuffed. Now some chat with Didier Drogba. Very nice stuff, but can we maybe get to the award now, George? It\u2019s an all-Barcelona top three: Women\u2019s award: full ranking 1 Aitana Bonmat\u00ed (Barcelona/Spain) 2 Caroline Graham Hansen (Barcelona/Norway) 3 Salma Paralluelo (Barcelona/Spain) 4 Sophia Smith (Portland/USA) 5 Lindsey Horan (Lyon/USA) 6 Mallory Swanson (Chicago/USA) 7 Marie-Antoinette Katoto (PSG/France) 8 Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal/Spain) 9 Trinity Rodman (Washington/USA) 10 Alexia Putellas (Barcelona/Spain) 11 Patri Guijarro (Barcelona/Spain) 12 Barbra Banda (Orlando/Zambia) 13 Lauren James (Chelsea/England) 14 Ada Hegerberg (Lyon/Norway) 15 Khadija Shaw (Man City/Jamaica) 16 Tabitha Chawinga (PSG/Malawi) 17 Alyssa Naeher (Chicago/USA) 18 Gabi Portilho (Corinthians/Brazil) 19 Giulia Gwinn (Bayern/Germany) 20 Lucy Bronze (Chelsea/England) 21 Mayra Ram\u00edrez (Chelsea/Colombia) 22 Gl\u00f3dis Vigg\u00f3sd\u00f3ttir (Bayern/Iceland) 23 Tarciane (Houston/Brazil) 24 Lea Sch\u00fcller (Bayern/Germany) 25 Sj\u0153ke N\u00fcsken (Chelsea/Germany) 26 Yui Hasegawa (Man City/Japan) 27 Manuela Giugliano (Roma/Italy) 28 Lauren Hemp (Man City/England) 29 Ewa Pajor (Wolfsburg/Poland) 30 Grace Geyoro (PSG/France) \u201cIf Vin\u00edcius loses out to Rodri, will vote-splitting among the five Real Madrid players in the top 10 be to blame?\u201d asks Kari Tulinius. \u201cOr does the voting process guard against that in some way?\u201d I don\u2019t really want to get into voting protocols at this stage of the evening, but you may well be right; as far as I can tell, there\u2019s no limit on how many players from one club you can vote for. Having tweeted the top 30, player-by-player, for the last five hours, France Football are now being coy about Nos 2-4. Here\u2019s a clip of Aitana Bonmat\u00ed\u2019s speech, in Spanish and dubbed in French, which is not ideal but we are where we are. \u201cI feel bad for Carlo Ancelotti,\u201d writes Krishna Moorthy. \u201cA gentleman manager with a character to go along with it. It\u2019s a pity that he had to toe the line of the club\u2019s direction. How many millimeters do you think that eyebrow went up today?\u201d In this category at least, the hot favourite has won. Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmat\u00ed wins the prize for a second time, retaining it from last year, and following on from clubmate Alexia Putellas\u2019s double. It\u2019s well deserved, she\u2019s a phenomenal player who has won the World Cup and Champions League (twice) in the last 18 months. Now it\u2019s time for the real quiz, as we hand out the Ballons d\u2019Or. First, the women\u2019s award, which is being presented by Natalie Portman. The Hollywood actor is a part-owner of Angel City FC in the USA, and reveals that she goes to watch Paris Saint-Germain quite often. A crowd-pleasing choice. So, Real Madrid add men\u2019s coach of the year to the team of the year prize \u2013 and four of the top six players in the men\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or countdown. Carlo Ancelotti isn\u2019t here, of course, and we move swiftly on. This is the award for the coach of the year, with a women\u2019s category for the first time this year. It goes to Emma Hayes, former Chelsea coach who led the USA to Olympic gold in the summer. She accepts the award via a video link message. \u201cMisread the names and thought the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, was up for the Yashin Trophy. Pretty impressive for a 74-year old,\u201d writes Chris Plant, whose name I initially misread as Chris Pratt. I must admit I wasn\u2019t familiar with Ronwen Williams either \u2013 but this interview with Ed Aarons is a great starting point. Men\u2019s award: live ranking 5 Erling Haaland (Man City/Norway) 6 Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (Real Madrid/France) 7 Lautaro Mart\u00ednez (Inter, Argentina) 8 Lamine Yamal (Barcelona/Spain) 9 Toni Kroos (Real Madrid/Germany) 10 Harry Kane (Bayern Munich/England) 11 Phil Foden (Man City/England) 12 Florian Wirtz (Leverkusen/Germany) 13 Dani Olmo (Barcelona/Spain) 14 Ademola Lookman (Atalanta/Nigeria) 15 Nico Williams (Athletic/Spain) 16 Granit Xhaka (Leverkusen/Switzerland) 17 Federico Valverde (Real Madrid/Uruguay) 18 Emiliano Mart\u00ednez (Aston Villa/Argentina) 19 Martin \u00d8degaard (Arsenal/Norway) 20 Hakan Calhanoglu (Inter/Turkey) 21 Bukayo Saka (Arsenal/England) 22 Antonio R\u00fcdiger (Real Madrid/Germany) 23 R\u00faben Dias (Man City/Portugal) 24 William Saliba (Arsenal/France) 25 Cole Palmer (Chelsea/England) 26 Declan Rice (Arsenal/England) 27 Vitinha (PSG/Portugal) 28 Alejandro Grimaldo (Leverkusen/Spain) =29 Mats Hummels (Roma/Germany) =29 Artem Dovbyk (Roma/Ukraine) The top four, in no particular order: Jude Bellingham, Dani Carvajal, Rodri, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior. Next up, it\u2019s the Socrates Award, which is given to a footballer for their off-field, charity or humanitarian work. Last year\u2019s winner was \u2013 oh! \u2013 Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior. This year, the award goes to \u2026 Spain forward Jennifer Hermoso! Hermoso wins the award for her \u201cexemplary role in the development and equality in women\u2019s football,\u201d for standing up for her rights \u2013 under intense pressure \u2013 after being forcibly kissed by Luis Rubiales, the Spanish FA chief now consigned to the dustbin of football history. Women\u2019s award: live ranking 5 Lindsey Horan (Lyon/USA) 6 Mallory Swanson (Chicago/USA) 7 Marie-Antoinette Katoto (PSG/France) 8 Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal/Spain) 9 Trinity Rodman (Washington/USA) 10 Alexia Putellas (Barcelona/Spain) 11 Patri Guijarro (Barcelona/Spain) 12 Barbra Banda (Orlando/Zambia) 13 Lauren James (Chelsea/England) 14 Ada Hegerberg (Lyon/Norway) 15 Khadija Shaw (Man City/Jamaica) 16 Tabitha Chawinga (PSG/Malawi) 17 Alyssa Naeher (Chicago/USA) 18 Gabi Portilho (Corinthians/Brazil) 19 Giulia Gwinn (Bayern/Germany) 20 Lucy Bronze (Chelsea/England) 21 Mayra Ram\u00edrez (Chelsea/Colombia) 22 Gl\u00f3dis Vigg\u00f3sd\u00f3ttir (Bayern/Iceland) 23 Tarciane (Houston/Brazil) 24 Lea Sch\u00fcller (Bayern/Germany) 25 Sj\u0153ke N\u00fcsken (Chelsea/Germany) 26 Yui Hasegawa (Man City/Japan) 27 Manuela Giugliano (Roma/Italy) 28 Lauren Hemp (Man City/England) 29 Ewa Pajor (Wolfsburg/Poland) 30 Grace Geyoro (PSG/France) The top four (in no particular order): Aitana Bonmat\u00ed, Caroline Graham Hansen, Salma Paralluelo, Sophia Smith. \u201cI hope there will be wider acknowledgement of how classless it is for Real Madrid to boycott this event,\u201d writes Ben Hardman. \u201cThey have won the award multiple times in recent years. To win Team of the Year and refuse to turn up claiming an agenda is not a good look. It stinks of entitlement.\u201d It\u2019s also part of a tedious modern trend: big, rich and hugely dominant clubs who can bend the fabric of the game to their will, complaining that they\u2019re victims of an agenda. It is indeed the Aston Villa and Argentina custodian, who won the Copa Am\u00e9rica and helped Villa into the Champions League. He retains the trophy from last year, and manages to accept it without placing it somewhere hilarious on his anatomy. Unai Sim\u00f3n came second after winning the Euros with Spain, with Andriy Lunin of Real Madrid in third for his performances covering for Thibaut Courtois. The Ukrainian is back on the bench now, though. The Ballons d\u2019Or have been removed from their Louis Vuitton lock-boxes, live on stage. Pure theatre. Anyway, the next award is the Lev Yashin Trophy, which is going to one of these keepers. Emi Martinez or Mamardashvili, you\u2019d imagine \u2026 Diogo Costa, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Gregor Kobel, Andriy Lunin, Mike Maignan, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, Unai Sim\u00f3n, Yann Sommer, Ronwen Williams. Men\u2019s award: live ranking 8 Lamine Yamal (Barcelona/Spain) 9 Toni Kroos (Real Madrid/Germany) 10 Harry Kane (Bayern Munich/England) 11 Phil Foden (Man City/England) 12 Florian Wirtz (Leverkusen/Germany) 13 Dani Olmo (Barcelona/Spain) 14 Ademola Lookman (Atalanta/Nigeria) 15 Nico Williams (Athletic/Spain) 16 Granit Xhaka (Leverkusen/Switzerland) 17 Federico Valverde (Real Madrid/Uruguay) 18 Emiliano Mart\u00ednez (Aston Villa/Argentina) 19 Martin \u00d8degaard (Arsenal/Norway) 20 Hakan Calhanoglu (Inter/Turkey) 21 Bukayo Saka (Arsenal/England) 22 Antonio R\u00fcdiger (Real Madrid/Germany) 23 R\u00faben Dias (Man City/Portugal) 24 William Saliba (Arsenal/France) 25 Cole Palmer (Chelsea/England) 26 Declan Rice (Arsenal/England) 27 Vitinha (PSG/Portugal) 28 Alejandro Grimaldo (Leverkusen/Spain) =29 Mats Hummels (Roma/Germany) =29 Artem Dovbyk (Roma/Ukraine) Remaining nominees: Jude Bellingham, Dani Carvajal, Erling Haaland, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Rodri, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior. Women\u2019s award: live ranking 8 Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal/Spain) 9 Trinity Rodman (Washington/USA) 10 Alexia Putellas (Barcelona/Spain) 11 Patri Guijarro (Barcelona/Spain) 12 Barbra Banda (Orlando/Zambia) 13 Lauren James (Chelsea/England) 14 Ada Hegerberg (Lyon/Norway) 15 Khadija Shaw (Man City/Jamaica) 16 Tabitha Chawinga (PSG/Malawi) 17 Alyssa Naeher (Chicago/USA) 18 Gabi Portilho (Corinthians/Brazil) 19 Giulia Gwinn (Bayern/Germany) 20 Lucy Bronze (Chelsea/England) 21 Mayra Ram\u00edrez (Chelsea/Colombia) 22 Gl\u00f3dis Vigg\u00f3sd\u00f3ttir (Bayern/Iceland) 23 Tarciane (Houston/Brazil) 24 Lea Sch\u00fcller (Bayern/Germany) 25 Sj\u0153ke N\u00fcsken (Chelsea/Germany) 26 Yui Hasegawa (Man City/Japan) 27 Manuela Giugliano (Roma/Italy) 28 Lauren Hemp (Man City/England) 29 Ewa Pajor (Wolfsburg/Poland) 30 Grace Geyoro (PSG/France) Remaining nominees: Aitana Bonmat\u00ed, Caroline Graham Hansen, Marie-Antoinette Katoto, Salma Paralluelo, Sophia Smith, Mallory Swanson, Lindsey Horan. Anyway, back to the awards \u2013 next, it\u2019s the Gerd M\u00fcller award, for the man with the most goals last season. And it\u2019s a tie, between Harry Kane and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who both scored 52 goals. Kane, as the only one of the two actually here, comes up to give a short speech, claiming he is clearly superior to Mbapp\u00e9 and this was all his own work thanking his teammates and France Football, and adding that it\u2019s nice to win an award named after a Bayern Munich legend. It\u2019s nice to see Harry get his hands on a trophy \u2013 but it\u2019s a bitter irony that even when he wins something, he has to share it with another player. Were Hummels and Dovbyk always sitting next to Rodri, or \u2026 ? Well, this is awkward. Real Madrid win the men\u2019s club of the year prize, but nobody from the club is here to collect it. Real haven\u2019t tweeted about the award, or any other Ballon d\u2019Or news \u2013 this is their only tweet today. It\u2019s \u2026 a choice. Barcelona win women\u2019s club of the year! The all-conquering queens of Spain and Europe beat Lyon in last season\u2019s Women\u2019s Champions League final, their third title in four years. \u201cI would like to dedicate this award to my mother and my grandmother who have always supported me,\u201d Yamal says. \u201cBut also to my teams and my coaches.\u201d Bar\u00e7a\u2019s starboy finished ahead of Arda Guler and Kobbie Mainoo, with Savinho fourth and Pau Cubarsi fifth. The ceremony begins, with Didier Drogba and Sandy Herbert hosting. Ruud Gullit is on stage to present the first award of the night \u2013 the Kopa Trophy for best young (U21) player. It goes to \u2026 Lamine Yamal! At the age of 17, he\u2019s the first player under 18 to win the award. The various nominees in attendance are now being called out on to the stage in pairs, some of which make sense \u2013 Rodri and Luis de la Fuente, Yamal and Putellas \u2013 others less so. Alejandro Garnacho and Aitana Bonmat\u00ed? Here\u2019s the Barcelona contingent arriving on the red carpet \u2026 Lamine Yamal is the hot favourite to win this year\u2019s Kopa Trophy \u2013 maybe Real Madrid aren\u2019t coming tonight because they don\u2019t want to run into him again \u2026 As far as I can tell, there is still no L\u2019Equipe livestream for the ceremony, which is due to start in about 15 minutes. It\u2019s also not available to watch on TV (in the UK, at least). Seems a strange setup for such a popular and significant event. Rodri is here, using crutches to cross the red carpet after suffering a season-ending ACL injury last month. He says he\u2019s \u201cfeeling good\u201d despite being early in his recovery, and insists he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know anything\u201d about tonight\u2019s outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to be nominated.\u201d The Barcelona admin is at it here, surely \u2026 One member of Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League winning 23-24 team who is talking tonight is Toni Kroos. The midfielder, who retired after Germany\u2019s Euro 2024 exit, has said \u201cRodri will win,\u201d adding: \u201cI have never seen the importance of these individual awards in football, they have no place.\u201d Spain coach Luis de la Fuente, who is at tonight\u2019s ceremony, says: \u201cIt is not good for football that a club like Real Madrid is not present at an event of this nature.\u201d A reminder of the day\u2019s big development \u2013 Real Madrid reportedly cancelled their delegation\u2019s trip to Paris, because they believe Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior will not win the men\u2019s award tonight. If all of this is true, there\u2019s still time for organisers to give Vin\u00edcius the award tonight while Real Madrid collectively sulk in Spain. I think even Rodri might see the funny side. \u201cRegardless of whether Real Madrid may be right about Rodri taking home the prize, isn\u2019t skipping the event a childish lack of respect?\u201d asks Rosario Russo. Oh yes, absolutely it is. If a Real Madrid player wins the award next year, why should anyone else bother to turn up? Here\u2019s Harry Kane, who has made the top 10. Who knows, he might have been a contender tonight had Bayern beaten Real Madrid, England defeated Spain at the Euros, and Kane had not been worked into the ground by the season\u2019s business end. Mario Balotelli \u2013 who finished 23rd on the 2012 shortlist \u2013 has joined Serie A strugglers Genoa. Back in 2016, the Italian said he \u201ccould have already won\u201d the Ballon d\u2019Or, but hoped to still win \u201cin the next three years\u201d. Not going to happen now of course, but I\u2019d like to see him shine one more time. For the first time in 20 editions of the men\u2019s award, neither Cristiano Ronaldo nor Lionel Messi are on the 30-player shortlist. Messi (with eight) and Ronaldo (five) have held a grip on this golden ball for the past two decades, but now that era is over. Plus awards for coaches and clubs \u2026 Men\u2019s club of the year: Leverkusen, Dortmund, Girona, Manchester City, Real Madrid. Women\u2019s club of the year: Barcelona, Chelsea, Lyon, NJ/NY Gotham, Paris Saint-Germain. Men\u2019s coach of the year: Xabi Alonso (Leverkusen), Carlo Ancelotti (Real Madrid), Luis de la Fuente (Spain), Gian Piero Gasperini (Atalanta), Pep Guardiola (Manchester City), Lionel Scaloni (Argentina). Women\u2019s coach of the year: Sonia Bompastor (Lyon/Chelsea), Arthur Elias (Corinthians/Brazil), Jonatan Gir\u00e1ldez (Barcelona), Emma Hayes (Chelsea/USA); Filipa Pat\u00e3o (Benfica), Sarina Wiegman (England). Some of the other awards already have shortlists announced, including these prizes for players: Kopa Trophy (best young player \u2013 men\u2019s award only): Pau Cubars\u00ed, Alejandro Garnacho, Arda G\u00fcler, Karim Konat\u00e9, Kobbie Mainoo, Jo\u00e3o Neves, Savinho, Mathys Tel, Lamine Yamal, Warren Za\u00efre-Emery. Yashin Trophy (best goalkeeper \u2013 men\u2019s award only): Diogo Costa, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Gregor Kobel, Andriy Lunin, Mike Maignan, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, Unai Sim\u00f3n, Yann Sommer, Ronwen Williams. The men\u2019s list continues with Nos 15-11: Nico Williams, Ademola Lookman, Dani Olmo, Florian Wirtz and Phil Foden. A quality quintet there, and no mistake. The good news for Roma is that they have two players on the top 30 shortlist. The bad news is they finished joint-29th (i.e. bottom) of that list \u2013 and neither played for them last season. Another early arrival at the ceremony is Marcel Desailly. As good an excuse as any to recommend Jonathan Liew\u2019s interview with the France, Milan and Chelsea legend. Men\u2019s live ranking 11 Phil Foden (Man City/England) 12 Florian Wirtz (Leverkusen/Germany) 13 Dani Olmo (Barcelona/Spain) 14 Ademola Lookman (Atalanta/Nigeria) 15 Nico Williams (Athletic/Spain) 16 Granit Xhaka (Leverkusen/Switzerland) 17 Federico Valverde (Real Madrid/Uruguay) 18 Emiliano Mart\u00ednez (Aston Villa/Argentina) 19 Martin \u00d8degaard (Arsenal/Norway) 20 Hakan Calhanoglu (Inter/Turkey) 21 Bukayo Saka (Arsenal/England) 22 Antonio R\u00fcdiger (Real Madrid/Germany) 23 R\u00faben Dias (Man City/Portugal) 24 William Saliba (Arsenal/France) 25 Cole Palmer (Chelsea/England) 26 Declan Rice (Arsenal/England) 27 Vitinha (PSG/Portugal) 28 Alejandro Grimaldo (Leverkusen/Spain) =29 Mats Hummels (Roma/Germany) =29 Artem Dovbyk (Roma/Ukraine) Remaining nominees: Jude Bellingham, Dani Carvajal, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, Toni Kroos, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Rodri, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Lamine Yamal. Here comes the Spain manager, Luis de la Fuente, looking like he\u2019s on his way to collect an Oscar after his three-hour historical drama won Best International Feature Film. \u201cWill an American ever win the Ballon d\u2019Or someday?\u201d asks Kurt Perleberg. Well, Megan Rapinoe has won it, and I\u2019ll wager that another USWNT player will follow suit in the next few years. As for the men\u2019s award, it\u2019s hard to see it happening in the near future. It seems to me that a lot of US players with big potential end up hitting a ceiling \u2013 Gio Reyna, Folarin Balogun, Weston McKennie, even Christian Pulisic. But who knows. Men\u2019s live ranking 16 Granit Xhaka (Leverkusen/Switzerland) 17 Federico Valverde (Real Madrid/Uruguay) 18 Emiliano Mart\u00ednez (Aston Villa/Argentina) 19 Martin \u00d8degaard (Arsenal/Norway) 20 Hakan Calhanoglu (Inter/Turkey) 21 Bukayo Saka (Arsenal/England) 22 Antonio R\u00fcdiger (Real Madrid/Germany) 23 R\u00faben Dias (Man City/Portugal) 24 William Saliba (Arsenal/France) 25 Cole Palmer (Chelsea/England) 26 Declan Rice (Arsenal/England) 27 Vitinha (PSG/Portugal) 28 Alejandro Grimaldo (Leverkusen/Spain) =29 Mats Hummels (Roma/Germany) =29 Artem Dovbyk (Roma/Ukraine) Remaining nominees: Jude Bellingham, Dani Carvajal, Phil Foden, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, Toni Kroos, Ademola Lookman, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Dani Olmo, Rodri, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Nico Williams, Florian Wirtz, Lamine Yamal. There are some big names missing from the women\u2019s top 30 \u2013 including Naomi Girma, Keira Walsh, Kadidiatou Diani and Olga Carmona. Tonight\u2019s ceremony also won\u2019t award a Kopa or Yashin award to a female player, and is taking place on the eve of Euro 2025 qualifiers. Is the Ballon d\u2019Or really treating the women\u2019s game equally? Women\u2019s award live ranking: 11 Patri Guijarro (Barcelona/Spain) 12 Barbra Banda (Orlando/Zambia) 13 Lauren James (Chelsea/England) 14 Ada Hegerberg (Lyon/Norway) 15 Khadija Shaw (Man City/Jamaica) 16 Tabitha Chawinga (PSG/Malawi) 17 Alyssa Naeher (Chicago/USA) 18 Gabi Portilho (Corinthians/Brazil) 19 Giulia Gwinn (Bayern/Germany) 20 Lucy Bronze (Chelsea/England) 21 Mayra Ram\u00edrez (Chelsea/Colombia) 22 Gl\u00f3dis Vigg\u00f3sd\u00f3ttir (Bayern/Iceland) 23 Tarciane (Houston/Brazil) 24 Lea Sch\u00fcller (Bayern/Germany) 25 Sj\u0153ke N\u00fcsken (Chelsea/Germany) 26 Yui Hasegawa (Man City/Japan) 27 Manuela Giugliano (Roma/Italy) 28 Lauren Hemp (Man City/England) 29 Ewa Pajor (Wolfsburg/Poland) 30 Grace Geyoro (PSG/France) Remaining nominees: Aitana Bonmat\u00ed, Mariona Caldentey, Caroline Graham Hansen , Marie-Antoinette Katoto, Salma Paralluelo, Alexia Putellas, Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith, Mallory Swanson, Lindsey Horan. Here are the baubles being handed out at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet this evening: Men\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or Women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or Kopa Trophy (best U21 player) Yashin Trophy (best goalkeeper) Gerd M\u00fcller Trophy (top goalscorer) Men\u2019s Club of the Year Women\u2019s Club of the Year Men\u2019s Coach of the Year Women\u2019s Coach of the Year Here\u2019s more on the day\u2019s big news, and the 30-player long lists which were announced in September. The countdowns have begun, so we\u2019ll bring you the latest asap \u2026 Ballon d\u2019Or. Ballon d\u2019Or! Ballon d\u2019Or!!! \u2026 Ballon d\u2019Or? Ballon d\u2019Or?! Ballon d\u2019Or??? The biggest night in football for those who refuse to accept that this is fundamentally a team sport, and that every player on earth (yes, even Cristiano Ronaldo) would swap it to win the World Cup, is here \u2013 but before the ceremony in Paris has even kicked off, there\u2019s been big drama. Ever since the moment that caused Rio Ferdinand to lose the run of himself, Real Madrid baller Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior has been the hot favourite to win the men\u2019s award. On Monday, though, speculative reports that he could be pipped to the prize by Manchester City midfield maestro Rodri soon gathered serious momentum. It is now thought that Real have thrown their collective toys from the pram, and will not be sending anyone to Paris for tonight\u2019s big shindig. Rodri, on the other hand, is here on crutches, which may tell its own story. Or there may be another twist in the tale, with France Football\u2019s countdown of the top 30 now under way. The women\u2019s award is also being dished out tonight, with Aitana Bonmat\u00ed the favourite to retain her crown and continue Barcelona\u2019s dominance after Alexia Putellas won it in 2021 and 2022. Another Bar\u00e7a player, Caroline Graham Hansen, could be a contender alongside Mariona Caldentey, who left Catalonia to join Arsenal in the summer.",

      "bodyText": "Rodri and Aitana Bonmat\u00ed have been named winners of the 2024 Ballon d\u2019Or at football\u2019s annual awards ceremony in Paris, their trophies handed out at the end of a bizarre day in which Real Madrid\u2019s delegation opted not to attend. In Rodri\u2019s case the award crowned an extraordinary year\u2019s work in which the influential Manchester City and Spain midfielder became a Premier League and European champion, also winning the Club World Cup. That was not enough to impress the contingent from Real that had been expected to attend. Their forward, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, had been hot favourite to win the award but they cancelled their plans to travel upon learning earlier in the day that he had been pipped to the prize. Rodri is sidelined with a long\u2011term anterior cruciate ligament injury, meaning he walked up to the stage aided by crutches, but the 28\u2011year\u2011old holding midfielder has become indispensable to City since arriving five years ago from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. He is the first non-forward to win the men\u2019s prize since Luka Modric in 2018. \u201cAn incredible night for me,\u201d Rodri said after receiving the trophy from George Weah, a previous winner who spent a brief spell at City in 2000. \u201cToday is a very special day, not just for me but for my family and my country.\u201d He beat Vin\u00edcius to top spot, with the Brazilian\u2019s Madrid teammate, England\u2019s Jude Bellingham, in third place. Carlo Ancelotti, the Madrid coach, won the men\u2019s Johan Cruyff award as the top manager. Before the ceremony, Madrid issued a statement to AFP and the Spanish media, saying: \u201cIf the award criteria doesn\u2019t give it to Vin\u00edcius as the winner, then those same criteria should point to [Dani] Carvajal as the winner. As this was not the case, it is clear that Ballon d\u2019Or-Uefa does not respect Real Madrid. And Real Madrid does not go where it is not respected.\u201d Moments after Rodri was announced as the winner: Vin\u00edcius posted on social media: \u201cI\u2019ll do it 10x if I have to. They\u2019re not ready.\u201d The Spurs and Brazil striker Richarlison wrote: Rodri is a great player who deserves to be among the best. But Vini not winning the Ballon d\u2019Or was embarrassing, and the only one who lost today was football.\u201d Among those supporting Rodri\u2019s victory was his Manchester City teammate, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan. \u201cFrom today on he is finally not \u2018underrated\u2019 anymore. Congratulations to my teammate Rodri on winning the Ballon d\u2019Or!\u201d he wrote. \u201cRodri is the perfect midfielder and there\u2019s no one that plays his position better than he does.\u201d Bonmat\u00ed became the second player to retain the women\u2019s award since its inception in 2018, following in the footsteps of her Barcelona teammate Alexia Putellas. The playmaker was influential in another Liga F and Champions League double for Barcelona, also pulling the strings as Spain won the women\u2019s Nations League earlier this year. \u201cWhat drives me to be here is the winning mentality that we have as a team and a national team, it\u2019s what leads you to these successes,\u201d Bonmat\u00ed said.

      "bodyText": "Israel\u2019s parliament has passed bills banning the UN agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in Israel and the Palestinian territories, designating it a terror organisation, and cutting all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. What is Unrwa? The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees is the main refugee agency for Palestinians and operates across the Middle East. It was originally set up in 1948 to support 700,000 Palestinians displaced in the war that saw Israel established, and provides services education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and runs shelters during periods of conflict. Its operations are spread across the occupied West Bank \u2013 including East Jerusalem \u2013 and the Gaza Strip, as well as Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. It is funded largely by voluntary contributions from UN member states, and also receives some funding directly from the UN. Employing 30,000 Palestinians, it serves almost 6 million refugees, including in Gaza where 1,476,706 Palestinians are registered as refugees in eight Palestinian refugee camps, while in the West Bank 800,000 are registered. During the current conflict in Gaza almost the entire population of Gaza has been reliant on Unrwa for basic necessities, including food, water and hygiene supplies. More than 200 Unrwa staff have been killed in Israeli attacks during the year-long war. Why has Israel\u2019s parliament voted to ban it? On Monday 92 Israeli MPs voted for a measure to ban Unrwa\u2019s activities in Israel while only 10 voted to oppose the measure. A second bill severed diplomatic relations with the agency. Israel has long complained that Unrwa is obsolete and its continuing support of the descendants of those initially displaced in 1948 is an impediment to a peace settlement. Critics say that Israel\u2019s own actions \u2013 not least its failure to meaningfully accept the foundation of a Palestinian state, and continued settlement activity on lands intended for that Palestinian state \u2013 represent the most significant obstacle to peace. During the current conflict with Hamas, Israel also has repeatedly claimed that Unrwa has employed militants from Hamas. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has in the past called on the US \u2013 Israel\u2019s top ally and the agency\u2019s biggest donor \u2013 to roll back its support, saying the agency is \u201cperforated by Hamas\u201d. A six-page Israeli dossier shared with the US accused 12 Unrwa staff members of taking part in the 7 October 2023 attacks, including nine who it said worked as teachers in the agency\u2019s schools. The dossier said Israel also had wider evidence that Unrwa has employed 190 Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants, which would represent 0.64% of the total Unrwa staff if true. The agency fired nine employees after an investigation but denied it knowingly aids armed groups. Unrwa, however, has long shared the list of its staff with Israel. Speaking earlier this year, the spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, reiterated the currency of this arrangement. What does the new Israeli law mean? Under the laws \u2013 which will not be implemented for several months \u2013 Unrwa could not \u201coperate any institution, provide any service, or conduct any activity, whether directly or indirectly\u201d. Opponents charge that would imperil the already fragile process for distributing aid in Gaza at a moment when Israel is under increased US pressure to ramp up aid. While most of Unrwa\u2019s activities take place in the West Bank and Gaza, it is hugely dependent on an agreement with Israel to operate, including access to border crossings into Gaza including for humanitarian aid. The legislation does not include provisions for alternative organisations to oversee its work. What do other countries say? The move is strongly opposed by numerous governments, including the UK, as well as international aid groups. They say that Israel has not only offered no suggestion of what could replace Unrwa [nothing was mentioned during the debate on the bill] but has consistently failed to articulate a \u201cday after\u201d plan for Gaza for when the conflict ends. The US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, speaking to reporters in Washington on Monday, said the Biden administration was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the legislation. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that can replace them right now in the middle of the crisis,\u201d he said. Unrwa condemned the Knesset\u2019s approval of the bill. \u201cThese bills will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians, especially in Gaza where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell,\u201d wrote Philippe Lazzarini, Unrwa\u2019s commissioner general, in a statement on X. \u201cIt \u2060will deprive [more than] 650,000 girls and boys there from education, putting at risk an entire generation of children.

What took you so long? Another demerit on the Ineos scorecard: even doing the right thing, sacking an inadequate manager, has somehow been turned into a bodge via the simple fact of delay. It was obvious Ten Hag had to go at the end of last season. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/01/jim-ratcliffe-sets-uniteds-stakes-high-for-first-manchester-derby-test\">Jim Ratcliffe had set his own criteria</a> for retention, specifically qualifying for the Champions League and developing an attractive style of play.</p> \n<p>How did that work out then? United finished eighth and are now 14th. And while attraction is clearly subjective, the defining quality of the current United team is bafflement, vagueness of purpose, a group that seems totally under-equipped for the complex task at hand, like watching a litter of well-meaning labrador puppies trying to rewire a circuit board.</p> \n<p>Ten Hag has overseen not just underachievement, but a collapse of the internal geometry of the team.

      "bodyText": "Well, that\u2019s finally happened then. On, now, to the next glorious two-year plan. The last few months of Erik Ten Hag\u2019s time at Manchester United have felt at times like a throwback to the dog days of the Soviet Union, when the Secretary of the Central Committee always seemed to be either dead or dying, wheeled out grudgingly to oversee a parade every three months, the human face of this vast, dying red bureaucracy basically a corpse in a coat propped up in front of some missiles. As of Monday afternoon we finally have clarity. The latest man in black is no more. That frowning bald Dutchman with a way of standing on the Old Trafford touchline that conveyed a strangely tender kind of pathos, a man to whom the world is simply doing things, will now receive the large payoff governed by an utterly insane two-year contract signed this summer, at a point when he was already clearly just a pair of legs in a suit. Is this the worst United sacking yet? Does it, at least, feel epic, an Event Sacking, as Manchester United sackings are supposed to? Not so much. And this is perhaps the greatest achievement of Ten Hag\u2019s time and more vitally the early days of Ineos. Between them these two entities have managed the amazing feat of transforming Manchester United, who for all their flaws are above all messy and sexy and loud, into something glacial, Soviet, and weirdly dull. It seems boasting about winning the League Cup will do that to you in the end. Ten Hag aside, the last few months of drift have been a disaster for that most vital of things, the brand, which for the first time feels a little shrunken and incidental. Above all this has been a major black eye for Ineos, which has handled the succession clumsily, and which is, so early in its time in charge, still in the process of revealing itself and its capacities. The first point to make is the obvious one. What took you so long? Another demerit on the Ineos scorecard: even doing the right thing, sacking an inadequate manager, has somehow been turned into a bodge via the simple fact of delay. It was obvious Ten Hag had to go at the end of last season. Jim Ratcliffe had set his own criteria for retention, specifically qualifying for the Champions League and developing an attractive style of play. How did that work out then? United finished eighth and are now 14th. And while attraction is clearly subjective, the defining quality of the current United team is bafflement, vagueness of purpose, a group that seems totally under-equipped for the complex task at hand, like watching a litter of well-meaning labrador puppies trying to rewire a circuit board. Ten Hag has overseen not just underachievement, but a collapse of the internal geometry of the team. Nobody has improved. No components of the team speak to one another. The outcome has been a kind of shapeless panic-football and a revolving carousel of how-about-this selections. Even the bad vibes of Ten Hag\u2019s own end times were becoming contagious. Struggling managers often use their public appearances to set the narrative of their departure. Ten Hag had taken to railing constantly about injustices, perhaps with the aim of being remembered as simply unlucky. This can also poison the waters. Matthijs de Ligt\u2019s entire United career to date seems to have involved throwing his arms wide while howling about injustice, conspiracy, chemtrails, phone masts. This hasn\u2019t been good for him. The reality of Ten Hag\u2019s time is \u00a3600m spent to make a mediocre team worse, and last season arguably the worst showing by any English team in the Champions League group stage. Through this Ten Hag has seemed constantly to be wreathed in gloom, less big club impresario more austere 16th century priest who will talk, if you really insist, about VAR and defensive mistakes, but really just wants to tell you that all human life is dark, short and joyless. And so here we are, at a point where the real story isn\u2019t actually Ten Hag at all, but Ineos and the puzzle of a much-fanfared management collective which seems, at this stage, to have no more idea of how to govern this thing than anyone else. Why did the management cartel retain Ten Hag for so long? Presumably for many reasons, not least the failure to source a replacement. In the event, those four months of delay have effectively doubled down on the bodge of the previous league season. Getting into the Champions League from this point will require a feat of dramatic resuscitation. Missing out on that expanded jamboree, for a club this size, so in thrall to their own brand power, feels like a generational mistake. Elite football is a fluid place right now. This really wasn\u2019t the moment to stumble. It feels doubly significant because the age of Ineos is still so young. Who are these people anyway? To date almost nothing has been achieved beyond the hire of some convincing-looking men in suits. Mediocre footballers continue to arrive. One of the few good decisions, cutting off Alex Ferguson\u2019s golden sinecure (Ferguson is 82: \u00a324m has been paid to him since he retired) became a poorly timed piece of anti-PR. And yet of course nothing is ever done or closed. Football constantly renews. And the question of what-next seems unusually important. Managing this vast and uncontrollable entity, with all its maddening exceptionalism, has never been easy. To be United manager is to undertake three simultaneous roles. First you need to manage the past, which is constantly in the room, rattling at the door handles, sweeping the plates from the kitchen dresser. Second, you need to manage the dysfunction of the present, from leaking roof and unbalanced squad to sui generis owners. And third you need to win, and to do so with vigour and energy, as though guiding this vast, creaking plague ship is in fact the simplest thing in the world. In the post-Ferguson death scape United have tried a proper football man, an ageing legend, a has-been giant, a club museum waxwork and a sensible but limited mid-ranger. What now? A punt on youth? Some 27-year-old polyamorous Swiss who arrives on a hoverboard and talks about domination of the non-spaces? The role of a manager is often overstated. But it is a hugely important moment for Ineos, and one of the few really significant levers they have to pull. Arguably it is the most important appointment in the club\u2019s modern history.

Gareth Southgate is in theory a culture merchant and whole-club visionary, but the job would eat him alive within six weeks (imagine the sheer volume of heartfelt open letters this is going to require). R\u00faben Amorim has been hotly tipped for the job and was also linked previously with Manchester City should Pep Guardiola decide to leave at the end of the season. Amorim is a pragmatist tactically, but a young, vigorous, charismatic one. It seems a sensible fit in outline.

He was told that \u201cnobody is above the law\u201d by a judge who said the \u201cflagrant\u201d breaches had been done in a \u201csophisticated\u201d way to ensure the false claims would achieve \u201cmaximum coverage\u201d, reaching tens of millions of people.

While two days had been set aside for the hearing, the court was told in the morning that Robinson had admitted contempt through 10 breaches of a high court order made in 2021, and which led to the solicitor general issuing two contempt applications. The hearing was told that Robinson had in effect repeated all of the allegations that led to him losing a libel case brought by Jamal Hijazi, who had been filmed being attacked at a school in West Yorkshire. Shortly after the video of the incident went viral, Robinson falsely claimed in Facebook videos that Hijazi was \u201cnot innocent and he violently attacks young English girls in his school\u201d. The false claims were repeated by Robinson in interviews with figures including Gareth Icke, son of the conspiracy theorist David Icke, and in a film made by Robinson. Entitled Silenced, it was viewed by millions of people as a result of being shared on online platforms including that of the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate.

At the start of the hearing, Eardley said a \u201cresolution\u201d had been reached over the allegations. When asked by Mr Justice Johnson whether he accepted he had committed the breaches, Robinson nodded and then replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Referring to Robinson by his real name, Eardley said the case was not about the far right figure\u2019s political activities. \u201cIt\u2019s a case about disobedience to an order of a court and an undermining of the rule of law,\u201d he said.

Now Frazier travels the country as a Front Row Joe \u2013 one of the devoted fans, of whom we meet several, who sit up close to Trump at every rally and cheer their hero on. \u201cI want control of my life,\u201d says Frazier, and there is not anger but desperation in his tone.</p> <p>At the same time, Trump\u2019s base also very much includes Gavin McInnes, founder of the Proud Boys, the group thought to be instrumental in the violence on Capitol Hill on 6 January and far more enmeshed with far-right ideology. McInnes sets out his stall pretty clearly in the film: \u201cWe want to make America hate again.\u201d And, he says, it wasn\u2019t him or his group responsible for what happened on 6 January: \u201cIt was you.

      "bodyText": "Documentaries about the phenomenon of Donald Trump are often overcome by the sheer horror of the man, what he has done and \u2013 especially among those broadcast in the runup to the 2024 US election \u2013 what he may be planning to do in the future. Sometimes, however, they sidestep this trap and treat the subject itself with the sober consideration that it, rather than the man, deserves. Into the latter category falls Trump: A Second Chance? which, like all the best documentaries, ploughs the harder furrow.

The accusations that led to Errej\u00f3n\u2019s resignation are the latest in a series of damaging allegations that have hit S\u00e1nchez\u2019s administration six years after he came to power by promising \u201cdemocratic regeneration\u201d after seven years of corruption-mired rule by the conservative People\u2019s party (PP). S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, is being investigated by a judge over allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. The allegations \u2013 which the prime minister has described as a baseless smear campaign by his rightwing and far-right opponents in politics and the media \u2013 briefly led him to consider stepping down earlier this year. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s administration has also been under pressure since it emerged in February that an assistant to the former transport minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, had been arrested on suspicion of taking payments to facilitate contracts for face masks during the coronavirus pandemic. More recently, a report from the Guardia Civil police force has alleged that a criminal network was operating inside the transport ministry in 2020 and 2021, when \u00c1balos, once a close ally and confidant of the prime minister, was in charge. \u00c1balos was suspended by the PSOE in February after refusing to resign over the alleged bribery scandal. While \u00c1balos himself was not investigated and has denied any wrongdoing, the party insisted he bore \u201cpolitical responsibility\u201d.

Although the PP finished first in last year\u2019s general election, it was unable to muster sufficient backing to form a government and S\u00e1nchez\u2019s socialists eventually secured another term by offering Catalan separatist parties a controversial amnesty law in return for their support.",

She spoke lovingly of her mother, a late cancer researcher, and of her lifelong girlfriends whom she considers just as valuable, if not more so, than romantic partners \u2013 a line that probably resonated with gen Z women, who increasingly <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/11/11/lifestyle/women-consider-friendships-as-important-as-romantic-relationships-study/\">prioritize</a> platonic relationships, and the many older women who are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/09/14/seniors-alone-health/\">learning to live alone</a>.

While speaking on reproductive rights, she said she was the first sitting vice-president to have visited an abortion clinic. She imagined Trump in the Oval Office on the first day of his second presidency drafting an \u201cenemies list\u201d, unlike the \u201cto-do list\u201d she would be looking at \u2013 he\u2019ll stew while she gets to work. In this vein, much of the conversation focused on fear of another Trump presidency. Using a favorite therapy buzzword, Harris said Americans were \u201ctraumatized\u201d by the \u201ccruelty\u201d of Trump\u2019s Maga movement. \u201cTrauma blunts our senses,\u201d and voting blue was a way to take back some of the power, she said.</p> <p>Harris seems to genuinely enjoy speaking to people in these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/18/kamala-harris-black-barbershop-media\">lower-stakes, conversational formats</a>, and some of her standout bits with Brown appeared off the cuff. We learned that her college nickname was \u201cC Cubed\u201d, which stood for \u201ccool, calm and collected\u201d. And despite having what Brown described as a \u201cDepeche Mode haircut\u201d in her 20s (a closely cropped, asymmetrical look), Harris said she was never big on the goth sound \u2013 though her husband, Doug Emhoff, loves the group.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/white-women-voters-harris-trump\">Will white women abandon Republicans and vote for Kamala Harris?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Except for the two women\u2019s emphatic support of abortion rights, the chat came off as cozy and largely apolitical.

When asked about her two biggest values in a leader, Harris called out \u201cfairness and justice\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s so powerful,\u201d Brown cooed back. With just a week to go before election day, as she struggles to communicate policy issues with voters, Harris cycled through her greatest hits. While speaking on reproductive rights, she said she was the first sitting vice-president to have visited an abortion clinic. She imagined Trump in the Oval Office on the first day of his second presidency drafting an \u201cenemies list\u201d, unlike the \u201cto-do list\u201d she would be looking at \u2013 he\u2019ll stew while she gets to work. In this vein, much of the conversation focused on fear of another Trump presidency. Using a favorite therapy buzzword, Harris said Americans were \u201ctraumatized\u201d by the \u201ccruelty\u201d of Trump\u2019s Maga movement. \u201cTrauma blunts our senses,\u201d and voting blue was a way to take back some of the power, she said. Harris seems to genuinely enjoy speaking to people in these lower-stakes, conversational formats, and some of her standout bits with Brown appeared off the cuff. We learned that her college nickname was \u201cC Cubed\u201d, which stood for \u201ccool, calm and collected\u201d. And despite having what Brown described as a \u201cDepeche Mode haircut\u201d in her 20s (a closely cropped, asymmetrical look), Harris said she was never big on the goth sound \u2013 though her husband, Doug Emhoff, loves the group. Except for the two women\u2019s emphatic support of abortion rights, the chat came off as cozy and largely apolitical. That tactic could play well with Unlocking Us listeners, who probably come to Brown\u2019s lovey-dovey podcast as an escape from the hyper-partisan news cycle. Harris seemed, if not the candidate you want to have a beer with, then the pleasant-enough person sitting next to you at an airport bar sipping on a glass of chardonnay. Positioned against Trump\u2019s macho posturing, which reached an apex this weekend with an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast and the racist Madison Square Garden bonanza, Brown\u2019s interview with Harris was like a cardigan on the first day of fall. And we know how much white women love fall.",

Under its international obligations, Israel must ensure sufficient aid reaches civilians in Gaza.\u201d Speaking at a daily briefing, the US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said Washington was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the vote and had urged Israel to \u201cpause implementation\u201d of the legislation, which could \u201chave implications under US law\u201d. US law prevents Washington from providing military aid to countries that restrict US humanitarian assistance, although that legislation is rarely enforced. During the briefing, Miller said that Unrwa had an \u201cirreplaceable\u201d role in providing aid to the Gaza Strip. The legislation, which was co-sponsored by members of the rightwing Yisrael Beiteinu and Likud parties, followed allegations by Israel that members of the Unrwa staff in Gaza were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks that led to the deaths of more than 1,200 Israelis and the kidnapping of hundreds more. Israel responded to the Hamas raid with military operations in the Gaza Strip that have sparked a humanitarian crisis, leading to the deaths of more than 43,000 civilians. \u201cUnrwa workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable,\u201d the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement. \u201cSince avoiding a humanitarian crisis is also essential, sustained humanitarian aid must remain available in Gaza now and in the future.\u201d \u201cIn the 90 days before this legislation takes effect \u2013 and after \u2013 we stand ready to work with our international partners to ensure Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not threaten Israel\u2019s security,\u201d he said. The UN launched an investigation into the Israeli claims and fired nine Unrwa staff as a result. The allegations also led the US and EU to briefly halt funding to the agency. Unrwa was established in 1949 to provide aid to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The agency now provides services to millions of Palestinians in Israel and nearby countries, many of whom remain stateless and live in refugee camps. It has 13,000 staff in the Gaza Strip. On Sunday, the foreign ministers of Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the UK all voiced their opposition to the legislation and said it could lead to \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d. Unrwa \u201cprovides essential and life-saving humanitarian aid and basic services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank and throughout the region\u201d, the foreign ministers said in a statement before the vote. \u201cWithout its work, the provision of such assistance and services, including education, health care, and fuel distribution in Gaza and the West Bank would be severely hampered if not impossible, with devastating consequences on an already critical and rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation, particularly in northern Gaza.\u201d \u201cIt is crucial that Unrwa and other UN organisations and agencies be fully able to deliver humanitarian aid and their assistance to those who need it most, fulfilling their mandates effectively,\u201d the statement continued. In the same statement, the foreign ministers, who include some of Israel\u2019s closest allies, condemned the 7 October attacks and said that Unrwa had \u201ctaken steps to address allegations regarding individual employees\u2019 support for terrorist organisations\u201d. \u201cWe call on Unrwa to continue its path of reform as a priority, demonstrating its commitment to the principle of neutrality, and ensure that its activities remain entirely in line with its mandate. We will continue to actively monitor and support this process,\u201d the statement concluded.",

      "body": "<p>A young boy with train-track braces in blue and red like Bar\u00e7a defeated the giant that couldn\u2019t be defeated, he and his friends standing tall in the place where everyone else falls. There were 13 minutes left in the opening cl\u00e1sico of the season, the first of a new era that wasn\u2019t supposed to be theirs, when Lamine Yamal Nasraoui Ebana bared his teeth.</p> \n<p>Bared his teeth, pointed at the name on his shirt <em>and</em> danced with Alejandro Balde for a bit, four celebrations in one starting with a <em>calm down, I\u2019m here</em>: down in the south-west corner of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u smiling, the ball in the net for the third time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-clasico-match-report\">victory secured and history written</a>. Maybe a new future too.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-clasico-match-report\">Robert Lewandowski\u2019s double sparks Barcelona\u2019s cl\u00e1sico rout of Real Madrid</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As teammates ran towards Lamine Yamal, on the other side of the stadium Marc Casad\u00f3 tried to lift the coach, Hansi Flick, into the air and up in the directors\u2019 box the president, Joan Laporta, sitting to the left of the presidents of Real Madrid, the region of Madrid and the senate, tried to contain himself, only a wink aimed at a Barcelona fan daring to wave his scarf below cracking the surface to reveal how wild he was going inside. To Lamine Yamal\u2019s right, the Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga passed: still walking to the bench having been replaced by Brahim D\u00edaz, rescue mission now aborted before he even got back, he had the best view of the goal that ended it. Behind him, unheard yet, some fans spat abuse at Lamine Yamal. Go and sell hankies at the traffic lights, one shouted. How about I do <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremSportsTV/status/1850277007185084770\">this</a></em> instead, you stupid racist bastards.</p> \n<p>Asked what Madrid\u2019s players had said about his goal afterwards, Lamine Yamal replied \u201cthat they didn\u2019t know I had a right foot\u201d, but he had just used it to send the ball screaming past Andriy Lunin to effectively end the cl\u00e1sico. Mostly, Madrid\u2019s fans just sat, stunned and silent, although a lot of them made their way to the exit. By the time Raphinha scored the fourth, maybe a third of the 78,192 that came had gone already. It was done: no epic, inevitable Madrid comeback and no collapse of their victims, no turning this into an asylum, no fear paralysing opponents. At 2-0, maybe there was a chance \u2013 at 2-0 there <em>were</em> chances, in fact, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 twice denied by I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a \u2013 but not now, not with the only club that seems to <em>like</em> coming here.</p> \n<p>Madrid were going to lose at home for the first time in 18 months, their undefeated run in La Liga halted at 42, one short of Barcelona\u2019s record. The team who had won seven of the last nine cl\u00e1sicos in La Liga, and put four past Barcelona in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/14/real-madrid-barcelona-spanish-super-cup-final\">January\u2019s Super Cup</a>, the European and La Liga champions who had then gone and signed Mbapp\u00e9, the team that were going to walk the league, were beaten and like this. In the stadium where they can\u2019t hold concerts, Barcelona gave a recital. A festival, AS called it. It had been a \u201cbath,\u201d Marca said; a \u201cbattering\u201d, El Mundo Deportivo called it, one to be celebrated. Asked what music had played down in the dressing room, where Wojciech Szczesny lit up, the players sang for three days off and Flick gave them two as planned, Lamine Yamal laughed. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201csome of them are quite old\u2026 \u201d</p> \n<p>Barcelona have made a habit of big wins at the Bernabeu. Since 2006, there have been three 3-0s, a 2-3, a 3-4, and a 2-6 while this was a third 4-0 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/23/barcelona-clasico-destruction-real-madrid-on-their-knees-sid-lowe\">since 2015</a>, yet no one expected this. No one truly expected <em>any</em> of this. Flick though has transformed everything and everyone, quietly making Barcelona the best team in La Liga; if there was a winner from the cl\u00e1sico, from the season so far, it is him. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible: he has changed the dressing room radically,\u201d Lamine Yamal said. \u201cYou see it in the way we play, how we enjoy it on the pitch. We have a lot of respect for him and he has not had to shout or anything, it\u2019s earned naturally. He\u2019s an amazing coach.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raphinha, the winger who had felt unwanted by Xavi, the former coach, and who had spent the summer listening to people say he was on his way, one of the few sellable assets Barcelona had, had become probably the best player in Spain, with nine goals and six assists in all competitions. Robert Lewandowski, the striker that Xavi hadn\u2019t wanted, accused of being past it, looked like Lewandowski again, scorer of 12 goals in just 10 games. Dani Olmo, the one signing he asked for, and part of the reason they let Ilkay G\u00fcndogan go, had been superb, and then injured. Marc Bernal had been brought into the team, Flick telling the club that they didn\u2019t need to sign a central midfielder after all, and had been a revelation at 17. When he tore a cruciate, so was Casado.</p> \n<p>Together, they were the best team in Spain: faster, more direct and harder working than ever before. Over the last week alone, they covered more than 30km more than Madrid. Barcelona began the week top of the table, having lost just once all season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/30/bryan-zaragoza-osasuna-barcelona-la-liga\">against Osasuna</a>, and won the other nine. They had put four past Girona and five past Villarreal. In their last three games they had got five against Young Boys, three against Alav\u00e9s and five against Sevilla. They had scored more league goals than anyone else in Europe, on 33, and forced more offsides than anyone else too, with 65 \u2013 an average higher than anyone else in a decade.</p> \n<p>Still Bayern Munich and Real Madrid would be a different matter, or so it goes. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/23/barcelona-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">they scored four</a> against them both. Against Madrid they added 12 more offsides, a tactical temerity that turned out to be an expert trap into which Mbapp\u00e9 fell eight times, Vin\u00edcius three. None of the front three had ever scored against Madrid for Barcelona; on Saturday they all did, the cl\u00e1sico coming as confirmation of just how good they could be. \u201cWhen we won earlier in the season, they said it was against teams from the bottom half; now we\u2019ve beaten two of the world\u2019s best,\u201d Lamine Yamal said.</p> \n<p>They had done it their way, embracing the risks. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to play like that, but it works,\u201d Pe\u00f1a admitted. \u201cYou need balls,\u201d Casado said, but life is good lived on the edge if maybe not quite as much as they had in the opening 45 minutes, which is why Frenkie de Jong came on for Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez at half-time to give them control of a game that had been wild until then, the threat feeling constant if often proving virtual, attacks everyone saw, one of which the Bernabeu celebrated when Mbapp\u00e9 clipped in a neat finish, rendered non-existent by the flag or the VAR. \u201cWe had more possession and that changed the game,\u201d Flick said, and while there were still chances for Madrid, it ended ended up pretty well perfect.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fda7ce6a-24d8-490a-93da-4f61e98a20d4\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Espanyol 0-2 Sevilla, Valladolid 1-2 Villarreal, Rayo Vallecano 1-0 Alav\u00e9s, Las Palmas 1-0 Girona, Real Madrid 0-4 Barcelona, Leganes 3-0 Celta Vigo, Getafe 1-1 Valencia, Real Betis 1-0 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Real Sociedad 0-2 Osasuna. Monday: Mallorca v Athletic Club</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Right down to Olmo coming on like he had never been away; Pe\u00f1a getting the opportunity to prove himself, the doubts washed away; and Gavi being given <em>a clasico</em> to get a few minutes closer to recovery and using it to crash into Vin\u00edcius, get a yellow yard and hold four fingers up, which wasn\u2019t quite quite Tonny Bruins Slot or Gerard Piqu\u00e9, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/nov/30/barcelona-win-epoch-defining-clasico\">finger short of a </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/nov/30/barcelona-win-epoch-defining-clasico\">manita</a></em>, but did sort of sum it up. Even Flick\u2019s disbelief at Lewandowski missing an open goal worked out nicely, the coach falling head over heels backwards just like the fans have, and didn\u2019t cost them. They had done it, their way.</p> \n<p>With six under-21s in the starting XI and eight La Masia graduates playing. With a back-up goalkeeper and a back-up to the back-up who they had pulled off the beach in Marbella, retirement interrupted. With one central defender who is 17, and the other who is 33, up against Vin\u00edcius and Mbapp\u00e9. With L\u00f3pez, a No 10 who was on loan at third-tier Linares a little over a year ago. And Casado, a central midfielder, the best player on the pitch, who spent last season with the B team and was unknown two months ago. And with a coach who has made sense of it all.</p> \n<p>With second half goals that were the embodiment of the new, direct Barcelona: two from Lewandowski, 141 seconds between them, one from Raphinha and another from the 17 year kid who Luis de la Fuente says is touched by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/09/lamine-yamals-goal-for-the-ages-shows-best-of-spains-generational-talent\">the wand of God</a>, who was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/40882536/destiny-brought-barcelona-lionel-messi-lamine-yamal-together-iconic-photo\">anointed by Him too</a>, the kid who had just become youngest goalscorer in the history of the cl\u00e1sico<em> </em>and looks it, standing there at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u with a twinkle in his eye and on his teeth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element

      "bodyText": "A young boy with train-track braces in blue and red like Bar\u00e7a defeated the giant that couldn\u2019t be defeated, he and his friends standing tall in the place where everyone else falls. There were 13 minutes left in the opening cl\u00e1sico of the season, the first of a new era that wasn\u2019t supposed to be theirs, when Lamine Yamal Nasraoui Ebana bared his teeth. Bared his teeth, pointed at the name on his shirt and danced with Alejandro Balde for a bit, four celebrations in one starting with a calm down, I\u2019m here: down in the south-west corner of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u smiling, the ball in the net for the third time, victory secured and history written. Maybe a new future too. As teammates ran towards Lamine Yamal, on the other side of the stadium Marc Casad\u00f3 tried to lift the coach, Hansi Flick, into the air and up in the directors\u2019 box the president, Joan Laporta, sitting to the left of the presidents of Real Madrid, the region of Madrid and the senate, tried to contain himself, only a wink aimed at a Barcelona fan daring to wave his scarf below cracking the surface to reveal how wild he was going inside. To Lamine Yamal\u2019s right, the Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga passed: still walking to the bench having been replaced by Brahim D\u00edaz, rescue mission now aborted before he even got back, he had the best view of the goal that ended it. Behind him, unheard yet, some fans spat abuse at Lamine Yamal. Go and sell hankies at the traffic lights, one shouted. How about I do this instead, you stupid racist bastards. Asked what Madrid\u2019s players had said about his goal afterwards, Lamine Yamal replied \u201cthat they didn\u2019t know I had a right foot\u201d, but he had just used it to send the ball screaming past Andriy Lunin to effectively end the cl\u00e1sico. Mostly, Madrid\u2019s fans just sat, stunned and silent, although a lot of them made their way to the exit. By the time Raphinha scored the fourth, maybe a third of the 78,192 that came had gone already. It was done: no epic, inevitable Madrid comeback and no collapse of their victims, no turning this into an asylum, no fear paralysing opponents. At 2-0, maybe there was a chance \u2013 at 2-0 there were chances, in fact, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 twice denied by I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a \u2013 but not now, not with the only club that seems to like coming here. Madrid were going to lose at home for the first time in 18 months, their undefeated run in La Liga halted at 42, one short of Barcelona\u2019s record. The team who had won seven of the last nine cl\u00e1sicos in La Liga, and put four past Barcelona in January\u2019s Super Cup, the European and La Liga champions who had then gone and signed Mbapp\u00e9, the team that were going to walk the league, were beaten and like this. In the stadium where they can\u2019t hold concerts, Barcelona gave a recital. A festival, AS called it. It had been a \u201cbath,\u201d Marca said; a \u201cbattering\u201d, El Mundo Deportivo called it, one to be celebrated. Asked what music had played down in the dressing room, where Wojciech Szczesny lit up, the players sang for three days off and Flick gave them two as planned, Lamine Yamal laughed. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201csome of them are quite old\u2026 \u201d Barcelona have made a habit of big wins at the Bernabeu. Since 2006, there have been three 3-0s, a 2-3, a 3-4, and a 2-6 while this was a third 4-0 since 2015, yet no one expected this. No one truly expected any of this. Flick though has transformed everything and everyone, quietly making Barcelona the best team in La Liga; if there was a winner from the cl\u00e1sico, from the season so far, it is him. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible: he has changed the dressing room radically,\u201d Lamine Yamal said. \u201cYou see it in the way we play, how we enjoy it on the pitch. We have a lot of respect for him and he has not had to shout or anything, it\u2019s earned naturally. He\u2019s an amazing coach.\u201d Raphinha, the winger who had felt unwanted by Xavi, the former coach, and who had spent the summer listening to people say he was on his way, one of the few sellable assets Barcelona had, had become probably the best player in Spain, with nine goals and six assists in all competitions. Robert Lewandowski, the striker that Xavi hadn\u2019t wanted, accused of being past it, looked like Lewandowski again, scorer of 12 goals in just 10 games. Dani Olmo, the one signing he asked for, and part of the reason they let Ilkay G\u00fcndogan go, had been superb, and then injured. Marc Bernal had been brought into the team, Flick telling the club that they didn\u2019t need to sign a central midfielder after all, and had been a revelation at 17. When he tore a cruciate, so was Casado. Together, they were the best team in Spain: faster, more direct and harder working than ever before. Over the last week alone, they covered more than 30km more than Madrid. Barcelona began the week top of the table, having lost just once all season, against Osasuna, and won the other nine. They had put four past Girona and five past Villarreal. In their last three games they had got five against Young Boys, three against Alav\u00e9s and five against Sevilla. They had scored more league goals than anyone else in Europe, on 33, and forced more offsides than anyone else too, with 65 \u2013 an average higher than anyone else in a decade. Still Bayern Munich and Real Madrid would be a different matter, or so it goes. Instead, they scored four against them both. Against Madrid they added 12 more offsides, a tactical temerity that turned out to be an expert trap into which Mbapp\u00e9 fell eight times, Vin\u00edcius three. None of the front three had ever scored against Madrid for Barcelona; on Saturday they all did, the cl\u00e1sico coming as confirmation of just how good they could be. \u201cWhen we won earlier in the season, they said it was against teams from the bottom half; now we\u2019ve beaten two of the world\u2019s best,\u201d Lamine Yamal said. They had done it their way, embracing the risks. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to play like that, but it works,\u201d Pe\u00f1a admitted. \u201cYou need balls,\u201d Casado said, but life is good lived on the edge if maybe not quite as much as they had in the opening 45 minutes, which is why Frenkie de Jong came on for Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez at half-time to give them control of a game that had been wild until then, the threat feeling constant if often proving virtual, attacks everyone saw, one of which the Bernabeu celebrated when Mbapp\u00e9 clipped in a neat finish, rendered non-existent by the flag or the VAR. \u201cWe had more possession and that changed the game,\u201d Flick said, and while there were still chances for Madrid, it ended ended up pretty well perfect. Right down to Olmo coming on like he had never been away; Pe\u00f1a getting the opportunity to prove himself, the doubts washed away; and Gavi being given a clasico to get a few minutes closer to recovery and using it to crash into Vin\u00edcius, get a yellow yard and hold four fingers up, which wasn\u2019t quite quite Tonny Bruins Slot or Gerard Piqu\u00e9, a finger short of a manita, but did sort of sum it up. Even Flick\u2019s disbelief at Lewandowski missing an open goal worked out nicely, the coach falling head over heels backwards just like the fans have, and didn\u2019t cost them. They had done it, their way. With six under-21s in the starting XI and eight La Masia graduates playing. With a back-up goalkeeper and a back-up to the back-up who they had pulled off the beach in Marbella, retirement interrupted. With one central defender who is 17, and the other who is 33, up against Vin\u00edcius and Mbapp\u00e9. With L\u00f3pez, a No 10 who was on loan at third-tier Linares a little over a year ago. And Casado, a central midfielder, the best player on the pitch, who spent last season with the B team and was unknown two months ago. And with a coach who has made sense of it all. With second half goals that were the embodiment of the new, direct Barcelona: two from Lewandowski, 141 seconds between them, one from Raphinha and another from the 17 year kid who Luis de la Fuente says is touched by the wand of God, who was anointed by Him too, the kid who had just become youngest goalscorer in the history of the cl\u00e1sico and looks it, standing there at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u with a twinkle in his eye and on his teeth.",

      "body": "<p>Among the former Soviet states that gained independence in the early 1990s, Georgia has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the most steadfastly pro-European. Polls have <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/26/europe/georgia-election-uncertain-russia-intl-latam/index.html\">consistently</a> found that up to 80% of its 3.7 million population support joining the European Union \u2013 an aspiration that is enshrined in the constitution. Sadly, following a pivotal election that will further polarise a deeply divided country, those ambitions now look likely to be put on indefinite hold.</p> <p>The unexpectedly decisive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/georgia-election-calls-for-protests-as-ruling-pro-russia-party-declared-winner\">victory</a> of the anti-western Georgian Dream party (GD) on Saturday \u2013 amid reliable <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/georgia/579376\">reports</a> of intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters \u2013 will be a source of dismay in Brussels and satisfaction in Moscow. For Georgians fearful that their country is being bullied away from European values and into Russia\u2019s authoritarian orbit, GD\u2019s re-election is a calamity. It is also further evidence of the extent to which the fallout from Vladimir Putin\u2019s brutal assault on Ukraine, and his wider revanchist aims, are affecting the wider politics of the region.</p> <p>Less than a year after Georgia was awarded EU candidate status, GD\u2019s oligarch founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, appears intent on turning the country into a Kremlin-friendly illiberal democracy, in the manner of Turkey, Serbia and Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Georgia has become a suspected conduit for sanctions-busting trade, while domestic policies have been copied and pasted out of Mr&nbsp;Putin\u2019s authoritarian playbook.</p> <p>A \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/georgia-foreign-agent-bill-becomes-law-international-outcry-european-union/\">designed</a> to emasculate civil society organisations, sparked mass protests in Tbilisi in the spring. It was swiftly followed in the summer by draconian legislation to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/georgian-parliament-approves-law-curbing-lgbt-rights-2024-09-17/\">restrict</a> LGBT+ rights, including a ban on same-sex marriage. During the election campaign, a vote for pro-western opposition parties was portrayed as a vote for a \u201cGlobal War\u201d party, liable to embroil Georgia in a disastrous war with Russia.</p> <p>While Mr Ivanishvili realigns Georgia away from the west, destabilising Russian pressure is also being exerted on Ukraine\u2019s smaller neighbour, Moldova. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/moldova-vote-join-eu-razor-thin-majority\">referendum</a> last week, amid allegations of Moscow-backed disinformation and bribery, Moldovans voted by a far smaller margin than expected to enshrine the path to EU membership in the country\u2019s constitution. Police and prosecutors alleged that Russian attempts to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moldova-police-say-businessman-shor-channelled-24-million-pay-off-voters-2024-10-24/\">bribe</a> voters had begun long before the poll. Mr&nbsp;Putin\u2019s brutal efforts to restore Moscow\u2019s sway in former satellite Soviet states are taking their toll.</p> <p>Events in Georgia present European leaders with urgent dilemmas.

      "bodyText": "Among the former Soviet states that gained independence in the early 1990s, Georgia has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the most steadfastly pro-European. Polls have consistently found that up to 80% of its 3.7 million population support joining the European Union \u2013 an aspiration that is enshrined in the constitution. Sadly, following a pivotal election that will further polarise a deeply divided country, those ambitions now look likely to be put on indefinite hold. The unexpectedly decisive victory of the anti-western Georgian Dream party (GD) on Saturday \u2013 amid reliable reports of intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters \u2013 will be a source of dismay in Brussels and satisfaction in Moscow. For Georgians fearful that their country is being bullied away from European values and into Russia\u2019s authoritarian orbit, GD\u2019s re-election is a calamity. It is also further evidence of the extent to which the fallout from Vladimir Putin\u2019s brutal assault on Ukraine, and his wider revanchist aims, are affecting the wider politics of the region. Less than a year after Georgia was awarded EU candidate status, GD\u2019s oligarch founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, appears intent on turning the country into a Kremlin-friendly illiberal democracy, in the manner of Turkey, Serbia and Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Georgia has become a suspected conduit for sanctions-busting trade, while domestic policies have been copied and pasted out of Mr Putin\u2019s authoritarian playbook. A \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill, designed to emasculate civil society organisations, sparked mass protests in Tbilisi in the spring. It was swiftly followed in the summer by draconian legislation to restrict LGBT+ rights, including a ban on same-sex marriage. During the election campaign, a vote for pro-western opposition parties was portrayed as a vote for a \u201cGlobal War\u201d party, liable to embroil Georgia in a disastrous war with Russia. While Mr Ivanishvili realigns Georgia away from the west, destabilising Russian pressure is also being exerted on Ukraine\u2019s smaller neighbour, Moldova. In a referendum last week, amid allegations of Moscow-backed disinformation and bribery, Moldovans voted by a far smaller margin than expected to enshrine the path to EU membership in the country\u2019s constitution. Police and prosecutors alleged that Russian attempts to bribe voters had begun long before the poll. Mr Putin\u2019s brutal efforts to restore Moscow\u2019s sway in former satellite Soviet states are taking their toll. Events in Georgia present European leaders with urgent dilemmas. Confronted with the country\u2019s lurch towards authoritarianism, the EU announced the freezing of accession negotiations in July. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, have called for an investigation into alleged irregularities in the election, and possible sanctions are likely to be discussed when EU leaders next meet in November. But these would need to be skilfully targeted, or risk deepening the east-west divide that Mr Ivanishvili has sought to open up. On Sunday, Georgia\u2019s president, Salome Zourabichvili, refused to recognise the election result. Opposition parties have followed suit. What comes next will depend on the level of mobilisation in the streets, and what impact western pressure can have. As protesters marched in Tbilisi on Monday, Mr Orb\u00e1n arrived in the capital to congratulate Mr Ivanishvili. It was a dismal sign of the times.

He said that would not hurt Bezos, who already lost $77m on the Post in 2023, because the paper is just \u201cpocket change\u201d to the businessman who also owns the online retailer Amazon and aerospace company Blue Origin.</p> <p>\u201cBut boycotting The Post <em>will</em> hurt my colleagues and me,\u201d Milbank wrote. \u201cThe more cancellations there are, the more jobs will be lost, and the less good journalism there will be.\u201d</p> <p>But he added that if the non-endorsement was \u201cthe beginning of a crackdown on our journalistic integrity \u2026 my colleagues and I will be leading the calls for Post readers to cancel their subscriptions, and we\u2019ll be resigning en masse\u201d.</p> <p>Milbank pointed out that Bezos had typically not interfered with the Post before the newspaper\u2019s brass refused to run an endorsement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> in the upcoming election. The non-endorsement policy was announced shortly before executives of Blue Origin met with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> as the Republican White House nominee campaigns for a second presidency.</p> <p>From outside the Post, the CNN anchor Jake Tapper <a href=\"https://x.com/jaketapper/status/1850210618751553950\">wrote on X</a>: \u201cCanceling a newspaper subscription helps politicians who don\u2019t want oversight, does nothing to hurt the billionaires who own the newspapers and make decisions with which you may disagree, and will result in fewer journalists trying to hold the powerful to account.\u201d</p> <p>By mid-Monday, reports indicated that more than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions to the Washington Post, according to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168416/washington-post-bezos-endorsement-president-cancellations-resignations\">NPR</a>. The publication noted that the number was \u201cabout 8% of the paper\u2019s paid circulation of 2.5 million subscribers, which includes print as well\u201d.</p> <p>But some argue it would be better to cancel subscriptions to Bezos\u2019s Amazon Prime service.</p> <p>The mood in the Washington Post was still \u201cpretty furious\u201d, an employee there told the Guardian on Monday. And there were moves toward greater union involvement.</p> <p>The employee confirmed that workers were worried that subscription cancellations could ultimately boomerang on them with further job losses.</p> <p>The Post\u2019s non-endorsement decision was made public by Will Lewis, the paper\u2019s publisher and chief executive officer since January. He said that Bezos \u201cwas not sent, did not read and did not opine on any draft\u201d of the spiked Harris endorsement.</p> <p>\u201cI do not believe in presidential endorsements,\u201d Lewis \u2013 who previously rose through the ranks of British newspapers and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire \u2013 wrote in a statement on Sunday. \u201cWe are an independent newspaper and should support our readers\u2019 ability to make up their own minds.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, under Lewis\u2019s leadership, the Post has issued endorsements this election cycle, including in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/02/maryland-senate-angela-alsobrooks-endorsement/\">US Senate seat race in Maryland</a>.</p> <p>Within hours of the announcement on Friday, 11 Post opinion columnists <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/post-columnist-no-endorsement-2024-trump-harris/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28\">co-signed a column</a> condemning the decision as \u201can abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper\u201d.</p> <p>The progressive senator Bernie Sanders alluded to multibillion contracts Amazon holds with the federal government, including the Department of Defense, to explain the decision. Sanders said Bezos \u201cis afraid of antagonizing Trump and losing Amazon\u2019s federal contracts\u201d if the former president returns to power. \u201cPathetic,\u201d Sanders said.</p> <p>On Monday, Michelle Norris, an opinion contributor at the Post, said she would resign, calling the decision \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d and \u201can insult to the paper\u2019s own longstanding standard of regularly endorsing candidates since 1976\u201d.</p> <p>Norris follows Robert Kagan, an editor-at-large, who left the paper after the non-endorsement announcement.</p> <p>David Hoffman, an editorial board member who recently accepted a Pulitzer for a series on \u201cthe tactics authoritarian regimes use to repress dissent in the digital age\u201d, is also said to be resigning.</p> <p>Among those to cancel Post subscriptions since Friday is the former Republican congresswoman turned Trump critic Liz Cheney. She accused Bezos \u2013 who owns the paper through a <a href=\"https://edesiderata.crl.edu/providers/wp-company-llc-washington-post\">for-profit subsidiary</a> of an investment fund Nash Holdings LLC \u2013 of being \u201capparently afraid\u201d to endorse \u201cthe only candidate in the race who\u2019s a stable responsible adult because he fears Donald Trump\u201d.</p> <p>The Oscar-nominated actor Jeffrey Wright and the West Wing actor Bradley Whitford also posted that they had canceled.</p> <p>The Post\u2019s controversy erupted days after the Los Angeles Times made a similar call to block an endorsement of Harris. The LA newspaper also faced a wave of subscription cancellations.</p> <p>But the LA outlet has sought to cast its non-endorsement decision as more straightforward, with its billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, framing the matter as an attempt at neutrality.</p> <p>On Saturday, his daughter Nika Soon-Shiong, a progressive political activist, said the decision was motivated by Harris\u2019s continued support for Israel as it wars in Gaza.</p> <p>\u201cAs a citizen of a country openly financing genocide, and as a family that experienced South African Apartheid, the endorsement was an opportunity to repudiate justifications for the widespread targeting of journalists and ongoing war on children,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/los-angeles-times-endorsement-soon-shiong.html\">she said in a statement.</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The furore over the Washington Post\u2019s decision to forgo a presidential endorsement continued on Monday, with writers for the newspaper pleading with subscribers not to cancel as it would only hurt journalists who did not make the call. The newspaper owned by the multibillionaire Jeff Bezos was thrown into a pre-election inferno on Friday when it announced that it would abandon a five-decade convention of making a formal presidential endorsement. Reaction was swift, with the famed Watergate investigative duo Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein slamming the decision as \u201csurprising and disappointing, especially this late in the electoral process\u201d ahead of the 5 November election. But there are developing signs of a pushback to calls to cancel Washington Post subscriptions, with writers for the newspaper pointing out that doing so was ultimately counterproductive. Dana Milbank, an opinion columnist, said he could not endorse the calls to cancel. He said that would not hurt Bezos, who already lost $77m on the Post in 2023, because the paper is just \u201cpocket change\u201d to the businessman who also owns the online retailer Amazon and aerospace company Blue Origin. \u201cBut boycotting The Post will hurt my colleagues and me,\u201d Milbank wrote. \u201cThe more cancellations there are, the more jobs will be lost, and the less good journalism there will be.\u201d But he added that if the non-endorsement was \u201cthe beginning of a crackdown on our journalistic integrity \u2026 my colleagues and I will be leading the calls for Post readers to cancel their subscriptions, and we\u2019ll be resigning en masse\u201d. Milbank pointed out that Bezos had typically not interfered with the Post before the newspaper\u2019s brass refused to run an endorsement of Kamala Harris in the upcoming election. The non-endorsement policy was announced shortly before executives of Blue Origin met with Donald Trump as the Republican White House nominee campaigns for a second presidency. From outside the Post, the CNN anchor Jake Tapper wrote on X: \u201cCanceling a newspaper subscription helps politicians who don\u2019t want oversight, does nothing to hurt the billionaires who own the newspapers and make decisions with which you may disagree, and will result in fewer journalists trying to hold the powerful to account.\u201d By mid-Monday, reports indicated that more than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions to the Washington Post, according to NPR. The publication noted that the number was \u201cabout 8% of the paper\u2019s paid circulation of 2.5 million subscribers, which includes print as well\u201d. But some argue it would be better to cancel subscriptions to Bezos\u2019s Amazon Prime service. The mood in the Washington Post was still \u201cpretty furious\u201d, an employee there told the Guardian on Monday. And there were moves toward greater union involvement. The employee confirmed that workers were worried that subscription cancellations could ultimately boomerang on them with further job losses. The Post\u2019s non-endorsement decision was made public by Will Lewis, the paper\u2019s publisher and chief executive officer since January. He said that Bezos \u201cwas not sent, did not read and did not opine on any draft\u201d of the spiked Harris endorsement. \u201cI do not believe in presidential endorsements,\u201d Lewis \u2013 who previously rose through the ranks of British newspapers and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire \u2013 wrote in a statement on Sunday. \u201cWe are an independent newspaper and should support our readers\u2019 ability to make up their own minds.\u201d Nonetheless, under Lewis\u2019s leadership, the Post has issued endorsements this election cycle, including in a US Senate seat race in Maryland. Within hours of the announcement on Friday, 11 Post opinion columnists co-signed a column condemning the decision as \u201can abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper\u201d. The progressive senator Bernie Sanders alluded to multibillion contracts Amazon holds with the federal government, including the Department of Defense, to explain the decision. Sanders said Bezos \u201cis afraid of antagonizing Trump and losing Amazon\u2019s federal contracts\u201d if the former president returns to power. \u201cPathetic,\u201d Sanders said. On Monday, Michelle Norris, an opinion contributor at the Post, said she would resign, calling the decision \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d and \u201can insult to the paper\u2019s own longstanding standard of regularly endorsing candidates since 1976\u201d. Norris follows Robert Kagan, an editor-at-large, who left the paper after the non-endorsement announcement. David Hoffman, an editorial board member who recently accepted a Pulitzer for a series on \u201cthe tactics authoritarian regimes use to repress dissent in the digital age\u201d, is also said to be resigning. Among those to cancel Post subscriptions since Friday is the former Republican congresswoman turned Trump critic Liz Cheney. She accused Bezos \u2013 who owns the paper through a for-profit subsidiary of an investment fund Nash Holdings LLC \u2013 of being \u201capparently afraid\u201d to endorse \u201cthe only candidate in the race who\u2019s a stable responsible adult because he fears Donald Trump\u201d. The Oscar-nominated actor Jeffrey Wright and the West Wing actor Bradley Whitford also posted that they had canceled. The Post\u2019s controversy erupted days after the Los Angeles Times made a similar call to block an endorsement of Harris. The LA newspaper also faced a wave of subscription cancellations. But the LA outlet has sought to cast its non-endorsement decision as more straightforward, with its billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, framing the matter as an attempt at neutrality. On Saturday, his daughter Nika Soon-Shiong, a progressive political activist, said the decision was motivated by Harris\u2019s continued support for Israel as it wars in Gaza. \u201cAs a citizen of a country openly financing genocide, and as a family that experienced South African Apartheid, the endorsement was an opportunity to repudiate justifications for the widespread targeting of journalists and ongoing war on children,\u201d she said in a statement.",

The bus fare cap in England will be extended for a further year, but rise from \u00a32 to \u00a33, Keir Starmer has said.

The prime minister said the previous administration had only funded the policy up to the end of this year. Green co-leader Carla Denyer described the change as \u201cthe wrong approach\u201d.

The use of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d in relation to the war in Gaza risks undermining genocides such as the Holocaust, David Lammy has said. The foreign secretary was replying to a question by Conservative MP Nick Timothy, who asked whether the description of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza as \u201cannihilation, extermination and genocide\u201d was inappropriate. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer welcomed Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati to Downing Street for a bilateral meeting. The pair shook hands outside Number 10, where they are expected to discuss the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The prime minister offered Mikati his \u201ccondolences for the very many losses in your country\u201d. Labour figures today have been repeatedly questioned by the media about the definition of \u201cworking person\u201d. The prime minister said \u201cI\u2019m concerned with what\u2019s in their payslip, and making sure that there is no more tax in their payslip\u201d. Cabinet minister Pat McFadden said the budget would be the \u201cmost honest\u201d in years. McFadden also issued a strong rebuke to shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s criticism of the Office for Budget Responsibility plans to publish a report about the country\u2019s fiscal situation, saying the Tories \u201cdon\u2019t want to hear the truth\u201d about the financial situation they left for the new government. Foreign secretary David Lammy robustly defended his position and the topics he had raised with the Chinese in recent discussion during an urgent question in the Commons, where he was repeatedly criticised for not being strong enough. Lammy said it was \u201ccrass\u201d to suggest in three months he could have brough about different outcomes to the previous government\u2019s 14 years of diplomacy. Kemi Badenoch said the Tory leadership election was \u201cexistential\u201d for the party. She nevertheless claimed the party could return to power after one term of a Labour government. Russell Findlay, the new Scottish Conservative leader, has proposed cutting free prescriptions, merging local authorities and abolishing quangos to deliver cuts in Scottish income tax rates. The adult prison population in England and Wales has dropped 3% after reaching record levels. That\u2019s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and the UK politics live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Conservative shadow Treasury minister Gareth Davies has urged the government to say how much Labour plans to borrow in this Wednesday\u2019s budget. Across the dispatch box from chief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones, Davies pressed the government on what advice Treasury officials had given to ministers about the impact of Labour\u2019s spending plans on interest rates. He also asked: \u201cThis Labour government are quick to spend but unwilling to explain, so can I ask the chief secretary finally, on behalf of the British people and the markets who are watching this statement so very nervously, what definition of public debt is the UK offering to lenders today and how much does the government plan to borrow under an expanded definition?\u201d Jones said in his reply: \u201cHe has some brass neck standing up in this House telling this government how to behave after the years of his party\u2019s maladministration over the last 14 years.\u201d The minister had earlier set out changes to fiscal rules, known as the \u201cstability rule, that we will pay for all day-to-day spending on public services from receipts\u201d and the \u201cinvestment rule, which will get debt falling as a proportion of our economy\u201d. He said: \u201cAfter years of chaos from the Conservative party, chaos that cost families, businesses and public services dear, the British people are now rightly looking to this new Labour government to clear up the mess from the last government, to fix the foundations and to rebuild Britain.\u201d Meanwhile, Keir Starmer welcomed Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati to Downing Street for a bilateral meeting. The pair shook hands outside Number 10, where they are expected to discuss the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The prime minister offered Mikati his \u201ccondolences for the very many losses in your country\u201d. Referring to the \u201clong, shared and good history\u201d between the UK and Lebanon, Starmer said it was important to discuss how to bring about a \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d and \u201censure that the UN resolution is not just words\u201d. Mikati thanked Starmer for calling for a ceasefire in the region and for Britain\u2019s support on humanitarian matters. The foreign secretary has said that if Israel severs its ties with the United Nations agency dedicated to humanitarian aid in Gaza, it could be grounds for sanctions. MPs asked David Lammy whether he would be introducing sanctions on Israeli politicians several times after he gave his statement on the Middle East on Monday afternoon. Labour\u2019s Patricia Ferguson asked if new laws due to be debated in the Israeli parliament this week over whether to stop all cooperation with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees could hasten sanctions. She said: \u201cGiven the way in which the Knesset to vote on the issue on Unrwa today, will he, if that decision goes the way it seems to be going in which Israel will make it very difficult if not impossible for Unrwa to operate, with the consequence that humanitarian aid will not get into Gaza. \u201cIs that not the point at which we have to consider serious sanctions against those who are proponents of such action?\u201d Lammy said: \u201cYes, the truth is if Unrwa is brought to its knees, that would be a very very serious event indeed.\u201d SNP MP for Dundee Central Chris Law called for sanctions for Yair Golan, the Israel Democrats Party leader who during an interview in June called for Palestinians to \u201cstarve\u201d if Hamas did not return hostages. Lammy said: \u201cThese issues are being kept under review.\u201d The use of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d in relation to the war in Gaza risks undermining genocides such as the Holocaust, David Lammy has said. The foreign secretary was replying to a question by Conservative MP Nick Timothy, who asked whether the description of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza as \u201cannihilation, extermination and genocide\u201d was inappropriate. Timothy said: \u201cToday, as on other occasions recently we\u2019ve heard comments from the benches opposite that suggest somehow Israel is conducting a war of annihilation, extermination and of genocide. \u201cThere is obviously much suffering in Gaza, and we all accept that, but this terminology is completely inappropriate, not accurate, and is repeated by the protesters and the lawbreakers who are intimidating British Jews as we saw again this weekend. Will the foreign secretary take the opportunity to say that there is not a genocide occurring in the Middle East?\u201d Lammy said: \u201cThere are quite properly legal terms that must be determined by international courts. \u201cBut I do agree with the honourable gentleman, those terms were largely used when millions of people lost their lives in crises like Rwanda, the second world war in the Holocaust, and the way that they are used now undermines the seriousness of that term.\u201d Iran \u201cshould not respond\u201d to Israeli airstrikes over the weekend, David Lammy has urged. The foreign secretary told the Commons on Monday: Targeted Israeli strikes hit military sites inside Iran including a missile manufacturer and an air defence base. This was in response to Iran\u2019s escalatory ballistic missile attacks on Israel, condemned across the House. These attacks were the latest in a long history of malign Iranian activity. Its nuclear programme, with their total enriched uranium stockpile now reported by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) to be 30 times the Jcpoa (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Iran nuclear deal) limit, and political, financial, military support for militias including Hezbollah and Hamas. Let me be clear, the Government unequivocally condemns Iranian attacks on Israel. Lammy warned Iran and its proxies\u2019 goal is the \u201ccomplete eradication of the Israeli state\u201d and added: \u201cWe do not mourn the deaths of the heads of proscribed terrorist organisations. The priority now is immediate de-escalation. Iran should not respond. \u201cAll sides must exercise restraint. We do not wish to see the cycle of violence intensified, dragging the whole region into a war with severe consequences.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson, responding to the Commons Speaker\u2019s criticism, told reporters \u201cit\u2019s entirely routine for government to make announcements in the run up to budgets and spending reviews\u201d. However, they added: But obviously we will also ensure that parliament has all the requisite time to scrutinise measures clearly. The chancellor will be in front of parliament on Wednesday and, indeed, there will be days of budget debate subsequently at which parliamentarians will be able to scrutinise budget measures. Lindsay Hoyle earlier accused Chancellor Rachel Reeves of acting with \u201csupreme discourtesy\u201d towards MPs given her \u201cpremature disclosure\u201d of budget details. In an angry rebuke delivered in parliament he said it was \u201ctotally unacceptable to go around the world telling everybody\u201d about \u201cmajor\u201d new policy announcements rather than giving the information first to MPs. In the announcement, Hoyle said Reeves\u2019s interview were \u201cmajor new policy announcements with significant and wide-ranging implications for the government\u2019s fiscal policy and for the public finances.\u201d He said: It is evident to me that this should therefore have been made in the first instance in this House and not to the world\u2019s media. This principle is clearly and unambiguously set out in paragraph 9.1 of the Ministerial Code. While this can hardly be described as a leak - the Chancellor herself gave interviews on the record and on camera - the premature disclosure of the contents of the budget has always been regarded as a supreme discourtesy to the House. Indeed, I still regard it as such. I am very, very disappointed that the Chancellor expects the House to wait nearly a full week to hear her repeat these announcements in the budget statement on Wednesday. The bus fare cap in England will be extended for a further year, but rise from \u00a32 to \u00a33, Keir Starmer has said. The Liberal Democrats have described it as a \u201cbus tax\u201d, and Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick called the move \u201cclueless\u201d. The prime minister said the previous administration had only funded the policy up to the end of this year. Green co-leader Carla Denyer described the change as \u201cthe wrong approach\u201d Starmer has promised \u201cbetter days ahead\u201d and said the era of Tory neglect and \u201cmaking working people pay the price\u201d for their policies was over. Warning \u201cthere are no shortcuts\u201d after 14 years of Tory-led government, he said \u201cThe time is long overdue for politicians in this country to level with you honestly about the trade-offs this country faces\u201d Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has angrily reprimanded the government and in particular Chancellor Rachel Reeves over details of the budget being announced in the media in advance, rather than in parliament. A statement on fiscal rules is to be made in the House of Commons later today Labour figures today have been repeatedly questioned by the media about the definition of \u201cworking person\u201d. The prime minister said \u201cI\u2019m concerned with what\u2019s in their payslip, and making sure that there is no more tax in their payslip\u201d. Cabinet minister Pat McFadden said the budget would be the \u201cmost honest\u201d in years McFadden also issued a strong rebuke to shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s criticism of the Office for Budget Responsibility plans to publish a report about the country\u2019s fiscal situation, saying the Tories \u201cdon\u2019t want to hear the truth\u201d about the financial situation they left for the new government Foreign secretary David Lammy robustly defended his position and the topics he had raised with the Chinese in recent discussion during an urgent question in the Commons, where he was repeatedly criticised for not being strong enough.

Read more here: UK loses out on \u00a319bn in annual GDP growth due to lack of social mobility My colleague Jessica Elgot has also suggested that the speaker was misguided earlier in his vociferous criticism of Labour\u2019s pre-budget announcements and briefing. She writes: Sorry but the last time when big measures were not briefed, it was such a shock to markets that it caused a run on sterling and the Bank of England had to save pension funds from collapse. Pitch-rolling is not always a bad thing. Imagine - just imagine - if Reeves had only announced her borrowing changes on the day to parliament. Not serious. In parliament the foreign secretary has made a statement about the Middle East. David Lammy said the government unequivocaly condemns Iranian attacks on Israel. He said he had spoken to the foreign ministers of both Iran and Israel and urged restraint from both. On northern Gaza, he said nine in ten Gazans had been displaced in the course of the year, and said \u201cthere is no excuse for Israel\u2019s government\u2019s current restrictions on humanitarian aid\u201d. \u201cThey must let aid in now,\u201d he said. He added that current restrictions \u201cfly in the face\u201d of Israel\u2019s commitments, and said they are a rebuke to friends of Israel who have supported its right to defend itself, while also funding humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people. He said it was \u201ca matter of profound regret\u201d that Israel\u2019s parliament has debated closing down access to Gaza for Unrwa. On Lebanon, Lammy said the government had led efforts to respond, with a swift call for a ceasefire. He said the prime minister was meeting with Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister. Lammy said ceasefires, international law and diplomacy were the way to deescalate the situation in the region. \u201cIt is a source of deep frustration\u201d, Lammy said, that progess had not been made. He said the government would continue its efforts in the region \u201cSo that one day they might all live side-by-side in peace and security.\u201d A dissenting voice to the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, hauling the government and in particular the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, over the coals on budget details being published in the media in advance is Hugo Gye, political editor at the i, who argues the counterpoint, that \u201cif the government genuinely refused to say anything about the budget before its delivery you would find a) even more damaging speculation doing the rounds b) a potentially quite violent market reaction on the day\u201d. Readers with keen memories may remember the incident in 2013 when it appears that the Evening Standard in London had been briefed the whole of George Osborne\u2019s budget, as evidenced by one journalist tweeting out the paper\u2019s front page containing details before Osborne had spoken. Not that many of us however, I suspect, remember directly the time in 1947 that Labour chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after a different evening paper, the Star, published his budget before he spoke. In parliament Iain Duncan Smith has raised an urgent question about the UK\u2019s relations with China, and recent contact between the foreign secretary and Chinese officials. Foreign secretary David Lammy robustly defended his position and the topics he had raised with the Chinese, and said he would take no lessons from the Conservative party, whose attitude to relations with China changed course several times, he says. Emily Thornberry has invited Lammy to appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee which she now chairs. Lammy says he would be happy to appear before the committee whenever \u201cshe commands\u201d. Alicia Kearns, Conservative MP and shadow minister for foreign affairs, accused Lammy of giving an account of meetings that differed greatly from that given by the Chinese. \u201cThat was really quite bad,\u201d Lammy replies to her question. Sir Lindsay Hoyle has said it is \u201cevident\u201d to him that last week chancellor Rachel Reeves made significant policy announcements about fiscal rule changes in the media, rather than in parliament. He said he is glad there is a statement being made in the house later which he implies is \u201cno coincidence\u201d after he has expressed his anger. \u201cIt is not acceptable, I don\u2019t want it to continue\u201d, he said of budget details being paraded in the media before Wednesday. He said that often members are worried about getting a seat in the chamber for the budget speech, but \u201cthe way things are going\u201d this won\u2019t be a problem, as everything will have already been published. He also said that the party now in government used to complain about the previous administration doing this, and are now doing the same themselves. \u201cGet your acts together on all sides,\u201d he said. My colleague Polly Toynbee has published her latest column, in which she argues that Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget \u201cneeds to sing \u2018Here comes the sun\u2019 after too many grey months of grim prognosis.\u201d Kemi Badenoch has just been given a warning by the speaker in the House of Commons after raising questions about Jas Athwal, MP for Ilford South since July 2024. After she referred to stories in the media about Athwal\u2019s alleged activities as a landlord, Lindsay Hoyle asked Badenoch whether she had notified the MP in advance that she intended to mention him. She said she would need to check with her office whether that had happened. He admonished her, and told her to change the subject of her questions. Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch are making their final pitches to Conservative party members in the leadership election this week. Jenrick has posted today to say that it was time to \u201cend the drama, end the excuses and just deliver.\u201d He also rather unexpectedly made a pitch for the nightclubbing vote, by posting a picture of himself in a night club in Ilford, calling for a revitalisation of the late night economy. For her part, Badenoch appeared on BBC Radio 2 today. She denied that the position she was vying for was \u201ca caretaker leader job\u201d. She told listeners it was possible for the Conservatives to get back into power after one term of Labour in government, but that this leadership election was \u201cexistential\u201d for the Tories. Badenoch said: What I tell everyone is that we have one chance to get this right. This is existential. I actually feel that if we\u2019re not careful, this could be the end of the Conservative Party. There is a Reform Party on the right that says it\u2019s the real conservative party. We need to be more confident, more authentic in our values. But we also need to ensure that we understand what we got wrong and explain to the public, apologise and create a better offer. So there\u2019s everything to play for. It can be done in one term, but it\u2019s certainly something that will be the toughest thing we\u2019ve ever had to do. Angela Rayner has robustly defended the government\u2019s plan for mandatory housing targets in the Commons today. Asked by David Simmonds, Conservative shadow minister for housing, how confident the government was of meeting its targets given, he said, \u201cthe uncertainty created by the government\u2019s new top down targets, which will delay the implementation of local plans and therefore planning decisions\u201d, Rayner said: Britain is facing the sharpest housing crisis ever because of the failure of those benches opposite. We will make sure through our mandatory housing targets and announcements that have been made, and will be made at the budget, to ensure that we get the houses that Britain needs. The co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, Carla Denyer, has described the change in the bus fare cap in England from \u00a32 to \u00a33 as \u201cthe wrong approach\u201d. She posted to social media to say: The Labour government has confirmed a 50% rise in bus fares - a blow for everyone who relies on buses in the cost of living crisis. This is the wrong approach \u2013 government should be supporting our economy and environment by making it easier to get around without a car. Blackburn\u2019s independent MP, Adnan Hussain, has also criticised Labour\u2019s plans for the bus fare cap in England. He posted to social media to say: Disappointing Labour plans to increase bus fares by 50%, especially for towns like Blackburn, in the north-west, where many rely on bus services to get to and from work. Pensioners\u2019 heating allowance, two-child cap, and now bus fares. So much for helping the most vulnerable. Hussain won the seat in July from Labour\u2019s Kate Hollern. The government has published a written ministerial statement from deputy prime minister Angela Rayner on social and affordable housing. In it she says Wednesday\u2019s budget will \u201cset out how the government will deliver more affordable housing and ensure social housing is available for those who need it most.\u201d Rayner says: This will include an immediate one year cash injection of \u00a3500m to top up the existing Affordable Homes Programme which will deliver up to 5,000 new social and affordable homes, bringing total investment in housing supply in 2025/2026 to over \u00a35bn. The government will also consult on a new 5-year social housing rent settlement, which caps the rents social housing providers can charge their tenants, to provide the sector with the certainty it needs to invest in new social housing. The intention would be for this to increase with CPI inflation figures and an additional 1%. You can read the statement in full here. The House of Commons is about to start sitting for the week, and after the traditional prayers there will be housing questions. Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron MP has described the announcement raising the bus fare cap from \u00a32 to \u00a33 in England and extended the scheme for a further 12 months as \u201cwithout a doubt a bus tax.\u201d In a statement, Farron said While this new government has been left to make difficult choices, they cannot allow the burden of fixing the Conservatives\u2019 mess to be on people and small businesses across the country. The fundamental issue is that neither Labour nor the Conservatives before them seemed to understand is that for rural communities, it doesn\u2019t matter if the cap is \u00a32 or \u00a33 if they don\u2019t have a bus service in the first place. If the government is serious about growth then it would invest in services which will boost our struggling town centres and high streets. Jeremy Corbyn has also added his voice to criticism of the announcement, saying: Scrapping the \u00a32 bus fare cap is a disgraceful decision that will harm the poorest in society, and discourage public transport at a time when it is needed more than ever. Why is the government punishing people for trying to get to work? Speaking earlier today, prime minister Keir Starmer said that the flat \u00a32 fare cap in England had only been funded by the previous Conservative administration to the end of this year, when it was due to end, and that his government were extending the policy, but at the higher rate. When the policy was announced, the then Conservative government claimed it would save almost a third of the ticket price for the average journey, and cut emissions and congestion by taking an estimated 2m cars off the roads. Earlier Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick described the Labour announcement as \u201cclueless\u201d, and shadow transport secretary Helen Whately said \u201cThat\u2019s \u00a310 a week extra to get to work under Labour. Clearly bus users don\u2019t count as \u2018working people\u2019 either.\u201d Russell Findlay, the new Scottish Conservative leader, has proposed cutting free prescriptions, merging local authorities and abolishing quangos to deliver cuts in Scottish income tax rates. In his first major policy speech since winning the leadership last month, Findlay said \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d in a bid to cut income tax rates, which are devolved in Scotland but higher than in the rest of the UK. He would start by abolishing the 21p tax rate. He told Tory activists and MSPs in Edinburgh: Tens of millions of pounds are waiting to be saved if only politicians in Edinburgh were more concerned about ensuring best value for taxpayers. This should be our mission over the years ahead: rebuild the broken bond of trust between politicians and the public by only promising what\u2019s deliverable. Rebuild trust by being ruthlessly efficient custodians of taxpayers\u2019 money. He said he would reduce Scotland\u2019s 131 quangos and agencies, which the Tories claim cost \u00a319bn a year. He pledged to merge the largest environmental agencies, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and NatureScot, and to scrap the Scottish Land Commission, which oversees land reform policy. He also proposed scrapping baby boxes, which include free gifts of clothing, books and thermometers given to all new mothers. \u201cNothing really is off the table. Everything is up for discussion. Baby boxes might seem in the grand scheme of things like not a lot of money, but \u00a350m could do a lot of good in our public services, and I think we should look at that.\u201d After appearing to suggest abolishing free tuition was under consideration, he later appeared to backtrack. He said the key issue was closing down university courses of little material value \u2013 a theme echoed by candidates in the contest to be the next UK Conservative leader. Findlay refused to be specific on how many of Scotland\u2019s 32 local councils or its NHS boards could be scrapped or merged; the Scottish Labour party has proposed merging Scotland\u2019s 14 territorial NHS boards into three. \u201cI think we need to rationalise where we can and look at everything with a fresh eye. [At] this stage, I\u2019m going to consult with colleagues and bring forward our proper proposals,\u201d he told one reporter. Findlay was elected Scottish Tory leader after his predecessor Douglas Ross resigned following a crisis over his treatment of a fellow Tory election candidate, David Duguid, his expenses claims, and an apparent breach of his promise not to stand again for Westminster. Political correspondent Kiran Stacey has this report on today\u2019s announcements by Keir Starmer: The bus fare cap in England will rise from \u00a32 to \u00a33 at the end of this year, Keir Starmer has said, as Rachel Reeves prepares to raid transport funding in this week\u2019s budget. The prime minister told an audience in Birmingham that the money to fund the \u00a32 cap would run out at the end of 2024 and that the Labour government would then not be able to keep it at the same level after that. The decision by the prime minister and chancellor comes despite heavy lobbying by Labour\u2019s elected mayors to keep the cap in place, as revealed last week by the Guardian. Starmer insisted on Monday that working people would welcome such decisions as a necessary part of fixing the public finances after 14 years of Conservative government. \u201cThe Tories only funded [the \u00a32 fare cap] until the end of 2024, and therefore that is the end of the funding in relation to the \u00a32 bus fare,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI do know that this matters, particularly in rural buses, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m able to say to you this morning that in the budget, we will announce there\u2019ll be a \u00a33 cap on bus fares until the end of 2025, because I know how important it is. So that\u2019ll be there in the budget on Wednesday.\u201d The prime minister was giving a pre-budget speech in Birmingham to set expectations ahead of what ministers warn will be a painful budget for many people, including planned rises to national insurance, capital gains tax and inheritance tax. Read more here: England\u2019s bus fare cap will rise from \u00a32 to \u00a33 in 2025, says Starmer Another part of the dripping out of budget announcements ahead of Wednesday has been the prime minister this morning stating that local services to \u201cget Britain working\u201d will get a \u00a3240m funding boost. It is part of the Labour party\u2019s stated national mission to pull the employment rate up to 80%. In quotes issued from the Chancellor about the funding, Rachel Reeves said \u201cDue to years of economic neglect, the benefits bill is ballooning.\u201d Work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall is quoted as saying that \u201cThrough our Get Britain Working plan, we will ensure every young person is supported to find earnings or learning, while our new jobs and careers service will transform opportunity for all.\u201d Economic inactivity has risen by nearly one million people since before the pandemic in 2020, with PA Media reporting that 85% of this is due to those who are long-term sick. If you didn\u2019t see it, at the weekend our economics correspondent Richard Partington had a reported out piece looking at this issue in Barnsley, where for the first time since the deindustrialisation years, there are more vacancies than people looking for work. I imagine the number of people who could put together a specific list of top five most impactful UK budgets from the last five decades is quite small, but our economics editor Larry Elliott is among them. Readers of a certain age \u2013 including me \u2013 are sure to get a certain frisson from seeing pictures of Geoffrey Howe, Nigel Lawson, Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke among others. Kwasi Kwarteng also, inevitably, puts in an appearance. The adult prison population in England and Wales has dropped 3% after reaching record levels. Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures show there were 85,867 people in prison on Monday, which was 1,598 fewer than recorded at the beginning of last week. PA Media reports the drop means there is capacity for 3,141 more people in the system, and that the figure for inmates is the lowest since 30 June in 2023. Earlier, speaking in Birmingham, prime minister Keir Starmer criticised the record of the previous government, saying \u201cJust look at the state of our prisons. Where\u2019s the Tory apology for that? Watching the prison population rise while they were too weak either to reform sentencing or build new prison places.\u201d A little bit more context around the bus fares cap in England. It was introduced by the last Conservative government at the beginning of 2023 as a three month scheme, budgeted at \u00a360m. It initially capped single bus fares at more than 130 bus operators serving more than 4,600 routes, saving almost a third of the average single ticket price. Some smaller operators declined to participate. In September 2023 government analysis claimed that the overall price of bus fares in England, outside London, had dropped by 7.4% between June 2022 and June 2023, largely as an effect of the scheme. Bus fares in London are capped at \u00a31.75. Robert Jenrick, the Conservative leadership hopeful, has described the Labour government\u2019s decision to extend the bus fare cap in England for another year, but raise the maximum price to \u00a33 as \u201cclueless\u201d, adding \u201cStarmer must think people who get the bus aren\u2019t working people.\u201d Shadow transport secretary Helen Whately, the Conservative MP for Faversham and Mid Kent, has criticised Keir Starmer\u2019s announcement that the bus fare cap in England was set to be extended for another year, but raised from \u00a32 to \u00a33. In a post to social media, Whately said: That\u2019s \u00a310 a week extra to get to work under Labour. Clearly bus users don\u2019t count as \u201cworking people\u201d either. In December 2022 the then-Conservative government announced that the \u00a32 bus fare cap in England \u201cwill run until 31 December 2024.\u201d In his speech in Birmingham announcing the extension and price rise, the prime minister said \u201cI do know how much this matters, particularly in rural communities where there\u2019s heavy reliance on buses.\u201d Keir Starmer has posted to social media to say that \u201cThis budget will help to get Britain working. It will pave the way for reforms that tackle the root causes of economic inactivity, so those who can work, will work.\u201d Earlier, speaking in Birmingham, the prime minister had said the UK is \u201cthe only G7 country for whom economic inactivity is still higher than it was before Covid\u201d. He continued: That\u2019s not just bad for our economy. It\u2019s also bad for all those who are locked out of opportunity. So the Chancellor will announce \u00a3240m in funding to provide local services that can help people back into work. The Green party of England and Wales\u2019s co-leader Carla Denyer has responded to Keir Starmer\u2019s speech in Birmingham by reposting some comments she made yesterday calling for more taxation on the super-rich, saying: 14 years of Tory underinvestment have left public services on their knees, our economy broken. We can\u2019t afford five more yers of this. It feels like Labour are stuck in second gear on the motorway. They could deliver on the change they promised if they\u2019re prepared to tax the super-rich. Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice has also been on the airwaves today talking about Wednesday\u2019s budget. He described Labour\u2019s plans as a \u201ctargeted assault on wealth creation,\u201d saying \u201cWe\u2019re all gonna get absolutely hammered and assaulted on Wednesday.\u201d Keir Starmer has promised \u201cbetter days ahead\u201d and said the era of Tory neglect and \u201cmaking working people pay the price\u201d for their policies was over. In a speech in Birmingham designed to trail Rachel Reeves\u2019 budget on Wednesday, the first from the new administration, Starmer: announced that the bus fares cap in England would be extended for a year, but at a higher rate of \u00a33 said the Chancellor will announce \u00a3240m in funding for services to get people back into work said the country needed to face up to the \u201cfiction\u201d that you can lower taxes and increase public spending at the same time said he could not give a \u201ccast iron guarantee that never again in any budget will there be any adjustment to tax\u201d because \u201cwe just don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner\u201d said his concern was making sure \u201cthere is no more tax in their payslip\u201d for working people sidestepped a question about whether a fuel duty rise would count as a tax on working people who use their cars to get to and from work Starmer warned that working people around the world had lost faith that politics could deliver for them, but said that did not mean politicians should give up on them, warning that \u201cpopulism preys on the fears that people have.\u201d He also accused Rishi Sunak and the previous Conservative government of calling an early election to avoid facing the fiscal situation that his Labour party have inherited. Warning \u201cthere are no shortcuts\u201d, Starmer said: The time is long overdue for politicians in this country to level with you honestly about the trade-offs this country faces Working people know that hard choices are necessary. They lived through the Liz Truss episode. They lived through the cost-of-living crisis. So they know that the things they want from us \u2013 protecting their living standards, building our nation, fixing our public services \u2013 they know that this can only be achieved alongside economic stability. Keir Starmer somewhat sidestepped a question on whether a rise in fuel duty would count as a rise in taxes on working people, and whether the government planned such a rise. During a question and answer session with the media in Birmingham, Jack Ellison from the Sun had asked \u201cEvery day millions of people across the country will get in their cars and go to work. So would any hike to fuel duty on Wednesday be a direct hit on the working people that you claim the champion?\u201d In response the prime minister said: Well, I know this is a particular concern to your readers, and I\u2019m not going to preempt what happens on Wednesday, but obviously this is an issue that comes up at every budget, and you\u2019ll see how we deal with it at this budget. But I do understand how important it is. I understand what you\u2019re putting to me, and I know how important it is to you, your readers and others. Keir Starmer has drawn a round of applause from the audience in Birmingham after a rather brusque response to a question from a journalist from the Daily Mail. Asked whether Starmer thought his government was at odds with the priorities of the public after Kumail Jaffer cited \u201cnew polling this morning suggests that the majority of voters would prefer Wednesday\u2019s priority to be lower taxes ahead of investment in public services,\u201d Starmer initially simply said \u201cNo.\u201d He then elaborated: I think for too long we pretended that you could lower your tax and spend more on your public services. It is about time we faced up to that fiction. A couple of questions during this session from Sky News and the Times have attempted to get the prime minister to commit to no further tax rises during the course of the five year parliament. Keir Starmer has refused to allow himself to become a hostage to fortune here, saying: We are fixing the foundations in this budget. So that is the purpose of this budget, to take the difficult decisions. Now nobody wants tax rises, least of all me, so we will do the hard work in this budget to allow us then to rebuild the country. I can\u2019t give you a cast iron guarantee that never again in any budget will there be any adjustment to tax, because we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner. We\u2019ve lived through, in the last five or six years, Ukraine, Covid, et cetera. But I can tell you that as we stand here now going into this budget, it\u2019s our intention to take the tough decisions here and now up front, in the hope that we can then build and rebuild the country on that stable foundation. Keir Starmer has announced that Labour will raise the \u00a32 bus fare cap in England to \u00a33 next week. Asked about rumours around changes to the cap in Wednesday\u2019s budget, the prime minister said: On the \u00a32 bus fare, the first thing to say is the Tories had only funded that til the end of 2024 and therefore that is the end of the funding in relation to the \u00a32 capped fair. I do know how much this matters, particularly in rural communities where there\u2019s heavy reliance on busses, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m able to say to you this morning that in the budget, we will announce there will be a \u00a33 cap on bus fares to the end of 2025, because I know how important it is. So that will be there in the budget on Wednesday. Sam Coates from Sky News asked the prime minister if he was \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d that the government were \u201cfront-loading\u201d tax rises, and could he rule out further tax rises in future budgets. Keir Starmer said \u201cI fundamentally believe that we need to run towards the tough decisions. I fundamentally believe we have to fix the foundations so we can build a better future, and that\u2019s tough. That\u2019s difficult.\u201d The first two questions have been from the BBC and ITV and have focussed on the semantics of whether Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour manifesto was \u201chonest\u201d about taxes on working people. The prime minister said in reply to one of the questions: Let me be clear. As far as working people, I\u2019m concerned with what\u2019s in their payslip, and making sure that there is no more tax in their payslip. And that matters to people, because we made that promise to them. But honesty is really important, because we\u2019re facing really difficult decisions, and I\u2019m not prepared to continue with the fiction that we\u2019ve had previously over the last 14 years. Where there are problems, we\u2019ll identify them and we will fix them. As a reminder, this is the paragraph from the Labour manifesto which has sparked these accusations: The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income Tax, or VAT. Keir Starmer has said that this week\u2019s Labour budget will \u201clight the way\u201d ahead for the new government. He said \u201cWe have five years and a big mandate so working people will not accept any excuses,\u201d adding that the government \u201cwill publish clear ambitions for this parliament\u201d that they can be measured about. He continued: These are my priorities for change, and I won\u2019t change course. The budget will light the way, and we will use the power of government for stability, investment and reform with partnerships across the whole of society, galvanised by clear objectives, to deliver on the priorities of the British people. Foundations fixed, public services renewed, a country rebuilt. Starmer is now taking questions from the media. Keir Starmer says that working people across the world have lost faith that politics can deliver for them. Describing it as a paradox, the prime minister said: All around the world, traditional values, democratic values, values that have underpinned the way countries like ours have operated for years, the pragmatism that is part of our identity, is under attack. Why? Because people \u2013 working people most of all \u2013 have lost faith it can still deliver for their family, And yet, at the same time, what people want from politics hasn\u2019t changed. People want a stable economy. They want their country to be safe, their borders secure, economic security, national security, border security. Beyond that, they want exactly what those [Labour] national missions promise, a growing economy, safer streets, clean British energy in their home, opportunities for their children and an NHS that is there when they need it. I know populism preys on the fears that people have that these things no longer belong to them. But I\u2019ve never felt that the right response is to ignore those concerns, rather than showing that they can still be delivered. In Birmingham Keir Starmer has delivered his previously trialled line, that his government will ignore the \u201cpopulist chorus of easy answers\u201d in this week\u2019s budget. The prime minister said: Politics is a choice, and it\u2019s time to choose a clear path. It\u2019s time to embrace the harsh light of fiscal reality so we can come together behind a credible long term plan. It\u2019s time we ran towards the tough decisions, because ignoring them set us on this path of decline. It\u2019s time we ignored the populist chorus of easy answers, because we saw what happened if you reject the constraints of the economic stability, and we\u2019re never going back to that. That is our choice. Stability to prevent chaos. Borrowing that will drive long term growth. Tax rises to prevent austerity and rebuild public services. We choose to protect working people. We choose to get the NHS back on its feet. We choose to fix the foundations, reject decline and rebuild our country with investment. Starmer then issued a challenge to the opposition, citing the disastrous short-lived premiership of Liz Truss, saying: I can\u2019t get into the individual measures before Wednesday but I will say this. If people want to criticise the path we choose, that\u2019s their prerogative, but let them spell out a different direction. If they think the state has grown too big, let them tell working people which public services they would cut. If they think tax rises are unfair, let them tell working people which taxes they would raise instead. If they don\u2019t see our long term investment in infrastructure as necessary, let them explain to working people how they would grow the economy for them. And if they think the taxes are too high, but they don\u2019t want to cut public spending, let them tell working people why the lessons of Liz Truss no longer apply. Because I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, the time is long overdue for politicians in this country to level with you honestly about the trade offs this country faces. To stop insulting your intelligence with the chicanery of easy answers. Keir Starmer has accused Rishi Sunak and the previous Conservative government of calling an early election to avoid facing the fiscal situation that his Labour party have inherited. Speaking in Birmingham, the prime minister said: Just look at the state of our prisons. Where\u2019s the Tory apology for that? Watching the prison population rise while they were too weak either to reform sentencing or build new prison places. Too scared to conduct a proper spending review, as we\u2019ve done, because of the damage they knew it would uncover. They knew. That\u2019s why they ran away from that exercise and called an early election instead. They knew our public services were broken. They knew there was a black hole in the public finances. \u00a322bn of unfunded spending this year. Wasting reserves three times over on Rwanda, asylum hotels, propping up a failing train companies, and that\u2019s before we even get the long term challenges ignored for 14 years. Keir Starmer has said the era of the Conservatives \u201cdestroying economic foundations\u201d and making \u201cworking people pay the price\u201d is over. Speaking in Birmingham two days ahead of the first budget from the new government, Starmer said: It will be a budget which will show to the British people that we won\u2019t be distracted from our task. That we will stick to our long term plan. Run towards the tough decisions, rip off the short term sticky plasters. So we can lead our country, finally, but decisively out of this, pay more, get less, doomed, low growth Tory trap that for 14 years, decimated public services, destroyed our economic foundations and made working people pay the price. And mark my words, that era is now over. We are turning the page on Tory decline, closing the book on their austerity and chaos. Those days are done. They are behind us, and change is here. Speaking in Brimingham, the prime minister has said he will defend Labour\u2019s \u201ctough decisions\u201d on the economy being made in the budget this week. He likened the public finances and the state of public services to a homeowner finding damp in their house. Keir Starmer said: Everyone who finds damp in their house knows they have to make the decision, paint over it or strip it out, pull off the plaster and deal with it once and for all. So I will defend our tough decisions all day long. It\u2019s the right thing for our country, and it\u2019s the only way to get the investment that we need. That is how we will fix the NHS, rebuild Britain and protect the payslips of working people delivering on our mandate of change. In a section of his speech that seems very much informed by the lengthy media debate over the weekend on the semantics of what constitutes a \u201cworking person\u201d, prime minister Keir Starmer has said: Every decision that we have made, every decision that we will make in the future, will be made with working people in our mind\u2019s eye. People who\u2019ve been working harder and harder for years just to stand still. People doing the right thing, maybe still finding a little bit of money to put away. Paying their way, even in the cost of living crisis. But who feel that this country no longer gives them or their children a fair chance. He continued about the identity of \u201cworking people\u201d, saying: I know some people want to have a debate about this, and I know there will always be an exception that proves the rule. Welcome to the wonders of a diverse country. But I also know that the working people of this country know exactly who they are. That they are the golden thread that runs through our agenda. Every single one of our national missions is about delivering for them, and we\u2019re getting on with the job. Kier Starmer has started his speech by reminding people that Birmingham, where he is speaking, had an announcement of a \u00a3500m investment in battery storage, and said \u201cthat\u2019s a snapshot of the Britain we\u2019re building.\u201d Keir Starmer is speaking in the West Midlands. We will bring you the key lines that emerge. You can watch it here \u2026 Richard Parker, mayor of the West Midlands, is opening the event where Keir Starmer is due to speak. The prime minister has begun the publicity push for his speech this morning on social media, with Keir Starmer issuing a post saying: This is a landmark week for Britain. For the first time in 15 years, our budget will put working people first. The truth is, the Tories left you to pay the price for their chaos. We will clear up their mess. Step up in tough times, not stand back. We will deliver change. Starmer is expected to speak and take questions from the media in the West Midlands this morning. Labour\u2019s leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, is expected to be making a visit in Glasgow today ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Westminster budget, which he says \u201cwill end the era of austerity and prioritise investment and growth.\u201d In a piece for the Daily Record published today, Sarwar writes: This week will see the first budget of a new UK Labour government. After 14 years of Tory chaos, division and decline, it will continue the job of turning the page on those lost Tory years, fixing the foundations and rebuilding our country. This week you will hear many, the Tories and the SNP, who will want to pretend that all of the UK\u2019s problems started three months ago or that somehow all of the UK\u2019s problems can be fixed with one budget. They will be insulting the intelligence of the Scottish people by attempting to absolve the Tories of their woeful record. He did sound a slight note of warning to his Labour colleagues based in London, though, adding: I recognise that the Chancellor will have to raise revenues, but any tax rises must fall on those with the broadest shoulders, and not hit working people who have already borne the brunt of the Tories crashing the economy and SNP income tax hikes. We need a Budget that prioritises investment and growth. We need to see a significant increase in capital investment. This is the change that Scotland needs \u2014 and I will be doing everything I can to make sure a Labour government delivers it. Esther Webber at Politico has an interesting piece this morning looking at some of the complaints by newly elected MPs about how, one said, \u201ctradition is standing in the way of MPs being able to either see their kids in the evening or do our job effectively.\u201d Among the complaints are the tradition of MPs having to bob up and down to attract the attention of the speaker in order to be called, late sitting hours, and the failure to implement electronic voting. Green MP Ellie Chowns has complained the so-called bobbing \u201cis not an efficient or accessible way to form an orderly queue to speak.\u201d Webber writes: MPs are proposing the Commons should have a \u201ccall list\u201d of the kind already employed by the House of Lords, where a list is published each day setting out who is going to speak and in what order. Some would also like to see a reformed timetable, with earlier sitting hours on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and a return to digital voting, which was trialed during the Covid pandemic but later dropped. You can read more here on the Politico website: Britain\u2019s new MPs rage at parliament\u2019s old traditions Imposing VAT on international schools in the UK could lead to hundreds of pupils leaving, European diplomats have said. They called for the institutions to retain the exemption from the 20% duty that private schools are expected to lose. The German and French ambassadors to the UK, Miguel Berger and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Duch\u00eane, said international schools were distinct from British private schools because the option of transferring to the British state sector was not always realistic for their pupils. Read more from Kevin Rawlinson here: VAT on international schools \u2018could prompt hundreds of pupils to leave UK\u2019 We are expecting Keir Starmer to give a pre-budget speech at about 11.15am this morning. It will, naturally, be quite light on detail ahead of the budget itself \u2013 tradition dictates that major measures can be trailed and hinted at but not announced before the day \u2013 but the prime minister is expected to set out the direction of travel for his government this way, with overnight briefing suggesting he will say: It is working people who pay the price when their government fails to deliver economic stability. They\u2019ve had enough of slow growth, stagnant living standards and crumbling public services. They know that austerity is no solution. And they\u2019ve seen the chaos when politicians let borrowing get out of control. We choose a different path: honest, responsible, long-term decisions in the interests of working people. It\u2019s stability that means we can invest, and reform that will maximise that investment. Stability, investment, reform. That\u2019s how we fix the NHS, rebuild Britain and protect working people\u2019s payslips. Delivering on the mandate of change. If people want to criticise the path we choose, that\u2019s their prerogative. But let them then spell out a different direction. If they think the state has grown too big, let them tell working people which public services they would cut. If they don\u2019t see our long-term investment in infrastructure as necessary, let them explain to working people how they would grow the economy for them. This is an economic plan that will change the long-term trajectory on British growth for the better. Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has issued a strong rebuke to shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s criticism of the Office for Budget Responsibility plans to publish a report about the country\u2019s fiscal situation, saying the Tories \u201cdon\u2019t want to hear the truth\u201d about the financial situation they left for the new government. Speaking on GB News, McFadden said: You have the sight today of the shadow chancellor desperately attacking the Office for Budget Responsibility for producing a report on the inheritance. They don\u2019t want to hear the truth. They don\u2019t want people to know about it. We inherited a whole load of things that were announced for which no funding had been allocated. It was enormously irresponsible. He said that when voters hear the budget announcement on Wednesday, they should be \u201cannoyed at a mess that we inherited.\u201d He told viewers: If people are annoyed about things that they\u2019ll hear about in the Budget, what I would say is be annoyed at the Tory legacy. Some of these decisions are difficult, but we have to fix up the situation that we inherited. There will be extra funds for public services, and there\u2019ll be a different investment story for the future. Hunt, who was appointed as chancellor by Liz Truss in October 2022 after her disastrous mini-budget led to the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng, has complained that the decision of the OBR to publish a report on the same day as the budget was \u201ca surprise and a significant concern\u201d. [See 9.50am GMT] McFadden was also inevitably again asked about the definition of a \u201cworking person\u201d by the media, and said: We\u2019ve had a lot of discussion in recent days about definitions, about job descriptions, or people\u2019s earning levels and so on. I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s the way to look at it. The way to look at it is to look at what we said in our manifesto about income tax, national insurance and VAT. And the question is, will we keep to those promises when the Budget happens on Wednesday? We will. McFadden added \u201cIt wasn\u2019t somebody is included if they earn a particular amount or they do a particular job, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a helpful way to think about it. We will stick to our manifesto promises.\u201d Shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt has returned to his theme this morning that Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) plans to publish a review of the Treasury on the same days as the budget are, he says, undermining the OBR\u2019s position of political impartiality. In a message on social media, the former chancellor said: I\u2019m a strong supporter of the OBR. I was proud to serve in the government which set it up and strongly believe it enhances the UK\u2019s economic credibility. However its credibility in holding the government to account depends on political impartiality so if that is being undermined friends need to say so. It cannot be right to publish a review of what happened under the previous government without consulting those who had political responsibility at the time. As my colleague Graeme Wearden reported late on Sunday, Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog is to publish a detailed breakdown of the \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d that Labour says it inherited after Rachel Reeves presents the budget on Wednesday, which Hunt has described as \u201ca surprise and a significant concern.\u201d Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has said that the new Labour government had \u201clevelled with people\u201d ahead of the budget, and that it would be \u201cthe most honest \u2026 we\u2019ve had for some years.\u201d Speaking on Times Radio, PA Media quotes McFadden saying: There\u2019s no point in telling people everything\u2019s absolutely fine when the prison system is in a state of collapse, when NHS waiting lists are at a record high, when we\u2019ve got crumbling schools. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s wrong that we\u2019ve got to fix and it\u2019s important to set that out honestly and candidly for the public. I think we\u2019ll have the most honest Budget on Wednesday that we\u2019ve had for some years. An important thing is when people see their payslip after the Budget, those key things to look for: the level of tax \u2013 income tax and national insurance \u2013 in their payslip in their wages, that won\u2019t change after Wednesday. Jeremy Corbyn and the independent alliance of MPs have issued a letter ahead of the budget with five things they are asking Chancellor Rachel Reeves to implement. Saying \u201cWe have the means to end poverty, we just need the political will\u201d, Corbyn listed five priorities: Scrap the two-child benefits cap Reverse cuts to winter fuel Tax wealth Protect welfare Invest in a greener future In a letter accompanying the requests, the independent group of MPs write: It is a national scandal that 4.2 million children and 2.1 million pensioners are living in poverty in the sixth richest country in the world. You have previously told the British public to prepare for \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d to repair this nation\u2019s finances. At the very same time, you have committed to raising defence expenditure to 2.5% of GDP. Imagine if we spent that money on renewable energy, social housing, schools and the NHS instead. The Labour party this morning is touting a piece in the Sun in which the government is announcing it will pledge \u00a3500m to fixing what it terms \u201cthe pothole crisis\u201d in Wednesday\u2019s budget. Josh Halliday is the North of England editor at the Guardian A Labour MP has warned that the government risks embarking on \u201causterity 2.0\u201d in a stark warning ahead of the budget on Wednesday. Kim Johnson, the MP for Liverpool Riverside, urged the chancellor Rachel Reeves to reverse expected cuts to benefits and the winter fuel allowance, citing fears that \u201cpeople will die this year unless this cut is reversed\u201d. In a letter to Reeves published on Monday, Johnson writes: \u201cThe anticipated \u00a33 billion in sickness benefit cuts risk driving some of the most vulnerable in our society into poverty and could be perceived as austerity 2.0.\u201d Liverpool Riverside is ranked as the most deprived parliamentary constituency in the UK, where 43% of children are classed as living in poverty \u2013 more than double the national average. Johnson, a backbench MP who has not shied away from criticising the Labour leadership, writes that her constituency has suffered \u201csystematic impoverishment, skyrocketing inequalities and plummeting living standards under successive Tory governments, while the right and powerful continue to benefit\u201d. She adds: \u201cOn 30 October, these communities who voted for change will be looking to Labour to deliver for them. We must not let them down.\u201d During his media round this morning Pat McFadden rather hit the nail on the head about the futility of interviews around the time of the budget, when ministers are forbidden from giving any details in advance. He told viewers of BBC Breakfast: I can\u2019t speculate on the individual measures. We\u2019re in this period where you interview people a day or two before a budget, and we really can\u2019t comment on what might be in it. It seems like that the question and answer session after Keir Starmer\u2019s speech this morning will mostly consist of him saying \u201cWell, I can\u2019t give you any details, wait until Wednesday\u201d to an increasingly frustrated broadcast journalist pool. We will, of course, bring you any key lines that do emerge when the prime minister speaks. Conservative shadow health secretary Victoria Atkins has accused the Keir Starmer government of imposing \u201c1970s socialism\u201d with its budget plans. Speaking on GB News, Atkins, who retained her Louth and Horncastle seat in July\u2019s election, said: This is socialism that we\u2019ve seen in the 1970s. This Labour government came into power promising they weren\u2019t going to raise taxes. They have this peculiar definition of working people. They don\u2019t seem to understand what a working person is, even though they\u2019ve set this test for themselves. If you have assets, if you work, if you\u2019re a pensioner looking this winter as to how you\u2019re going to make up that shortfall, given that they\u2019ve slashed winter fuel payments, this is going to affect all of us. This idea that they\u2019re compartmentalising and separating us into different categories of people that they find acceptable, I think is the very worst of socialism. It seems unlikely that many on the left of the Labour party would claim that Rachel Reeves is about to launch a set of socialist economic policies in the budget this week. In its election manifesto, Labour ruled out tax rises on income tax, employee national insurance contributions, and VAT. On the BBC Breakfast programme cabinet minister Pat McFadden was asked more about Labour\u2019s definition of \u201cworking people\u201d, a phrase which has dominated media coverage in recent days. He said: I don\u2019t define this by picking a job, or an income level, and relate it to the promises you just mentioned in the manifesto. We were talking about the taxes that people pay on their wages, and we said we will not increase those. Look, that was true in the campaign. It\u2019s true today. It will be true after Wednesday. We will stick to those promises when the Chancellor updates the budget speech this week. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has described it as \u201cfrustrating\u201d that both Labour and Conservatives ignored his warning before the election that there was a significant problem with the public finances. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: One heard the senior politicians from both sides continually saying that there wasn\u2019t this problem, and taxes wouldn\u2019t really have to go up, and growth would source it all. But everybody knew that there was a big problem with the public finances, and we\u2019d either have to get tax increases or significant spending cuts. And lo and behold, we\u2019re being told that that has now been discovered, and it looks like we\u2019re going to get something like \u00a340bn of tax increases, if the briefing is to be believed. And that would make this one of the biggest tax raising budgets ever. Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has said there are \u201creal reasons\u201d to have optimism as the country approaches the first Labour budget for 14 years later this week. He stated that the government had \u201cinherited a plan to decline, to reduce, investment\u201d from Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservative government, and that the measures Labour were taking in the budget were \u201ctough decisions\u201d but the start of a turnaround. He told viewers of BBC Breakfast: I think people should look for three things in the budget. Will it stabilize the country\u2019s public finances and do so in a way that keeps our promises? It will Will it also start to turn around the public services and the NHS in particular. We will start that road with a combination of both investment and reform. And critically, will it change the country\u2019s story for the future by investing in the things that we need, the better schools, hospitals, the houses we need, the transport infrastructure, the energy infrastructure. This is what Britain has to do if it\u2019s going to get better economic growth in the future. What we inherited was a plan to decline, to reduce investment in all of those things going forward. That\u2019s not a role we were prepared to accept we need to invest in the future of the country if we\u2019re going to have a better future. So there are tough decisions in this budget. There are also real reasons to look for hope and optimism, for better public services, a better NHS and a better investment and growth story for the UK in the future. McFadden has served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster since July\u2019s general election. Keir Starmer will be making a pre-budget speech later today in which he is expected to lay out what he says is the dire state of the fiscal reality of the country, but promise that \u201cbetter days are ahead\u201d. In briefings given in advance of the speech, the prime minister is expected to say: This is not 1997, when the economy was decent but public services were on their knees. And it\u2019s not 2010, where public services were strong, but the public finances were weak. These are unprecedented circumstances. And that\u2019s before we even get to the long-term challenges ignored for 14 years: an economy riddled with weakness on productivity and investment, a state that needs urgent modernisation to face down the challenge of a volatile world. Starmer will say the Budget will embrace the \u201charsh light of fiscal reality\u201d, and will have to \u201cignore the populist chorus of easy answers\u201d. In the 2024 Labour manifesto the party said: The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income Tax, or VAT. Prime minister Keir Starmer will make a speech today in which he is widely expected to say that this week\u2019s budget will embrace the \u201charsh light of fiscal reality\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s not 2010\u201d, but he will promise that \u201cbetter days are ahead\u201d. Here are your headlines \u2026 UK businesses are losing staff working time because of waits for healthcare or caring duties due to underfunded public services, the TUC says Pubs and restaurants are warning of closures and a tough Christmas ahead if the budget raises taxes and ends a Covid-era relief on business rates The prime minister has said content creators must be paid and vowed to ensure AI technology \u201cdoes not begin to chip away\u201d at press freedoms Starmer has appointed Claire Reynolds, a former aide to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, as his new political director in Downing Street Chancellor Rachel Reeves and health secretary Wes Streeting are visiting a London hospital this morning. Labour\u2019s leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, is making a pre-budget visit to a community group in Glasgow.

Some of the best cheddar cheese in the world has been stolen.\u201d Urging followers to keep an eye out, he added: \u201cIf anyone hears anything about posh cheese going for cheap, it\u2019s probably some wrong\u2019uns.\u201d Sarah Stewart, the owner of the cheese retailer, told the Times they had received messages of solidarity, offers of help and orders from new customers from around the world. \u201cClearly British people love their cheese but we have had a lot of really incredible people getting in touch, it seems like it\u2019s gone international,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had producers that we buy from asking what can they do, can they offer extended terms and financial support, and trade customers saying \u2018can we pay quicker and what can we do?\u2019.\u201d Tom Calver, the director of a Somerset supplier who produced some of the stolen cheese, said he had been \u201chugely distressed\u201d when he heard the news. Neal\u2019s Yard still paid his company, Westcombe Dairy, and other producers so that they would not have to bear the cost \u201cdespite the significant financial blow\u201d. \u201cNeal\u2019s Yard have been fantastic. We are just trying to support them as much as possible by encouraging people to shop with them. It is a huge, very difficult loss,\u201d said Calver, whose cheddar sells for \u00a37 for 250g. \u201cWhat worries me is the trust element in things,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the end of the day what we need to have is more trust in the food supply system rather than less of it.\u201d A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: \u201cOn Monday October 21, we received a report of the theft of a large quantity of cheese from a manufacturer based in Southwark. Inquiries are ongoing into the circumstances. There has been no arrest.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Police viewed confidential information about the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard such as her X-rays out of \u201ccuriosity\u201d, a disciplinary hearing heard. Seven Metropolitan police officers were accused of looking at sensitive information relating to the case after the arrest of the firearms officer Wayne Couzens, the Times reported. An audit by the Met\u2019s directorate of professional standards, codenamed Operation Scarborough, found that four serving and three former officers accessed the information. Everard, 33, went missing in March 2021, with Couzens arrested for her kidnap, rape and murder. An investigation found the group viewed electronic records, including investigation logs, witness information and evidence. A \u201cflurry of access\u201d to the files happened after Couzens\u2019 arrest on suspicion of kidnap on 9 March 2021, including X-rays taken of Everard. The serving Met officer was arrested again the next day on suspicion of murdering Everard, who went missing near Clapham Common in south London. Couzens was not named publicly at the time but Scotland Yard briefed that a serving officer from the parliamentary and diplomatic protection unit had been arrested. Paul Ozin KC, representing the Met at the disciplinary hearing in central London on Monday, said the timing of the rush to access the internal police files was \u201cnot a coincidence\u201d. The force is seeking to have the officers in question dismissed, describing their behaviour as \u201cinconsistent with the values and standards of the police service of the 21st century\u201d. It said some of the officers involved tried to \u201ccover their tracks\u201d by giving false reasons for accessing the information. Some of the officers also viewed custody information relating to Couzens\u2019 wife, Elena, who had been detained by police on suspicion of assisting an offender before being released without charge, the panel heard. Ozin added: \u201cIt was entirely to do with their own personal curiosity about a high-profile case in the public eye. \u201cAnd when further facts became known about a case that involved a fellow serving Met police officer, accused of the most terrible crimes, they each chose to abuse their privileged position. \u201cThat is to say, the position which enabled them to access confidential and sensitive police data, entirely for the purpose of satisfying their own personal curiosity.\u201d All seven of the officers involved admit accessing the documents to some extent but deny that it amounted to gross misconduct. The access could also have been a breach of data protection rules, exposing the force to the \u201cpossibility of liability and serious reputational damage\u201d, Ozin said. Akinwale Ajose-Adeogun, a former custody support inspector, is accused of accessing Couzens\u2019 records on 10 and 12 March of the same year. He resigned earlier this year. Former trainee detective constable Hannah Rebbeck said she viewed the information because \u201cshe felt curious, anxious and invested in the outcome of the investigation\u201d, the hearing was told. She viewed Everard\u2019s X-rays between 10 and 15 March 2021 and downloaded statements relating to the investigation. Robert Butters, a detective constable, resigned after 30 years with the force the night before the hearing began, it was told. Mark Harper, a custody sergeant, is accused of viewing the information between 10 and 13 March 2021. Other serving officers involved in the proceedings are PC Myles McHugh, PC Clare Tett and DC Tyrone Ward.",

      "body": "<p>As was the case for many of the journalists of his generation who covered the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the life and career of the award-winning photographer Paul Lowe was defined by the conflict.</p> <p>In 1992 he travelled to Sarajevo to document the horror in a city besieged by Bosnian Serb forces whose population was cut off from the world, being pounded with artillery and picked off by snipers. He fell in love with the place, the people and his future wife, and never really left.</p> <p>Lowe, who has died aged 60, sought to portray people reduced by war to what he called \u201ca medieval state of existence \u2026 doing the things that make us human\u201d in defiance of the 300 shells that struck the city on an average day, targeting schools, hospitals and queues for food and water.</p>    <p>Among his many photographs showing the resilience, resolve and courage of city residents from those years, is one in which a child plays with a ball next to an anti-tank trap \u2013 he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/03/a-girl-plays-in-the-street-during-siege-sarajevo-paul-lowe-best-photograph\">later select this as his best picture</a>. In others, a woman weeps over a makeshift coffin strewn with flowers, and famished locals pick leaves and grass to eat.</p> <p>Again like many journalists in the besieged Bosnian capital, Lowe was dismayed and frustrated at the general indifference in other European capitals to the conflict raging at the heart of the continent. \u201cMany of us covering the siege of Sarajevo initially believed, perhaps naively, that telling the story loud enough, well enough and honestly enough would lead to condemnation and intervention from the international community,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/03/a-girl-plays-in-the-street-during-siege-sarajevo-paul-lowe-best-photograph\">told the Guardian in 2022</a>. \u201cThere was a sense of incredulity that this could be happening in a European capital city. I don\u2019t think any of us would have thought the blockade would still be in place three years later.\u201d </p> <p>The Sarajevo siege lasted 1,425 days \u2013 the longest in modern history \u2013 and left more than 11,500 people, including over 1,600 children, dead. When it ended and the UN troops and media returned home, Lowe stayed to marry Amra Abadzic, a Bosnian working for the Reuters news agency.</p>    <p>After their marriage in 1995, he gave up war reporting, deeming it incompatible with raising a family. A thoughtful and considered man, he also questioned the role of journalists \u2013 particularly photographers \u2013 in situations of conflict and distress, recognising their value as chroniclers of history but troubled by whether their presence was positive or intrusive to those in distress.</p> <p>Instead he turned to documenting Sarajevo\u2019s return to peace and spent the following decades ensuring the trauma of his adopted home city would not be forgotten, through books, exhibitions and as a mentor to new generations of photojournalists. His book <a href=\"https://www.warphotoltd.com/exhibitions/bosnians27\">Bosnians</a>, documenting the war and its aftermath, was published in 2005.</p> <p>\u201cPhotography can be much more than a purely descriptive medium,\u201d he told his students. \u201cPhotographs can be used as tools with which to think and to analyse. I knew the things I was photographing were going to become part of our historical narrative.\u201d</p> <p>Kenneth Morrison, who co-authored <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/reporting-the-siege-of-sarajevo-9781350081796/\">Reporting the Siege of Sarajevo</a> (2021) with Lowe, <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2024/10/16/remembering-paul-lowe-photojournalist-who-pictured-sarajevo-in-war-and-peace/\">told the news website Balkan Insight</a>: \u201cWhile many other photojournalists were focused on getting close to the frontlines, Paul meticulously documented the lives of ordinary people in the besieged city. His vast collection of photographs is not only a hugely important historical resource but a testament to how much he loved Sarajevo.\u201d</p> <p>Born in London, Paul was brought up by his mother, Barbara Lowe, first in the capital, then in Liverpool, where he attended St Edward\u2019s college, founded by the Irish Christian Brothers, and later in Lancashire, where he was a pupil at Darwen Vale high school.</p> <p>As a reward for winning a scholarship to read history at Cambridge University, his mother bought him a camera to record his student days. It was this, rather than graduating with a 2:2 degree in history and philosophy, that decided his future.</p>    <p>In the 1980s, Lowe reported on the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Romanian revolution, followed by the domino-like collapse of communism in Europe.

      "bodyText": "As was the case for many of the journalists of his generation who covered the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the life and career of the award-winning photographer Paul Lowe was defined by the conflict. In 1992 he travelled to Sarajevo to document the horror in a city besieged by Bosnian Serb forces whose population was cut off from the world, being pounded with artillery and picked off by snipers. He fell in love with the place, the people and his future wife, and never really left. Lowe, who has died aged 60, sought to portray people reduced by war to what he called \u201ca medieval state of existence \u2026 doing the things that make us human\u201d in defiance of the 300 shells that struck the city on an average day, targeting schools, hospitals and queues for food and water. Among his many photographs showing the resilience, resolve and courage of city residents from those years, is one in which a child plays with a ball next to an anti-tank trap \u2013 he would later select this as his best picture. In others, a woman weeps over a makeshift coffin strewn with flowers, and famished locals pick leaves and grass to eat. Again like many journalists in the besieged Bosnian capital, Lowe was dismayed and frustrated at the general indifference in other European capitals to the conflict raging at the heart of the continent. \u201cMany of us covering the siege of Sarajevo initially believed, perhaps naively, that telling the story loud enough, well enough and honestly enough would lead to condemnation and intervention from the international community,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2022. \u201cThere was a sense of incredulity that this could be happening in a European capital city. I don\u2019t think any of us would have thought the blockade would still be in place three years later.\u201d The Sarajevo siege lasted 1,425 days \u2013 the longest in modern history \u2013 and left more than 11,500 people, including over 1,600 children, dead. When it ended and the UN troops and media returned home, Lowe stayed to marry Amra Abadzic, a Bosnian working for the Reuters news agency. After their marriage in 1995, he gave up war reporting, deeming it incompatible with raising a family. A thoughtful and considered man, he also questioned the role of journalists \u2013 particularly photographers \u2013 in situations of conflict and distress, recognising their value as chroniclers of history but troubled by whether their presence was positive or intrusive to those in distress. Instead he turned to documenting Sarajevo\u2019s return to peace and spent the following decades ensuring the trauma of his adopted home city would not be forgotten, through books, exhibitions and as a mentor to new generations of photojournalists. His book Bosnians, documenting the war and its aftermath, was published in 2005. \u201cPhotography can be much more than a purely descriptive medium,\u201d he told his students. \u201cPhotographs can be used as tools with which to think and to analyse. I knew the things I was photographing were going to become part of our historical narrative.\u201d Kenneth Morrison, who co-authored Reporting the Siege of Sarajevo (2021) with Lowe, told the news website Balkan Insight: \u201cWhile many other photojournalists were focused on getting close to the frontlines, Paul meticulously documented the lives of ordinary people in the besieged city. His vast collection of photographs is not only a hugely important historical resource but a testament to how much he loved Sarajevo.\u201d Born in London, Paul was brought up by his mother, Barbara Lowe, first in the capital, then in Liverpool, where he attended St Edward\u2019s college, founded by the Irish Christian Brothers, and later in Lancashire, where he was a pupil at Darwen Vale high school. As a reward for winning a scholarship to read history at Cambridge University, his mother bought him a camera to record his student days. It was this, rather than graduating with a 2:2 degree in history and philosophy, that decided his future. In the 1980s, Lowe reported on the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Romanian revolution, followed by the domino-like collapse of communism in Europe. He photographed the Somalia famine and genocide in Rwanda, the conflict in Chechnya and Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from prison in South Africa, and won awards not just for the technical quality of his images but for their humanity. His work appeared in the Guardian, the Observer, the Sunday Times magazine, Time, Newsweek, Life and other international publications. Bosnia would represent the pinnacle of his photographic career, but he was frustrated by \u201cthe fact that, despite all of our coverage of the atrocities taking place in Bosnia, the international community failed to intervene, and it took the massacre of 8,000 men and children in Srebrenica to force their hand. And then, to watch the same unfolding in Ukraine today.\u201d In recent years, Lowe was course director of the master\u2019s programme in photojournalism and documentary photography at the London College of Communication, University of the Arts London, and a professor of conflict, peace and the image. He also contributed to the VII Foundation, which trains journalists from underrepresented communities. Lowe and his family split their time between the UK and Bosnia, and he was a passionate runner and cyclist, participating in trail races and triathlons in both countries. He died from a stab wound to the neck while on a walking trail in the San Gabriel mountains in California. His son Emir has been charged with his murder. Lowe is survived by Amra and their sons, Emir and Amil. \u2022 Christian Paul Lowe, photographer, author and academic, born 6 November 1963; died 12 October 2024",

Elsewhere, minimal Neptunes-influenced beats abut lush Beach Boys harmonies, and folky acoustic guitar figures appear alongside lush G-funk-inspired synths and the sound of an 80s R&amp;B slow jam is disturbed by machine-gun drum rolls. It\u2019s held together by a profusion of gasps and grunts and feral barks that thread through the rhythm tracks, lending even the most laid-back tracks a claustrophobic feel.</p> <p>After an hour, it ends without any real sense of resolution: the closing track is called I Hope You Find Your Way Home, but one doesn\u2019t hold out much hope. It finds Tyler, the Creator still thrashing around \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m slipping, I\u2019m slipping \u2026 I need a hand\u201d \u2013 constantly contradicting himself about his hopes for the future. An album that began with its author denying its existence, Chromakopia ultimately seems to manifest a state of confusion, in which everything is in flux and nothing is quite as it initially seems. It achieves that to enthralling and exhausting effect.</p>",

It finds Tyler, the Creator still thrashing around \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m slipping, I\u2019m slipping \u2026 I need a hand\u201d \u2013 constantly contradicting himself about his hopes for the future. An album that began with its author denying its existence, Chromakopia ultimately seems to manifest a state of confusion, in which everything is in flux and nothing is quite as it initially seems. It achieves that to enthralling and exhausting effect.",

Previous to this incident, Lily and Margot would take minor detours when flying around the zoo to explore the trees but this was the first time that they had completely disappeared for as long as six days. In the appeal, London zoo urged people to be on the lookout for the parrots, which they described as between two and three feet tall and relatively easy to spot due to their bright blue and yellow plumage.

London zoo is home to a vast array of more than 10,000 animals. The zoo has been approached for comment.",

How about you find that your bus fare has gone up 50% and you are spending an extra \u00a310 a week on getting to and from work?

Any one of us can fluctuate between being a working person and not being a working person any number of times during the course of the day. It\u2019s a state of mind. A higher form of awareness. So whether you feel you are being taxed more comes down more to a personal choice than an act of government.

Glad to have been of help.</p> <p>Quite why Starmer has got so lost in the semantic weeds of the working person over the past few months is a mystery.

But if you can rewrite the fiscal rules to give yourself another \u00a350bn of investment spending without anyone being that bothered, then national insurance shouldn\u2019t be too much of a headache.</p> <p>Still, we are where we are: two days out from a budget, most of which has already been leaked.

They weren\u2019t going to be fixed with fiscal giveaways. No one wanted tax rises and spending cuts, but sometimes you just had to be realistic about the situation.

He accused the plaintiff of attempting to \u201cmake money\u201d by claiming \u20ac30,000 (\u00a325,000) in compensation. The defence also asked for a further eight witnesses to be heard, which would result in the trial taking longer than originally planned. It is now scheduled to be heard on 24-25 March next year. Anouk Grinberg, an actor who appeared in Les Volets Verts, told AFP that Depardieu used \u201csalacious words \u2026 from morning till night\u201d while on set. About 20 women have accused Depardieu of various sexual offences, which he denies. The actor Charlotte Arnould was the first to file a criminal complaint. A judge has yet to rule on a request from prosecutors in August for Depardieu to stand trial for allegedly raping and sexually assaulting her. Arnould and Grinberg were outside the courtroom on Monday, alongside a crowd of people supporting the plaintiffs. In December last year the French president, Emmanuel Macron, shocked feminists by complaining of a \u201cmanhunt\u201d targeting Depardieu, whom he called a \u201ctowering actor\u201d who \u201cmakes France proud\u201d. Macron\u2019s remarks followed the broadcast by an investigative TV show of a recording of Depardieu making repeated misogynistic and insulting remarks about women.",

Personally I was OK with erring on the side of patience, but, at a certain point, someone has to call it and say it\u2019s not working. I know plenty of people here would have called that moment a long time ago, but I\u2019m on board with the new hierarchy and their decision-making process. </p> \n   <p>And football is weird: Barcelona, not a terrible comparison, were looking all over the place not so long ago. Lewandowski, Raphinha \u2013 total disasters, what were they thinking spending all that money on Olmo while losing Gundogan, they are clearly out of their minds \u2026 Fast forward just a couple of months and it\u2019s completely different \u2013 they look like a confident, competent club again, at least for the moment.

Kieran McKenna previously worked for Manchester United\u2019s academy. He progressed to the first-team setup under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r but then made the move to Ipswich. He committed to the Tractor Boys this summer despite reported interest from United and Chelsea by signing a new four-year deal this summer. Ipswich have yet to win a Premier League match this season in their return to the top-flight. </p> \n  <p>2. Peter Bosz could be an option if the board are not afraid to go Dutch again. He won the Eredivisie title with PSV last season and the Dutch champions are flying once again despite Bosz losing a number of players to clubs in Europe\u2019s top five leagues.</p> \n  <p>3. Dino Toppm\u00f6ller has proven he can change a team\u2019s style to fit his tactics with Eintracht Frankfurt this season. The German side have won four of their opening five league games and the attacking duo of Omar Marmoush and Hugo Ekitike are lighting up the Bundesliga. Could he be the one to unlock Manchester United\u2019s struggling frontline? </p> \n  <p>4. Xavi left Barcelona in May last year after a confusing roundabout with the board. Many felt he was underqualified when he arrived in Catalonia but he won the club a league title, going head to head with Real Madrid and has been known to give youngsters a chance. His wife also posted an Instagram story of his son donning a United top which is now making the rounds on Reddit.

I felt as though they would have enough to be able to get a decent level of performance together after a smoother transfer window, and that Erik ten Hag would get a level of stability.</p> \n   <p>The fact that they are 14th is unacceptable.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s the lot for today. Thank you for reading. Goodbye. Here\u2019s our coverage on the dismissal of Erik ten Hag thus far: Alejandro Garnacho has taken to Instagram: \u201cThank you for everything, boss,\u201d writes the Argentinian. \u201cI will always be grateful to you for giving me the opportunity and the confidence to play for this club. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t gone as well as we wanted, but I will remember the good times we had together and I wish you all the best in the future. \u201cThank you very much Erik \u2764\ufe0f\u201d \u201cAs a non-United fan, I\u2019m naturally enjoying the latest managerial shenanigans,\u201d emails Richard Morris. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help wondering - what next for ETH? In many ways the best thing for United would be if he quickly ends in a job and achieves instant success - not just because he\u2019s by all accounts a very nice bloke, but because then, and perhaps only then, the management at Manchester United will begin to ask themselves - \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the manager. Maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s us \u2026\u201d Anyway, back to the entertainment.\u201d Self-awareness from the Manchester United top brass, Richard? I\u2019ve heard it all now. Mary Waltz is right. Manchester United clearly need proper a long-term rebuild, involving patience, a clear strategy, sensible and strategic investment in new players, and in the development of players in the club\u2019s academy. But football\u2019s content machine requires constant feeding, so the new manager will no doubt be teetering on the brink after a few dodgy results. Hot off the press, a co-written news bulletin from Jamie Jackson and Will Unwin: \u201cThomas Frank has emerged as an early favourite to succeed Erik ten Hag as the Manchester United manager after the Dutchman was sacked on Monday. \u201cBrentford\u2019s No 1 was previously considered as a potential replacement for Ten Hag towards the end of last season when he was under threat then, Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s Ineos-led football department having interviewed several candidates.\u201d \u201cAs a fan, Van Nistelrooy would be fun but maybe a bit too much like Ole,\u201d emails Paul Simpson. \u201cSo it would seem to me a few qualities that should be looked for in a new manager. Experience with a big club - check, good record in minor European competitions - check, able to install a bit of order to a chaotic defence - check, able to steady a club too good to go down - check, not afraid to go back to an unfinished job - check, from the same mould as Lord Ferg - check. The call needs to go out to Moyesie.\u201d David Moyes. Interesting shout. You say you\u2019re a fan, Paul, but of which club? \u201cAnother United defenestration,\u201d emails Mary Waltz. \u201cNo surprise. Will it work? Only if United fans and administration realise that, for the time being, they are a mid-table squad and that it will take time to strip it down to the studs and rebuild. No more short-term solutions, a focused long term plan that will take time to achieve.\u201d There were plenty of times over the past 14 months when sacking Erik ten Hag would have been justified but Manchester United clung on in the hope he could somehow turn things around. Patience and excuses finally ran out at Old Trafford after another dismal defeat at West Ham on Sunday, leaving them 14th in the Premier League and increasingly fearful of another season outside the Champions League. \u201cI\u2019ve supported Manchester United since I was six \u2013 almost 80 years now,\u201d writes Gordon McDougall. \u201cWhen I worked for Granada TV the team used to drink in the same pubs, and George Best ran the local disco. I\u2019ve never known the players in such bad shape \u2013 even while in Division Two. There are really fine players in the team: the problem is belief. And lack of belief breeds fear. \u201cSo Dalot, who is almost always on target, shoots over the bar from a few yards in front of an open goal. Rashford makes great runs and shoots straight at the keeper. There is a lack of inventiveness and a total absence of the one-touch football Ferguson developed. Maybe Ruud can restore the belief as Ole did for a while. But the best result would be Guardiola, who will be free next year. I hope to live to see it ...\u201d Thanks for your email, Gordon. \u201cYou always feel for guys that lose their job,\u201d says Brentford\u2019s Thomas Frank, reacting to Ten Hag\u2019s dismissal. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Erik can look at himself and say he gave everything. It\u2019s life, it happens. \u201cI\u2019ve got a big responsibility to Brentford,\u201d says Frank, asked about his future. \u201cI have one focus, that is to beat Sheffield Wednesday tomorrow. I\u2019ve said many times, I am very happy here, I think it\u2019s one of the best clubs in the world, but I am very, very happy here. \u201cI can see myself being here for a long, long time \u2026 maybe if something comes up in the future, let\u2019s see, but for now I am very happy here.\u201d Flattered to be linked. \u201cListening to the game at the London Stadium yesterday I was reminded of Graham Taylor\u2019s time with England,\u201d emails David Wall. \u201cAlthough ultimately it was the long-term underperformance of the team under Taylor that cost him his job, the final straw was a loss that was largely due to inept referring. Ditto Ten Hag (he can blame the profligate forwards for the fact they didn\u2019t win, but it\u2019s down to the VAR that they lost rather than drawing). Is managing Manchester United now also an impossible job? \u201cAlso, now that Ten Haag has been sacked, who does Howard Webb address his email to when he sends out the next list of PGMOL apologies for refereeing mistakes? Perhaps he could still send it to Ten Hag, it might give him a little bit of comfort while he thinks about what to do now.\u201d \u201cI suppose you could call this a Ruud awakening for Man United fans,\u201d writes Peter Oh. That\u2019s your lot for today, Peter. \u201cIn terms of who they can get, and Premier League experience, I think maybe Thomas Frank,\u201d Jamie Jackson says of a potential successor for Ten Hag. \u201c[Or] R\u00faben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon \u2026 Xavi has been mentioned, but would he be what they need right now? Would he hit the ground running? Ruud Van Nistelrooy only has one season at PSV on his CV.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Jamie Jackson is on Sky Sports News now and says that apart from Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford, the current squad \u201care not good enough\u201d for Manchester United. He says Ten Hag is a \u201cvery likeable man\u201d with \u201ca twinkle in his eye\u201d but that he had doubts about his ability to inspire the players, that he was \u201ca bit wooden\u201d. \u201cIneos have not handled it great,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing mess at Manchester United since Sir Alex Ferguson left \u2026 maybe when their get their man in now we\u2019ll see a brave new world. But it feels a little bit like groundhog day.\u201d \u201cUnai Emery \u2013 if you look at the job he\u2019s done at Aston Villa \u2013 he\u2019s come in there and turned them around. That\u2019s a proper job that a proper manager has done. He\u2019s made players that he inherited better, and look where they are now.\u201d Reuters have done a \u201cFactbox\u201d on Ten Hag. Here it is, unredacted: Born 2 February 1970, in Haaksbergen, Netherlands. Playing career Ten Hag began his career at Dutch side FC Twente, where he played primarily as a defender from 1989-1990. Stints at Utrecht, De Graafschap and RKC Waalwijk before returning to Twente in 1996, where he finished his playing career in 2002. Ten Hag made over 300 league appearances in Dutch professional football. Coaching career Ten Hag started coaching in 2012 with Go Ahead Eagles, leading the team to promotion after 17 years outside the Eredivisie in his first season in charge. Joined Bayern Munich II in 2013, taking charge of their reserve team and working under the guidance of Pep Guardiola during the Spaniard\u2019s time as Bayern head coach. Ten Hag returned to the Netherlands to manage FC Utrecht in 2015, guiding them to a fifth-place finish and a spot in the Europa League through the playoffs. Appointed Ajax manager in 2017. During his tenure, the club won three Eredivisie titles (2018-19, 2020-21, 2021-22) and two KNVB Cups (2018-2019 and 2020-2021). Ten Hag gained widespread acclaim after guiding Ajax to the 2018-19 Champions League semi-finals, the club\u2019s first appearance at that stage since 1997, and beating defending champions Real Madrid 4-1 and Juventus 2-1 along the way. Ten Hag left Ajax after leading them to the 2022 KNVB Cup final in April On April 21 that year Ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager on a three-year contract. In his first season in charge he led United to a third-placed Premier League finish and League Cup triumph, ending the club\u2019s six-year trophy drought since a Europa League success in 2017 under Jose Mourinho. In the 2023-24 season United finished eighth in the league and won the FA Cup by beating Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City 2-1. Ten Hag\u2019s United tenure ended on 28 October after a series of inconsistent performances left United languishing in 14th place in the Premier League with 11 points (W3 D2 L4) and without a win in their three Europa league games which they drew. The Dutchman\u2019s last match in charge was a 2-1 defeat at West Ham United following earlier losses to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. You can email me with your hot takes. Why is none of the reaction [that I have seen] on a well-known sports news channel mentioning the Glazers? Seems like a rather glaring omission. I sense there\u2019s been a bit of a recurring theme since the Glazers took over and Lord Ferguson departed. Thanks John. I\u2019ve not been this excited to take a live blog since Liverpool signed Ozan Kabak. Hello everyone. And with that, I hand over to Luke McLaughlin. Ben Lake: \u201cBefore I tell everyone why all this has gone wrong and it is easy, I\u2019d just like to point out that Tan Hag\u2019s most successful signing is probably the free transfer of aging, creaky old Jonny Evans. Kind of tells its own story, doesn\u2019t it? \u201cNow, Ten Hag. I genuinely don\u2019t think he is very good, certainly not for this level. Utd\u2019 board are probs right to fire him. However, the way they have managed this situation is absurd.\u201d Jason Geer: \u201cI, for one, hope Ten Hag sits out until 2026 and, like Graham Potter, collects all the compensation owed him under his contract. \u201cWhat a ridiculous decision by Ineos just 3 months after giving him a contract extension, costing the club and its shareholders tens of millions of pounds. Never mind the results - United will end up between 6th and 10th no matter who manages this group of content generators. And, the club is now operating down one coach by firing Ten Hag and appointing van Nistelrooy as interim. Well done Ineos!!\u201d A name often mentioned, because it is said he would work well within Manchester United\u2019s Ineos-led structure. Southgate to follow Van Nistelrooy\u2019s caretakership? I need to give myself time to make good decisions. When you come out of a really big role you need to give your body time, you need to give your mind time. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying my life, so there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019m fortunate that there are lots of opportunities presenting themselves. From United We Stand editor Andy Mitten: After choosing not to sack Ten Hag, the Manchester United hierarchy signed the following players. One hasn\u2019t kicked a ball in anger, the rest yet to show much. Ouch. Leny Yoro, Lille \u00a355m Manuel Ugarte, Paris St-Germain \u00a345m Matthijs De Ligt, Bayern Munich \u00a340m Joshua Zirkzee, Bologna \u00a337m Noussair Mazraoui, Bayern Munich \u00a312m According to the BBC\u2019s Simon Stone: \u201cManchester United chief executive Omar Berrada and sporting director Dan Ashworth delivered the bad news to Erik ten Hag at the club\u2019s Carrington training ground this morning.\u201d Stephen Carr gets in touch: \u201cAfternoon John. Rio Ferdinand\u2019s comments about Man U players being there for \u201cone, two, three managers now and it\u2019s still the same results\u201d is odd to say the least. This was categorically Ten Haag\u2019s team and the simple fact is that the more of his team United became, the worse they got.\u201d Looks like Ten Hag didn\u2019t want to be seen leaving his Cheshire home. Thomas Frank would be a fine choice for Manchester United. And he\u2019s been asked about the job while preparing for Brentford\u2019s match with Sheffield Wednesday. He didn\u2019t exactly close the door. Of course, I feel for Erik. He is a great coach and has a great career. He did a good job at Man United, two trophies in two years. It\u2019s a non-stop developing world and that is more than acceptable. At these big clubs, there are massive expectations but there has to be a reality check... You feel for guys who lose their jobs and I\u2019m sure Erik gave everything. There are better people to judge that (improvement). He had a very good first season and had more than a few injury problems.\u201d I\u2019ve got a big responsibility to Brentford Football Club, the fans, the leadership, players and staff. One focus, to beat Sheffield Wednesday in the Carabao Cup. I\u2019m very happy here, one of the best clubs in the world. What happens in the future who knows, but I am very happy here. Here\u2019s our video explainer for the fall of Erik ten Hag from Jamie Jackson. Rick Harris has nailed it: \u201cCan\u2019t say I am surprised by Erik Ten Hag\u2019s sacking as the United season hasn\u2019t gone upwards from the pinnacle of the FA Cup Final humbling of Manchester City in May and there was no discernible structure or style to their play. \u201cSo that you can say \u2018you read it here first\u2019, John, I think you need to state the obvious appointment next summer after Van Nistelrooy gets United through another written-off season. \u201cPep Guardiola \u2013 just look at the evidence. He is out of contract at the end of the season. The director of football has left. The ex-MD has moved across town. He\u2019s won everything at City but knows it was tainted so will never really be respected in most fan\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat could be more incredible than Guardiola taking United back to the top of English and European football?\u201d Adam Edwards gets in touch: \u201cBit telling that so far the players posting on social media have been \u201cthanks gaffer, see ya later!\u201d about it all, and not the \u201cwe\u2019re gutted, sorry for the part we\u2019ve played in awful performances for 18 months\u201d levels of introspection you might hope for to maintain some semblance of a squad united behind the manager. He\u2019s evidently been a dead man walking for a while. Good luck Ruud!\u201d Also elsewhere in football. Interesting news here. United sack manager, mark II. Interesting tweet from David de Gea. This is stat is especially damning. The way we were: it was all going so well. The highlight of your Monday has arrived. Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Dan Bardell and Troy Townsend to discuss a fun game at the Emirates. Elsewhere, Manchester United lost at West Ham thanks to a very late and somewhat dubious VAR decision. The podcast had (of course) finished recording when the news of Erik ten Hag\u2019s sacking came through. Expect more on that on Tuesday\u2019s pod. Plus: Crystal Palace get their first win of the season thanks to Spurs, Chris Wood keeps scoring for Nottingham Forest and the pod wrap up the rest of the Premier League action. Time for me to hand this blog back to John. Thanks for joining me! Some more reaction from you all! Patrick with some perspective: I\u2019ve been a backer of EtH all the way. He seems like a clever, capable manager and I was sure that the clouds would clear, the team would click and United would be at the forefront of European football again, with a sophisticated modern approach. We waited, and waited, and tried to make sense of why it still seemed so chaotic, and waited some more. Personally I was OK with erring on the side of patience, but, at a certain point, someone has to call it and say it\u2019s not working. I know plenty of people here would have called that moment a long time ago, but I\u2019m on board with the new hierarchy and their decision-making process. And football is weird: Barcelona, not a terrible comparison, were looking all over the place not so long ago. Lewandowski, Raphinha \u2013 total disasters, what were they thinking spending all that money on Olmo while losing Gundogan, they are clearly out of their minds \u2026 Fast forward just a couple of months and it\u2019s completely different \u2013 they look like a confident, competent club again, at least for the moment. So, here\u2019s hoping. I wish EtH all the best at his next club. Krishna with the exclusive of how it will go down in the coming year: I am reminded of a story that is well known in corporate circles. It goes like this \u2013 suitably altered to the football world. Rudd: Any advice Eric? EtH: Here, keep these 3 envelopes. Open them whenever you are faced with a crisis that looks insurmountable. Weeks pass by and Rudd faces his first crisis. Opens the first envelope. \u201cBlame me.\u201d Rudd puts the blame on his predecessor in an articulate way and gets away. Months roll by and he encounters his second crisis. Time for the second envelope. \u201cBlame the schedule and VAR.\u201d Rudd escapes again and things settle down. Not unsurprisingly the third crisis blows up in his face. Rudd opens the third envelope. \u201cMake 3 envelopes.\u201d R\u00faben Amorim has been speaking to the media ahead of Sporting\u2019s match against C.D. Nacional in the Portuguese League Cup. Lucky for us (and unlucky for him) the timing could not have worked better. The Portugese was obviously asked about the Manchester United role. I was already expecting this question and obviously, I\u2019m not going to talk about the future, because otherwise, I\u2019ll always have to comment. I\u2019m very proud to be Sporting coach, that\u2019s all. Amorim has been at Sporting since 2020 but he has been linked with several Premier League moves. Let\u2019s look in depth at the (realistic) options the Manchester United board could bring in. 1. Kieran McKenna previously worked for Manchester United\u2019s academy. He progressed to the first-team setup under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r but then made the move to Ipswich. He committed to the Tractor Boys this summer despite reported interest from United and Chelsea by signing a new four-year deal this summer. Ipswich have yet to win a Premier League match this season in their return to the top-flight. 2. Peter Bosz could be an option if the board are not afraid to go Dutch again. He won the Eredivisie title with PSV last season and the Dutch champions are flying once again despite Bosz losing a number of players to clubs in Europe\u2019s top five leagues. 3. Dino Toppm\u00f6ller has proven he can change a team\u2019s style to fit his tactics with Eintracht Frankfurt this season. The German side have won four of their opening five league games and the attacking duo of Omar Marmoush and Hugo Ekitike are lighting up the Bundesliga. Could he be the one to unlock Manchester United\u2019s struggling frontline? 4. Xavi left Barcelona in May last year after a confusing roundabout with the board. Many felt he was underqualified when he arrived in Catalonia but he won the club a league title, going head to head with Real Madrid and has been known to give youngsters a chance. His wife also posted an Instagram story of his son donning a United top which is now making the rounds on Reddit. Make of that what you will. Our fantastic picture desk has put together a gallery showing the timeline of Ten Hag\u2019s tenure at Old Trafford. Highlights: winning the Carabao Cup and FA Cup. Lowlights: Manchester City 6-3 Manchester United, Liverpool 7-0 Manchester United and \u2013 the final dagger \u2013 West Ham 2-1 Manchester United. Rasmus Hojlund has joined Fernandes in bidding farewell to Ten Hag, posting on his Instagram story: \u201cThanks for everything boss. Wish u all the best in the future.\u201d Van Nistelrooy will not be speaking to the media before Manchester United\u2019s match with Leicester in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, according to reports. This is now Yara taking over the blog to bring all the latest news and reaction to Ten Hag\u2019s sacking. Nigel Moore gets in touch: \u201cI think Ineos has escaped a lot of the criticism that has otherwise been flung at ETH and some players. The big question that I\u2019ve rarely seen posed is do they have the nous to run a football club? Their other sports businesses aren\u2019t a great success either. Big Jim has rode on a crest of goodwill as a local lad made good and a lifelong Utd fan but that doesn\u2019t make you necessarily fit to run a football club, esp one with such baggage as the outfit in Manchester 16!\u201d Alan Gomes gets in touch: \u201cI realise the comment by Mr. Ashdown (13:24) is mostly in jest. But some of the names he puts forward are probably better than those with the top odds to replace Erik ten Hag. \u201cS\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Edin Terzi\u0107, Sebastian Hoene\u00df, Michel: all of these have achieved excellent results by playing pragmatic football with squads assembled with relatively limited resources. \u201cI believe that is exactly what United need now: a competent caretaker who can find a way to make the pieces fit. Not another \u201csystem\u201d manager who will demand millions be spent to bring in \u201chis\u201d players. \u201cThe most likely outcome of United\u2019s manager search will probably be \u201cstay the course\u201d (Van Nistelrooy) or \u201cbig name hire\u201d. But they\u2019d do well to look at Mr. Ashdown\u2019s suggestions.\u201d Reminder that Manchester United play on Wednesday in the Carabao Cup against Leicester. Some more Rio Ferdinand, too: Some of these players have been here for one, two, three managers now and it\u2019s still the same results where they haven\u2019t been performing, haven\u2019t been consistent enough and haven\u2019t challenged for anything of any sort, especially the Premier League. Someone\u2019s got to come in and change that now, change the whole dynamic of this squad, and it\u2019s going to be difficult because these guys are in a rut. These guys are in a position where they\u2019re used to falling short. They\u2019re used to not being able to compete with the best teams. How do you go about changing that culture? This is down to Ruud right now. He\u2019s the interim manager, he\u2019s got to change that culture. More Gary Neville, via Sky: \u201cAfter that defeat by Tottenham, Manchester United would have chosen the next big moment, or bad loss, to make that decision. I think they would have started the process then. \u201cI think the lack of identity and style is something that has been a mystery for two-and-a-half seasons. The recruitment has not been the best, awful at times. Yesterday I was shocked to see Casemiro starting and Manuel Ugarte, who is supposed to be replacing him, on the bench. \u201cIf I was the club owner looking at that, I would be asking questions. A lack of style with the players has been big and Erik ten Hag has not been able to get a consistent performance out of them, and a lot of them are his players.\u201d John Ashdown \u2013 not our John Ashdown \u2013 had this to say: \u201cI can only add some other possible/outlandish/funny possibilities Edin Terzic Sergio Conceicao Xavi Sebastian Hoeness Michel Julian Nagelsmann Frank Lampard (lol) Jurgen Klopp (lololol) Jose Mourinho (lolololol) Some of these and some of the ones on your list are unemployed and may well be willing to take the job. But I do think Van Nistelrooy is the most likely choice. Hard as it might be for Man Utd fans to realize, this is not the greatest job in football any more. Huge expectations, no Champions League football, a very expensive but poorly constructed squad. United may have trouble attracting the kind of manager they need. Van Nistelrooy might have to steer the barge until the end of the season.\u201d Those 21 Ten Hag signings, and ratings Manuel Ugarte, PSG, 29.08.2024 \u20ac50.00m \u2013 N/A \u2013 oddly dropped Matthijs de Ligt, Bayern Munich, 12.08.2024, \u20ac45.00m \u2013 bust, must do better Noussair Mazraoui, Bayern Munich, 12.08.2024,\u20ac15.00m \u2013 no improvement Leny Yoro, Lille, 17.07.2024 \u20ac62.00m \u2013 injured \u2013 N/A Joshua Zirkzee, Bologna, 13.07.2024. \u20ac42.50m \u2013 good start, poor since Sergio Reguil\u00f3n, Tottenham, 31.08.2023, loan \u2013 bust, forgotten Sofyan Amrabat, Fiorentina, 31.08.2023, loan \u2013 bad start, got better, not good enough Altay Bayindir, Fenerbahce, 31.08.2023, \u20ac5.00m \u2013 barely seen Rasmus H\u00f8jlund, Atalanta, 04.08.2023, \u20ac73.90m \u2013 fitness problems, has talent seen all too rarely Andr\u00e9 Onana, Inter 19.07.2023, \u20ac50.20m \u2013 can be bad, can be spectacular Jonny Evans, Leicester, 17.07.2023, free transfer \u2013 not let anyone down Mason Mount, Chelsea, 04.07.2023, \u20ac64.20m \u2013 who?

I appreciate the trust and the moments we share together, I wish you all the best in the future. Even knowing the last period isn\u2019t been great from all of us I hope you fans can keep with you the good things the manager as done for our club!\u201d Odds on the next manager, via Oddschecker: Ruud van Nistelrooy 7/2 Ruben Amorim 7/2 Gareth Southgate 8/1 Thomas Frank 8/1 Kieran McKenna 14/1 Michael Carrick 14/1 Graham Potter 16/1 Max Allegri 20/1 Zinedine Zidane 25/1 Simone Inzaghi 25/1 The Gary Neville viewpoint is here, via Sky Sports: The big shock for me is how bad they\u2019ve been with the new signings that have come in. I felt as though they would have enough to be able to get a decent level of performance together after a smoother transfer window, and that Erik ten Hag would get a level of stability. The fact that they are 14th is unacceptable. You can\u2019t be in 14th after nine or 10 games with the level of spend that\u2019s occurred without being under significant pressure - and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. I was hoping it would end differently. I think Manchester United fans were hoping that the manager would continue to keep his job and the faith shown in him in the summer would pay off. But it\u2019s not been the case. Some Ten Hag data via PA Media: With 70 wins from 128 games in charge, Ten Hag\u2019s 54.7 per cent win record is actually the second-best of any United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement - behind only Jose Mourinho\u2019s 58.3 per cent. The Dutchman lost 27.3 per cent of his games though, ahead of only David Moyes (29.4 per cent) and a spell as interim boss for Ralf Rangnick (27.6), as his side struggled to turn defeats into draws - just 23 games, or 18 per cent, ended all square. Ten Hag\u2019s side conceded 165 goals in his time in charge, with their average of 1.29 per game topping even the figure in a lost half-season under Rangnick (37 in 29 games, 1.28 per game). Mourinho (0.84) and Louis van Gaal (0.95) kept their goals against average below one per match, with Moyes at 1.06 and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 1.09. Overall United had conceded almost exactly a goal a game between Ferguson\u2019s retirement and Ten Hag\u2019s appointment, 499 in 502 games. They have conceded four or more in a game seven times under Ten Hag, losing 6-3 and 7-0 to bitter rivals Manchester City and Liverpool respectively in his first season while in his second they let in three or more goals on more occasions (15) than they kept clean sheets (13). Ten Hag is only the second post-Ferguson manager with multiple trophies to his name, adding last season\u2019s FA Cup to the 2022-23 Carabao Cup. Karen Asad gets in touch: \u201cFA Cup win last season, as sweet a memory as it was, masked the obvious flaws of ETH team. This season he had the players and no difference; because serious teams don\u2019t take shelter in these kinds of excuses. \u201cA lot of questionable transfer decisions will leave United to count the costs for the foreseeable future. I think ETH wasn\u2019t ambitious enough. He invested more than anybody but act like he\u2019s been tasked with delivering cup glory to a medium-sized club. We assumed he\u2019ll be in the same league as Pep &amp; Klopp but he really wasn\u2019t.\u201d Here is Ruud himself: Nicholas Ridgman gets in touch: \u201cOf all the post-Fergie management faragos, this is the hardest to understand. \u201cTo finish third, 14pts of the top, with a trophy, in his first season, was a pretty impressive achievement. This was largely with a squad he inherited. Then the more of his preferred players came in, the more incomprehensible the tactics became. \u201cWhat\u2019s also odd is the general togetherness of the squad seems fine. None of the poor body language / dressing-room leaks we saw in other managers\u2019 endgames. How did he seemingly manage to keep this unity while utterly tanking the team\u2019s fortunes?\u201d Rio Ferdinand, a backer of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r you may recall, has his man already. OK, here\u2019s the first runner and rider to shake off the list. Not sure he\u2019d be a popular candidate. All eyes on Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The big decision is made, now for an even bigger decision. Though was it Big Sir Jim\u2019s call? Should Ten Hag have been sacked despite this famous victory? Hindsight suggests it absolutely should have done. At Wembley that day: Asked if he thinks he\u2019s been treated unfairly by the media, Ten Hag said to Gary Lineker: \u201cI think so, the team as well. It was not right.\u201d Alan Shearer interjected to say that United have rarely been as good as they were today and often deserved whatever criticism came their way. \u201cYou are right but we didn\u2019t have the players,\u201d came the riposte. \u201cIt was not always good football, definitely not, but if you don\u2019t have the players you can\u2019t play the football you want to play.\u201d Was it his last game in charge of United? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I am doing is training my team, preparing my team, developing my team because this is for me a project. When I came in, I can say it was a mess and we are now better but we are by far not where we want to be.\u201d The United brains trust kept him on, and spent even more money. A fateful decision. Complaints made in vain after that defeat at West Ham. It probably wasn\u2019t a penalty but then again, Ten Hag was not much of a Manchester United manager. It seems quite a while already since the \u201cbald is best\u201d campaign. Will Unwin has the story so far. Here\u2019s that official club statement: short but sweet. Seen shorter. Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men\u2019s first-team manager. Erik was appointed in April 2022 and led the club to two domestic trophies, winning the Carabao Cup in 2023 and the FA Cup in 2024. We are grateful to Erik for everything he has done during his time with us and wish him well for the future. Ruud van Nistelrooy will take charge of the team as interim head coach, supported by the current coaching team, whilst a permanent head coach is recruited. Well, it wasn\u2019t a shock, was it? It had been coming. Even if VAR delivered the felling blow at West Ham, Ten Hag has been on a sticky wicket from the start of the season. He departs as a League Cup winner, an FA Cup winner but he becomes the sixth manager since Sir Alex Ferguson, if you include Ralf Rangnick. What next? Ruud van Nistelrooy is the caretaker, and has looked likely to fulfil that role since he arrived in the summer as assistant coach. The Ineos regime has taken down its first manager, to follow the many staff who have departed the club. Right, a day ahead of reaction and further news. Join us.",

      "body": "<p>The artist David Shrigley has said Stem subjects should be expanded to prioritise the arts, adding that children\u2019s creativity is being stymied by the narrow focus on maths and the sciences.</p> <p>The Turner prize-nominated artist says \u201cStem\u201d \u2013 which stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2013 should be changed to \u201cSteam\u201d to include the arts, which he believes are at the core of a rounded education.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI think it is really important because if you talk to anybody, any professional within engineering, for example, in order to be a good engineer, you need to have creativity in order to do that job.

      "bodyText": "The artist David Shrigley has said Stem subjects should be expanded to prioritise the arts, adding that children\u2019s creativity is being stymied by the narrow focus on maths and the sciences. The Turner prize-nominated artist says \u201cStem\u201d \u2013 which stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2013 should be changed to \u201cSteam\u201d to include the arts, which he believes are at the core of a rounded education. He said: \u201cI think it is really important because if you talk to anybody, any professional within engineering, for example, in order to be a good engineer, you need to have creativity in order to do that job. Creativity is part of learning \u2026 It\u2019s part of problem solving.\u201d On Monday, Shrigley unveiled the Mantis Muse, a towering nine-metre sculpture that is at the centre of a two-week alternative curriculum he is bringing to his former comprehensive school in Leicestershire, which he hopes will start a national conversation about the importance of the arts in education. \u201cArt subjects are the only subjects that give kids agency to do something, because the way you learn to do maths, the way you learn to do science, is really just about \u2026 remembering information and being able to apply that information to problem solving,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas an art education \u2013 particularly fine art and visual art \u2013 is about setting your own path, setting your own parameters, creating your own project. And that agency is really important to kids\u2019 development \u2026 I think that it\u2019s a profound mistake to take the A out of the Stem.\u201d Students at Beauchamp College in Oadby, where Shrigley was a student in the 1980s, were confronted by the giant insect on Monday, which sits in the middle of the school\u2019s art and design block, with the artist\u2019s lesson plan launching on the same day. Staff and pupils will have the chance to take part in yoga classes, kung fu lessons, screen-printing workshops, bug drawing and attend a talk from animal behaviour and mantids specialist Dr Vivek Nityananda, and Plunge Creations, the company that made the insect for Shrigley. A-level students in England have increasingly dropped humanities and arts subjects in favour of a limited number of science-based subjects, and concerns have been raised about the lack of children from black Caribbean backgrounds taking Stem subjects. In the summer, a report by the British Academy and the National Foundation for Educational Research found that over the past decade fewer students were combining humanities such as English or music with sciences or maths. More than half of students in England were choosing at least one humanities subject until 2015-16 \u2013 but by 2021-22, just 38% of students took at least one humanities course. The drop in arts subjects such as music, design and media studies was even more dramatic and started earlier, falling to 24% in 2021-22. Last month, in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, accused the previous Conservative government of \u201cvandalism\u201d and \u201cviolent indifference\u201d to the arts, which meant communities across the country were deprived of access to culture. Nandy singled out the school curriculum as being a particular problem area, saying Tory ministers had dismissed arts subjects as \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d while \u201cerasing\u201d them from the classroom. The number of students taking arts GCSEs has dropped by 47% since 2010. Shrigley said Nandy\u2019s comments were \u201creally encouraging\u201d, adding that \u201chopefully she can make some progress in that regard\u201d. The Mantis Muse, which is made from steel and fibreglass and uses a mechanical system to rotate the insect\u2019s head, is Shrigley\u2019s latest intervention and echoes his Life Model installation displayed at the Turner prize in 2013. Known for his sense of humour, last year Shrigley collected 6,000 copies of Dan Brown\u2019s novel The Da Vinci Code \u2013 after a Swansea charity shop had jokingly appealed for people to stop donating copies \u2013 and recycled them, turning them into a new edition of George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four. \u201cGeorge Orwell, I think, always intended it to be a warning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a parable of an existing state, but it was kind of a warning of what can happen when we don\u2019t value our democracy.\u201d",

Namely, what we now call \u201cfake news\u201d: the publication of the Zinoviev letter \u2013 supposedly from the head of the Communist International in Moscow \u2013 which purported to offer help to the Labour party. It was in fact a forgery, but did enormous damage at the time, and is a reminder of just how fragile our democracy can be.

      "bodyText": "A lack of social mobility is costing the UK \u00a319bn a year, a report produced by the cross-party thinktank Demos and the Co-op has found. The Social Mobility Commission, which advises the government, defines social mobility as \u201cthe link between a person\u2019s occupation or income and the occupation or income of their parents\u201d. The Co-op/Demos report details how in the UK, people from \u201clower socioeconomic backgrounds\u201d are \u201cfar less likely to earn good incomes, even after accounting for levels of education\u201d, with the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Social Mobility Index 2020 ranking the UK 21st out of 82 economies. The researchers said the UK was missing out on \u00a319bn a year in GDP growth as a result of this \u201csystemic failure\u201d to promote social mobility, and found, having surveyed 531 senior business leaders, that promotion of social mobility was linked to higher turnover. Co-op, whose businesses include retail, insurance and funerals, has removed video interviews and the requirement for CVs as part of its social mobility policies, and began reporting its socioeconomic pay gap earlier this year. The business has a social mobility taskforce, whose members include Azra Keely, from Manchester, who came to the UK as a three-year-old refugee from Bosnia. She told the Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t believe social mobility in the UK is improving, in some ways, it feels like we are moving backwards. The cost of university education is higher than ever, meaning it\u2019s becoming less accessible for those from lower-income backgrounds. \u201cAdditionally, while there have been efforts to improve vocational training and apprenticeships, these are still underfunded and undervalued compared to university. \u201cHousing is another key issue. Unequal access to property ownership is a significant barrier to social mobility,\u201d she said. The Co-op/Demos report, The Opportunity Effect, makes a series of recommendations to government and business, including giving the new body Skills England, which is intended to drive growth by helping people get better jobs, a \u201cstatutory responsibility\u201d to increase social mobility. The report urges the government to consult large employers on increasing their minimum skills and training expenditure to meet the EU average of \u00a33,000 per employee and consult on expanding pay gap reporting to socioeconomic as well as ethnic minority and disability gaps. It also calls for the government to create a \u201cBetter Opportunities Fund\u201d to fund social mobility projects, offer lower business rates for social enterprises and cooperatives, and ensure social mobility is \u201cfactored into public sector procurement\u201d. \u201cNew ideas, useful innovations, technological advances, artistic movements, scientific discoveries, high-quality infrastructure, strong support systems for the vulnerable \u2013 these all rest on our ability to nurture the talents of the population and give people and communities opportunities to thrive,\u201d the report said. \u201cWhere people\u2019s career pathways are limited by socioeconomic background, we miss out on potential gains to productivity and growth.\u201d The report says international evidence suggests countries with more social mobility, such as Sweden, Austria and Denmark have greater productivity, and that apprenticeships could be a \u201ca great vehicle\u201d for improving social mobility in the UK, but \u201cthis potential is not being realised\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The bus fare cap in England will rise from \u00a32 to \u00a33 at the end of this year, Keir Starmer has said, as Rachel Reeves prepares to raid transport funding in this week\u2019s budget. The prime minister told an audience in Birmingham that the money to fund the \u00a32 cap would run out at the end of 2024 and that the Labour government would then not be able to keep it at the same level after that. The decision by the prime minister and chancellor comes despite heavy lobbying by Labour\u2019s elected mayors to keep the cap in place, as revealed last week by the Guardian. Starmer insisted on Monday that working people would welcome such decisions as a necessary part of fixing the public finances after 14 years of Conservative government. \u201cThe Tories only funded [the \u00a32 fare cap] until the end of 2024, and therefore that is the end of the funding in relation to the \u00a32 bus fare,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI do know that this matters, particularly in rural buses, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m able to say to you this morning that in the budget, we will announce there\u2019ll be a \u00a33 cap on bus fares until the end of 2025, because I know how important it is.

The prime minister was giving a pre-budget speech in Birmingham to set expectations before what ministers warn will be a painful budget for many people, including planned rises to national insurance, capital gains tax and inheritance tax. Starmer and his senior ministers have spent the last few days defending their plans to increase taxes, despite having promised not to raise national insurance in their election manifesto.

Richard Parker, the Labour mayor for the West Midlands, introduced Starmer at the Birmingham speech. But Parker is understood to be one of those particularly concerned about bus services, which the combined authority is subsidising by \u00a350m to \u00a370m a year. While the spending of many government departments is likely to be cut this year to help close what the chancellor says is a \u00a322bn funding shortfall, Starmer did announce an additional \u00a3240m to help jobseekers find work. The money is designed to help roll out local services to help those who have been out of work with long-term health conditions get back into employment. \u201cThe UK is the only G7 country where economic inactivity is still higher than it was before Covid,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThat is not just bad for our economy, it\u2019s also bad for all those who are locked out of opportunity.\u201d Starmer also gave a hint that the chancellor might freeze fuel duty once more at this week\u2019s budget, telling a reporter from the Sun, which has campaigned to keep the freeze in place: \u201cI do understand how important it is to you, your readers and others.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A young man sits in a kitchen with a blue felt-tip pen. He can see his reflection in a chrome toaster: tousled black hair, Oxford shirt. He sketches out a grotesque figure, a human body with a contortion of tentacles where the neck should be, then a giant cauliflower-like red growth in place of a head. \u201cIt takes me a while,\u201d he says, \u201cbut at some point I realise I\u2019m drawing a self-portrait.\u201d</p> <p>This is the opening scene of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/sep/09/final-cut-by-charles-burns-review-a-book-to-be-read-and-reread\">Final Cut</a>, Charles Burns\u2019s first new English-language graphic novel in a decade (it brings together three serialised comics previously published in French). A body-horror toaster self-portrait is quintessentially Burnsian, his work being inked in the blurred space between humdrum American adolescent life and a monstrous, otherworldly unconscious. But it\u2019s also about a real thing that happened to Burns, half a century earlier. \u201cI was in this kitchen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was 1974 and I was very high, at a party, drawing my self-portrait in a toaster. Actually, I think I\u2019ve got a copy. Let me grab it real quick.\u201d</p> <p>Burns, now in his late 60s, heads off, giving me time to nosy around the studio of probably the most celebrated graphic novelist of his generation. He built his name in the alternative comics scene of the 1980s, where he buddied around with a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/matt-groening\">Matt Groening</a>, drew for Art Spiegelman\u2019s revered Raw magazine, and created the artwork for early Sub Pop mixtapes \u2013 including one that featured the first ever recording by Nirvana (Kurt Cobain was <a href=\"https://x.com/subpop/status/1272632595914752000/photo/1\">reportedly a fan</a>).</p> <p>Throughout the 1990s, Burns published a series of comics about a group of teens who circulate a sexually transmitted disease that turns them into monsters. Collected in graphic novel format in 2005, Black Hole became a watershed moment in comics for adults. It was taught on university literature courses and made Burns a cult hero, cited as an influence by everyone from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-knife\">the Knife</a> to Kristen Stewart.</p>    <p>We meet at his home in the Northern Liberties neighbourhood of Philadelphia, a once run-down and crime-ridden industrial area that has become a beacon for artists and hipsters. \u201cWhen we moved there 30 years ago, it was all we could afford. But because there was affordable studio space, other artists eventually moved in,\u201d he says. His home, like his work, is ordered, visually arresting \u2013 and filled with monsters. The living room is covered in eerie papier-mache masks while its bookshelves heave with rare independent and horror comics. On the top shelves sit hundreds of charming grotesque figurines, with saurian tongues and tumescent scales on their every surface.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wasn\u2019t interested in Captain America and Iron Man as a kid \u2013 I liked psychedelic comics and Robert Crumb</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Burns, tall and softly spoken, returns to the room holding a copy of that 1974 pencil drawing. It\u2019s rougher and more playful but the connection between that moment and Burns\u2019s new work is obvious. Rediscovering it shook him out of the writer\u2019s block that set in after his last big work a decade earlier, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/10/xed-out-charles-burns-review\">X\u2019ed Out</a> trilogy. \u201cI had three false starts. Each time I got into a project I started thinking, \u2018This is shit, I hate doing this.\u2019 I reached a point where I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do comics any more.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As a final attempt to break the block, he made a seven-page comic about that party. \u201cSuddenly it opened up,\u201d he says, and half-joking continues: \u201cI just started thinking, \u2018What if this beautiful girl came in and realised what a magnificent human being I was?\u2019 I liked the idea of revealing myself through my artwork. I had this awkward, stumbling personality, but I was able to express something on paper. Someone\u2019s going to see that and understand, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s this depth.\u2019 Then you go off and discover things.\u201d</p> <p>It all resulted in the story of a young comic artist, Brian, who struggles with depression and lives with his alcoholic mother. Brian makes Super 8 monster films with his best friend, Jimmy \u2013 smearing lipstick on their friends\u2019 faces to simulate blood. Subject to mood swings and a short temper, Brian becomes enraptured by a beautiful girl called Laurie, and they set off for the woods to shoot an 8mm horror flick inspired by Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</p> <p>Brian\u2019s lurid fantasies, combined with Burns\u2019s playfulness and the camera trickery of the moviemaking teens, means the book is constantly putting Vaseline on the lens of reality. When Laurie asks Brian what the film is going to be about, he screams: \u201cIt\u2019s about all the fucked-up shit going on in my head.\u201d</p> <p>As in most of Burns\u2019s work, the protagonist is an obvious avatar for himself. He even interchanges \u201cBrian\u201d and \u201cI\u201d during our interview, and says: \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me in every single character.\u201d In the story, which focuses on a group of attractive young people in the US in the 1970s, it\u2019s never quite clear what is fiction, memory or imagination.</p>    <p>Burns knows he\u2019s on familiar territory here. \u201cOne of the problems was that I was thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve got to do something different. I can\u2019t do young adults again. I\u2019ve got to have this middle-aged guy as a character.\u2019 But I thought, \u2018Fuck, I hate him. I don\u2019t want to hang out with him. I want to think about passion and intense emotions instead of everything dampened down.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Fuck it. I\u2019m just going to do what I enjoy doing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s good that he did. Final Cut is among Burns\u2019s best work, its huge full-page drawings pushing your buttons in the moonlit American outdoors. Still, even though the characters are young, they\u2019re layered and uncomfortable \u2013 particularly in their responses to Brian\u2019s depression \u2013 another element of Burns\u2019s own life he wanted to include. \u201cI went through real depression. It was three, four, five years of struggling. So I wrote that in.\u201d</p> <p>Burns became obsessed with monsters at a young age. His father had \u201cevery kind of hobby\u201d, which meant the house was always full of art tools and Indian ink. Burns would try to recreate comics he found around the house but his awakening came in early 1969 when a kid at school introduced him to Zap Comix, helmed by the godfather of underground comix <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/24/robert-crumb-interview-art-and-beauty-exhibition\">Robert Crumb</a>. \u201cSuddenly, here\u2019s this thing with intense drawings! I wasn\u2019t interested in Captain America and Iron Man \u2013 but I would imitate these psychedelic comics.\u201d</p> <p>Burns disappears again and comes back with some of his early examples. They have a beautiful, frantic quality \u2013 a kind of professionalised bedlam \u2013 with all the hallmarks of his current work, from weird monsters to attractive adolescents. The cartoonist Lynda Barry once wrote of his style and the standard he reaches: \u201cYou can\u2019t believe a person could do it with regular human hands. It\u2019s the kind of drawing that would have scared the pants off you in grade school, not only because the images are so eerie but because they are too perfectly done, and not good or evil enough for you to tell what you are supposed to think about them.\u201d</p> <p>That eerie perfectionism is right there in his earliest work. It\u2019s this style that excited Spiegelman, who agreed to publish Burns in Raw in the 1980s. It\u2019s why the cult literary magazine The Believer, founded by Dave Eggers in 1998, used Burns for every cover until 2014. It was also a style that brought Burns together with his wife, the artist Susan Moore, whom he married in 1982, and who died two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a painter,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we would always be looking over each other\u2019s shoulders. Very early on, when I had just moved in with her, I was struggling to letter a comic. I was trying as hard as I could to do really tight, good-looking lettering but my hand felt like a claw. She walked in and said, \u2018Oh, that doesn\u2019t look very good.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Oh, yeah? Let\u2019s see you try! I\u2019m going to set you up at the desk.\u2019 And she did this perfect, perfect lettering. She got the job. She was a painter, so I stretched her canvases and that sort of thing and she did all the lettering for me.\u201d Final Cut is his first book to use computer-generated lettering, although in a font based on Moore\u2019s style.</p>    <p>With such a prolific career in comics, you might expect Burns would be adapted for film, like his fellow graphic novelists Daniel Clowes and Alan Moore. He made one animation short in 2007, for a French horror anthology called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsF4TifBcfo\">Fear(s) of the Dark</a>. And he says Hollywood has come knocking many times, but nothing ever seems to lead anywhere.</p> <p>\u201cThere was an option for Black Hole,\u201d he says. \u201cI signed on the dotted line 15 years ago and got paid very well. But I don\u2019t know how Hollywood works and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m pursuing. If it happens, I don\u2019t want to be a consultant. I don\u2019t want to be involved. Because with comics, you have pure control over everything. If you fuck up, it\u2019s you. I like that kind of control.\u201d</p> <p>Burns has certainly had a life of unlimited creativity: working constantly, publishing rarely and compromising not a jot. \u201cI know there\u2019s folks that are thinking about what\u2019s going to sell. If I was smart, I would do Black Hole 2, Black Hole 3. That is what people buy. That is what people want. For me, that would be a dead end. The minute I\u2019m done with a book, it\u2019s in a distant space.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Final Cut by Charles Burns<em> </em>is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a330).

      "bodyText": "A young man sits in a kitchen with a blue felt-tip pen. He can see his reflection in a chrome toaster: tousled black hair, Oxford shirt. He sketches out a grotesque figure, a human body with a contortion of tentacles where the neck should be, then a giant cauliflower-like red growth in place of a head. \u201cIt takes me a while,\u201d he says, \u201cbut at some point I realise I\u2019m drawing a self-portrait.\u201d This is the opening scene of Final Cut, Charles Burns\u2019s first new English-language graphic novel in a decade (it brings together three serialised comics previously published in French). A body-horror toaster self-portrait is quintessentially Burnsian, his work being inked in the blurred space between humdrum American adolescent life and a monstrous, otherworldly unconscious. But it\u2019s also about a real thing that happened to Burns, half a century earlier. \u201cI was in this kitchen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was 1974 and I was very high, at a party, drawing my self-portrait in a toaster. Actually, I think I\u2019ve got a copy. Let me grab it real quick.\u201d Burns, now in his late 60s, heads off, giving me time to nosy around the studio of probably the most celebrated graphic novelist of his generation. He built his name in the alternative comics scene of the 1980s, where he buddied around with a young Matt Groening, drew for Art Spiegelman\u2019s revered Raw magazine, and created the artwork for early Sub Pop mixtapes \u2013 including one that featured the first ever recording by Nirvana (Kurt Cobain was reportedly a fan). Throughout the 1990s, Burns published a series of comics about a group of teens who circulate a sexually transmitted disease that turns them into monsters. Collected in graphic novel format in 2005, Black Hole became a watershed moment in comics for adults. It was taught on university literature courses and made Burns a cult hero, cited as an influence by everyone from the Knife to Kristen Stewart. We meet at his home in the Northern Liberties neighbourhood of Philadelphia, a once run-down and crime-ridden industrial area that has become a beacon for artists and hipsters. \u201cWhen we moved there 30 years ago, it was all we could afford. But because there was affordable studio space, other artists eventually moved in,\u201d he says. His home, like his work, is ordered, visually arresting \u2013 and filled with monsters. The living room is covered in eerie papier-mache masks while its bookshelves heave with rare independent and horror comics. On the top shelves sit hundreds of charming grotesque figurines, with saurian tongues and tumescent scales on their every surface. Burns, tall and softly spoken, returns to the room holding a copy of that 1974 pencil drawing. It\u2019s rougher and more playful but the connection between that moment and Burns\u2019s new work is obvious. Rediscovering it shook him out of the writer\u2019s block that set in after his last big work a decade earlier, the X\u2019ed Out trilogy. \u201cI had three false starts. Each time I got into a project I started thinking, \u2018This is shit, I hate doing this.\u2019 I reached a point where I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do comics any more.\u2019\u201d As a final attempt to break the block, he made a seven-page comic about that party. \u201cSuddenly it opened up,\u201d he says, and half-joking continues: \u201cI just started thinking, \u2018What if this beautiful girl came in and realised what a magnificent human being I was?\u2019 I liked the idea of revealing myself through my artwork. I had this awkward, stumbling personality, but I was able to express something on paper. Someone\u2019s going to see that and understand, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s this depth.\u2019 Then you go off and discover things.\u201d It all resulted in the story of a young comic artist, Brian, who struggles with depression and lives with his alcoholic mother. Brian makes Super 8 monster films with his best friend, Jimmy \u2013 smearing lipstick on their friends\u2019 faces to simulate blood. Subject to mood swings and a short temper, Brian becomes enraptured by a beautiful girl called Laurie, and they set off for the woods to shoot an 8mm horror flick inspired by Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Brian\u2019s lurid fantasies, combined with Burns\u2019s playfulness and the camera trickery of the moviemaking teens, means the book is constantly putting Vaseline on the lens of reality. When Laurie asks Brian what the film is going to be about, he screams: \u201cIt\u2019s about all the fucked-up shit going on in my head.\u201d As in most of Burns\u2019s work, the protagonist is an obvious avatar for himself. He even interchanges \u201cBrian\u201d and \u201cI\u201d during our interview, and says: \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me in every single character.\u201d In the story, which focuses on a group of attractive young people in the US in the 1970s, it\u2019s never quite clear what is fiction, memory or imagination. Burns knows he\u2019s on familiar territory here. \u201cOne of the problems was that I was thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve got to do something different. I can\u2019t do young adults again. I\u2019ve got to have this middle-aged guy as a character.\u2019 But I thought, \u2018Fuck, I hate him. I don\u2019t want to hang out with him. I want to think about passion and intense emotions instead of everything dampened down.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Fuck it.

      "body": "<p>After the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party run by the oligarch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/who-is-bidzina-ivanishvili-the-shadowy-billionaire-founder-of-georgian-dream\">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a> secured a parliamentary majority in Saturday\u2019s Georgian election, the reaction from Moscow was jubilant. \u201cGeorgians have won. Attaboys!\u201d <a href=\"https://x.com/M_Simonyan/status/1850239439961764128\">wrote Margarita Simonyan</a>, head of Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT, on X.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a devastated friend texted me Sunday morning to say they felt as if they \u201cwoke up in Russia\u201d.</p> <p>The question of whether Georgia would continue its drift into Russia\u2019s orbit or change course and embrace Europe hung over the election. But with reports of voting irregularities and the largest opposition party, United National Movement (UNM), outright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/georgia-election-calls-for-protests-as-ruling-pro-russia-party-declared-winner\">rejecting the result</a>, it is unlikely to be settled anytime soon.</p> <p>Ivanishvili has been in power since 2012, when he set up the GD party and scored a landslide victory against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/article/2024/may/23/former-georgian-president-had-fair-trial-strasbourg-judges-rule\">Mikheil Saakashvili</a>, Georgia\u2019s former president whom Putin famously promised to \u201chang by the balls\u201d and who is in jail in Tbilisi. Since that time, Ivanishvili has been methodically moving Georgia into a closer relationship with Russia \u2013 covertly and slowly at first, openly and aggressively in more recent years.</p> <p>This caused a lot of friction with society. Georgians had tired of Saakashvili\u2019s government, which was becoming autocratic, but many were set on a turn towards Europe. For centuries Georgian luminaries have cultivated the idea of Europe as the way of protecting the Georgian language and identity from oppression by its neighbours: Persians, Ottomans and, for the past two centuries, Russians. The modern Georgian constitution calls for a closer alliance with the west, in particular the EU and Nato.</p> <p>Even citizens already disillusioned with Ivanishvili were shocked when the government chose to side openly with Moscow against Kyiv in 2022. Ukraine had stood by Georgia through all of its wars, including the most recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/georgia.russia\">Russian invasion</a> in 2008. The government\u2019s position felt like a betrayal.</p> <p>In the ensuing years, GD has passed repressive Russian-style laws, launching brutal crackdowns on activists, targeting <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/georgian-parliament-approves-law-curbing-lgbt-rights-2024-09-17/\">the LGBTQ+ community</a> and unleashing dirty disinformation campaigns <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/georgias-government-uses-kremlin-playbook-to-consolidate-grip-on-power/\">straight out of the Kremlin playbook</a>. By 2024, hundreds of thousands were taking part in regular anti-government demonstrations led by the youth demanding that Georgia stay on its European course.</p> <p>The election was seen as the only democratic way of getting the country out of Ivanishvili\u2019s and Russia\u2019s tightening embrace \u2013 it was perhaps the most pivotal vote in the country\u2019s history since the independence referendum in 1991. Polls, including traditionally reliable exit polls, put the opposition in a clear lead. On the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/25/georgia-election-russia-west-democracy\">day of the vote</a>, the turnout was so high that in some polling stations people queued for hours to cast their ballots.</p> <p>And yet the central election body announced that the GD party beat the country\u2019s pro-European opposition and secured a fourth term. The list of recorded irregularities is long. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> (OSCE) says there was \u201cintimidation, coercion and pressure on voters\u201d, while <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/violence-georgia-election-polling-stations-voting/\">other reports detail</a> suspicious discrepancies in numbers, violence and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/georgias-pro-eu-opposition-calls-for-protest-over-rigged-election-result\">ballot stuffing</a>. The result will be challenged, although fighting for justice in courts controlled by an oligarch is likely to be futile.</p> <p>In the next few weeks, the opposition in Georgia will work to galvanise supporters and try to prove that the election was stolen. But they must face the reality that GD did perform better than anyone had expected, in part at least thanks to an aggressive pre-election campaign that focused on fear: the governing party\u2019s singular message equated opposition with another war with Russia. Their campaign included billboards that juxtaposed the ruins of Ukrainian cities with the peaceful landscapes of Georgia. It proved effective in a country where Russia still occupies 20% of the territory and memories of the 2008 invasion are very much alive.</p> <p>The election results may defy both logic and hope for many Georgians, but they align disturbingly well with the broader trajectory of the world. Over the past decade, the interplay of oligarchic alliances, disinformation, abuse of technology and selective violence have eaten away at the foundations of all societies. The losers aren\u2019t just the Georgian opposition and their supporters but everyone who believes in the value of freedom. The real winners aren\u2019t the Georgian politicians, or even the oligarch who pulls their strings, but anyone who puts money and power above shared values.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/georgias-pro-eu-opposition-calls-for-protest-over-rigged-election-result\">Georgia\u2019s pro-EU opposition calls for protest over \u2018rigged\u2019 election result</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the case of Georgia, the biggest winner is the Kremlin, which has just won a battle in its global war against liberal democracy.

      "bodyText": "After the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party run by the oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili secured a parliamentary majority in Saturday\u2019s Georgian election, the reaction from Moscow was jubilant. \u201cGeorgians have won. Attaboys!\u201d wrote Margarita Simonyan, head of Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT, on X. Meanwhile, a devastated friend texted me Sunday morning to say they felt as if they \u201cwoke up in Russia\u201d. The question of whether Georgia would continue its drift into Russia\u2019s orbit or change course and embrace Europe hung over the election. But with reports of voting irregularities and the largest opposition party, United National Movement (UNM), outright rejecting the result, it is unlikely to be settled anytime soon. Ivanishvili has been in power since 2012, when he set up the GD party and scored a landslide victory against Mikheil Saakashvili, Georgia\u2019s former president whom Putin famously promised to \u201chang by the balls\u201d and who is in jail in Tbilisi. Since that time, Ivanishvili has been methodically moving Georgia into a closer relationship with Russia \u2013 covertly and slowly at first, openly and aggressively in more recent years. This caused a lot of friction with society. Georgians had tired of Saakashvili\u2019s government, which was becoming autocratic, but many were set on a turn towards Europe. For centuries Georgian luminaries have cultivated the idea of Europe as the way of protecting the Georgian language and identity from oppression by its neighbours: Persians, Ottomans and, for the past two centuries, Russians. The modern Georgian constitution calls for a closer alliance with the west, in particular the EU and Nato. Even citizens already disillusioned with Ivanishvili were shocked when the government chose to side openly with Moscow against Kyiv in 2022. Ukraine had stood by Georgia through all of its wars, including the most recent Russian invasion in 2008. The government\u2019s position felt like a betrayal. In the ensuing years, GD has passed repressive Russian-style laws, launching brutal crackdowns on activists, targeting the LGBTQ+ community and unleashing dirty disinformation campaigns straight out of the Kremlin playbook. By 2024, hundreds of thousands were taking part in regular anti-government demonstrations led by the youth demanding that Georgia stay on its European course. The election was seen as the only democratic way of getting the country out of Ivanishvili\u2019s and Russia\u2019s tightening embrace \u2013 it was perhaps the most pivotal vote in the country\u2019s history since the independence referendum in 1991. Polls, including traditionally reliable exit polls, put the opposition in a clear lead. On the day of the vote, the turnout was so high that in some polling stations people queued for hours to cast their ballots. And yet the central election body announced that the GD party beat the country\u2019s pro-European opposition and secured a fourth term. The list of recorded irregularities is long. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) says there was \u201cintimidation, coercion and pressure on voters\u201d, while other reports detail suspicious discrepancies in numbers, violence and ballot stuffing. The result will be challenged, although fighting for justice in courts controlled by an oligarch is likely to be futile. In the next few weeks, the opposition in Georgia will work to galvanise supporters and try to prove that the election was stolen. But they must face the reality that GD did perform better than anyone had expected, in part at least thanks to an aggressive pre-election campaign that focused on fear: the governing party\u2019s singular message equated opposition with another war with Russia. Their campaign included billboards that juxtaposed the ruins of Ukrainian cities with the peaceful landscapes of Georgia. It proved effective in a country where Russia still occupies 20% of the territory and memories of the 2008 invasion are very much alive. The election results may defy both logic and hope for many Georgians, but they align disturbingly well with the broader trajectory of the world. Over the past decade, the interplay of oligarchic alliances, disinformation, abuse of technology and selective violence have eaten away at the foundations of all societies. The losers aren\u2019t just the Georgian opposition and their supporters but everyone who believes in the value of freedom. The real winners aren\u2019t the Georgian politicians, or even the oligarch who pulls their strings, but anyone who puts money and power above shared values. In the case of Georgia, the biggest winner is the Kremlin, which has just won a battle in its global war against liberal democracy. The Georgian opposition is unlikely to succeed unless it gets focused attention from Europe and the United States. But with the tragedy that has enveloped the Middle East, the drama of the US elections and the urgency of the increasingly unsustainable war in Ukraine, events in Georgia will struggle to compete for attention. Anyone interested in countering Russia\u2019s larger worldwide disruptions should remember Georgia. It was here that the fatal crack in the Soviet empire appeared on 9 April 1989, when Moscow gave the order for its troops to open fire on peaceful pro-independence protesters in Tbilisi. The reason empires crumble from the margins is because true resistance always comes from the edges. Helping Georgia bring back its democracy will keep it alive elsewhere.

      "body": "<p>Like many teens in the aughts, I spent most nights dutifully scouring my face with a popular scrub that smelled like apricot and felt like sandpaper. Years later, my nightly routine evolved into smearing my face with various expensive acids. The products were different, but the message was the same: in order to look our best, consumers needed to constantly be exfoliating \u2013 stripping off the top, dull layer of skin in order to reveal the glowing epidermis below.</p> <p>In beauty publications and on social media, exfoliation is often presented as an essential step in a skincare routine. In a column from May, Goop\u2019s beauty director, Jean Godfrey-June, <a href=\"https://goop.com/beauty/ask-jean/exfoliation-routine/?srsltid=AfmBOoo83xoV4Fv78v50ZexV9BjjbR-caljKttGmXrKTJu8D5X3VERZR\">wrote</a>: \u201cI am a huge enthusiast when it comes to exfoliation.\u201d On TikTok, videos claim it\u2019s a necessity. \u201cWhy you NEED to exfoliate 1-2x a week,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pamylasworld/video/7105091155729091886?q=exfoliation&amp;t=1729535040137\">one</a>. \u201cPOV: You need to exfoliate 2-3x a week!!\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@alicegabrii/video/7342622021014097195?q=exfoliation&amp;t=1729536235917\">another</a>.</p> <p>While experts agree there are benefits to proper exfoliation, they also say it\u2019s possible to take it too far. So how often do you really need to be exfoliating? And, what happens if you don\u2019t do it?</p> <h2><strong>What is exfoliation?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cExfoliation is the process of shedding dead skin cells from the surface of the skin,\u201d says Dr Joshua Zeichner, an associate professor of dermatology and director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai hospital in New York City. This process happens naturally and is part of the skin\u2019s natural life cycle. Usually, the skin turns over every few weeks, and dead cells are replaced by new ones. But a buildup of dead skin cells can cause skin to look dull, Zeichner says. Some people choose to speed up this turnover process with exfoliants.</p> <p>There are two types of exfoliants: physical (or mechanical) and chemical. Physical exfoliants, like my apricot scrub, often contain gritty particles that \u201cphysically remove the cells as they are massaged onto the skin\u201d, Zeichner explains. This can also be achieved with a rough object like a loofah or an exfoliating washcloth.</p> <p>Chemical exfoliators, on the other hand, contain acids that work by \u201cdissolving connections between cells, allowing them to be shed\u201d, says Zeichner.</p> <p>Chemical exfoliants often contain alpha hydroxy acids like glycolic acid or lactic acid, or beta hydroxy acids like salicylic acid, says Dr Murad Alam, vice-chair of the department of dermatology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. \u201cRetinols in cosmetic products or topical medications can also be used as exfoliants,\u201d he adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, \u2018Well Actually\u2019, then \u2018Read more on living a good life in a complex world,\u2019 then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say \u2018More from this section\u2019\u00a0\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>What are the benefits of exfoliation?</strong></h2> <p>There are many benefits to properly exfoliating, says Dr Shari Lipner, a dermatologist at Weill Cornell Medicine. These include \u201cmaking skin look clearer, preventing clogged pores and thus acne, and improving penetration of applied skin products\u201d, she says.

      "bodyText": "Like many teens in the aughts, I spent most nights dutifully scouring my face with a popular scrub that smelled like apricot and felt like sandpaper. Years later, my nightly routine evolved into smearing my face with various expensive acids. The products were different, but the message was the same: in order to look our best, consumers needed to constantly be exfoliating \u2013 stripping off the top, dull layer of skin in order to reveal the glowing epidermis below. In beauty publications and on social media, exfoliation is often presented as an essential step in a skincare routine. In a column from May, Goop\u2019s beauty director, Jean Godfrey-June, wrote: \u201cI am a huge enthusiast when it comes to exfoliation.\u201d On TikTok, videos claim it\u2019s a necessity. \u201cWhy you NEED to exfoliate 1-2x a week,\u201d says one. \u201cPOV: You need to exfoliate 2-3x a week!!\u201d says another. While experts agree there are benefits to proper exfoliation, they also say it\u2019s possible to take it too far. So how often do you really need to be exfoliating? And, what happens if you don\u2019t do it? What is exfoliation? \u201cExfoliation is the process of shedding dead skin cells from the surface of the skin,\u201d says Dr Joshua Zeichner, an associate professor of dermatology and director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai hospital in New York City. This process happens naturally and is part of the skin\u2019s natural life cycle. Usually, the skin turns over every few weeks, and dead cells are replaced by new ones. But a buildup of dead skin cells can cause skin to look dull, Zeichner says. Some people choose to speed up this turnover process with exfoliants. There are two types of exfoliants: physical (or mechanical) and chemical. Physical exfoliants, like my apricot scrub, often contain gritty particles that \u201cphysically remove the cells as they are massaged onto the skin\u201d, Zeichner explains. This can also be achieved with a rough object like a loofah or an exfoliating washcloth. Chemical exfoliators, on the other hand, contain acids that work by \u201cdissolving connections between cells, allowing them to be shed\u201d, says Zeichner. Chemical exfoliants often contain alpha hydroxy acids like glycolic acid or lactic acid, or beta hydroxy acids like salicylic acid, says Dr Murad Alam, vice-chair of the department of dermatology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. \u201cRetinols in cosmetic products or topical medications can also be used as exfoliants,\u201d he adds. What are the benefits of exfoliation? There are many benefits to properly exfoliating, says Dr Shari Lipner, a dermatologist at Weill Cornell Medicine. These include \u201cmaking skin look clearer, preventing clogged pores and thus acne, and improving penetration of applied skin products\u201d, she says. It can also be especially helpful for those with acne-prone skin. While exfoliation is often presented as a way for skin to look more youthful by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, experts aren\u2019t so sure about that claim. \u201cI don\u2019t think exfoliation is going to fix anyone\u2019s wrinkles,\u201d Dr Rachel Reynolds, interim chair of dermatology at the Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center told the Harvard health blog in May. How often should you exfoliate? For those who do choose to exfoliate, it\u2019s not meant to be part of a daily routine. \u201cNobody really needs to exfoliate every day,\u201d says Zeichner. For most people, one to two times a week is enough, he says. Lipner says it also depends on one\u2019s skin type. While weekly exfoliation may work for someone with oily skin, for those with dry or sensitive skin, she recommends limiting exfoliation to once or twice a month. To see how your skin might respond to a product, Alam suggests testing it on a small patch of skin before applying it to your whole face. And don\u2019t use exfoliants if you have acne, open sores or a sunburn. \u201cYour skin is already injured, and exfoliation may lead to further irritation, darkening or lightening of the skin, and even scarring,\u201d he says.

Some version of the idea has support among roughly 54% of Americans, and 86% of Republicans. \u201cTrump supporters will tell you they love the idea of mass deportation \u2013 even if they haven\u2019t thought much about the details,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cThe fact is, a lot of people seem to be supporting something right now whose implications they may not fully understand.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver went into the logistics of how mass deportation would work, but \u201cfor the record, the morality of it is despicable\u201d, he said. \u201cImmigrants are human beings, no matter what McDonald\u2019s worst employee says.\u201d</p> <p>The sheer size of what Trump is proposing is staggering \u2013 removing about 13 million people, more than the population of Ohio, many of whom have lived here for decades. Deportation would involve arrest, detention and legal processing, requiring the government to hire an estimated 220,000 to 409,000 new employees and law enforcement officers.

      "bodyText": "On the latest Last Week Tonight, John Oliver looked into the practical implications of Donald Trump\u2019s promise to enact mass deportations of undocumented people, which has been a cornerstone of his campaign. Some version of the idea has support among roughly 54% of Americans, and 86% of Republicans. \u201cTrump supporters will tell you they love the idea of mass deportation \u2013 even if they haven\u2019t thought much about the details,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cThe fact is, a lot of people seem to be supporting something right now whose implications they may not fully understand.\u201d Oliver went into the logistics of how mass deportation would work, but \u201cfor the record, the morality of it is despicable\u201d, he said. \u201cImmigrants are human beings, no matter what McDonald\u2019s worst employee says.\u201d The sheer size of what Trump is proposing is staggering \u2013 removing about 13 million people, more than the population of Ohio, many of whom have lived here for decades. Deportation would involve arrest, detention and legal processing, requiring the government to hire an estimated 220,000 to 409,000 new employees and law enforcement officers. As for the detention, \u201cthink for a second what it would entail to detain 13 million people,\u201d especially as the entire US prison and jail population stands at 1.9 million people. \u201cAnd we have a lot of prisons and jails in this country. They are kinda our thing,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cIf we had a slogan, it should probably be \u2018America: Home of Jails and the KFC Doubledown\u2019.\u201d To deport \u201cjust\u201d a million people a year \u2013 as JD Vance callously suggested in an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly touting a \u201cbite-by-bite\u201d approach \u2013 would cost an estimated $88bn annually, with the majority of that going toward building detention camps. Over a decade, that would cost nearly $1tn. \u201cAnd to be clear here, my biggest problem with \u2018we\u2019d spend nearly $1tn on building detention camps for immigrants is not the trillion-dollar part,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s worth recognizing the extent to which Trump and Vance are full of shit from a practical standpoint, as well as a moral one.\u201d For the sake of argument, Oliver pretended that mass deportation was a realistic policy. \u201cIt still wouldn\u2019t solve the problems the Trump campaign is claiming it would,\u201d he said, breaking down Republicans\u2019 arguments on how deportation would help the economy, housing costs and crime.

Trump has referred to Aurora as a \u201cwar zone\u201d, despite opposition from Aurora\u2019s Republican mayor. \u201cAnd that specific language points to what his real endgame here might look like,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cBecause while Trump can\u2019t deport 13 million or even 1 million people overnight, and mass deportation won\u2019t fix any of the problems he says it will, he could still use Aurora-style panics to give himself a ton of power,\u201d such as invoking the Illegal Aliens Act to turbocharge deportations without due process.

It claimed that Sergei Skripal\u2019s car was seen out and about on the morning of 4 March and his and Yulia\u2019s mobiles were turned off for four hours at that time. He said the claims were untrue and that there were many hundreds, if not thousands, of red herrings in such investigations. He said there was \u201cnothing to suggest\u201d the Skripals had not been at home when the novichok was applied to the door handle. The embassy also said it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that there was no CCTV cameras at Sergei Skripal\u2019s house. The hearing was told he did not want security measures because he did not want to make his home conspicuous or \u201clive under surveillance\u201d. The inquiry is examining how Dawn Sturgess, 44, died in July 2018 after she was exposed to novichok, which was apparently left in a discarded perfume bottle. The inquiry continues.",

Monday\u2019s long-awaited stock offering will give Boeing a financial cushion as its chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, tries to deal with the steep costs of the strike by 33,000 workers, while also solving production problems that this year renewed focus on the manufacturer\u2019s safety culture and delayed its new 777X jet. Adding to its troubles, problems with Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft \u2013 which had to return to Earth last month without two astronauts left on the International Space Station \u2013 have dealt a blow to its space division. The share offer could help Boeing stave off the prospect of a downgrade of its debt from investment grade to \u201cjunk\u201d status by one of the three big credit-rating agencies. Such a downgrade could make it more expensive for the company to borrow, particularly given its enormous $58bn debt pile. Boeing last week reported a $6bn quarterly loss up to the end of September, and it is bleeding money from the strike action. Last month it announced a plan to cut 17,000 jobs. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) union last week voted to reject a pay offer from Boeing that was brokered in part by Joe Biden\u2019s administration. The strike began on 13 September, and continued despite the offer of a 35% wage increase over the four-year contract. Boeing workers are holding out for a better deal after years of lagging pay, including the restoration of a defined-benefit pension plan they lost a decade ago. The manufacturer has fallen far behind its European rival, Airbus, since two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 of its bestselling plane, the 737 Max. Those crashes were blamed on design flaws, prompting the grounding of every 737 Max worldwide. The company has since lurched from crisis to crisis. As well as the huge drop in air travel during the coronavirus pandemic, it had continued production problems on other planes, and a mid-air door panel blowout in January put the focus back on its safety record. Regulators forced Boeing to slow production to address issues. Ortberg was named as chief executive in July, becoming the second person tasked with turning the company around. However, he has nearly immediately had to scramble to steady the company. Boeing said the new funding would be used for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes\u201d, including potentially for paying off debt. Ortberg last week said the company was saddled with too much borrowing, among other problems. Its share price dropped by 1.8% shortly after trading opened on Wall Street on Monday. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan were the four banks managing the stock offering. Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said before the offering that Boeing had still not provided \u201cmuch clarity on the pathway out of its calamitous situation, with the IAM strike still ongoing\u201d.",

The plan would be intended to eliminate the risk of the former president\u2019s nominees for senior posts being subject to intrusive background investigations intended to check for criminal histories, conflicts of interest or other potential liabilities that would normally be deemed disqualifying. The proposal, initially reported by the New York Times, also recommends hiring private investigators and researchers to carry out the vetting historically conducted by the FBI and other government agencies, of which Trump has grown suspicious. The goal is to avoid a repeat of Trump\u2019s presidency when several appointees \u2013 including Jared Kushner, the ex-president\u2019s son-in-law \u2013 experienced long delays to their security clearance while the bureau conducted extensive and intrusive checks. Kushner, who was a senior White House adviser and Middle East envoy under Trump, underwent months of background investigations for reasons that were never disclosed before the then president eventually overrode the process and ordered him to be given clearance. Background checks on government appointees have been part of the US system for protecting classified national security secrets dating back to the second world war and early cold war. But it is based on executive orders and memorandums of understanding rather than congressional legislation, giving Trump leeway to upend the convention if elected. A US supreme court ruling has granted the president ultimate authority over decisions about sharing and restricting national security information in his role as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Trump and his advisers have long harboured suspicions about the FBI background check system, believing it can be used to dig up personal information about prospective appointees that can then be used to inflict political damage. While the former president has long distrusted the FBI and accused it of being part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy designed to undermine him, it is unclear whether he has seen the memo proposing to cut it out of vetting procedures.

It\u2019s been a decade since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/dragon-age-inquisition-review\">the last Dragon Age game</a>, a decade for fan theories to percolate and expectations to rise out of control \u2013 and that\u2019s not to mention all the strife that\u2019s gone on at the studio after the disappointing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/23/mass-effect-andromeda-game-review-galaxy-problems\">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/22/anthem-review-bioware\">Anthem</a>. Veilguard is by no means bad, with plenty of charming characters to meet and new places to see. But the writing, the heart of previous games, is surprisingly mediocre, while the new combat style gets repetitive fairly quickly.</p> <p>You play as Rook, an associate of Varric, who served as companion and storyteller in the previous games. Varric and Rook have been on the hunt for elven god Solas for the better part of a year. Just when it looks as if you can stop him from tearing down the Veil between the physical and nether worlds, unleashing hordes of demons in the process, a magical mishap leads to the release of two other, even <em>worse</em> gods. These new villains are comically evil, but they are a disappointment compared with the compelling character of Solas, who is, after all, right there. Veilguard tells his side of the story, too, through side quests.</p>    <p>As we travel around the continent of Thedas, we visit places that previous games haven\u2019t explored: the city of Minrathous in mage-led Tevinter, or the sunny Rivain peninsula. Each place is gorgeous and filled with detail, from glowing butterflies flitting around Arlathan forest to animated skeletons swinging brooms in the Nevarran necropolis. Veilguard lets you travel freely, but certain areas of each map are closed off until a quest unlocks them; this can feel jarring, but also offers freedom to explore without the overwhelm. Exploration is fun, too, with plenty of treasure to find. Each area is home to a different faction of characters, and they immediately start asking favours. There\u2019s a lot of variety in these tasks, which unlock vital gear for each companion.</p> <p>Combat is now entirely real-time. You can still order your companions to use their skills via a ring menu similar to Mass Effect\u2019s, which I sometimes had to do because my companions wouldn\u2019t do useful things such as healing Rook or slowing down time without my say-so. But for the most part, they act autonomously. All I have to do is attack and dodge, pressing the same three buttons over and over again, throwing in the occasional combat skill or finishing move as my companions yell at me to watch out for imminent ranged attacks or explosions. It\u2019s serviceable, but we\u2019ve seen it before in countless other games, and there\u2019s not much room for strategy. Boss battles are quite challenging, however. Dodging is vital, and you won\u2019t get ahead by blindly slashing at your enemies.</p> <p>Generally, Veilguard is loth to let go of your hand for even a second. While a lot of the default damage numbers, wayfinders and blinking treasure indicators can be turned off in the options menu, the game seems to assume no player can retain information for longer than a few seconds. Characters will endlessly repeat events that have just happened and point out things you\u2019ve just seen, often by using the exact same words: \u201cOur rogue necromancer might be behind that door.\u201d \u201cWell, I sure hope our rogue necromancer is behind that door!\u201d In case this were somehow insufficient, there\u2019s a written summary for each mission so you can be absolutely sure what happened. The important ones are hashed over yet again in team meetings.</p> <p>Big decisions that affect the story are few and far between, and the game will tell you exactly what they lead to before you pick. Decisions do, for the most part, carry real consequence, which is nice, but it would have been nicer if the game didn\u2019t tell you that several times before you commit. These choices get rarer as time goes on, almost as if time to implement them ran out later in development.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdtmtuzICOI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NdtmtuzICOI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Rook is our hero of the hour because, by their own admission, \u201cno one else was there to do it\u201d.

      "body": "<p>More than 30 years have passed since President Bill Clinton persuaded Congress to ratify the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and yet the trade agreement still infuriates many voters and hangs over Kamala Harris\u2019s \u2013 and the Democrats\u2019 \u2013 chances in this year\u2019s elections.</p> <p>Zombie-like, Nafta just keeps coming back, decades after many Democrats believe it should have died. At the Republican convention, Donald Trump attacked Nafta, calling it \u201cthe worst trade agreement ever\u201d. In speech after speech, Nafta is a topic Trump turns to as he seeks to woo the voters in the pivotal blue-collar communities of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 many of whom remain angry about the job losses it caused.</p> <p>There were early warning signs. \u201cA lot of people were saying Nafta was going to be a disaster economically,\u201d said David Bonior, a former Democratic congressman from Michigan who led the congressional fight to defeat Clinton\u2019s push for Nafta. \u201cI could see it was going to be a disaster politically, too.\u201d</p> <p>Nafta acted like a slow-motion poison for Democrats. After Congress ratified it in 1993, year by year more factories closed and more jobs disappeared as manufacturers moved operations to Mexico to take advantage of that country\u2019s lower wages. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive thinktank, estimates that <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/trade-deficit-mexico-resulted-682900-jobs/\">the US lost 682,000 jobs</a> due to Nafta, which largely eliminated tariffs between the US, Mexico and Canada.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lingering issue in Michigan,\u201d said Ron Bieber, president of the Michigan AFL-CIO, the US\u2019s largest federation of unions. \u201cEveryone knows someone here in Michigan who lost their job due to Nafta. The door was cracked open to outsourcing before Nafta, but Nafta threw the door open after it was passed.\u201d</p> <p>JJ Jewell, who works at a Ford axle plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, was born two years before Nafta was ratified. The trade pact has been part of the background of his life, he says. Jewell said he often discussed trade problems with other auto workers, even when they didn\u2019t directly discuss Nafta. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cNafta helped expedite the loss of jobs from our country to a country where wages are cheaper. I have friends, family members, neighbors who lost their jobs as a direct result of Nafta. It still affects things decades later.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/13/trump-second-term-big-business\">\u2018Perilous for democracy, good for profits\u2019: is big business ready to love Trump again?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Trump talks tough on trade and protecting factory jobs, Jewell said that Trump, while president, fell badly short in his vows to bring back manufacturing jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s empty promises,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, the country\u2019s main labor federation, agreed, saying that Trump\u2019s tough words on trade have done little for workers. \u201cThis is an example of Trump\u2019s rhetoric not matching reality,\u201d Shuler said. \u201cHe talks a good game, but there\u2019s no action to back it up. When he had the ability to make a difference, when he was president, he went to different places and pretended to be a savior, and you followed up and you saw that those plants closed and jobs were moved to Mexico. He did nothing to fix it.\u201d</p> <p>Seeing all the lingering discontent about Nafta, many Democrats say it\u2019s unfair for Trump and others to blame their party for the agreement. The idea for Nafta arose under Ronald Reagan, they say, and George HW Bush negotiated the deal, both Republicans. More Republicans in Congress voted to ratify Nafta than Democrats. The vast majority of Senate Republicans also voted for it, while most Democratic senators voted against ratification.</p> <p>Still, Bonior said that Clinton and his administration \u201cget the blame because their top guy was for it\u201d, he said. \u201cClinton was instrumental in making it happen.\u201d</p> <p>Many workers who lost jobs due to Nafta were able to find other jobs, said Bonior, but their pay was 20% less on average. \u201cLifestyles were enormously downgraded in my district,\u201d said Bonior, who served as House majority whip. \u201cClinton bought into Nafta, but a lot of working-class people saw that as a betrayal.\u201d</p> <p>On Nafta, Clinton won strong backing from economists and corporate America. Brushing aside labor\u2019s warnings that Nafta would speed the loss of jobs to Mexico, nearly 300 economists on the right and the left, including several Nobel Prize winners, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-09-04-mn-31519-story.html\">signed a pro-Nafta letter</a>, saying: \u201cThe assertions that Nafta will spur an exodus of US jobs to Mexico are without basis.\u201d</p> <p>Many economists argued that Nafta would increase the number of manufacturing jobs in the US because the nation had a higher-skilled, more productive workforce than Mexico and would thus, in theory, gain factory jobs in an expanded free-trade zone. Pro-Nafta forces also argued that the closer economic integration of the US, Mexico and Canada would create a North American powerhouse to counter China\u2019s fast-growing economic power.</p> <p>Jeff Faux, a former president of the Economic Policy Institute, said many economists failed to realize something important that was happening when Nafta was negotiated: \u201cThe US was losing its manufacturing base. It was deindustrializing.\u201d</p> <p>Faux, one of the most outspoken economists against Nafta, said Clinton embraced Nafta because he was eager to present himself as a different type of Democrat and \u201cwas trying to ingratiate himself with the business community\u201d. \u201cClinton saw Nafta as an opportunity to present himself as not just another liberal Democrat,\u201d Faux said. \u201cIt was the beginning of the notion that came to dominate the Democratic party that its future is not in working people, that it\u2019s in professionals, in women, in minorities and various ethnic groups. They wanted to put together a new coalition, and labor would be a thing of the past.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Podhorzer, a former AFL-CIO political director, said many blue-collar workers remain angry about Nafta because it was such a departure from President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s emphatically pro-worker Democratic party. Podhorzer said: \u201cNafta is the catchall for a series of things that Democrats did that showed they had a greater concern for business interests and a kind of insensitivity to the consequences that accelerating deindustrialization would have on people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>Trump was shrewd to seize on Nafta, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a way for him to sort of wave a flag, but it doesn\u2019t actually mean he\u2019s on the workers\u2019 side. It channels pretty effectively the frustration that many Americans feel in seeing their jobs go offshore or to Mexico or seeing their communities hollowed out or seeing fewer economics prospects for their kids.\u201d</p> <p>In the view of many labor leaders and workers, the Democrats doubled down on misguided trade policy when Clinton successfully pushed Congress in 2000 to approve normal trade relations with China. That move encouraged many US corporations to outsource operations to lower-wage China, with one study finding that the country <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-080315-015041\">lost 2m jobs</a>, including 985,000 factory jobs, because of the normalized trade relations with China. The number of factories in the US also <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/reshoring-manufacturing-jobs/\">declined by 45,000</a> from 1997 to 2008, with many workers blaming Nafta and the China trade deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/election-harris-trump-pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania steel workers, wooed by Harris and Trump, remain skeptical</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s more, many unions faulted Barack Obama for pushing for another free trade agreement: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a pact with 12 Pacific Rim countries. TPP\u2019s supporters said the deal would increase US exports and build a powerful economic bloc to counter China. TPP was signed in 2016 under Obama\u2019s presidency, but soon after Trump became president, he withdrew the US from TPP, preventing it from taking force.</p> <p>\u201cObama wasn\u2019t great shakes on trade either,\u201d Bonior said. \u201cA lot of working people said they had enough. They decided we\u2019re not going to be with the Democrats any more, and Trump came along and filled the void. That was very smart for Trump to do.\u201d</p> <p>In a 2016 campaign appearance in Pittsburgh, Trump made a major speech on trade that denounced Nafta and cited several Economic Policy Institute studies that criticized the trade pact. Lawrence Mishel, who was the institute\u2019s president at the time, said: \u201cTrump never really explained what he would do about Nafta or trade. He ended his speech with a call for deregulation and tax cuts for the rich, which was far more pro-Chamber of Commerce than pro-worker.\u201d</p> <p>While Joe Biden voted to ratify Nafta when he was a senator, labor leaders say the president\u2019s current pro-worker stance on trade shows that he recognizes his Nafta vote was a mistake. For Bonior, it might be too little too late.</p> <p>\u201cBiden has been very good on working-class issues. Biden is trying to make up for his vote on Nafta,\u201d Bonior said. \u201cBut a lot of working-class people are turned off so much to the Democrats that they\u2019re not hearing of the things Biden and Harris have done for them. They\u2019re not listening. They\u2019re gone. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever get them back.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re to some degree mesmerized by Trump even though Trump has never been for working people,\u201d Bonior continued. \u201cThose plants he said he would restore \u2013 he never did any of that.\u201d</p> <p>Many union leaders slam Trump for a speech he gave in Youngstown in which he told thousands of workers that he would bring back all the factory jobs that Ohio had lost. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-ohio-campaign-rally-trump-offers-an-unfiltered-view-of-his-presidency/2017/07/25/dbbf6792-7188-11e7-8839-ec48ec4cae25_story.html\">They\u2019re all coming back</a>,\u201d he said. They didn\u2019t. And when General Motors closed its huge assembly plant in nearby Lordstown, Ohio, in 2019, Trump did little to stop the plant closing or bring back the lost jobs.</p> <p>\u201cHe said all those jobs would be coming back, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCkoaZUvvPI\">then he did nothing</a>,\u201d said Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers (UAW). \u201cThe auto industry abandoned Lordstown, and Trump did nothing.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump was running for president in 2016, he vowed to renegotiate Nafta, and he followed through, reaching a new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2018. Labor leaders had attacked Nafta not only for encouraging companies to move factory jobs to Mexico and but also for failing to effectively protect Mexican workers whose employers had violated their right to unionize or other rights.</p> <p>Union leaders agree that USMCA created a stronger mechanism to crack down on labor violations by Mexican companies, although the Trump administration negotiated that improved enforcement mechanism only after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and House Democrats <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/nancy-pelosi-says-a-usmca-trade-deal-breakthrough-could-be-imminent.html\">demanded that Trump go further</a> in the negotiations. But under USMCA, often called \u201cNafta 2.0\u201d, US companies have continued moving manufacturing operations to Mexico.</p> <p>Even though USMCA made only minor changes to Nafta, Trump called it, \u201cthe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/politics/trump-rnc-speech-transcript.html\">best trade deal</a> ever made\u201d. For her part, Harris was one of 10 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/02/jd-vances-false-claim-that-harris-voted-preserve-nafta/\">senators to vote against</a> USMCA, saying it didn\u2019t <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1839472003679457632\">improve Nafta</a> sufficiently.</p> <p>Faux said many workers applaud Trump on trade because \u201che did something\u201d about it by renegotiating Nafta, while \u201cthe Democrats did nothing\u201d.</p> <p>Labor leaders have differing views of USMCA. David McCall, president of the Pittsburgh-based United Steelworkers, said: \u201cI think Nafta 2.0 was helpful. It\u2019s gotten some better labor protections.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/27/election-harris-unions-swing-states\">US union members door-knock in swing states for Harris: \u2018It\u2019s a no-brainer for us\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the UAW\u2019s Fain was merciless in attacking USMCA. \u201cI like to <a href=\"https://x.com/UAW/status/1839745567821312451\">call it Trump\u2019s Nafta</a>,\u201d Fain said. \u201cTrump\u2019s Nafta only made problems worse. Trump\u2019s Nafta only gave the billionaires more profits. Trump\u2019s Nafta only killed more American jobs. Trump\u2019s Nafta only shipped more work to Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>Both Harris and Trump say they will renegotiate USMCA if elected. Trump also says he will protect factory jobs by imposing a 20% tariff on all imports, but the Steelworkers\u2019 McCall says that\u2019s a terrible idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think the solution to the problem is to have tariffs for the sake of having tariffs,\u201d McCall said. \u201cThat\u2019s protection. I think trade is a good thing. It\u2019s an economic stimulator.\u201d He said the US should use tariffs not in a blunderbuss way, but to \u201cpunish cheaters or countries that dump their various products\u201d.</p> <p>McCall said the Biden-Harris administration had had a far better strategy for protecting factory jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in generations that we\u2019ve had an industrial policy in this country,\u201d he said, praising three important laws passed under Biden: the infrastructure law, the green energy law and the Chips Act to encourage semiconductor production. McCall said those laws, along with Biden\u2019s targeted tariffs \u201cagainst countries that cheat\u201d, give the US \u201can opportunity to be the most productive producers of many products\u201d.</p> <p>While many blue-collar workers like Trump\u2019s views on trade, McCall said: \u201cHe\u2019s not a friend of unions or labor. For Trump it\u2019s all about him, not about the person that\u2019s working on the job: the steelworker, the electrical worker, the teamster or the UAW member.\u201d</p>",

Labor leaders had attacked Nafta not only for encouraging companies to move factory jobs to Mexico and but also for failing to effectively protect Mexican workers whose employers had violated their right to unionize or other rights. Union leaders agree that USMCA created a stronger mechanism to crack down on labor violations by Mexican companies, although the Trump administration negotiated that improved enforcement mechanism only after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and House Democrats demanded that Trump go further in the negotiations. But under USMCA, often called \u201cNafta 2.0\u201d, US companies have continued moving manufacturing operations to Mexico. Even though USMCA made only minor changes to Nafta, Trump called it, \u201cthe best trade deal ever made\u201d. For her part, Harris was one of 10 senators to vote against USMCA, saying it didn\u2019t improve Nafta sufficiently. Faux said many workers applaud Trump on trade because \u201che did something\u201d about it by renegotiating Nafta, while \u201cthe Democrats did nothing\u201d. Labor leaders have differing views of USMCA. David McCall, president of the Pittsburgh-based United Steelworkers, said: \u201cI think Nafta 2.0 was helpful. It\u2019s gotten some better labor protections.\u201d But the UAW\u2019s Fain was merciless in attacking USMCA. \u201cI like to call it Trump\u2019s Nafta,\u201d Fain said. \u201cTrump\u2019s Nafta only made problems worse. Trump\u2019s Nafta only gave the billionaires more profits. Trump\u2019s Nafta only killed more American jobs. Trump\u2019s Nafta only shipped more work to Mexico.\u201d Both Harris and Trump say they will renegotiate USMCA if elected. Trump also says he will protect factory jobs by imposing a 20% tariff on all imports, but the Steelworkers\u2019 McCall says that\u2019s a terrible idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think the solution to the problem is to have tariffs for the sake of having tariffs,\u201d McCall said. \u201cThat\u2019s protection. I think trade is a good thing. It\u2019s an economic stimulator.\u201d He said the US should use tariffs not in a blunderbuss way, but to \u201cpunish cheaters or countries that dump their various products\u201d. McCall said the Biden-Harris administration had had a far better strategy for protecting factory jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in generations that we\u2019ve had an industrial policy in this country,\u201d he said, praising three important laws passed under Biden: the infrastructure law, the green energy law and the Chips Act to encourage semiconductor production. McCall said those laws, along with Biden\u2019s targeted tariffs \u201cagainst countries that cheat\u201d, give the US \u201can opportunity to be the most productive producers of many products\u201d. While many blue-collar workers like Trump\u2019s views on trade, McCall said: \u201cHe\u2019s not a friend of unions or labor. For Trump it\u2019s all about him, not about the person that\u2019s working on the job: the steelworker, the electrical worker, the teamster or the UAW member.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><em><strong>Warning: this article contains descriptions of alleged rape and sexual assault</strong></em></p> <p>A total of 51 men are on trial over their alleged attacks on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, recruited by her husband at the time, Dominique Pelicot, who has admitted drugging and raping her.</p> <p>The 50 men accused of rape and assault alongside Dominique Pelicot are aged between 26 and 74. They include a nurse, a journalist, a prison warden, a councillor, a soldier, lorry drivers and farm workers. They each face up to 20 years in prison.</p> <p>In total, 49 are accused of rape, one of attempted rape and one of sexual assault. Five others are also accused of possessing child abuse imagery.</p> <p>Most lived in south-eastern France within a 60km radius of the village of Mazan, where the Pelicots lived. Six have previous convictions for domestic violence, two have convictions for sexual violence. A total of 23 have a criminal record for offences such as drunk-driving and possession of drugs.</p> <p>Some of the accused men have admitted rape but said they did not set out with this intention, and have apologised in court to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, a grandmother and former logistics manager. Others have denied the charge of rape, saying they believed they were taking part in a game by the couple.</p> <p>Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was unknowingly sedated and raped by her former husband, Dominique Pelicot, 71, who crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into her food and drinks and invited men to rape her over a nine-year period from 2011 to 2020.</p> <p>Pelicot has admitted the charges against him and said that for almost a decade he was in contact with men on an online chatroom titled \u201cwithout her knowledge\u201d where he would organise for strangers to come to the couple\u2019s home</p> <p>\u201cI am a rapist, like the others in this room,\u201d Pelicot told the court.</p> <p>The case is being heard by a panel of five professional judges in the southern city of Avignon and runs until December. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has waived her right to anonymity in order for the trial to be held in public, saying: \u201cShame must change sides.\u201d</p> <p>As the men appear in court over the course of the four-month trial, the Guardian will detail their profiles and testimony.</p>    <h2><strong>Cyrille D, 54</strong></h2> <p>Trained as a butcher, Cyrille D is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her home in September 2019. Cyrille D\u2019s partner, the mother of his children, was on holiday at the time. He said he was sexually frustrated in his relationship and had gone on to the online chatroom to console himself.</p> <p>In court, Cyrille D admitted rape, saying he had realised later that he had not gained Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s consent, only her husband\u2019s. He said Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was clearly unconscious but that her husband had been \u201cinsistent\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was naive, a little stupid, an idiot.\u201d He told the court that while in prison on remand he had understood that \u201cwomen do not belong to men\u201d.</p> <p>Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s lawyer said video evidence had showed that the alleged rape by Cyrille D had put her life in danger as she had risked not being able to breathe.</p> <p>Cyrille D detailed a violent childhood at the hands of his alcoholic father, who he said would wait outside school with a meat cleaver to attack him and threaten him. \u201cMy father was Hitler,\u201d he told the court. After a brutal public beating by his father outside school, Cyrille D was placed in care as a teenager.</p> <h2><strong>Lionel R, 44</strong></h2> <p>A worker at the Pelicots\u2019 local supermarket in Carpentras, Lionel R was a married father of three when he made contact with Dominique Pelicot. In court, Lionel R admitted raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on 2 December 2018 at her home, but he said he had not intended to commit rape.</p> <p>\u201cSince I never obtained Mrs Pelicot\u2019s consent, I have no choice but to accept the facts,\u201d he told the court. Turning to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, he said: \u201cI am sorry, I can only imagine the nightmare you\u2019ve lived through \u2026 and I am part of this nightmare.\u201d He said: \u201cI never told myself: \u2018I will rape that woman\u201d but he admitted: \u201cI\u2019m guilty of rape.\u201d He added that he should have left when he saw she was unconscious, and that it was cowardly of him not to have said anything.</p> <p>The court heard that Dominique Pelicot had previously brought an unsuspecting Gis\u00e8le Pelicot shopping at the supermarket so that Lionel R could see if he was attracted to her.</p> <p>Lionel R told the court he had been sexually abused at the age of 12 to 13 by the president of the p\u00e9tanque club in his village.</p>    <h2><strong>Jacques C, 72</strong></h2> <p>A former fire officer who had worked as a truck driver and then owned a pizzeria, Jacques C had been married for 25 years and had two children.</p> <p>He told the court he denied rape. He said he had been \u201cnaive\u201d and he thought that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot would wake up and it was a game by the couple.</p> <p>Jacques C admitted touching Pelicot, but said there had been no penetration and therefore no rape.</p> <p>Jacques C told the court he considered that his religious education had made him a \u201cgiving person\u201d who did good and respected women. He said he loved women \u201cin all their complexity\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Jean-Pierre M, 63</strong></h2> <p>A former lorry driver for an agricultural cooperative in southern France, Jean-Pierre M is not accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. Instead, he is accused of using the same technique to drug and rape his own wife, and organising for Pelicot to rape her with him.</p> <p>Described in court as a \u201cdisciple\u201d of Pelicot, he admitted sedating his wife, with whom he had five children, and enlisting Pelicot to rape her.</p> <p>The two men made contact in the online chatroom called \u201cwithout her knowledge\u201d. Pelicot is alleged to have provided sedatives to drug the man\u2019s wife, explained the method and travelled to rape the woman himself.</p> <p>Twelve rapes of Jean-Pierre\u2019s wife are alleged to have taken place between 2015 and 2020. Jean-Pierre told the court that he admitted the charges.</p> <p>Pelicot admitted raping Jean-Pierre\u2019s wife on several occasions and said he regretted his actions. He said he had cut contact with the couple after Jean-Pierre\u2019s wife woke up during one of the assaults while he was in her bedroom. </p> <p>The court heard how Jean-Pierre\u2019s childhood in the French countryside was marked by extreme poverty, extreme violence and he was the victim of sexual abuse within his family. \u201cI was raised by pigs in the woods,\u201d he had told his children.</p> <h2><strong>Joan K, 26</strong></h2> <p>A soldier in the French military, Joan K is the youngest man on trial. He was 22 at the time of his alleged raping of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on two separate visits to her home in 2019 and 2020.</p> <p>He told the court: \u201cI\u2019m a rapist because the law says I am\u201d \u2013 but he said he had not intended to rape and \u201cat the time I did not know what consent was\u201d.</p> <p>He said he had been invited to the couple\u2019s home by Dominique Pelicot for an encounter and had not asked for Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s consent, saying he learned only in prison what consent was.</p> <p>He said he had found it strange that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was snoring, and that he knew she was unconscious but he had not known that meant she had not consented.</p> <p>In November 2019, Joan K was absent for the premature birth of his daughter on the night he was accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot for the first time.</p> <p>Born in French Guiana, he joined his brother in Avignon when he was 16 before enlisting in the army. The court heard he had lived on the streets as a teenager and three of his brothers had died. He lost his army job when he was arrested. He was described by a psychologist as a chronic user of alcohol and cannabis, \u201cdepressive, impulsive and solitary\u201d.</p>    <h2><strong>Hugues M, 39</strong></h2> <p>A tiler, motorbike enthusiast and father of two, Hugues M is accused of the attempted rape of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot a few days before his then girlfriend\u2019s birthday in October 2019. He denies the charge. He said he did not know Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was drugged and had not looked at her face, just her body.</p> <p>His ex-partner Emilie O, 33, who met him online and lived with him for five years, told the court she feared she may have been drugged and sexually assaulted by him herself. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I was raped,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. I will always have doubts.\u201d</p> <p>She told the court that one night in 2019 she had woken up to find her partner attempting to assault her. She launched a police complaint, but it was dismissed for \u201clack of material evidence\u201d. She told the court she had experienced \u201cdizziness\u201d between September 2019 and March 2020, but investigators did not detect any substances that might have affected her at the time.</p> <h2><strong>Husamettin D, 43</strong></h2> <p>A married father who had given up part-time work to care for his disabled son, Husamettin D is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in June 2019. He denied the charge in court saying: \u201cI don\u2019t accept being called a rapist, I\u2019m not a rapist.\u201d</p> <p>The court heard that Husamettin D had made contact with Dominique Pelicot in the chatroom and had gone to the Pelicots\u2019 home the same night, telling his own wife he was going out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/this-is-europe-gisele-pelicot-france-rape-trial\">Could the shocking Pelicot rape trial help to finally change French attitudes to sexual violence?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pelicot had told him he was looking for an \u201cArab\u201d man for his wife \u2013 Husamettin, born in Turkey, used the online pseudonym \u201cKarim\u201d.</p> <p>He admitted that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \u201cseemed dead\u201d, with her leg dangling oddly, but he said he had thought it was a scenario or game and that she was pretending.</p> <p>He said Dominique Pelicot had said his wife was in agreement. He said he had not known she was drugged.</p> <p>The court heard that Husamettin D had become addicted to cannabis from the age of 11, and had lived in children\u2019s homes. In 2000, he was convicted for dealing drugs.</p> <h2><strong>Fabien S, 39</strong></h2> <p>A man with 16 previous convictions ranging from armed robbery and drug dealing to domestic violence and sexual assault of a minor, Fabien S said he admitted the charge of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in August 2018. But he said he had not gone to the Pelicots\u2019 home with the intention of raping her.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go there to rape her. I didn\u2019t know I was supposed to rape her, but I recognise the facts,\u201d he said, adding he had \u201cnot paid attention\u201d to whether or not she had consented.</p> <p>He said he wasn\u2019t interested in a scenario where a woman was unconscious because he liked to hear women scream. He apologised to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in court.</p> <p>The court heard that Fabien S allegedly raped Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her dining room. Asked how this was possible, Dominique Pelicot said he had put drugs in her meal and carried her unconscious to the dining room table.</p> <p>The court heard that Fabien S had been sexually abused by his father from the age of two, then placed in different foster families where he faced further violence and sexual abuse, and that he was admitted to psychiatric care at the age of 16.

He said he had believed Dominique Pelicot\u2019s assertion that his then wife liked to \u201cmake love while drunk\u201d.</p> <p>Gr\u00e9gory S told the court that when he arrived in the Pelicots\u2019 bedroom, he had said: \u201cGiven the state she\u2019s in, it\u2019s not really worth it.\u201d But Dominique Pelicot had told him to go ahead.</p> <p>Testifying in court, Gr\u00e9gory S said what he did was not rape. Looking over at Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, he said: \u201cYour husband manipulated me and I know he manipulated quite a few people here.\u201d She looked away.</p> <p>Gr\u00e9gory S said that at the time he was aged 24, smoking between 10 and 15 joints a day and was struggling with the loss of his baby daughter at seven months\u2019 pregnancy due to a heart defect. He said he had been afraid of Dominique Pelicot, despite video evidence showing him smiling.</p> <p>The court heard that Gr\u00e9gory S\u2019s father had been in prison when he was a small boy, a fact his parents tried to hide by lying and saying the building in which he visited him was a hospital, not a prison. When Gr\u00e9gory S was jailed on remand in the Pelicot case, he did the same for his stepson of the same age \u2013 telling him the prison was a building site and he was working there as a painter.</p>    <h2><strong>Florian R, 32</strong></h2> <p>A delivery driver convicted of nine offences including driving without a licence, burglary and receiving stolen goods, Florian R is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in December 2019.</p> <p>He has denied rape, saying he thought it was a \u201cconsenting game between three people\u201d. He made contact with Dominique Pelicot online and a few hours later went to their home out of \u201ccuriosity\u201d, he told the court.</p> <p>He said he had drunk a bottle of whisky that day. \u201cI did not leave my house with the intention to commit a rape,\u201d he said. Towards the end he had noticed there was a \u201cbizarre atmosphere\u201d in the room and he had felt afraid, he said. He did not call the police.</p> <p>Florian R\u2019s mother, a cleaner, told the court that when she heard the charges against her son: \u201cI wondered, did I get something wrong in the way he was raised? I know what he did is very serious. I don\u2019t hide that.\u201d</p> <p>Florian R told the court he did not know his biological father.</p> <h2><strong>Jean-Luc L, 46</strong></h2> <p>A mirror maker and father of four, Jean-Luc L has admitted raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her bedroom on two occasions in 2018, knowing she had been drugged unconscious.</p> <p>At first he thought Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s husband had consented on her behalf and that therefore \u201cit wasn\u2019t against the law\u201d, he said.</p> <p>He told a psychologist after his arrest that he had thought the definition of rape was instead something that \u201chappens in the street\u201d in the style of \u201cif you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll hit you\u201d.</p> <p>Jean-Luc L\u2019s wife, who is Vietnamese, told the court her mother was ill at the time and she had refused sex. She said: \u201cI think because I refused him all the time, as a man, he had to look elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, through her lawyer, said Jean-Luc L\u2019s wife was not responsible for her husband\u2019s actions. \u201cThere is never an obligation to have sexual relations with your husband. Do you understand that?\u201d the lawyer said.</p> <p>The court heard that Dominique Pelicot had suggested drugging Jean-Luc L\u2019s wife, so they could both rape her. \u201cI told him I\u2019d think about it just to please him, but I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Jean-Luc L. \u201cSex wasn\u2019t really her thing.\u201d</p> <p>The court heard Jean-Luc L had fled Vietnam by boat with his mother as a child and had lived in refugee camps before coming to France.</p> <h2><strong>Patrice N, 55</strong></h2> <p>An electrician from Carpentras, Patrice N has described himself as a \u201cjovial\u201d guy who once trained youth football teams. He has denied rape, saying: \u201cTo my mind, it was a game.\u201d</p> <p>Despite video evidence in court showing Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in an unconscious state, snoring loudly, Patrice N claimed he had not noticed that she was sedated when he went to the couple\u2019s home in February 2020.</p> <p>He said he told Dominique Pelicot at the end of the visit: \u201cYour wife looks like she\u2019s really asleep.\u201d Dominique Pelicot replied that he gave his wife \u201cpills\u201d and would also take her to motorway laybys and \u201chand her to men\u201d. Patrice N said he called Dominique Pelicot \u201csick\u201d and then left.</p> <p>Asked why he did not contact the police, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to waste my time at the police station. I\u2019m a humble neighbourhood electrician \u2026 who would have believed me?\u201d</p> <p>A care worker who became Patrice N\u2019s girlfriend 16 months ago despite knowing he was charged with rape in the Pelicot case, told the court: \u201cHe treats me like a princess.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Abdelali D, 47</strong></h2> <p>A former canteen worker who has had a stroke since his arrest, Abdelali D has admitted rape, saying he went to the Pelicots\u2019 home twice and raped Gis\u00e8le Pelicot when she was in a comatose state.</p> <p>He said Dominique Pelicot told him \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t wake up\u201d.</p> <p>The first time, one January night in 2018, he had asked his then girlfriend to drive him to the Pelicots\u2019 village and wait an hour for him in the car.</p> <p>She told the court she had driven him because she was worried about him driving drunk. She thought he was meeting a couple for a sexual encounter, but had not sought details. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She described Abdelali D as someone who \u201cdrank morning, noon and night\u201d.</p> <h2><strong><br>Romain V, 63</strong></h2> <p>The former forklift truck-driver is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on six occasions over six months between 2019 and 2020 while she was unconscious on her bed.</p> <p>He denied rape, saying \u201cher husband [Dominique Pelicot] invited me in\u201d and that a husband\u2019s consent was enough. He denied knowing she was drugged, despite video evidence showing him smiling as she snored loudly. He said he first went to the Pelicots\u2019 home because: \u201cI felt lonely. Christmas was approaching and I was going to be on my own again. I was looking for friendship.\u201d</p> <p>Romain V told the court he had known he was HIV positive at the time of the alleged rapes and had not worn a condom. His lawyer said that because he had been on HIV treatment since his diagnosis in 2004 he had an undetectable viral load, which was regularly tested, and could not transmit the virus. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t contagious,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The court heard that Romain V had been subjected to such extreme physical violence and abuse by his parents that it amounted to \u201ctorture\u201d. He was raped by several men as a child, including a priest.</p> <h2><strong>C\u00e9dric G, 50</strong></h2> <p>A software technician who used to run a record shop in Avignon, C\u00e9dric G is accused of raping Pelicot in her home in October 2017 in the knowledge that she had been drugged unconscious. He is also accused of possessing child abuse imagery. He has admitted both charges.</p> <p>The court heard that C\u00e9dric G had also procured from Dominique Pelicot an amount of sedatives with the aim of drugging his own girlfriend at the time. He said he did not go through with it. He had written a message to Dominique Pelicot about his girlfriend saying: \u201cMy dream is her getting raped on the way home from work.\u201d He had shown Pelicot where his girlfriend lived.</p> <p>C\u00e9dric G said he did not use the sedatives but that having them in his possession \u201cgave a feeling of power\u201d. He added: \u201cIt flatters your ego. I had the fantasy but I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>He said that when he went to the Pelicots\u2019 home, \u201cmy sexuality was already twisted \u2026 the deviance was already there.\u201d Turning to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in court, he said: \u201cI was your rapist.

He said: \u201cI have always said that I did not intend to rape anyone.\u201d</p> <p>He told the court he felt tricked by Dominique Pelicot, and had believed he was going to have an encounter with a consenting couple with \u201cfantasies\u201d.</p> <p>He said that, at the time, he was under the impression that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was consenting, but in court recognised she had not been in a state to consent. When questioned he said: \u201cGiven this case, I can consider that I raped, yes.\u201d He apologised in court and said: \u201cToday I see consent differently.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Ludovick B, 39</strong></h2> <p>The warehouse worker is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot one night between Christmas and New Year 2019 when the Pelicots were on holiday at their daughter\u2019s home in the Paris area.</p> <p>He recognised that a sexual encounter had taken place, but told the court he had had no intention to rape. \u201cWhat I did was not premeditated,\u201d he said. He told the court he was a regular cannabis user, saying he had been afraid of Dominique Pelicot\u2019s reaction if he left the bedroom. He said he was a \u201ccollateral victim\u201d of Dominique Pelicot, who he said had used him to enact his fantasy.</p> <p>After December 2019, Ludovick B, who has one child, sent Dominique Pelicot a message about potentially meeting up again if he was in the area, and a new year message the following year.</p> <p>The court heard that, as a child, Ludovick B was a victim of a notorious sex offender, Fabrice Motch, a fire service captain convicted for drugging and raping boys who were young volunteers. Motch, who was sentenced to 15 years for those offences, is serving a life sentence for murder.</p> <h2><strong>Omar D, 36</strong></h2> <p>A married mechanic<strong> </strong>who worked cleaning buses in Avignon, Omar D is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at her home in November 2017 after making contact with Dominique Pelicot on a chatroom hours earlier. He denied the charge of rape.</p> <p>He said Dominique Pelicot had told him what to do and he had not asked questions. Asked by a judge if he had been concerned that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot appeared unconscious and did not react, he said: \u201cIt was my first threesome and I didn\u2019t know how it worked.\u201d</p> <p>He said he did not remember if he had looked at Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s face. Asked by Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s lawyer if he accepted that what he did was rape, he said \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Morocco, Omar D arrived in France at the age of two. </p> <h2><strong>Paul G, 31</strong></h2> <p>Paul G, who told the court he would like to train as a pastor, is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at her home one lunchtime in 2016 after Dominique Pelicot had drugged her at breakfast.</p> <p>Paul G admitted the charge of rape. \u201cI raped, I accept it, I raped,\u201d he told the court. He said that, at the time, he had not seen it as rape, because he was young [aged 23 at the time] and wanted to \u201chave fun\u201d without much thought. He said that after he was shown video evidence by police, he realised it was rape.</p> <p>He apologised to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, telling the court: \u201cWe are not monsters; we are men like any others.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Guinea to parents who worked as a midwife and a pastor, Paul G arrived in France as an unaccompanied minor aged 16, having travelled by boat to Europe.

He said he knew the village of Mazan well because he once worked building swimming pools there.</p> <p>Saifeddine G admitted what he called \u201cattempted rape\u201d, but denied a rape took place. He told the court: \u201cI recognise that I did not get Madame Pelicot\u2019s consent. I am totally conscious of the seriousness of the facts \u2026 But for me, it\u2019s an attempted rape. That is not to minimise it. I\u2019m here for Madame Pelicot to know the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The court heard he grew up in Tunisia and arrived in France aged 15. He said he had an \u201caddiction to social networks and the internet\u201d and would go on websites for meeting partners, simply out of \u201cboredom.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Warning: this article contains descriptions of alleged rape and sexual assault A total of 51 men are on trial over their alleged attacks on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, recruited by her husband at the time, Dominique Pelicot, who has admitted drugging and raping her. The 50 men accused of rape and assault alongside Dominique Pelicot are aged between 26 and 74. They include a nurse, a journalist, a prison warden, a councillor, a soldier, lorry drivers and farm workers. They each face up to 20 years in prison. In total, 49 are accused of rape, one of attempted rape and one of sexual assault. Five others are also accused of possessing child abuse imagery. Most lived in south-eastern France within a 60km radius of the village of Mazan, where the Pelicots lived. Six have previous convictions for domestic violence, two have convictions for sexual violence. A total of 23 have a criminal record for offences such as drunk-driving and possession of drugs. Some of the accused men have admitted rape but said they did not set out with this intention, and have apologised in court to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, a grandmother and former logistics manager. Others have denied the charge of rape, saying they believed they were taking part in a game by the couple. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was unknowingly sedated and raped by her former husband, Dominique Pelicot, 71, who crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into her food and drinks and invited men to rape her over a nine-year period from 2011 to 2020. Pelicot has admitted the charges against him and said that for almost a decade he was in contact with men on an online chatroom titled \u201cwithout her knowledge\u201d where he would organise for strangers to come to the couple\u2019s home \u201cI am a rapist, like the others in this room,\u201d Pelicot told the court. The case is being heard by a panel of five professional judges in the southern city of Avignon and runs until December. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has waived her right to anonymity in order for the trial to be held in public, saying: \u201cShame must change sides.\u201d As the men appear in court over the course of the four-month trial, the Guardian will detail their profiles and testimony. Cyrille D, 54 Trained as a butcher, Cyrille D is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her home in September 2019. Cyrille D\u2019s partner, the mother of his children, was on holiday at the time. He said he was sexually frustrated in his relationship and had gone on to the online chatroom to console himself. In court, Cyrille D admitted rape, saying he had realised later that he had not gained Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s consent, only her husband\u2019s. He said Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was clearly unconscious but that her husband had been \u201cinsistent\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was naive, a little stupid, an idiot.\u201d He told the court that while in prison on remand he had understood that \u201cwomen do not belong to men\u201d. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s lawyer said video evidence had showed that the alleged rape by Cyrille D had put her life in danger as she had risked not being able to breathe. Cyrille D detailed a violent childhood at the hands of his alcoholic father, who he said would wait outside school with a meat cleaver to attack him and threaten him. \u201cMy father was Hitler,\u201d he told the court. After a brutal public beating by his father outside school, Cyrille D was placed in care as a teenager. Lionel R, 44 A worker at the Pelicots\u2019 local supermarket in Carpentras, Lionel R was a married father of three when he made contact with Dominique Pelicot. In court, Lionel R admitted raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on 2 December 2018 at her home, but he said he had not intended to commit rape. \u201cSince I never obtained Mrs Pelicot\u2019s consent, I have no choice but to accept the facts,\u201d he told the court. Turning to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, he said: \u201cI am sorry, I can only imagine the nightmare you\u2019ve lived through \u2026 and I am part of this nightmare.\u201d He said: \u201cI never told myself: \u2018I will rape that woman\u201d but he admitted: \u201cI\u2019m guilty of rape.\u201d He added that he should have left when he saw she was unconscious, and that it was cowardly of him not to have said anything. The court heard that Dominique Pelicot had previously brought an unsuspecting Gis\u00e8le Pelicot shopping at the supermarket so that Lionel R could see if he was attracted to her. Lionel R told the court he had been sexually abused at the age of 12 to 13 by the president of the p\u00e9tanque club in his village. Jacques C, 72 A former fire officer who had worked as a truck driver and then owned a pizzeria, Jacques C had been married for 25 years and had two children. He told the court he denied rape. He said he had been \u201cnaive\u201d and he thought that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot would wake up and it was a game by the couple. Jacques C admitted touching Pelicot, but said there had been no penetration and therefore no rape. Jacques C told the court he considered that his religious education had made him a \u201cgiving person\u201d who did good and respected women. He said he loved women \u201cin all their complexity\u201d. Jean-Pierre M, 63 A former lorry driver for an agricultural cooperative in southern France, Jean-Pierre M is not accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. Instead, he is accused of using the same technique to drug and rape his own wife, and organising for Pelicot to rape her with him. Described in court as a \u201cdisciple\u201d of Pelicot, he admitted sedating his wife, with whom he had five children, and enlisting Pelicot to rape her. The two men made contact in the online chatroom called \u201cwithout her knowledge\u201d. Pelicot is alleged to have provided sedatives to drug the man\u2019s wife, explained the method and travelled to rape the woman himself. Twelve rapes of Jean-Pierre\u2019s wife are alleged to have taken place between 2015 and 2020. Jean-Pierre told the court that he admitted the charges. Pelicot admitted raping Jean-Pierre\u2019s wife on several occasions and said he regretted his actions. He said he had cut contact with the couple after Jean-Pierre\u2019s wife woke up during one of the assaults while he was in her bedroom. The court heard how Jean-Pierre\u2019s childhood in the French countryside was marked by extreme poverty, extreme violence and he was the victim of sexual abuse within his family. \u201cI was raised by pigs in the woods,\u201d he had told his children. Joan K, 26 A soldier in the French military, Joan K is the youngest man on trial. He was 22 at the time of his alleged raping of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on two separate visits to her home in 2019 and 2020. He told the court: \u201cI\u2019m a rapist because the law says I am\u201d \u2013 but he said he had not intended to rape and \u201cat the time I did not know what consent was\u201d. He said he had been invited to the couple\u2019s home by Dominique Pelicot for an encounter and had not asked for Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s consent, saying he learned only in prison what consent was. He said he had found it strange that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was snoring, and that he knew she was unconscious but he had not known that meant she had not consented. In November 2019, Joan K was absent for the premature birth of his daughter on the night he was accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot for the first time. Born in French Guiana, he joined his brother in Avignon when he was 16 before enlisting in the army. The court heard he had lived on the streets as a teenager and three of his brothers had died. He lost his army job when he was arrested. He was described by a psychologist as a chronic user of alcohol and cannabis, \u201cdepressive, impulsive and solitary\u201d. Hugues M, 39 A tiler, motorbike enthusiast and father of two, Hugues M is accused of the attempted rape of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot a few days before his then girlfriend\u2019s birthday in October 2019. He denies the charge. He said he did not know Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was drugged and had not looked at her face, just her body. His ex-partner Emilie O, 33, who met him online and lived with him for five years, told the court she feared she may have been drugged and sexually assaulted by him herself. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I was raped,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. I will always have doubts.\u201d She told the court that one night in 2019 she had woken up to find her partner attempting to assault her. She launched a police complaint, but it was dismissed for \u201clack of material evidence\u201d. She told the court she had experienced \u201cdizziness\u201d between September 2019 and March 2020, but investigators did not detect any substances that might have affected her at the time. Husamettin D, 43 A married father who had given up part-time work to care for his disabled son, Husamettin D is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in June 2019. He denied the charge in court saying: \u201cI don\u2019t accept being called a rapist, I\u2019m not a rapist.\u201d The court heard that Husamettin D had made contact with Dominique Pelicot in the chatroom and had gone to the Pelicots\u2019 home the same night, telling his own wife he was going out. Pelicot had told him he was looking for an \u201cArab\u201d man for his wife \u2013 Husamettin, born in Turkey, used the online pseudonym \u201cKarim\u201d. He admitted that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \u201cseemed dead\u201d, with her leg dangling oddly, but he said he had thought it was a scenario or game and that she was pretending. He said Dominique Pelicot had said his wife was in agreement. He said he had not known she was drugged. The court heard that Husamettin D had become addicted to cannabis from the age of 11, and had lived in children\u2019s homes. In 2000, he was convicted for dealing drugs. Fabien S, 39 A man with 16 previous convictions ranging from armed robbery and drug dealing to domestic violence and sexual assault of a minor, Fabien S said he admitted the charge of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in August 2018. But he said he had not gone to the Pelicots\u2019 home with the intention of raping her. \u201cI didn\u2019t go there to rape her. I didn\u2019t know I was supposed to rape her, but I recognise the facts,\u201d he said, adding he had \u201cnot paid attention\u201d to whether or not she had consented. He said he wasn\u2019t interested in a scenario where a woman was unconscious because he liked to hear women scream. He apologised to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in court. The court heard that Fabien S allegedly raped Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her dining room. Asked how this was possible, Dominique Pelicot said he had put drugs in her meal and carried her unconscious to the dining room table. The court heard that Fabien S had been sexually abused by his father from the age of two, then placed in different foster families where he faced further violence and sexual abuse, and that he was admitted to psychiatric care at the age of 16. From 18 to 28 he lived on the streets in Toulon as an alcoholic. Mathieu D, 53 The father of two had worked as baker for 25 years before having to leave his job because of an intolerance to wheat. He is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot with Dominique Pelicot on 3 October 2020. He admitted the facts, saying he was high on the drug MDMA at the time and thought it was a game with a married couple. Mathieu D accepted later that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had not been in a fit state to consent. \u201cI can\u2019t deny it was rape,\u201d he said. The court heard that Mathieu D\u2019s stepfather had been violent. Mathieu D told investigators he was inspired by Buddhism and \u201cthe balance of karmas\u201d. Andy R, 37 An unemployed agricultural labourer and married father of two, Andy R has two domestic violence convictions and is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at her home on New Year\u2019s Eve 2018. He said he did not intend to rape Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, telling the court: \u201cAs the husband had given me permission, in my mind she agreed to it.\u201d Andy R arrived at the Pelicots\u2019 home an hour after first making contact online with Dominique Pelicot on New Year\u2019s Eve. He said he had \u201cnothing else to do\u201d that night because his brothers hadn\u2019t invited him to their New Year\u2019s Eve party. He said he had thought it was a sexual \u201cgame\u201d between the Pelicots. The court heard he had been addicted to alcohol since he was 13 or 14, and was a regular user of cocaine. Simone M, 42 A builder, former soldier and father of five, Simone M lived on the next street to the Pelicots in the village of Mazan. He is the only alleged rapist whom Gis\u00e8le Pelicot recognised when she was shown video evidence by police. She told the court he had come into their living room once to discuss cycling with her husband. \u201cI saw him now and then in the bakery; I would say hello. I never thought he\u2019d come and rape me,\u201d she said. The former mountain infantryman made contact with Dominique Pelicot in the online chatroom before realising they lived less than 200 metres apart. Simone M lived opposite the tennis club where Dominique Pelicot played. \u201cThings were going badly with my ex-wife, I was looking for love, an encounter to calm myself,\u201d Simone M told the court. Dominique Pelicot suggested Simone M first come to the house during the day \u201cto see how beautiful my wife is\u201d, adding: \u201cIf she asks, say you\u2019ve come to discuss my bike.\u201d Simone M is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on the night of 14 November 2018. He denies rape. He said he thought Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was only pretending to be asleep and would wake up. \u201cI\u2019m not a rapist,\u201d he told the court. His ex-wife told the court he had once threatened her with an axe. Simone M is from New Caledonia, where he grew up. As a teenager he was abused and raped by a man his parents had sent him to live with as a labourer. The court heard he had a complex about his penis size and needed constant reassurance. He had debts and periods of alcoholism. He has a 15-month-old daughter with his current partner, who told the court she stands by him. Thierry Po, 61 A refrigeration specialist and father of three from Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne in southern France, Thierry Po is also charged with possession of hundreds of child abuse images found on a USB stick after his arrest for the alleged rape of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. He admits those charges but denies raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on 21 August 2020. He said hadn\u2019t seen anything abnormal about the night he went to the Pelicots\u2019 home, believing he was meeting a couple. \u201cI always thought Mrs Pelicot would wake up,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t cold, she wasn\u2019t dead, her skin was soft.\u201d He said he had not sought Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s consent because he had lots of experience of encounters with couples when it was mostly the man who gave consent for the woman. He said he had had three \u201cmajor\u201d previous experiences where a husband had invited him to have sex with a wife and \u201cshe\u2019ll be asleep, she doesn\u2019t want to know, we\u2019ll film it\u201d. In one case, the woman had woken up. In two cases, he had left without seeing the women\u2019s faces. He said he couldn\u2019t tell if those women had been asleep or not. He told the court: \u201cAfter I leave prison, I\u2019d like to create an association to get men like me to understand that consent is important. I\u2019d go to swingers\u2019 clubs and say: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to get consent!\u201d J\u00e9r\u00f4me V, 46 The former grocery store worker and father of three is one of the few accused men who admit the charges of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot with the knowledge that she was drugged. He told the expert psychiatrist in the case that he was aware she had not consented. He allegedly went to the Pelicots\u2019 home six times between March and June 2020 to rape her during the first Covid lockdown in France. A volunteer in the fire service, he lived 30 minutes\u2019 drive away. He told the court: \u201cI didn\u2019t keep going back because rape mode was my thing, but because I couldn\u2019t control my sexuality.\u201d He said he was at first attracted by the idea of having an inert body at his disposal and being free to act however he wanted. He said his life was defined by sexual urges, and he was regularly unfaithful to partners because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t meet my demands\u201d and he tried extreme practices to break the \u201cmonotony\u201d. He said he paid \u201cless and less\u201d attention to his partners. J\u00e9r\u00f4me V said he was addicted to sex and that Pelicot took advantage of that. In court, looking over at Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, he said he was ashamed \u201cto have done bad to someone who seems so pure\u201d. At his home, a list of 89 names of sexual partners were found. \u201cI needed to count my conquests,\u201d he said. His current partner told the court she stood by him and visited him regularly in prison. He said he was never supported or protected by his parents. He was bullied at school and once forcibly stripped in public by other pupils at high school. Thierry Pa, 54 A former builder who turned to alcohol when his 18-year-old son died in a road collision, Thierry Pa was an inpatient on a psychiatric ward after suffering from depression when investigators identified him as allegedly raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot several months earlier in 2020. He had separated from his wife a few weeks before his alleged rape of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in July 2020 and had left his family home, saying he was unable to bear the photographs and memories of his son. He said he had contacted Dominique Pelicot online for an encounter with a couple. He denied rape, saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t set out from my house saying: \u2018I\u2019m going to rape someone.\u2019\u201d He said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand how she didn\u2019t feel anything, didn\u2019t realise.\u201d He said he thought Pelicot may have drugged him, and that he was manipulated and brainwashed by Pelicot. His ex-wife told the court the alleged rape was out of character. She said she would like to get back together with him. The court heard that Thierry Pa\u2019s mother was an alcoholic and his father was often absent. Adrien L, 34 Adrien L, a former building site manager from Carpentras, was convicted last year of the rapes of three former partners in a different trial and is serving a 14-year jail sentence. He denied raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in March 2014. He said he had thought he was taking part in a game and did not think she was drugged. Aged 23 at the time of the alleged rape of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, he is one of the youngest men on trial. He was educated at private school before joining his father\u2019s successful building business, and was described as coming from a higher-income background than many of the other men accused. He told the court that when he was 21 he discovered after a paternity test that he was not the biological father of the three-year-old girl he was raising with his girlfriend. He said from that point onwards, \u201cI had a hatred towards women\u201d. The night he was alleged to have raped Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, his new girlfriend was nine months pregnant and gave birth 10 days later. He admitted to court experts that he had mistreated his pregnant girlfriend and called her a whore. The court heard that he was sexually abused by a cousin when he was 10. Jean T, 52 A former roofer born on the French Indian Ocean island of R\u00e9union, Jean T was in a nine-year relationship when he drove two-and-a-half hours from Lyon to allegedly rape Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her bed on the night of 21 September 2018. He had made contact with Dominique Pelicot in the chatroom, where he used the name \u201cBill\u201d. He told the court: \u201cI am not a rapist\u201d. He said he thought Dominique Pelicot had drugged him. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything,\u201d he said. In court, he recalled many details of the evening, including the house, the rules of undressing in the kitchen and seeing Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on the bed. But he told the court he had no memory of the actual moment of his alleged rape of Pelicot, and recalled only getting into his car afterwards when he drove home. Judges observed that he had not appeared drugged in seven videos, in which he was active and gave a thumbs up sign. He was asked why, if he feared he had been drugged, he did not report this to police. He said at the time he had thought: \u201cIt was a bad encounter, forget about it.\u201d The court heard he had regularly sought encounters with couples for more than a decade and had paid sex workers but \u201cit felt dirty\u201d. Redouan E, 55 A former anaesthesia nurse in hospital operating theatres in Morocco, Redouan E lived in Avignon, where he worked as a community nurse. He was married for the second time and in the process of adopting a young girl from Morocco. He was disappointed that the adoption process was stopped after he was arrested for allegedly raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at her home on a Saturday night in June 2019. Redouan E told the court: \u201cI plead not guilty.\u201d He denied rape, saying he was the \u201cvictim of a trick\u201d and had been too \u201cterrified\u201d of Dominique Pelicot to say no. Confronted with video evidence of several alleged rapes of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, he said: \u201cI was terrified, but you can\u2019t see it.\u201d He said he did not leave because he feared that would ruin Pelicot\u2019s Saturday night. He said he had not known Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was sedated. Asked in court, how, as a trained aneasthesia nurse, he had not seen that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was unconscious, he said he thought she was pretending to be dead \u201cbut never that she\u2019d been drugged\u201d, and he believed he saw her move. Patrick A, 60 A former factory worker and video-club owner from the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Patrick A admitted the charge of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot but said he had taken part reluctantly because he was gay and had wanted an encounter with Dominique Pelicot, not his wife. Patrick A met Dominique Pelicot in the online chatroom and they messaged on Skype, where Pelicot told him Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was a \u201cprudish bitch who didn\u2019t want threesomes\u201d and said: \u201cI\u2019m looking for a pervert accomplice to abuse my wife, she takes sleeping pills and I take advantage.\u201d Patrick A had replied: \u201cOK.\u201d He told the court he had wanted so much to have a gay encounter with Dominique Pelicot that he was blinded by it and brainwashed. He said he raped Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \u201creluctantly\u201d to \u201cplease\u201d Dominique Pelicot. He questioned whether he may have been drugged. \u201cYou are homosexual but you have committed a heterosexual rape, which you admit,\u201d said Antoine Camus, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s lawyer. \u201cIn this trial we have already heard of rapes committed \u2018by accident\u2019, your specificity is to plead rape committed \u2018reluctantly\u2019.\u201d Patrick A apologised in court. He told the court he had known he was gay from his teenage years but sought to hide it from his homophobic parents. He married a woman, had two children and after divorcing at 43 regularly met men for sex in saunas and backrooms of sex-shops in the Avignon region, and truck-drivers in motorway laybys. Didier S, 68 A former long-distance lorry driver and divorced father of two, Didier S said he went to Dominique Pelicot\u2019s house \u201cexclusively for a homosexual encounter\u201d with him. He denied the charge of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on 30 January 2019. He said he had thought she was pretending to be asleep. In court, he said he had had no intention to rape Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and was simply following her husband\u2019s instructions. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you should be angry with, it\u2019s your husband,\u201d he told Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in court, trying to catch her eye. She turned away. He lived a 20-minute drive away, had logged on to the chatroom at 8pm one night, and two hours later went to the Pelicots\u2019 home. Five years earlier he underwent bladder and prostate surgery for cancer and had begun meeting men. The court heard he was raped when he was 16. Karim S, 40 A computer expert with two university degrees, Karim S denied raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on 27 June 2020. He is also charged with possessing child abuse imagery found on his computer during the investigation. He denied those charges, saying he downloaded the images \u201cinadvertently\u201d. He told the court of the night he went to the Pelicots\u2019 home: \u201cI did not go there with the aim of committing a crime and I had absolutely no idea that Mrs Pelicot was not consenting.\u201d Messages between him and Pelicot showed them discussing Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in crude terms, referring to her not being aware of what was going on. Karim S had been told that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot would be \u201casleep from alcohol and a sleeping tablet\u201d but he said he had thought it was a game. Dominique Pelicot, who told Karim he was a doctor, invited him back in August. Karim said he feigned food poisoning as an excuse because the June encounter had been \u201ctoo bizarre for me\u201d. He grew up in Marseille and had moved to a picturesque village half an hour\u2019s drive from Mazan just before the Covid lockdowns of 2020. Vincent C, 42 Vincent C, a carpenter, was convicted of domestic violence against his ex-partner in 2021 and given a six-month suspended sentence. The court heard he had had an alcohol addiction since he was a teenager. He is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at her home on two occasions in October 2019 and January 2020. He denies rape. He admitted a sexual encounter but said he had had no intention of committing rape. He said he had thought Gis\u00e8le Pelicot would wake up. He met Dominique Pelicot in the chatroom after a postcode search on the site to find people nearby. He tended to log on after his village bistro closed on a Saturday night. \u201cI was looking for sex,\u201d he said, adding that he had not put much thought into it. He said he found the situation in the Pelicots\u2019 bedroom \u201cbizarre\u201d but trusted the fact that he was \u201cat a couple\u2019s home, invited by the husband\u201d. He said he felt no pleasure himself, but went back a second time because Dominique Pelicot had told him that he and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had \u201cenjoyed it\u201d. Pelicot said Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had watched a video of his first visit and \u201cliked it\u201d, which for him, \u201cclosed the door on any doubt\u201d, he said. He said he felt he had \u201csatisfied\u201d the Pelicots more than himself. During his testimony, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot got up and briefly left the courtroom, appearing exasperated. Jean-Marc L, 74 Describing himself as a former \u201cinternational truck-driver between Paris and Baghdad\u201d, the divorced grandfather is the oldest of the accused men. He denied raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in May 2017. He said he had always thought that rape was \u201csomething violent \u2026 done by a madman, a brutal thing\u201d, but that this had instead been a \u201csexual game\u201d. He told the court he had only \u201cobeyed orders\u201d from Dominique Pelicot. He said: \u201cShe was going to wake up because it was a game.\u201d It was only after he left the house that he thought about whether Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had consented. He didn\u2019t alert the police. \u201cI should have done but it didn\u2019t cross my mind.\u201d He said Dominique Pelicot, whom he had met beforehand in a supermarket car park, had told him he wanted to \u201cpunish\u201d his wife for having had an affair in the past. He said Pelicot asked him to come back another time \u201cwith a friend\u201d, which he didn\u2019t do, after mentioning it to another truck driver who said it wasn\u2019t normal. Jean-Marc L said he had often paid sex workers in Spain. \u201cWhat truck driver hasn\u2019t been to prostitutes?\u201d he said in court. Dominique D, 45 Dominique D, a lorry driver and former soldier, said he was contacted via the online chatroom in February 2015 by Dominique Pelicot, who said he was looking for a man as a \u201cgift\u201d for his wife \u201cfor Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d. Dominique D is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on six different occasions. Police found video evidence of five visits to the Pelicots\u2019 house, but he told them of one further visit. He denied rape, saying he had not intended to rape anyone. He told the court: \u201cI didn\u2019t wake up one morning and say to myself hey, today I\u2019m going to go to a couple\u2019s house and commit a crime.\u201d He said that before going to the Pelicots\u2019 home for the first time in 2015, he had asked to see Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and was sent a video of her taken without her knowledge as she left the shower. He also briefly visited the home pretending to be an electrician and saw Gis\u00e8le Pelicot reading on the sofa. He said he felt he had enough guarantees from Dominique Pelicot, adding \u201cI just forgot one big guarantee \u2013 Madame\u2019s consent.\u201d He is the youngest of 16 children and was placed in care at the age of six months. Mohamed R, 70 Mohamed R, a former discotheque worker from La Rochelle who in 1999 was sentenced to five years in prison for raping his 17-year-old daughter, is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in May 2019 at the holiday cottage of the Pelicots\u2019 daughter, Caroline, on the island of \u00cele-de-R\u00e9 in the west of France. Mohamed R denied raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. He told the court: \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine for a fraction of a second that Dominique Pelicot did that without his wife knowing.\u201d He had been in contact with Dominique Pelicot via the online chatroom. Dominique Pelicot was asked in court why he had drugged and raped Gis\u00e8le Pelicot not just at the couple\u2019s own home but at their daughter\u2019s holiday home, where the Pelicots often went with their grandchildren. The couple\u2019s daughter and grandchildren were not at the cottage at the time. Pelicot said: \u201cThere was no symbolism, it could have happened anywhere.\u201d Ahmed T, 54 Ahmed T, a plumber and former champion boxer married for more than 30 years with three children, is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at the couple\u2019s home in June 2019. He denied rape and told the court: \u201cI\u2019m not a rapist, but if I had wanted to rape I wouldn\u2019t have chosen a 57-year-old woman, I would have chosen a pretty one.\u201d He was in contact with Dominique Pelicot on a chatroom, saying that at the time he was having less sex with his wife and he \u201cdid not want a mistress\u201d but thought \u201cwhy not\u201d have an encounter with a couple. He said Dominique Pelicot had referred to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot as \u201cla bourgeoise\u201d, saying she was away a lot in Paris and home at weekends. He said he had thought Gis\u00e8le Pelicot must have been shy, and that he had trusted her husband. Ahmed T said he travelled to the couple\u2019s home by car after his own wife had gone to bed. Redouane A, 40 Redouane A, an unemployed, separated father of four who has convictions for domestic violence, burglary and death threats and has served time in prison, went to the Pelicots\u2019 home twice in 2019. He denied rape. He said he had asked Dominique Pelicot if it was normal that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was snoring and had been told: \u201cYes, we like doing it like that.\u201d He described the Pelicots\u2019 home as \u201ca beautiful house in Provence\u201d with a \u201cwell-kept garden\u201d. He said he grew up on a housing estate, began smoking cannabis at 10 and was the victim of sexual abuse at this age, by an old man he met in the park who took him to his van. He left school at 16. The question was raised in court of a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, with one psychiatrist saying he instead had a personality disorder. Mahdi D, 36 Mahdi D, a transport worker and father of one from Avignon, is accused of going to the Pelicots\u2019 home once in October 2018. He denied rape. He placed the responsibility on Dominique Pelicot, who he said had presented himself online as part of a couple who wanted to meet single men. Mahdi D said of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot: \u201cOne can\u2019t imagine what she has been through, she has been destroyed and I have thoughts not only for that poor woman but her whole entourage and family.\u201d He said it was \u201cterrible\u201d for him to find himself caught up in something like this. Cyril B, 47 Cyril B, a single lorry driver who described himself as a daily consumer of cannabis, is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at her home in November 2018.

He did not say the word rape, telling the court \u201cI can\u2019t say that it\u2019s rape\u201d, arguing that Dominique Pelicot had led him to believe that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was playing a role in a game and \u201cwould pretend to be asleep\u201d. The court heard he grew up in children\u2019s homes and foster families and later suffered from alcohol addiction as an adult. Quentin H, 34 A prison warden who had previously worked as a junior member of the motorway police, Quentin H is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her bed in November 2019. He said he had sold drugs on the website where Dominique Pelicot sought men to abuse his wife, and said Dominique Pelicot had told him he had a female \u201cfriend\u201d who \u201chad a fantasy about playing the sleeping woman\u201d. In his car afterwards, Quentin H said, he had realised \u201csomething wasn\u2019t right\u201d; Gis\u00e8le Pelicot hadn\u2019t been moving. Asked why he did not call the police then and there, he said: \u201cI was ashamed, I wanted to get it out of my head.\u201d Quentin H, who lived with a girlfriend at the time, worked as a warden in the prison outside Avignon where Dominique Pelicot was held after his arrest. When he read newspaper reports of the detention he said he knew that sooner or later \u201cpolice would come knocking at my door\u201d. He has admitted the charge of rape. Quentin H said he had \u201cwanted for nothing\u201d during his childhood in northern France with parents who worked in the public sector but that gambling on sports betting sites had caused him financial difficulties later in life. He had recently begun retraining as a member of an ambulance team. A court psychologist said he had a \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d; another expert psychiatrist disagreed. Gr\u00e9gory S, 31 A painter and decorator with seven convictions ranging from possession of drugs to driving offences, Gr\u00e9gory S is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in June 2017 when she had been drugged unconscious. He has denied the charges. He said he had believed Dominique Pelicot\u2019s assertion that his then wife liked to \u201cmake love while drunk\u201d. Gr\u00e9gory S told the court that when he arrived in the Pelicots\u2019 bedroom, he had said: \u201cGiven the state she\u2019s in, it\u2019s not really worth it.\u201d But Dominique Pelicot had told him to go ahead. Testifying in court, Gr\u00e9gory S said what he did was not rape. Looking over at Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, he said: \u201cYour husband manipulated me and I know he manipulated quite a few people here.\u201d She looked away. Gr\u00e9gory S said that at the time he was aged 24, smoking between 10 and 15 joints a day and was struggling with the loss of his baby daughter at seven months\u2019 pregnancy due to a heart defect. He said he had been afraid of Dominique Pelicot, despite video evidence showing him smiling. The court heard that Gr\u00e9gory S\u2019s father had been in prison when he was a small boy, a fact his parents tried to hide by lying and saying the building in which he visited him was a hospital, not a prison. When Gr\u00e9gory S was jailed on remand in the Pelicot case, he did the same for his stepson of the same age \u2013 telling him the prison was a building site and he was working there as a painter.

He said he had drunk a bottle of whisky that day. \u201cI did not leave my house with the intention to commit a rape,\u201d he said. Towards the end he had noticed there was a \u201cbizarre atmosphere\u201d in the room and he had felt afraid, he said. He did not call the police. Florian R\u2019s mother, a cleaner, told the court that when she heard the charges against her son: \u201cI wondered, did I get something wrong in the way he was raised? I know what he did is very serious. I don\u2019t hide that.\u201d Florian R told the court he did not know his biological father. Jean-Luc L, 46 A mirror maker and father of four, Jean-Luc L has admitted raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her bedroom on two occasions in 2018, knowing she had been drugged unconscious. At first he thought Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s husband had consented on her behalf and that therefore \u201cit wasn\u2019t against the law\u201d, he said. He told a psychologist after his arrest that he had thought the definition of rape was instead something that \u201chappens in the street\u201d in the style of \u201cif you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll hit you\u201d. Jean-Luc L\u2019s wife, who is Vietnamese, told the court her mother was ill at the time and she had refused sex. She said: \u201cI think because I refused him all the time, as a man, he had to look elsewhere.\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, through her lawyer, said Jean-Luc L\u2019s wife was not responsible for her husband\u2019s actions. \u201cThere is never an obligation to have sexual relations with your husband. Do you understand that?\u201d the lawyer said. The court heard that Dominique Pelicot had suggested drugging Jean-Luc L\u2019s wife, so they could both rape her. \u201cI told him I\u2019d think about it just to please him, but I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Jean-Luc L. \u201cSex wasn\u2019t really her thing.\u201d The court heard Jean-Luc L had fled Vietnam by boat with his mother as a child and had lived in refugee camps before coming to France. Patrice N, 55 An electrician from Carpentras, Patrice N has described himself as a \u201cjovial\u201d guy who once trained youth football teams. He has denied rape, saying: \u201cTo my mind, it was a game.\u201d Despite video evidence in court showing Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in an unconscious state, snoring loudly, Patrice N claimed he had not noticed that she was sedated when he went to the couple\u2019s home in February 2020. He said he told Dominique Pelicot at the end of the visit: \u201cYour wife looks like she\u2019s really asleep.\u201d Dominique Pelicot replied that he gave his wife \u201cpills\u201d and would also take her to motorway laybys and \u201chand her to men\u201d. Patrice N said he called Dominique Pelicot \u201csick\u201d and then left. Asked why he did not contact the police, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to waste my time at the police station. I\u2019m a humble neighbourhood electrician \u2026 who would have believed me?\u201d A care worker who became Patrice N\u2019s girlfriend 16 months ago despite knowing he was charged with rape in the Pelicot case, told the court: \u201cHe treats me like a princess.\u201d Abdelali D, 47 A former canteen worker who has had a stroke since his arrest, Abdelali D has admitted rape, saying he went to the Pelicots\u2019 home twice and raped Gis\u00e8le Pelicot when she was in a comatose state. He said Dominique Pelicot told him \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t wake up\u201d. The first time, one January night in 2018, he had asked his then girlfriend to drive him to the Pelicots\u2019 village and wait an hour for him in the car. She told the court she had driven him because she was worried about him driving drunk. She thought he was meeting a couple for a sexual encounter, but had not sought details. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said. She described Abdelali D as someone who \u201cdrank morning, noon and night\u201d. Romain V, 63 The former forklift truck-driver is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on six occasions over six months between 2019 and 2020 while she was unconscious on her bed. He denied rape, saying \u201cher husband [Dominique Pelicot] invited me in\u201d and that a husband\u2019s consent was enough. He denied knowing she was drugged, despite video evidence showing him smiling as she snored loudly. He said he first went to the Pelicots\u2019 home because: \u201cI felt lonely. Christmas was approaching and I was going to be on my own again. I was looking for friendship.\u201d Romain V told the court he had known he was HIV positive at the time of the alleged rapes and had not worn a condom. His lawyer said that because he had been on HIV treatment since his diagnosis in 2004 he had an undetectable viral load, which was regularly tested, and could not transmit the virus. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t contagious,\u201d he said. The court heard that Romain V had been subjected to such extreme physical violence and abuse by his parents that it amounted to \u201ctorture\u201d. He was raped by several men as a child, including a priest. C\u00e9dric G, 50 A software technician who used to run a record shop in Avignon, C\u00e9dric G is accused of raping Pelicot in her home in October 2017 in the knowledge that she had been drugged unconscious. He is also accused of possessing child abuse imagery. He has admitted both charges. The court heard that C\u00e9dric G had also procured from Dominique Pelicot an amount of sedatives with the aim of drugging his own girlfriend at the time. He said he did not go through with it. He had written a message to Dominique Pelicot about his girlfriend saying: \u201cMy dream is her getting raped on the way home from work.\u201d He had shown Pelicot where his girlfriend lived. C\u00e9dric G said he did not use the sedatives but that having them in his possession \u201cgave a feeling of power\u201d. He added: \u201cIt flatters your ego. I had the fantasy but I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d He said that when he went to the Pelicots\u2019 home, \u201cmy sexuality was already twisted \u2026 the deviance was already there.\u201d Turning to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in court, he said: \u201cI was your rapist. I was your torturer.\u201d The court heard that aged 13, he was raped by an uncle. Hassan O, 30 Born in Marseille, Hassan O is being tried in absentia for raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in her bedroom in March 2018. After he left France, an international warrant for his arrest was issued. The court heard that Hassan O had been handed 13 convictions between 2010 and 2017 in connection with theft, violence, drugs and possession of weapons. Dominique Pelicot told the court he remembered Hassan O coming to the Pelicots\u2019 home. Cendric V, 44 A former soldier in the French foreign legion who later became a restaurant manager in Corsica, Cendric V was unemployed when he is alleged to have gone to the Pelicots\u2019 home to rape Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on two occasions in 2016 and 2018. He had previously denied rape, but in court he changed his position and said that it was not possible to deny \u201cthe facts\u201d of what had happened. He said: \u201cI have always said that I did not intend to rape anyone.\u201d He told the court he felt tricked by Dominique Pelicot, and had believed he was going to have an encounter with a consenting couple with \u201cfantasies\u201d. He said that, at the time, he was under the impression that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was consenting, but in court recognised she had not been in a state to consent. When questioned he said: \u201cGiven this case, I can consider that I raped, yes.\u201d He apologised in court and said: \u201cToday I see consent differently.\u201d Ludovick B, 39 The warehouse worker is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot one night between Christmas and New Year 2019 when the Pelicots were on holiday at their daughter\u2019s home in the Paris area. He recognised that a sexual encounter had taken place, but told the court he had had no intention to rape. \u201cWhat I did was not premeditated,\u201d he said. He told the court he was a regular cannabis user, saying he had been afraid of Dominique Pelicot\u2019s reaction if he left the bedroom. He said he was a \u201ccollateral victim\u201d of Dominique Pelicot, who he said had used him to enact his fantasy. After December 2019, Ludovick B, who has one child, sent Dominique Pelicot a message about potentially meeting up again if he was in the area, and a new year message the following year. The court heard that, as a child, Ludovick B was a victim of a notorious sex offender, Fabrice Motch, a fire service captain convicted for drugging and raping boys who were young volunteers. Motch, who was sentenced to 15 years for those offences, is serving a life sentence for murder. Omar D, 36 A married mechanic who worked cleaning buses in Avignon, Omar D is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at her home in November 2017 after making contact with Dominique Pelicot on a chatroom hours earlier. He denied the charge of rape. He said Dominique Pelicot had told him what to do and he had not asked questions. Asked by a judge if he had been concerned that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot appeared unconscious and did not react, he said: \u201cIt was my first threesome and I didn\u2019t know how it worked.\u201d He said he did not remember if he had looked at Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s face. Asked by Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s lawyer if he accepted that what he did was rape, he said \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Born in Morocco, Omar D arrived in France at the age of two. Paul G, 31 Paul G, who told the court he would like to train as a pastor, is accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at her home one lunchtime in 2016 after Dominique Pelicot had drugged her at breakfast. Paul G admitted the charge of rape. \u201cI raped, I accept it, I raped,\u201d he told the court. He said that, at the time, he had not seen it as rape, because he was young [aged 23 at the time] and wanted to \u201chave fun\u201d without much thought. He said that after he was shown video evidence by police, he realised it was rape. He apologised to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, telling the court: \u201cWe are not monsters; we are men like any others.\u201d Born in Guinea to parents who worked as a midwife and a pastor, Paul G arrived in France as an unaccompanied minor aged 16, having travelled by boat to Europe. A father of one, he had previous convictions in France for theft and forgery, as well as domestic violence. Saifeddine G, 37 The long-distance lorry driver was married with three children when he was accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at her home in November 2019. He said he knew the village of Mazan well because he once worked building swimming pools there. Saifeddine G admitted what he called \u201cattempted rape\u201d, but denied a rape took place. He told the court: \u201cI recognise that I did not get Madame Pelicot\u2019s consent. I am totally conscious of the seriousness of the facts \u2026 But for me, it\u2019s an attempted rape. That is not to minimise it. I\u2019m here for Madame Pelicot to know the truth.\u201d The court heard he grew up in Tunisia and arrived in France aged 15. He said he had an \u201caddiction to social networks and the internet\u201d and would go on websites for meeting partners, simply out of \u201cboredom.\u201d",

Hungary\u2019s prime minister is leading a delegation of his senior ministers to meet Georgia\u2019s prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, in a two-day visit that is likely to anger fellow EU leaders at a time when Hungary holds the rotating EU presidency. In a striking rebuke, ministers from 13 EU countries criticised Orb\u00e1n\u2019s visit and the \u201cviolations of electoral integrity\u201d in Georgia. \u201cWe criticise Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n\u2019s premature visit to Georgia,\u201d said the statement, signed by France, Germany and Poland and 10 other member states. \u201cHe does not speak on behalf of the EU.\u201d Orb\u00e1n \u201cdoes not represent the European Union\u201d on his visit, the bloc\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, told Spanish public radio on Monday. \u201cThe union\u2019s rotating president has no authority in foreign policy,\u201d he added.

      "bodyText": "Time to recap\u2026 German carmaker Volkswagen is planning to shut at least three factories in its home country, lay off thousands of workers and cut pay by 10%, according to the company\u2019s union. The deeper-than-expected cuts come as the company faces weak sales and slow expansion in the electric vehicle (EV) sector amid tough competition from Chinese manufacturers. \u201cThe board wants to close at least three factories in Germany,\u201d the works council chief, Daniela Cavallo, told employees at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg. Its remaining manufacturing sites will reduce capacity, she said, citing information provided by management. Boeing has announced plans for $19bn of share sales, to shore up its finances amid a costly worker strike and an ongoing crisis about the safety of its aeroplanes. The oil price has tumbled, on relief that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran last weekend did not hit oil production or nuclear facilities. Brent crude is now down 5.3% today at $72.06 per barrel. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says: \u201cWTI oil prices dropped as markets opened after the weekend, hitting their lowest level in over three weeks. This decline comes as tensions in the Middle East appear to ease.\u201d \u201cConcerns of an all-out war between Israel and Iran had loomed over the region for the past month, with markets bracing for Israel\u2019s potential retaliation following Iran\u2019s missile strike on October 1.\u201d \u201cHowever, the response was measured, and for now, the worst fears have subsided. With reduced geopolitical risks to supply, traders have shifted their focus back to market fundamentals, which currently include a demand slowdown\u2014especially from China, the world\u2019s top crude importer\u2014and an upcoming OPEC+ production increase set for December. In this context, the risk to oil prices appears skewed to the downside.\u201d The budget continues to dominate the economy, with just two days to wait for Rachel Reeves\u2019s fiscal statement. New data shows that the UK\u2019s Alternative Investment Market (Aim) has shrunk to its smallest size in 23 years as business owners and investors anticipate an abolition of inheritance tax relief. Pubs and restaurants are warning of closures and a tough Christmas ahead if Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget this week raises taxes and ends a Covid-era relief on business rates. There are also fears that Reeves could cut funding for nuclear sites including Sellafield. While bosses are cross that they are losing staff working time because of waits for healthcare or caring duties due to underfunded public service Meanwhile, the government has announced that the budget will include \u00a3240m of funding to help people currently economically inactive to get into work. While Oxfam has reported that the high carbon emissions of the world\u2019s richest 1% are worsening hunger, poverty and excess deaths. Volkswagen\u2019s brand chief Thomas Schaefer has warned that the company simply isn\u2019t productive enough, especially with costs increasing. Schaefer explained (via Reuters): \u201cWe are not earning enough money with our cars currently. At the same time, our costs for energy, materials and personnel have continued to rise. This calculation cannot work in the long term. \u201cSo we have to get to the root of the problem: we are not productive enough at our German sites and our factory costs are currently 25-50% higher than we had planned. This means that individual German plants are twice as expensive as the competition. \u201cIn addition, we at Volkswagen are still processing many tasks internally that the competition has already outsourced more cost effectively. This means that we cannot continue as before. We must quickly find a joint and sustainable solution for the future of our company.\u201d Shares in Volkswagen have dropped by over 1% today, after its union said the company plans to shut at least three German plants, axe tens of thousands of jobs and slash pay by 10%. The City of London is in broad agreement that the Bank of England will cut interest rates next week, but there\u2019s less certainty about December\u2019s meeting. Reuters has polled 72 economists, and each one predicted the BoE will cut rates by a quarter of one percentage point a week on Thursday, to 4.75%. It feels like a safe call, as inflation has now fallen below the Bank\u2019s target, and BoE governor Andrew Bailey told the Guardian the Bank could become \u201ca bit more activist\u201d in its approach to cutting interest rates, if inflation stayed low. Looking beyond the November meeting, around two-thirds of economists predicted the BoE would leave rates on hold in December., while the remainder expect a second quarter-point cut. Retail sales volumes fell at a modest pace in October, after slight growth last month, according to the latest CBI Distributive Trades Survey. Worryingly, retailers reported that sales were weak for the time of year. The survey found that some retailers see consumers holding back on their spending due to uncertainty surrounding the budget on Wednesday. UK green power supplier Good Energy have received a possible takeover offer from Dubai-based Esyasoft Holding. Good Energy says it is evaluating the \u201cunsolicited indicative, non-binding proposal\u201d. Its shares have jumped by 25% so far today, raising its market value from \u00a353m to \u00a367m. News of Esyasoft\u2019s approach came as Good Energy announced its own deal; it has bought solar power installation company Empower for up to \u00a38m. An official report into UK parcel delivery firms has found that Evri and Yodel are the worst parcel firms at helping their customers. Ofcom, the UK\u2019s communication regulator, found that Evri, once again, has the lowest levels of satisfaction, with just 32% of customers satisfied with its service, and 39% unhappy. UPDATE: Evri tells us: \u201c2024 has been a year of significant investment and listening to our customers to improve our service. Our ambition is that every customer\u2019s experience with Evri is a positive one. We recognise there remains more to do, but Ofcom found that we are making year-on-year improvements and our rising parcel volumes are proof that customers and retail clients are voting with their feet and trust us with their deliveries. Evri handles 730 million parcels a year with 99% successfully delivered on time \u2013 and is committed to instilling a culture where every parcel matters. We have invested \u00a332m to develop our customer service options and improve the customer experience at the doorstep. Earlier this month, Evri announced a range of doorstep delivery improvements for people living with a condition or impairment. We have also launched a major three-year partnership with disability equality charity, Scope, to work together to help disabled customers have a better parcel delivery experience.\u201d Yodel wasn\u2019t much better, registering a satisfaction score of 38%. At the top of the table, though, Amazon (56%) and DHL (55%) were the best performers, followed by FedEx (52%). Ofcom also reports that customers are slightly more satisfied with the process of contacting the parcel company to discuss an issue, after it strengthened regulations. The regulator adds: Parcel operators have made a number of improvements to complaints handling, including better information on their websites; improvements to phone lines and live chat; and introducing options for customers to request an email or call back. We expect further, sustained and continued improvement. We remain particularly concerned that disabled consumers and those with limiting conditions are still more likely to encounter difficulties with the delivery process (71%) compared to other people (63%). Another troubled company, Boeing, is also making news today. Boeing has announced it will issue 90 million new shares to bolster its balance sheet. At a current share price of $155, that would raise almost $14bn for the firm whose production is currently stymied by strikes by its workers. In addition, Boeing will issue $5bn of depositary shares, meaning it will raise a total of $19bn. Two weeks ago, Boeing said it planned to raise up to $25bn through a stock and debt offering. It has also lined up a $10bn credit agreement with a consortium of banks, to give it more access to liquidity. Last week, Boeing\u2019s staff rejected their latest pay offer, meaning the industrial action continues\u2026. Back in the UK, chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a \u00a3240m package to help people back into work. The cash injection will accelerate the rollout of local services to help people out of economic inactivity. Get Britain Working \u201ctrailblazers\u201d in local areas will bring together and streamline work, health, and skills support to disabled people and those who are long term sick, the Treasury says. Reeves says: Due to years of economic neglect, the benefits bill is ballooning. We will build a Britain where people who can work, will work, turning the page on the recent rise in economic inactivity and decline and towards a future where people have good jobs and our benefits bill is under control. Official data shows that more than 9.2 million people are economically inactive \u2013 neither working, nor looking for work \u2013 often because of illness, or caring responsibilities. My colleague Richard Partington wrote last weekend about the efforts to reduce inactivity in Barnsley, one of the areas with the highest rates of economic inactivity: A spokesperson for the German government has said that Berlin is aware of the difficulties at Volkswagen, and in close contact with the carmaker and its unions. The spokesperson told a news conference today: \u201cIt is well known that Volkswagen is in a difficult situation. There is also a constant dialogue with both the employer and employee sides at Volkswagen.\u201d Today\u2019s comments from VW\u2019s works council warning of factory closures, job reductions and pay cuts will escalate the conflict between the carmaker\u2019s workers and its management. Daniela Cavallo told workers that the two sides agreed about the problems facing VW, if not the solutions, saying: \u201cWe are not far apart when it comes to analysing the problems. But we are miles apart on the answers to them.\u201d Cavallo also told workers today that the Berlin government needs to urgently come up with a masterplan for German industry to ensure it does not \u201cgo down the drain\u201d. Here\u2019s AFP\u2019s take: Ailing auto giant Volkswagen plans to close at least three factories in Germany and cut \u201ctens of thousands of jobs\u201d at its namesake brand as part of a drastic cost-savings plan, workers\u2019 representatives said Monday. The plan laid out by management also includes downsizing remaining plants in the country and a proposed 10-percent pay cut for all VW brand employees, the company\u2019s powerful works council said in an update to staff, vowing to put up resistance. Daniella Cavallo also appeared to hint that the unions could call strike action over the closures. According to the Financial Times, she told workers: Chief executive Oliver Blume was \u201cplaying with the massive risk that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we will break off the talks and do what a workforce has to do when it fears for its existence\u201d. The German carmaker Volkswagen is planning to shut at least three factories in Germany, lay off thousands of workers and cut pay by 10%, the company\u2019s union has revealed. Daniella Cavallo, the head of Volkswagen\u2019s workers council, told workers at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg today that the company is planning even deeper cuts than expected. This would be the first closure of domestic plants in Volkswagen\u2019s 87-year history. Cavallo told staff that VW\u2019s management have a \u201cclear intention\u201d to cut tens of thousands of jobs, Reuters reports, to shrink German factories that remain open. Cavallo said: Management is absolutely serious about all this. This is not sabre-rattling in the collective bargaining round. This is the plan of Germany\u2019s largest industrial group to start the sell-off in its home country of Germany. At the start of September, Volkswagen told staff it was planning to close at least one larger vehicle manufacturing plant and one component factory in Germany. The company has been struggling to manage the transition away from fossil fuel cars to electric vehicles, where it is facing tough competition from Chinese manufacturers Shares in Georgian banks listed in London have dropped sharply, after the ruling, Russia-aligned Georgian Dream (GD) party won a contested election last weekend. Tbilisi-based TBC Bank\u2019s shares tumbled 10%, making it the biggest faller on the UK\u2019s FTSE 250 index, followed by Bank Of Georgia whose shares are down 7.5%. GD\u2019s victory is a blow to the country\u2019s aspirations to join the European Union, and there are accusations of intimidation and coercion of voters. The pro-western opposition are accusing GD of a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d, while the. country\u2019s pro-EU president, Salome Zourabichvili, has called for protests against the result this evening. The oil price is sinking lower, with Brent crude now down over 5% at $71.95 per barrel. That means oil has now dropped by $10/barrel over the last three weeks, and is now at a fresh four-week low. As flagged in the introduction, traders are optimistic that tensions in the Middle East may ease now that Israel has retaliated against Iran \u2013 without hitting its energy infrastructure. Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, senior market analyst at XS.com, says: Despite the tensions generated by this event, the impact was less severe than anticipated, immediately affecting the crude market. The Israeli attack, which avoided vital facilities such as nuclear and oil sites in Iran, significantly reduced the uncertainty that had reigned in the previous weeks. Despite Iran\u2019s threat to retaliate, the fact that the attack avoided critical facilities managed to moderate concerns about a possible significant escalation in the conflict. In recent months, oil prices have seen a considerable increase due to the growing tension between Israel and Iran, exacerbated by ongoing operations against factions like Hamas and Hezbollah. However, this episode seems to have reduced the likelihood of a larger-scale confrontation, at least in the short term. That remains to be seen, of course. Earlier today, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran will \u201cuse all available tools\u201d to respond to Israel\u2019s attack. Dutch medical devices maker Philips has been hit by a slowdown in demand from Chinese customers, forcing it to slash its sales forecast for this year. Philips reported that it saw a deterioration in demand in China in the last quarter, leading to flat group sales over the July-September period. Comparable orders fell by 2%, due to the decline in China. Roy Jakobs, CEO of Royal Philips, says: In the quarter, demand from hospitals and consumers in China further deteriorated, while we continue to see solid growth in other regions. We have adjusted our full-year sales outlook to reflect the continued impact from China. Philips now expects its comparable sales to grow by only 0.5% to 1.5% in 2024, down from a previous forecast of 3% to 5%. Shares in Philips have dropped by almost 17% in early trading. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are predicting that economic uncertainty in the UK should fall once Wednesday\u2019s budget has passed \u2013 unless the bond market reacts badly, of course! In a research note, they predict Rachel Reeves will steer a middle course, which could be good for shares in UK companies. Goldman told clients: Our economists expect the government to set a budget that finds a middle ground: it won\u2019t be so tight as to hinder growth and investment, nor so loose as to risk fiscal stability. If this is the case, it would be a support for our Buy British view and Long recommendation on FTSE 250. Elsewhere in the markets, the yen has tumbled to a three-month low after Japan\u2019s ruling coalition lost its majority in Sunday\u2019s general election. The yen fell as low as 153.87 to the US dollar, the weakest since late July, just before the Bank of Japan surprisingly raised interest rates. Japan\u2019s prime minister Shigeru Ishiba has said voters had issued a \u201csevere judgment\u201d against his Liberal Democratic party (LDP), which had its worst performance since 2009. The LDP and its longtime junior coalition partner Komeito failed to secure a majority in the lower house on a bruising night in which the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party (CDP) made significant gains, creating uncertainty over Japan\u2019s political future. French bonds are also weakening a little today, after credit rating agency Moody\u2019s lowered its rating on Paris\u2019s debt on Friday night. Moody\u2019s revised France\u2019s outlook down to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201cstable\u201d on Friday, citing mounting uncertainty that the country will be able to rein in its widening budget deficits. Moody\u2019s kept its rating on French debt at Aa2. Ironically, French bond prices are actually dropping by less than UK, US and German counterparts today. That has nudged the yield on 10-year French bonds up just 2.5 basis points, to 3.055%. Government bond prices are weakening this morning, pushing up the yield \u2013 or rate of return \u2013 on the debt. This has pushed the yield on UK 10-year bonds up to 4.27%, the highest since the start of July, a rise of about 6 basis points from 4.21% on Friday night. Yields rise when bond prices fall, so this can be a sign that investors are nervous about a country\u2019s debt and demanding a higher rate of return. Chancellor Rachel Reeves will be watching the bond market closely, as she prepares to announce an overhaul of the UK\u2019s budget rules which will give her the flexibility to borrow billions of pounds more. But the UK is not alone this morning. US 10-year bond yields have also risen today, by around 5 basis points to 4.28%, while German bonds are 4bps higher at 2.32%. There is concern this morning that the global economic recovery could be derailed by a lurch towards economic protectionism. The FT reports: Speaking on the sidelines of the IMF\u2019s annual meetings with the World Bank in Washington this week, officials expressed relief at signs that the global economy is on track for a soft landing, avoiding recession after the worst bout of inflation for a generation. However, they cautioned that mounting political risks in the US and elsewhere threatened the outlook. Shares in oil companies are dropping this morning, while airlines are benefiting from the prospect of cheaper fuel. BP is leading the fallers in London, down 2.2%, followed by Shell (-2%). But easyJet is the top riser on the FTSE 100, up 3.5%, followed by British Airway\u2019s parent company IAG (+1.9%). On Friday, the financial sector was rocked by a landmark car finance mis-selling case that could frce companies to pay billions of pounds in compensation to customers who borrowed the money for their new vehicle. This morning, Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 a major provider of motor finance \u2013 says it \u201cnotes\u201d the Court of Appeal decisions, and is \u201cassessing\u201d its potential impact. The Court of Appeal ruled in favour of three consumers who argued it was unlawful for lenders to have paid a commission to car dealers without the borrowers\u2019 knowledge. Shares in Lloyds fell over 7% on Friday after the ruling. This morning, they\u2019re down another 1% in early trading. A study by Oxfam into the emissions of the world\u2019s super-rich has found that the use of private jets and superyachts combined with high-polluting investments are accelerating climate breakdown and wreaking havoc on lives and economies around the world. The research found that the world\u2019s 50 richest billionaires took on average 184 private jet flights in a single year, spending 425 hours in the air and producing as much carbon as the average person would in 300 years. Their luxury yachts emitted as much carbon as the average person would in 860 years, according to the report. Chiara Liguori, Oxfam\u2019s senior climate justice policy adviser, said: Most of the super-rich are treating our planet like their personal playground, setting it ablaze for pleasure and profit. Ahead of the Labour government\u2019s first budget statement Oxfam is calling on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to increase taxes on \u201cclimate-polluting extreme wealth\u201d, starting with private jets and superyachts, to raise funds which could be used to tackle the climate crisis. The report found that if all people used private jets and superyachts as much as the group of ultra-wealthy individuals highlighted in the report, the world would breach its climate targets in two days rather than current estimates of four years if carbon emissions remain as they are today. However, it is their investments in fossil fuels which creates even greater damage, according to the report. It found that the investments made by this group created around 340 times more emissions than from their private jets and superyachts combined. Liguori says: The evidence is clear: the extreme emissions of the richest, from their luxury lifestyles and even more from their polluting investments, are fueling inequality, hunger and threatening lives. It\u2019s not just unfair that their reckless pollution is fueling the very crisis threatening our collective future \u2013 it\u2019s lethal. This report shows that fairer taxes on extreme wealth are crucial to accelerate climate action and fight inequality \u2013 starting with private jets and superyachts. It\u2019s clear these luxury toys aren\u2019t just symbols of excess; they\u2019re a direct threat to people and the planet. The study into both the luxury transport and polluting investments of billionaires, believed to be the first of its kind, found that the ultra-wealthy billionaires are responsible for causing economic losses of trillions of dollars as well as contributing to huge crop losses and millions of excess deaths because the impacts of the climate crisis are disproportionately felt by low-income countries and communities. The carbon emissions of the world\u2019s richest 1% have caused global economic output to drop by $2.9 trillion since 1990, according to Oxfam. It found that low- and lower-middle-income countries are expected to lose about 2.5% of their cumulative GDP between 1990 and 2050 due to the impact of the climate crisis while high-income countries are likely to accrue economic gains, it said. UK business confidence has dipped to a four-month low in October, a new survey has shown. Firms are less optimistic about their own trading prospects, and wider economic optimism, according to the latest Lloyds Business Barometer. The net balance of optimism towards the economy slipped three points to 35%, the lowest since March, Lloyds reports. In October, 55% of businesses felt more confident about the economy than three months ago (down from 57%), while 20% were less positive (up from 19%). Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Commercial Banking, said: Although overall business confidence dipped in October, it follows a sustained period of significant optimism, and business sentiment remains above historical levels. Encouragingly, many businesses remain confident in their own trading prospects, and the increase in hiring intentions suggests more employers want to grow their workforce. Businesses\u2019 broader economic outlook continues to reflect this rounded picture, and as they move into the final part of the year, they will look to manage these considerations effectively. This is the latest in a string of surveys showing a drop in consumer and business morale in recent weeks, as the government has signalled that this week\u2019s budget will be a tough affair. Prime minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to talk about \u201cthe harsh light of fiscal reality\u201d in a speech today, and the need to run towards \u201ctough decisions\u201d\u2026 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The oil price is sliding today, on relief that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran last weekend avoided striking energy facilities. Brent crude has sunk by over 4% this morning, dropping as low as $72 per barrel at one point, its weakest since 1st October \u2013 the day that Iran launched its large missile attack on Israel. Oil is selling off, despite initial fears that Israel\u2019s direct, retaliatory, airstrikes against military targets in Iran on Saturday morning could bring the Middle East closer to a full-scale regional war. The Israeli air force struck about 20 military bases across Iran, including missile and drone manufacturing sites and air defence systems. Traders, it seems, are relieved that Israel avoided hitting Iranian oil production facilities, which would have removed some supplies from the market. There are also hopes that Israel\u2019s latest strikes on Iran will mark the end of a months-long cycle of escalation, with US President Joe Biden telling reporters \u201cI hope this is the end.\u201d Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said yesterday that Tehran was not looking for a war but would respond \u201cappropriately\u201d to Israel\u2019s strikes. Pezeshkian told a cabinet meeting on Sunday: We do not seek war but we will defend the rights of our nation and country. The fact Iran hasn\u2019t vowed to respond is \u201ca clear sign of de-escalation \u2013 or at least not a re-escalation \u2013 of the tensions in the region\u201d, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, adding: As such, the geopolitical tensions that were keeping the oil bulls on alert near the $70 per barrel level has gone up in smoke.

When Buehler visited the country, it was impractical to photograph the empty beds of those still missing because an active war crimes investigation is under way.</p> <p>But he was able to meet eight children who escaped from Russian-occupied areas \u2013 some taking journeys that lasted a week \u2013 to be reunited with parents or guardians. Children were brought back thanks to the efforts of the <a href=\"https://www.bringkidsback.org.ua/\">Bring Kids Back UA</a>, an initiative of the president of Ukraine, which now works on all of the children\u2019s returns and their further reintegration into Ukrainian society. They now live with their families outside Kyiv in the Hope and Healing Center of Save Ukraine, awaiting more permanent housing, or in Hansen Village, a new charitable housing development where they may stay rent-free for five years.</p> <p>Buehler observed: \u201cSome of the children are still traumatised and want to run to the shelter when they hear the air raid sirens.\u201d</p> <p>Among them was Rostislav, 17, who was held captive and tortured by Russian forces but refused to renounce his Ukrainian citizenship and ultimately escaped.

He kept them empty as a symbol of shared humanity. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s such an intimate place with your children and the bond between parents and children and, when that\u2019s separated like that, it\u2019s a tragedy, it\u2019s horrible.</p> <p>\u201cThe brutality of that is worse than a bullet wound.

But it is that universal thing from all generations, all countries \u2013 I even think if Russians weren\u2019t so brainwashed and propagandised that they would be able to relate to these other children and the horror of that.

I don\u2019t want to turn it into that because even part of Trump\u2019s Maga base would empathise with these kids if they could see this situation.

They know that Trump is Putin\u2019s friend.\u201d</p> <p>The mural will be on display until 30 November. At Saturday\u2019s opening, from 12 noon to 6pm, there was an added immersive experience. In front of each of the eight rooms there was a chair with a stuffed animal exactly as in the image, while Ukrainian lullabies played from loudspeakers.</p> <p>Galeyeva explains: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=rWx9zVnSCIQ\">Ukrainian lullaby songs</a> are perhaps the most sensitive, touching part here because they convey such an intimate experience when a mother or father sings to their child. The lullaby song is something that lures the baby into this dreamlike world of safety, cosiness, warmth and, in the folk tradition, it\u2019s not recommended to look at the child while the child is sleeping, because it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re bringing your energy into that sacred space.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a very intimate connection between the song and the child sleeping and this, we hope, also will add an additional layer of immersion. It\u2019s not like that right now in Ukraine for many kids and that\u2019s the tragedy.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Empty Beds is on show in Little Ukraine in New York City until 30 November</p></li> </ul>",

They know that Trump is Putin\u2019s friend.\u201d The mural will be on display until 30 November. At Saturday\u2019s opening, from 12 noon to 6pm, there was an added immersive experience. In front of each of the eight rooms there was a chair with a stuffed animal exactly as in the image, while Ukrainian lullabies played from loudspeakers. Galeyeva explains: \u201cUkrainian lullaby songs are perhaps the most sensitive, touching part here because they convey such an intimate experience when a mother or father sings to their child. The lullaby song is something that lures the baby into this dreamlike world of safety, cosiness, warmth and, in the folk tradition, it\u2019s not recommended to look at the child while the child is sleeping, because it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re bringing your energy into that sacred space. \u201cThere is a very intimate connection between the song and the child sleeping and this, we hope, also will add an additional layer of immersion. It\u2019s not like that right now in Ukraine for many kids and that\u2019s the tragedy.\u201d Empty Beds is on show in Little Ukraine in New York City until 30 November",

      "bodyText": "A company linked to the United Arab Emirates royals has approached one of the UK\u2019s pioneering green electricity suppliers over a potential takeover. Wiltshire-based Good Energy, which supplies renewable energy to about 245,000 households, said it had received an unsolicited takeover offer from Dubai-based Esyasoft on Friday. Esyasoft, which describes itself as being at the forefront of smart grid technology, is ultimately controlled by the Abu Dhabi International Holding Company (IHC), the investment company chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the son of the UAE\u2019s founder and part of the Abu Dhabi ruling family. Launched in 1999 by Juliet Davenport, Good Energy was one of the first \u201cchallenger\u201d suppliers to compete with established companies such as British Gas, and supplies renewable energy to homes, as well as installing heat pumps, solar panels and batteries into homes. In addition to being supplied by Good Energy, about 180,000 of its customers also supply extra energy their solar panels produce to the grid through the feed-in tariff system. In its update to the stock market on Monday, Good Energy said it was evaluating the offer but said there was still no certainty on what the terms of the offer would be, or if an offer would be made at all. Esyasoft now has until 25 November to make a firm offer. Good Energy\u2019s shares have leapt by more than 22% after the news. Good Energy also revealed it had agreed a deal to buy the Hampshire-based rooftop solar power company Empower Energy for \u00a37m. The acquisition marks the fifth takeover by the Good Energy in the past two years, including the solar power installation firms Wessex EcoEnergy, which was based in Dorchester, Dorset, and JPS Group, which was based in Maidstone, Kent. In 2022, it made its first move into the heat pump installation sector with acquisition of Igloo Works. Davenport stepped down after a 20-year role with the company and was replaced by Nigel Pocklington. The company was censured by the energy watchdog Ofgem last year, when it was ordered to pay \u00a31.25m after being found to have overcharged 7,000 households a total of \u00a3391,650, or about \u00a3109 on their energy bills.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">It finished 2-2</a>. Twice Arsenal had the lead and twice Liverpool pegged them back. By the end, Arsenal had a back four that contained not a single first-choice element in its usual place and yet had still seemed oddly untested late on. Set it out like that and it sounds like a madcap thriller and yet, somehow, it all felt slightly flat.</p> <p>Arsenal even had what many in the ground celebrated as an injury-time winner ruled out, although it turned out the referee Anthony Taylor had already blown for a foul by Jakub Kiwior, something that really should have been obvious from Gabriel Jesus\u2019s body language as he poked the ball over the line. This is Arsenal, and so there had to be a conspiracy theory, which beyond the incontrovertible fact that Taylor is from Greater Manchester (like, you know, Manchester City: coincidence? Really?), seemed to focus on the fact that the referee had paused momentarily before giving a fairly straightforward decision. Waiting to see if there might be an advantage? Or getting his orders from the shadowy anti-Arsenal forces that run the game?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the persecution complex of some Arsenal fans is easy to mock, it is true that after a long spell of being fairly fortunate with injuries, they are now experiencing the regression to the mean. That William Saliba was suspended following his red card at Bournemouth last week was self-inflicted, but losing Gabriel and Jurri\u00ebn Timber to injuries sustained during the game while already without Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu was deeply unfortunate: a back four of Thomas Partey, Ben White, Kiwior and Myles Lewis-Skelly is not what anybody envisaged.</p> <p>That\u2019s enough to scramble any mind, particularly when their captain Martin \u00d8degaard remains absent and Bukayo Saka, superb on his return from injury, was always likely have to be withdrawn before the end. Arsenal have been guilty of dancing with doom, focusing always on the frustration of the refereeing decisions that go against them and the players who are not available, but in this instance they were unfortunate with injuries. Perhaps they could have done something differently to see out the final quarter-hour plus injury-time, but if Trent Alexander-Arnold measures a pass behind your 18-year-old full-back with such precision and Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez then, for once, takes the right option to tee up Mohamed Salah, there\u2019s not a huge amount for Arsenal to reproach themselves for.</p> <p>The surprise, in fact, is that Liverpool were unable to apply more pressure having equalised. It was Arsenal who threatened, which leads inevitably, if perhaps not entirely fairly, to the thought that their response to the injuries was too cautious. Arne Slot, clearly, was frustrated and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/they-were-on-the-floor-so-many-times-arne-slot-accuses-arsenal-of-time-wasting\">protested about Arsenal\u2019s time-wasting</a>, but at 2-2 he showed no inclination to gamble.</p> <p>But these are not gamblers. Football is at a curious point in its on-field evolution. For years, the game has been getting more attacking. Improvements in pitches and tweaks to the laws have encouraged passing play and possession football. Sitting in and spoiling from the off is very unusual these days. Last season we saw a Premier League record 3.20 goals per game. This season, the average is 2.90, which is still historically extremely high.

But both have a risk-averse approach to possession. They\u2019re not like Klopp, urging their teams to get the ball forward at every opportunity, to roll the dice constantly.

      "bodyText": "It finished 2-2. Twice Arsenal had the lead and twice Liverpool pegged them back. By the end, Arsenal had a back four that contained not a single first-choice element in its usual place and yet had still seemed oddly untested late on. Set it out like that and it sounds like a madcap thriller and yet, somehow, it all felt slightly flat. Arsenal even had what many in the ground celebrated as an injury-time winner ruled out, although it turned out the referee Anthony Taylor had already blown for a foul by Jakub Kiwior, something that really should have been obvious from Gabriel Jesus\u2019s body language as he poked the ball over the line. This is Arsenal, and so there had to be a conspiracy theory, which beyond the incontrovertible fact that Taylor is from Greater Manchester (like, you know, Manchester City: coincidence? Really?), seemed to focus on the fact that the referee had paused momentarily before giving a fairly straightforward decision. Waiting to see if there might be an advantage? Or getting his orders from the shadowy anti-Arsenal forces that run the game? While the persecution complex of some Arsenal fans is easy to mock, it is true that after a long spell of being fairly fortunate with injuries, they are now experiencing the regression to the mean. That William Saliba was suspended following his red card at Bournemouth last week was self-inflicted, but losing Gabriel and Jurri\u00ebn Timber to injuries sustained during the game while already without Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu was deeply unfortunate: a back four of Thomas Partey, Ben White, Kiwior and Myles Lewis-Skelly is not what anybody envisaged. That\u2019s enough to scramble any mind, particularly when their captain Martin \u00d8degaard remains absent and Bukayo Saka, superb on his return from injury, was always likely have to be withdrawn before the end. Arsenal have been guilty of dancing with doom, focusing always on the frustration of the refereeing decisions that go against them and the players who are not available, but in this instance they were unfortunate with injuries. Perhaps they could have done something differently to see out the final quarter-hour plus injury-time, but if Trent Alexander-Arnold measures a pass behind your 18-year-old full-back with such precision and Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez then, for once, takes the right option to tee up Mohamed Salah, there\u2019s not a huge amount for Arsenal to reproach themselves for. The surprise, in fact, is that Liverpool were unable to apply more pressure having equalised. It was Arsenal who threatened, which leads inevitably, if perhaps not entirely fairly, to the thought that their response to the injuries was too cautious. Arne Slot, clearly, was frustrated and protested about Arsenal\u2019s time-wasting, but at 2-2 he showed no inclination to gamble. But these are not gamblers. Football is at a curious point in its on-field evolution. For years, the game has been getting more attacking. Improvements in pitches and tweaks to the laws have encouraged passing play and possession football. Sitting in and spoiling from the off is very unusual these days. Last season we saw a Premier League record 3.20 goals per game. This season, the average is 2.90, which is still historically extremely high. But the very elite are always slightly ahead, leading the evolution. Before 2008 there was only one season in which goals-per-game in the knockout stages of the Champions League was over 3.00. From 2008-09 to 2019-20, there was only one season in which it fell below 3.00. But it\u2019s been below 3.00 in each of the last four seasons. It is true that the last three of those coincide with Uefa competition abandoning the away goals rule, but the trend pre-dates that. J\u00fcrgen Klopp, in fact, suggested in 2019 that with everybody focusing on attack, it was in improving defence that competitive advantages were to be found. Slot and Mikel Arteta are coaches of this new caution. There were, of course, still four goals at the Emirates on Sunday, much higher than the Premier League average. But this was a typical game of modern elite football. Arsenal had the best defensive record in the Premier League last season, Liverpool have the best this time around. Neither Arteta nor Slot are instinctively defensive in the manner of, say, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or Antonio Conte \u2013 although, as he showed in the draw at City, Arteta has his moments.

The survey, published on Sunday by the New York Times in collaboration with Siena College, sketched out a deeply divided political landscape. Both sides of the divide expressed distrust of the other \u2013 and doubts in general about the US\u2019s brand of democracy. But they come together with an overall perception: a majority said the country was plagued by corruption, with 62% saying that the government was mostly working to serve itself and elites than any broader purpose of collective good. Fifty-eight per cent of voters in the survey indicated that the country\u2019s financial and political systems needed major changes or a complete overhaul. A separate national poll published a day earlier found that Kamala Harris was deadlocked with Donald Trump as he seeks a return to the White House \u2013 a slip of three points for the vice-president from a similar poll earlier in October. That poll sparked fears among some that the Democratic candidate could lose the popular vote \u2013 a reversal of the four last elections. Both candidates stand at 48% nationally, down from 49% for Harris and up from 46% for Trump weeks earlier. One glimmer of positivity from the latest poll surveying trust in US democracy: nearly 80% of voters from both main parties and independents said they trusted the results next week would be accurate, despite Trump\u2019s sustained efforts to question the integrity of the vote in this race and the one he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. That\u2019s an improvement from two years ago, when only about 70% said they were confident in the results. But the survey figures also pointed to a deep distrust of the information universe: 21% said the mainstream media was good for democracy, and 55% said it was bad. For social media, 21% of poll respondents said it was good for democracy, and 51% said it was bad. Assigning overall blame for the division depended on political affiliation, the Times\u2019 poll found. Democrats defined Trump as the central threat to democracy. Republicans viewed Harris, Biden and Democrats in general as bad for democracy \u2013 but also pointed to a subset of concerns including voting by mail, electronic voting machines, immigration and the justice department. The Times suggested that the Democratic concern about Trump could explain why Harris\u2019s campaign has shifted its initial euphoric tone to a sustained message about a Trump victory representing \u201ca dark slide into fascism\u201d. Twenty-one per cent \u2013 9% less than two years ago \u2013 said it was permissible for a president to go outside the rule of law to achieve their ends. And six in 10 said they were not confident that Trump would accept the results of the 5 November vote if he lost. But the poll also found that voters did \u201cnot necessarily believe\u201d some of Trump\u2019s most inflammatory rhetoric, though experts on authoritarianism have cautioned that it should be taken seriously. Under half said they believed his threat to use the national guard to handle what Trump has called the \u201cenemy from within\u201d. But three-quarters said they took his threats to deport undocumented immigrants in large scale seriously. Separately, a CNN poll published on Monday found that 56% of registered voters said they had just some or no trust in the US supreme court and its conservative majority \u2013 including three justices appointed during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 to make the right decisions on any legal cases relating to the 2024 election.",

      "bodyText": "The Business Council of Australia wants local governments to be stripped of decision-making powers if they fail to meet \u201cbasic timeliness requirements\u201d when processing development applications. The Victorian government is already heading in this direction. It intends to override council planning to fast-track apartment blocks around transport hubs in established suburbs. There\u2019s a widespread view that local government shoulders responsibility for our housing shortfall because proscriptive regulations enable well-heeled objectors to block or delay projects. Bolder council action on housing would certainly be welcome. But the matter is more complex than a simple nimby-yimby divide would suggest. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Five years ago, Australia was building homes at a rapid clip. More than 215,000 dwellings were completed nationwide in 2018-19 and more than 1m homes in the five years before that, matching the target set in the 2022 housing accord struck by national cabinet soon after the Albanese government took office. If we\u2019d kept building at that pace, we\u2019d get within spitting distance of the accord\u2019s revised target of 1.2m homes by 2029. Now, though, we\u2019re miles away. Last financial year fewer than 175,000 new homes were completed. It wasn\u2019t \u201cred tape\u201d and local government delays that caused the slowdown in residential construction but changed business conditions. Covid was followed by supply chain bottlenecks, rising material costs and shortages of skilled labour. Higher interest rates increased the cost of borrowing for developers and made potential buyers wary of buying off the plan. This has a big impact on larger apartment projects, because most developers need to pre-sell 60% to 70% of units to secure finance before they can build. Overseas buyers are an important part of this market, and in 2017 the Coalition government made it harder to get the numbers to stack up by imposing a 50% cap on foreign ownership in new multi-storey buildings with 50 or more apartments.

The electoral matters committee, chaired by the Labor MP Luba Grigorovitch, released a discussion paper on Monday suggesting six possible options for reform, which include adopting the model used for the New South Wales upper house and that of the federal Senate. It comes after the committee in July recommended the government ditch group voting tickets as part of its inquiry into the 2022 election. Victoria\u2019s legislative council is the only house of parliament in Australia still using such a voting system, in which voters choose just one party above the line on the ballot paper, with their preferences then allocated by the party. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Voters can also vote below the line, and list their own preferences, but must number at least five boxes for it to be valid. Only 9.4% of voters did so at the 2022 election. All but one of the proposals in Monday\u2019s discussion paper retain the current eight upper house regions, from which five MPs are elected. One scraps regions altogether, with Victorians able to vote for all members. The quota for election would go from the current 16.7% to 2.4%, which the discussion paper said would guarantee the representation of minor parties and maximise the diversity of views in the upper house. The second proposal is similar to the models in place in NSW, South Australia and the Senate, in which 40 upper house MPs would be elected from the state as a whole, with only half on the ballot at each election. Under this proposal, the quota for election would be 4.8%. Other models include changing to four 10-member regions; increasing the size of the legislative council to 49 members and electing seven members from seven regions; and retaining the current regions but adding \u201ctop up members\u201d for parties that receive more than 4% of first preference votes. Grigorovitch said \u201cthe last time there was significant reform done to the upper house was in 2003\u201d. \u201cVictoria has changed a lot over the last 20 years, and we need to do the work to understand what possible changes could look like and what their impact might be,\u201d Grigorovitch said. The ABC electoral analyst Antony Green has previously told Guardian Australia that group voting tickets were an \u201cabrogation of democracy\u201d as they were regularly exploited by \u201cpreference whisperers\u201d who are paid to help candidates win despite receiving a small proportion of first-preference votes. The electoral matters committee deputy chair, Liberal MP Wayne Farnham, said group voting tickets can result in above-the-line votes for the upper house being distributed in ways that voters do not expect or want. \u201cI don\u2019t think the public is really aware of how it works and because of this, their intent is not truly reflected in their vote,\u201d Farnham said. \u201cThe government should adopt the committee\u2019s recommendation to abolish group voting tickets, which was made following both the 2018 and 2022 elections.\u201d The prominent \u201cpreference whisperer\u201d Glenn Druery helped arranged preference deals in 2022 that saw the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP Jeff Bourman elected. Georgie Purcell also benefited from the deals, though her Animal Justice party directed its preferences to a bloc of progressive parties, in a \u201csting\u201d revealed by Guardian Australia. Responses to the discussion paper are due by 3 February, with the committee to report back to parliament by December 2025. Parliament will have to agree with any recommended changes before they can be implemented and most proposed changes to the structure of the upper house would require a vote at a referendum.",

Two years ago, residents moved to fundamentally alter their local government structure and adopted what experts have described as some of the most \u201cexpansive voting reforms\u201d undertaken by a major US city in recent decades. Come November, the city will use ranked-choice voting to elect a mayor and a larger, more representative city council as Portland moves from a commission form of government to one overseen by a city administrator. The shake-up comes after challenging years for Portland in which the city of 630,000 grappled with a declining downtown, rising homelessness, a fentanyl crisis, growing public drug use and the continued economic impacts of the pandemic years. While some news coverage has portrayed the shift as Portlanders rejecting the city\u2019s historically progressive values, those involved with the project counter that residents are embracing democratic reforms that will lead to a more equitable government better equipped to solve the city\u2019s problems. \u201cIt was really clear that this system was, as operated, very inequitable,\u201d said Jenny Lee, managing director of Building Power for Communities of Color, a non-profit that was a key proponent of the effort. \u201cAnd the challenges in governing are going to be felt the most by those who already have been marginalized in our political system.\u201d Now the city waits to see what the \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d change will mean for its future. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Since 1913, Portland has used a commission form of government. The commission consisted of five people elected citywide and who were responsible for passing policies and also acting as administrators in charge of city departments. The system was briefly popular in other major US cities, but then largely abandoned, said Richard Clucas, a political science professor at Portland State University. \u201cMost cities who adopted that form of government realized there were problems with it,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone may be good as a legislator but it doesn\u2019t make them good as an administrator.\u201d And Portland\u2019s system had long failed to adequately represent different demographics in the city, Lee said. The city\u2019s elected officials historically have been white men from more affluent areas where residents are more likely to have a higher income and own their homes, according to the Sightline Institute. In 2017, only two people of color had ever been elected to the city council. Under the charter system, simple decisions \u2013 such as where to put a bike lane \u2013 were politicized, said Shoshanah Oppenheim, the charter transition project manager. \u201cIt was based on the political tide,\u201d said Oppenheim, who is also a senior adviser in the city administrator\u2019s office. For more than a century, Portlanders rejected attempts to reform the commission system, but that changed when the 10-year review of the city charter coincided with upheaval and challenges of the pandemic years. The pandemic exacerbated the existing limitations of the city\u2019s form of government, according to a report from Harvard\u2019s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation chronicling Portland\u2019s reforms. Meanwhile, Portland was the site of widespread racial justice protests and an ensuing federal crackdown, the city\u2019s economic recovery from the pandemic was slow, and residents grew increasingly disillusioned with their leaders\u2019 ability to make meaningful progress tackling homelessness and drug abuse. Those challenges created an opportunity to have meaningful conversations about elections and government, Lee said. Clucas echoed that sentiment: \u201cI think the public was looking and happy to take on some sort of change.\u201d Community leaders had spent years educating themselves about electoral reform, and saw an opportunity to create change in the city, the report stated. With support from community organizations and local activists, the commission brought a measure before voters that would make key changes to the city\u2019s system, allowing voters to rank local candidates in order of preference, expand the city council from five to 12 representatives elected from four newly created districts, and move to a system of government overseen by a professional city administrator. Despite criticism about the complexity of the measure and opposition from political leaders and the business community, 58% of voters approved the package of reforms proposed by the commission. Although the timing coincided with major changes and social issues, Lee said the reforms were not reactionary and instead an example of Portland being willing to try new things, which ties into Oregon\u2019s long history of democratic reforms aimed at making government more participatory. \u201cIt was a message about change, but it was definitely a hopeful one,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was always about these changes will make our government more effective and equitable.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The city has spent the last two years preparing for a project unlike anything Portland has seen before,Oppenheim said. \u201cWe had a really short timeline \u2026 It\u2019s been an all-hands-on-deck approach,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no playbook.

      "bodyText": "Whitehaven Coal, one of Australia\u2019s biggest coal producers, faces a rare \u201csecond strike\u201d from shareholders this week as climate activists seek to draw attention to the miner\u2019s plans to ramp up volumes and resulting carbon emissions. The ASX-listed company received a 41% vote against its executives\u2019 remuneration report at last year\u2019s annual general meeting. A vote of at least 25% at this year\u2019s AGM on Wednesday would force a motion to spill Whitehaven\u2019s board. Market Forces, a climate action lobby, said the investor group Glass Lewis backed a second censure against Whitehaven. Another investor, ISS, also called for a rejection of plans to award the chief executive, Paul Flynn, a 1m share bonus worth about $7m. \u201cWhitehaven is paying massive bonuses to executives for steamrolling ahead with an outdated and unacceptably risky coal growth strategy,\u201d said Will van de Pol, Market Forces\u2019 chief executive. \u201cInvestors do have the power to change companies if they are willing to pull out all the stops and use that power.\u201d Whitehaven plans to expand its thermal coal output alone by about 40% in the next 20 years at a time when fossil fuel production should be in retreat, a shift out of step even with its peers in Australia, according to Van de Pol. Some of its plans, including the Blackwater South mine in Queensland, had a planned life of as much as 90 years. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email While not all of the projects have reached final investment decisions, \u201call are on the table\u201d, he said. \u201cWe have to assume they plan to develop them.\u201d Successful \u201csecond strike\u201d votes are fairly rare, with none achieved in last year\u2019s AGM season, according to consultancy PwC. Still, Whitehaven may face an embarrassing event at Wednesday\u2019s gathering in Sydney. A protest vote of more than 25% would result in a spill motion for the board. Should that motion secure at least 50% of shareholders\u2019 votes, Whitehaven would be forced to call a subsequent meeting to choose its non-executive board members. For its part, Whitehaven issued a statement aimed at rebuking Market Forces\u2019 push. \u201cWhitehaven\u2019s remuneration framework considers short-term production goals (with outcomes based on performance versus yearly budgets) and long-term project advancement, both to replace mines which are closing (due to finite mine lives) and to develop new projects with attractive rates of return,\u201d the company said in defence of its salary plan. As to its emissions plan, \u201cNet Zero emissions does not mean no emissions,\u201d it said. \u201cOffsetting remains a viable method to reduce anthropogenic carbon emissions and indeed was provisioned for under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. \u201cWe believe the transition to a low-carbon economy will take decades, not years, and that decarbonisation must be considered alongside the need to support economic activity and growth while providing secure and reliable energy to underpin standards of living,\u201d it said. Whitehaven said claims it wanted to expand production by 80% or that it had a $6bn development pipeline were \u201ca vast overstatement\u201d. Its four \u201cstrategic development projects\u201d were the Vickery extension project, Narrabri Stage 3, Winchester South and the Maules Creek continuation project\u201d. Market Forces said Whitehaven\u2019s expansion plans would result in 23 times the cumulative emissions reductions expected to be made from the Albanese government\u2019s safeguard mechanism to curb carbon emissions from industry by 2030. The company\u2019s trajectory was also at odds with the three main scenarios put forward by the International Energy Agency, it said. \u201cIf all mines are pursued, Market Forces estimates the company\u2019s product coal output would peak at just shy of 60m tonnes in the mid-2030s,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "An international law expert has warned that abandoning oil and gas infrastructure in Bass Strait would breach Australia\u2019s obligations under international law, if ExxonMobil pursues this plan in decommissioning its Gippsland offshore project. Prof Donald Rothwell, who specialises in international law at the Australian National University, said Bass Strait was used for international navigation and had special status under the UN convention on the law of the sea and related International Maritime Organisation guidelines. As a party to the Unclos, Australia was obliged to remove all structures from Bass Strait when they were no longer in use, he said. Unclos and related IMO guidelines were \u201cunambiguously clear\u201d, Rothwell said: structures in an international strait within Australia\u2019s exclusive economic zone couldn\u2019t be left \u201cin situ\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s actually an obligation to remove those structures,\u201d he said. When decommissioning its 50-year-old fossil fuel infrastructure in the Gippsland basin, located up to 77km off Victoria\u2019s Gippsland coast, ExxonMobil proposed to leave steel structures below depths of 55m \u201cin place on the seabed\u201d. In a September update, the company said lower sections of steel structures in deep water would remain, with removal \u201cpart of a future decommissioning campaign, unless an alternative end state is proposed and accepted by the regulator\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority said full removal was \u201cthe base case for decommissioning\u201d unless it was satisfied that environmental risks and impacts could be reduced \u201cto as low as reasonably practicable and an acceptable level\u201d in an accepted environment plan. ExxonMobil plans to submit its plan in early 2025. Separate approval would be required from the federal environment department under the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act to abandon any infrastructure on the seabed. \u201cThis is a novel issue that hasn\u2019t arisen legally in Australia before,\u201d Rothwell said. He added that the government was well aware of the importance of the UN convention, as well as Australia\u2019s rights and obligations. \u201cWe\u2019re in this interesting position at the moment where the prime minister, the defence minister and the foreign minister constantly reference the law of the sea convention in many different settings, mostly in the context of disputations in the South China Sea and the freedom of navigation.\u201d He said the situation raised questions about whether the government would uphold its own obligations under the convention in relation to the offshore oil and gas industry. The Wilderness Society sought Rothwell\u2019s legal opinion after ExxonMobil stated its intention to resubmit plans to leave steel structures in the ocean to Nopsema and the federal environment department. The Wilderness Society campaigner Fern Cadman said Rothwell\u2019s advice demonstrated a clear requirement under international law for the government and its offshore regulator to insist on full removal. \u201cNopsema needs to crack the whip on ExxonMobil to avoid a scenario where the company no longer has financial capacity for clean up and taxpayers are left meeting Australia\u2019s legal requirement and footing the bill,\u201d Cadman said. Over the next 30 years as projects reach their end of life, an estimated 5.7m tonnes of material \u2013 equivalent to 110 Sydney Harbour Bridges \u2013 needs to be removed from Australian offshore oil and gas facilities, according to the Centre of Decommissioning Australia. As Australia\u2019s first major offshore oil and gas development, the Gippsland basin was among the first and largest to face decommissioning. ExxonMobil\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary Esso Australia operated and managed the Bass Strait assets in the Gippsland basin on behalf of the company\u2019s joint ventures with Woodside Energy and Mitsui E&amp;P Australia.

Here are some of the most memorable examples.</p> <h2>Austerity error</h2> <p>In 2010, two respected economists released a paper that made an influential case for the years of austerity that followed. Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff argued in Growth in a Time of Debt that once a government\u2019s debt reaches 90% of gross domestic product \u2013 a measure of a country\u2019s economic output \u2013 growth goes into reverse.</p> <p>However, in 2013 it emerged that the Harvard economists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/18/uncovered-error-george-osborne-austerity\">had made an error</a> in an Excel spreadsheet: instead of falling by 0.1%, their work should have found that the economies in question grow by 2.2%. </p> <p>\u201cIt is sobering that such an error slipped into one of our papers,\u201d they said in a statement. They nonetheless stood by their broad conclusion \u2013 debt hinders growth \u2013 but the error was jumped on by critics.</p> <p>\u201cThis can\u2019t possibly be good for Team Austerity,\u201d wrote the US economist Paul Krugman.</p> <h2>Utter dis-mae</h2> <p>Fannie Mae, the US mortgage lender, issued a quarterly results statement in 2003 containing accounting errors that totalled more than $1bn. Fannie Mae said the mistakes were due to a company accountant <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2003/10/31/finding-errors-a-plus-fannie-says/6d5ff9c1-a6d5-425a-ad54-0a0668ef17bb/\">putting the wrong formula</a> into an Excel spreadsheet, as the financial firm sought to comply with a new accounting standard.</p> <p>The company stressed that the errors did not affect profits, but questions were raised about Fannie Mae\u2019s internal controls at the time.

      "bodyText": "For millions of people, from accountants to the person in charge of the work rota, Microsoft Excel has been been a godsend. But as the spreadsheet software nears its 40th birthday, spare a thought for those who misplaced a decimal, left out a row or got their cut and paste wrong. Here are some of the most memorable examples. Austerity error In 2010, two respected economists released a paper that made an influential case for the years of austerity that followed. Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff argued in Growth in a Time of Debt that once a government\u2019s debt reaches 90% of gross domestic product \u2013 a measure of a country\u2019s economic output \u2013 growth goes into reverse. However, in 2013 it emerged that the Harvard economists had made an error in an Excel spreadsheet: instead of falling by 0.1%, their work should have found that the economies in question grow by 2.2%. \u201cIt is sobering that such an error slipped into one of our papers,\u201d they said in a statement. They nonetheless stood by their broad conclusion \u2013 debt hinders growth \u2013 but the error was jumped on by critics. \u201cThis can\u2019t possibly be good for Team Austerity,\u201d wrote the US economist Paul Krugman. Utter dis-mae Fannie Mae, the US mortgage lender, issued a quarterly results statement in 2003 containing accounting errors that totalled more than $1bn. Fannie Mae said the mistakes were due to a company accountant putting the wrong formula into an Excel spreadsheet, as the financial firm sought to comply with a new accounting standard. The company stressed that the errors did not affect profits, but questions were raised about Fannie Mae\u2019s internal controls at the time. Five years later, Fannie Mae was rescued by the US government as the credit crunch took hold. Computer says 000 MI5, the UK\u2019s domestic spy agency, tapped 134 incorrect telephone numbers in 2010 following a spreadsheet error that altered the last three digits in the numbers to \u201c000\u201d. A report admitted the errors were caused by \u201ca formatting fault on an electronic spreadsheet\u201d, adding euphemistically that \u201ca degree of unintended collateral intrusion occurred\u201d. Virus problems During the coronavirus pandemic, nearly 16,000 cases went unreported in England after an Excel error. The Guardian reported that the mistake may have been caused by a file containing test results, sent from NHS test and trace to Public Health England, exceeding the number of rows it could contain. As a consequence, test reports were missed off and thousands of potentially infectious people were missed by contact tracers. The then health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the incident \u201cshould never have happened\u201d. Whale-sized mistake An internal report into a $6bn trading loss at the US investment bank JP Morgan, at the hands of a trader known as the London Whale, found flaws in how an important measure of financial risk at the institution was being calculated. One problem was that the risk model monitoring the fateful portfolio operated \u201cthrough a series of Excel spreadsheets, which had to be completed manually, by a process of copying and pasting data from one spreadsheet to another\u201d \u2013 a process that might ring bells for some Excel veterans. An error was created after a cell mistakenly divided by the sum of two interest rates, rather than the average, according to the report. James Kwak, a US scholar, said the report outlined one of Excel\u2019s main issues: its accessibility. \u201cThe biggest problem is that anyone can create Excel spreadsheets \u2013 badly,\u201d he wrote. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2024.

      "body": "<p>The German carmaker Volkswagen is planning to shut at least three factories in its home country, lay off thousands of workers and cut pay by 10%, according to the company\u2019s union.</p> <p>The deeper-than-expected cuts come as the company faces weak sales and slow expansion in the electric vehicle (EV) sector amid tough competition from Chinese manufacturers. </p> <p>\u201cThe board wants to close at least three factories in Germany,\u201d the works council chief, Daniela Cavallo, told employees at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg on Monday. Its remaining manufacturing sites will reduce capacity, she said, citing information provided by management.</p> <p>As Europe\u2019s top economy suffers a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/23/project-to-build-german-ev-microchip-factory-put-on-hold\">crisis in manufacturing and fears of mass unemployment</a>, VW is aiming for a fundamental restructuring to cut costs. It had initially warned last month that it had the equivalent of two factories of extra capacity in Germany.</p> <p>Redundancies are expected across the workforce, amounting to tens of thousands of jobs and whole divisions closed or sent overseas. Real-terms pay cuts could amount to as much as 18% after a two-year pay freeze, the works council said. \u201cAll German VW plants are affected by these plans,\u201d Cavallo said. \u201cNone is safe.\u201d</p> <p>The works council said the factory in the northern city of Osnabr\u00fcck, in Lower Saxony, which recently lost a major contract with Porsche, VW\u2019s subsidiary, was threatened with closure. However, that could prove politically contentious as Lower Saxony\u2019s government is Volkswagen\u2019s second-largest shareholder, with 20% of voting rights. The state\u2019s leader, Stephan Weil, last month said plant closures should not be under consideration.</p> <p>Cavallo also raised the prospect of industrial action if VW did not back down. She said the company was \u201cplaying with the massive risk that everything will soon escalate here\u201d and workers will \u201cdo what a workforce has to do when it fears for its existence\u201d.</p> <p>Car companies are complaining of falling demand in many key markets after interest rates rose in recent years after the historic lows of more than a decade that followed the global financial crisis.

      "bodyText": "The German carmaker Volkswagen is planning to shut at least three factories in its home country, lay off thousands of workers and cut pay by 10%, according to the company\u2019s union. The deeper-than-expected cuts come as the company faces weak sales and slow expansion in the electric vehicle (EV) sector amid tough competition from Chinese manufacturers. \u201cThe board wants to close at least three factories in Germany,\u201d the works council chief, Daniela Cavallo, told employees at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg on Monday. Its remaining manufacturing sites will reduce capacity, she said, citing information provided by management. As Europe\u2019s top economy suffers a crisis in manufacturing and fears of mass unemployment, VW is aiming for a fundamental restructuring to cut costs. It had initially warned last month that it had the equivalent of two factories of extra capacity in Germany. Redundancies are expected across the workforce, amounting to tens of thousands of jobs and whole divisions closed or sent overseas. Real-terms pay cuts could amount to as much as 18% after a two-year pay freeze, the works council said. \u201cAll German VW plants are affected by these plans,\u201d Cavallo said. \u201cNone is safe.\u201d The works council said the factory in the northern city of Osnabr\u00fcck, in Lower Saxony, which recently lost a major contract with Porsche, VW\u2019s subsidiary, was threatened with closure. However, that could prove politically contentious as Lower Saxony\u2019s government is Volkswagen\u2019s second-largest shareholder, with 20% of voting rights. The state\u2019s leader, Stephan Weil, last month said plant closures should not be under consideration. Cavallo also raised the prospect of industrial action if VW did not back down. She said the company was \u201cplaying with the massive risk that everything will soon escalate here\u201d and workers will \u201cdo what a workforce has to do when it fears for its existence\u201d. Car companies are complaining of falling demand in many key markets after interest rates rose in recent years after the historic lows of more than a decade that followed the global financial crisis. Germany\u2019s traditional manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, have reported falling profits as Chinese sales in particular struggle. At the same time, incumbent carmakers such as Volkswagen are having to come up with major investments needed to switch production from petrol and diesel to battery electric, while facing Chinese rivals who enjoy lower costs. Some factories had already been switched over, but slowing growth in demand for EVs has made companies less keen to make the job-saving investments. Volkswagen employs more than 120,000 people in Germany, about half of those in Wolfsburg. The company, which operates 10 sites in Germany under the VW brand, sent shock waves through the country in September with an announcement that it was considering the closure of factories in Germany for the first time in its history. To return to competitiveness, it said it would abolish its 30-year-old employment protection agreement as part of an attempt to save about \u20ac10bn. Volkswagen said in a statement on Monday that its management had been in talks with labour representatives since the middle of 2023 about how to proceed, and had made clear over the summer that the \u201cworsening economic situation required a fundamental restructuring\u201d. It said management would put forward \u201cconcrete proposals to lower labour costs\u201d at upcoming salary negotiations. Gunnar Kilian, the head of human resources on the management board, said: \u201cThe fact is, the situation is serious and the responsibility of the negotiating partners is enormous.\u201d He confirmed unspecified factory closures and painted a dire picture of the company\u2019s condition. The company said the automobile market in Europe, of which its share amounts to about a quarter, had shrunk by 2 million vehicles since 2020 while costs for energy, personnel and raw materials had grown. The sector was \u201cstagnating and will not recover in the foreseeable future\u201d, it said. Volkswagen Passenger Cars\u2019 chief executive, Thomas Sch\u00e4fer, said the company\u2019s German factories had significantly higher labour costs than the industry standard.",

After attending grammar school in south London, Bailey won a scholarship to the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1953.

Yet to tell it any other way would ignore the truth that Inter could have been out of sight before he did.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/european-football-juventus-inter-bayern-munich-marseille-psg\">European football: Yildiz double earns Juventus point in 4-4 thriller at Inter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This was not the football we anticipated. Juventus are still a team in construction under Thiago Motta, hired this summer after steering Bologna into the Champions League. The <em>Bianconeri</em> had shown us different faces so far: adventurous and creative in some games but muddled and passive in others. They scored three goals in five of their first eight matches under the new manager. The others were all 0-0 draws.</p> \n<p>They arrived here from easily their worst performance so far \u2013 a home defeat to Stuttgart in the Champions League in which they had one attempt on goal to their opponents\u2019 10. Still, the impression was of a team that, even on bad days, could at least keep it tight at the back. They had conceded once in eight Serie A fixtures.</p> \n<p>Inter made a mockery of that statistic, scoring three before the interval. Juventus helped them out, giving away a pair of penalty kicks. The first arrived at 0-0, Danilo swinging at a cross but kicking Marcus Thuram instead. Piotr Zielinski, making his first league start since a summer move from Napoli, converted the spot-kick.</p> \n<p>That was the 15th minute. Juventus were 2-1 up by the 26th. Dusan Vlahovic side-footed in the equaliser after Weston McKennie served him a delicious lay-off from a Juan Cabal chip over the Inter defence. The 21-year-old winger Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o feather-footed his way past two Inter defenders to set up McKennie\u2019s USA teammate Tim Weah.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-clasico-match-report\">Robert Lewandowski\u2019s double sparks Barcelona\u2019s cl\u00e1sico rout of Real Madrid</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Inter responded with maybe the best strike of the night, Henrikh Mkhitaryan executing a one-two with Marcus Thuram on the edge of the Juventus box before threading a finish between three defenders and into the bottom corner of Michele Di Gregorio\u2019s net. It was the first goal any Serie A player had scored against Motta\u2019s side in open play.</p> \n<p>From the sublime, we arrived at the ridiculous: Pierre Kalulu kicking Denzel Dumfries inside the Juventus box a fraction of a second before the Inter player was about to commit a handball. Zielinski\u2019s penalty was perfection. For the first time in more than a century of competing, these teams had combined for five first-half goals.</p> \n<p>When Dumfries made it 4-2 to Inter after the break, forcing the ball in at a corner, the game only seemed to be heading in one direction. He had missed another chance to score moments earlier. Di Gregorio made sharp stops to deny Federico Di Marco and Nicol\u00f2 Barella soon after.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SerieA_EN/status/1850809728818942427\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"tr\" dir=\"ltr\">Kenan Yildiz came on.

A graduate of Juventus\u2019s NextGen team, and prior to that Bayern Munich\u2019s academy, the 19-year-old had already made 27 league appearances for the first team under Massimiliano Allegri last season \u2013 mostly off the bench \u2013 but has been taking on a more prominent role this year after impressing for Turkey at the Euros.</p> \n<p>Despite playing the third-most minutes of any Juventus player, his performances had been a mixed bag. Yildiz made assists in each of his first two games this season, and scored <a href=\"https://(https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbpjHhIEr2I&amp;ab_channel=Juventus\">a spectacular goal against PSV</a> on his Champions League debut, but had struggled to make an impact since. National media carried interviews with former pros calling him \u201cpredictable\u201d and wondering whether the No 10 shirt was weighing too heavy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"21715e1c-7201-4bef-bcb3-057e13e2b9a7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Udinese 2-0 Cagliari, Torino 1-0 Como, Napoli 1-0 Lecce, Atalanta 6-1 Verona, Parma 1-1 Empoli, Lazio 3-0 Genoa, Monza 2-2 Venezia, Inter 4-4 Juventus, Fiorentina 5-1 Roma</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yildiz sought to dispel all that in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport last week, describing himself as a \u201cwell-centred and balanced person\u201d. There were hints of a normal teenage vulnerability as he acknowledged in the same breath that \u201cI\u2019m not happy spending time on my own\u201d.</p> \n<p>He has made a bond with Alessandro Del Piero, one of Juve\u2019s all-time great No 10s, who sent him a towel to congratulate him on his first Juventus goal last year and has stayed in touch ever since. When the interviewer pointed out that Del Piero first made his iconic tongue-out goal celebration after scoring at San Siro, Yildiz replied: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. I\u2019ll have to try to replicate it.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Detto fatto</em>, as they say in Italy. Said, and done. Yildiz kept his tongue in his mouth after he cut the deficit to 4-3 in the 71st minute, perhaps as surprised as everyone else by Dumfries backing off to give him the space to run into the Inter penalty box and drill a shot across Yann Sommer. But it came out after he scored again to equalise at 4-4.</p> \n<p>Sommer was slow to react on both goals, this time letting the ball squirm underneath him when Yildiz fired the ball in from a half-cleared Concei\u00e7\u00e3o cross. With Fiorentina thrashing Roma 5-1 in Sunday evening\u2019s later game, this was a bad night for tired cliches about Italian teams being hard to score against.</p> \n<p>It was a very good night for Antonio Conte. After winning the Derby d\u2019Italia as manager of Juventus, and then as manager of Inter, he had somehow now won it as manager of Napoli \u2013 this result allowing his team to finish the round with a four-point lead at the top of the division.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/marcel-desailly-interview-france-milan-marseille\">Marcel Desailly: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I was a star, but I\u2019m now a legend\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is still early to worry about such things, and the next six weeks might be the toughest stretch \u2013 on paper, at least \u2013 of the Partenopei\u2019s whole season. Inter, we might remind ourselves, were second in late January of this year, before finishing 19 points clear in first place. Sunday\u2019s avoidable collapse needs to be reflected on, but there are still positives to be found in a swaggering attack led by the ever-more confident Thuram.</p> \n<p>Juventus remain a work in progress, a young team showing promise in some areas and naivety in others. Even with Yildiz on the bench, their starting XI against Inter was, with an average age of 25 years and 212 days, the youngest they have fielded in a Derby d\u2019Italia since Opta started tracking data in 1994.</p> \n<p>Not every clash between great sporting rivals needs to provide us with a singular narrative or sense of direction. Sometimes the best simply offer 90 minutes of marvellous entertainment \u2013 even if the manager disagrees.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

      "bodyText": "It had been a bonkers, record-setting, night \u2013 one of the highest-scoring matches ever in a rivalry that goes back 115 years \u2013 but not all the protagonists were enjoying themselves. \u201cThanks for the show!\u201d said Zvonimir Boban in the Sky Sport studio to Simone Inzaghi at full-time. The Inter manager winced and forced a laugh. \u201cThe neutrals like you enjoyed yourselves. Me, a little bit less.\u201d Inzaghi had seen his team fritter away a two-goal lead in the final 20 minutes against Juventus, letting 4-2 become 4-4. To write it that way does a disservice to Kenan Yildiz, the teenager who came off the bench to score twice and turn the game on its head \u2013 writing his name into Derby d\u2019Italia lore. Yet to tell it any other way would ignore the truth that Inter could have been out of sight before he did. This was not the football we anticipated. Juventus are still a team in construction under Thiago Motta, hired this summer after steering Bologna into the Champions League. The Bianconeri had shown us different faces so far: adventurous and creative in some games but muddled and passive in others. They scored three goals in five of their first eight matches under the new manager. The others were all 0-0 draws. They arrived here from easily their worst performance so far \u2013 a home defeat to Stuttgart in the Champions League in which they had one attempt on goal to their opponents\u2019 10. Still, the impression was of a team that, even on bad days, could at least keep it tight at the back. They had conceded once in eight Serie A fixtures. Inter made a mockery of that statistic, scoring three before the interval. Juventus helped them out, giving away a pair of penalty kicks. The first arrived at 0-0, Danilo swinging at a cross but kicking Marcus Thuram instead. Piotr Zielinski, making his first league start since a summer move from Napoli, converted the spot-kick. That was the 15th minute. Juventus were 2-1 up by the 26th. Dusan Vlahovic side-footed in the equaliser after Weston McKennie served him a delicious lay-off from a Juan Cabal chip over the Inter defence. The 21-year-old winger Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o feather-footed his way past two Inter defenders to set up McKennie\u2019s USA teammate Tim Weah. Inter responded with maybe the best strike of the night, Henrikh Mkhitaryan executing a one-two with Marcus Thuram on the edge of the Juventus box before threading a finish between three defenders and into the bottom corner of Michele Di Gregorio\u2019s net. It was the first goal any Serie A player had scored against Motta\u2019s side in open play. From the sublime, we arrived at the ridiculous: Pierre Kalulu kicking Denzel Dumfries inside the Juventus box a fraction of a second before the Inter player was about to commit a handball. Zielinski\u2019s penalty was perfection. For the first time in more than a century of competing, these teams had combined for five first-half goals. When Dumfries made it 4-2 to Inter after the break, forcing the ball in at a corner, the game only seemed to be heading in one direction. He had missed another chance to score moments earlier. Di Gregorio made sharp stops to deny Federico Di Marco and Nicol\u00f2 Barella soon after. Enter Yildiz. A graduate of Juventus\u2019s NextGen team, and prior to that Bayern Munich\u2019s academy, the 19-year-old had already made 27 league appearances for the first team under Massimiliano Allegri last season \u2013 mostly off the bench \u2013 but has been taking on a more prominent role this year after impressing for Turkey at the Euros. Despite playing the third-most minutes of any Juventus player, his performances had been a mixed bag. Yildiz made assists in each of his first two games this season, and scored a spectacular goal against PSV on his Champions League debut, but had struggled to make an impact since. National media carried interviews with former pros calling him \u201cpredictable\u201d and wondering whether the No 10 shirt was weighing too heavy. Yildiz sought to dispel all that in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport last week, describing himself as a \u201cwell-centred and balanced person\u201d. There were hints of a normal teenage vulnerability as he acknowledged in the same breath that \u201cI\u2019m not happy spending time on my own\u201d. He has made a bond with Alessandro Del Piero, one of Juve\u2019s all-time great No 10s, who sent him a towel to congratulate him on his first Juventus goal last year and has stayed in touch ever since. When the interviewer pointed out that Del Piero first made his iconic tongue-out goal celebration after scoring at San Siro, Yildiz replied: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. I\u2019ll have to try to replicate it.\u201d Detto fatto, as they say in Italy. Said, and done. Yildiz kept his tongue in his mouth after he cut the deficit to 4-3 in the 71st minute, perhaps as surprised as everyone else by Dumfries backing off to give him the space to run into the Inter penalty box and drill a shot across Yann Sommer. But it came out after he scored again to equalise at 4-4. Sommer was slow to react on both goals, this time letting the ball squirm underneath him when Yildiz fired the ball in from a half-cleared Concei\u00e7\u00e3o cross. With Fiorentina thrashing Roma 5-1 in Sunday evening\u2019s later game, this was a bad night for tired cliches about Italian teams being hard to score against. It was a very good night for Antonio Conte. After winning the Derby d\u2019Italia as manager of Juventus, and then as manager of Inter, he had somehow now won it as manager of Napoli \u2013 this result allowing his team to finish the round with a four-point lead at the top of the division. It is still early to worry about such things, and the next six weeks might be the toughest stretch \u2013 on paper, at least \u2013 of the Partenopei\u2019s whole season. Inter, we might remind ourselves, were second in late January of this year, before finishing 19 points clear in first place. Sunday\u2019s avoidable collapse needs to be reflected on, but there are still positives to be found in a swaggering attack led by the ever-more confident Thuram. Juventus remain a work in progress, a young team showing promise in some areas and naivety in others. Even with Yildiz on the bench, their starting XI against Inter was, with an average age of 25 years and 212 days, the youngest they have fielded in a Derby d\u2019Italia since Opta started tracking data in 1994. Not every clash between great sporting rivals needs to provide us with a singular narrative or sense of direction. Sometimes the best simply offer 90 minutes of marvellous entertainment \u2013 even if the manager disagrees.",

It was difficult to prepare for because they would have thrown anything at us. We didn\u2019t really know how they would play, their shape, their formation, it took a little while to adapt to what they were doing. After 30 minutes we found our feet and found the shape we wanted to be in and that allowed us to get more on the front foot and counter and get back at the scoreline. Overall, it\u2019s a learning opportunity, we gave them that scoreline with the way that we played.\u201d</p>",

Then the tactics come in and we\u2019re working on that all the time.\u201d Stanway was in a lighthearted mood. When prodded by a journalist about her comments about spending some time in the analysis room prior to the Germany game, the Bayern Munich midfielder let out a big laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll take the hit,\u201d she said amid the giggles. \u201cBut to be fair, I did my best to try to recover from the fact I messed up from the beginning. \u201cGermany are a top side and we knew that going into it. It was difficult to prepare for because they would have thrown anything at us. We didn\u2019t really know how they would play, their shape, their formation, it took a little while to adapt to what they were doing. After 30 minutes we found our feet and found the shape we wanted to be in and that allowed us to get more on the front foot and counter and get back at the scoreline. Overall, it\u2019s a learning opportunity, we gave them that scoreline with the way that we played.\u201d",

As a former New Yorker from the Bronx, she\u2019s observed his flaws up close.</p> <p>She recalled how he was gifted huge sums of money from his real estate father; how he called for Black young men known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">Central Park Five</a> to be executed for a rape they did not commit and for which they were later exonerated; how he treated his first wife, Ivana Trump, badly.</p> <p>\u201cI know everything about Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not getting my vote.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah Waleh, 66, is also all-in for Harris, for more positive reasons: \u201cShe will bring change, she is real, not a liar. She is for the poor and working-class people.\u201d</p> <p>Waleh, a medical technician, has been urging her colleagues at her hospital and church to get out and vote early for the Democratic candidate: \u201cI\u2019m begging them. If everybody votes, I\u2019m sure she will win.\u201d</p>    <p>She might be right. The Meredith poll has tracked the extraordinary transformation in the race after Harris took over the Democratic nomination from Joe Biden.</p> <p>\u201cBiden was losing North Carolina,\u201d McLennan said. \u201cHarris\u2019s entry into the race returned the state to being 50-50 again \u2013 it\u2019s back to being purple.\u201d</p> <p>It is one thing bringing North Carolina back into contention and quite another to win.

They are doing so by focusing on abortion rights, with the Harris-Walz campaign warning that the state\u2019s current restrictive <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/north-carolina-12-week-abortion-ban-effect-20/story?id=100499149\">12-week abortion ban</a> would be tightened under a Trump administration to a total nationwide abortion ban.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Harris\u2019s entry into the race returned the state to being 50-50 again \u2013 it\u2019s back to being purple</p> <footer> <cite>David McLennan, Meredith opinion poll</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They have also sought to tie Trump to extreme Republicans further down the ballot.

But anxieties continue to swirl around the Democratic ticket, led by concerns that early turnout from African American voters, who in past cycles have swung overwhelmingly Democratic, is lower this year than at the same stage four years ago (<a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/Press/2020%20General/NC%20Absentee%20Stats%20for%202020%20General%20Election/Absentee_Stats_2020General_10232020.pdf\">37% in 2020</a>, compared with <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/Press/2024%20General/NC%20Absentee%20Stats%20for%202024%20General/2024-10-23%20Daily%20Absentee%20Stats%20Report%20-%202024%20General.pdf\">20% today</a>).</p> <p>As the months remaining until election day turn into days, and days into hours, the Harris-Walz campaign will be making last-ditch efforts to persuade Black voters to get out and vote \u2013 voters like Christian Swims, 21, a student at community college, who would be voting in his first presidential election.</p> <p>If he votes at all, that is.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t follow the election much,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friends don\u2019t talk about it.

As the months remaining until election day turn into days, and days into hours, the Harris-Walz campaign will be making last-ditch efforts to persuade Black voters to get out and vote \u2013 voters like Christian Swims, 21, a student at community college, who would be voting in his first presidential election. If he votes at all, that is. \u201cI don\u2019t follow the election much,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friends don\u2019t talk about it. People round here aren\u2019t very political.\u201d Or Joseph Rich, a Fedex worker, 28. \u201cI don\u2019t know too much about Trump and Kamala Harris,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll read up on them, but now I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Time is running out for Democrats to connect with voters like Swims and Rich. Whether or not they succeed could make all the difference.",

Japan\u2019s political future has been shrouded in uncertainty after voters punished the ruling coalition over rising prices and a funding scandal, paving the way for days of wrangling as party leaders try to form a government following a snap election that delivered no majority victor. Georgia\u2019s pro-western opposition has called on the country to protest against the disputed parliamentary victory of the ruling, Russia-aligned Georgian Dream (GD) party.

There have been other sporting events that captured the imagination, but no athletic contest in history has inspired as much global joy as Ali\u2019s victory in Kinshasa, Zaire, during the pre-dawn hours of 30 October 1974, writes Thomas Hauser. \u2026 or this: the science behind hugs After an airport in New Zealand imposed a three-minute cap on hugging in the airport\u2019s drop-off zone, Heathrow in London has told passengers to take as much time as they need saying goodbye to loved ones in departures. This is fortunate, because hugging bestows an array of physical and psychological benefits, experts say. \u201cMany of us know that it feels good to receive a hug, but we don\u2019t often stop and think about the other positive effects of hugging,\u201d says Prof Michael Banissy, a social neuroscientist at the University of Bristol and the author of When We Touch. Climate check: residents in a wildfire-prone Yosemite town eye more tourism with unease Kampgrounds of America (KOA) is eyeing a plot in Mariposa, the California mountain town near Yosemite national park, for a camping and glamping development. Should the project move forward, up to 1,000 visitors could end up spending the night on land that straddles a narrow escape route used by people fleeing previous blazes. When a fire inevitably flares again, evacuating may be far more challenging. Last Thing: inside the \u2018science\u2019 of medieval astrology A new exhibit at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles called Rising Signs: The Medieval Science of Astrology explores how astrology was taught in major European universities for centuries as part of the scientific disciplines, including medicine. Kings hired court astrologers and consulted them on questions of diplomacy and military strategy. The position of the stars and planets at the time of a person\u2019s birth was thought to affect the organs in their bodies and the diseases they might be most likely to develop.

      "body": "<p>Francis McPeake, who has died aged 82, was a third-generation Irish uilleann piper in the Belfast-based McPeake family, attracting attention not only from the Irish traditional music community, but also the English folk music scene and the world of popular music. Francis III, to distinguish him from other members of the family, gave John Lennon a lesson on playing the pipes at a party for the Beatles, and the family\u2019s music was also revered by Bob Dylan, Bono, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/28/pete-seeger\">Pete Seeger</a> and Van Morrison. </p> <p>The first piping McPeake was Francis I, who learned to play from John O\u2019Reilly, a blind piper. Francis I won competitions and in 1910 attended the Pan-Celtic Congress in Brussels. At this time, there were very few pipers in Ulster and Francis\u2019s rarity was enhanced by his unprecedented practice of playing the pipes to accompany his singing of traditional songs. </p> <p>Francis I taught his son, Francis II, to play the pipes, and in 1952, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/19/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Peter Kennedy</a>, working for the BBC, recorded the father and son playing and singing. This led to a performance at the English Folk Dance and Song Society\u2019s annual festival at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 1953 where they were enthusiastically received. Although the instrument was rare in Irish traditional music, the London visit prompted the acquisition of a harp, which was played by Francis II\u2019s brother, James. The trio visited the World Youth festival in Moscow in 1957, followed by first-prize success at the Llangollen International Eisteddfod. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlS1spbuSbo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GlS1spbuSbo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The McPeake family at home in 1964</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was against this backdrop of the family\u2019s increasing international fame, and their unique style of playing Irish music, pairing the harp and the pipes and singing, often in harmony, to their accompaniment, that Francis III took up the pipes in 1956, learning from his father. </p> <p>The son of Mary (nee O\u2019Sullivan) and Francis II, he was born in Tyrella, Co Down, where the family had been evacuated to during the second world war. When they returned home, to west Belfast, Francis III went to St Joseph\u2019s school, and later worked in labouring jobs until he was able to take up music full-time. </p> <p>He made his debut with the family group in 1962, with his sister Kathleen on harp and their cousin, Tommy McCrudden, also on pipes. The six musicians performed in a variety of permutations, with instrumentals, including the slow air An Coolin, and accompanied songs. </p> <p>Songs such as The Jug of Punch, My Singing Bird, The Old Piper, Slieve Gallon Brae and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=u-GR3oYq8fE\">The Verdant Braes of Skreen</a> were enthusiastically received by the expanding folk club scene, particularly in England. Foremost among their songs was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHQJ4lDWkLk\">Wild Mountain Thyme</a>, also known as Will Ye Go, Lassie, Go?, which Francis I wrote following the death of his first wife, using fragments of an older song that originated in Scotland. This new song was recorded by Joan Baez, the Clancy Brothers, Morrison, Dylan, Judy Collins, the Byrds, Rod Stewart, Ed Sheeran and many more, and became an anthem of the British folk revival, often sung at the end of an evening. </p> <p>In the 1960s Francis III and the family group toured Spain, the Netherlands, France and the US, as well as Britain and Ireland. Seeger had already filmed the family, including a youthful Francis, in Belfast in the early 60s, and in the US they appeared on television with Seeger and Baez. In 1967, at a party to celebrate the film Magical Mystery Tour, the McPeakes performed for the Beatles. Francis recalled that John Lennon was \u201centhralled\u201d by the sound of the pipes and keen for Francis to teach him to play; Francis was impressed by his quick uptake.</p> <p>The trio\u2019s first album, The McPeake Family of Belfast (1959), was on the Prestige label, and in 1963 Topic Records released The McPeake Family with an extended play (EP) record, both featuring the wider family including Francis III: all the tracks were rereleased on the 2009 album Wild Mountain Thyme. Francis III contributed to three family albums on the Fontana label: Irish Folk! (1964), At Home With the McPeakes and Introducing the McPeake Family (both 1965). Pleasant and Delightful on the Fontana label followed in 1967.</p> <p>After Francis I died in 1971, and with the growing Troubles in Northern Ireland, the family stopped touring. Francis III suffered an accident to his right hand which affected his playing ability. In 1977, Father McNiff of Clonard monastery in west Belfast asked Francis II and III to teach local youngsters to play the tin whistle to keep them off the streets during the Troubles. A six-week course developed into regular classes covering a variety of instruments, with Francis III taking the lead after his father\u2019s death in 1986. </p> <p>Hundreds of youngsters were taught to play at the Francis McPeake School of Music, and they swept the board at competitive festivals. Francis III continued to perform at the many concerts associated with the school, including their 21st anniversary in 1998 in the Ulster Hall. </p> <p>In 2005 he joined Kathleen, McCrudden and his son Francis IV in concert at the Belfast Opera House.

The McPeake family tradition continues, with Francis\u2019s grandson, Francis V, now playing the pipes. </p> <p>Francis featured extensively in a 2023 film, The McPeake Family: In Their Own Words, directed by his other son, Eugene, which confirmed the central role of the McPeakes in the traditional music of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Francis is survived by his wife Sarah (nee Pinkey), sons Francis and Eugene, and grandchildren, Hannah, Rebecca, Lucia and Francis.</p> <p> \u2022 Francis Joseph McPeake III, musician, born 30 April 1942; died 12 October 2024</p>",

      "body": "<p>All budgets matter, but some matter more than most. In the 100 years since Sir Winston Churchill used his debut as chancellor in 1925 to put Britain back on the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/yourcountry/collections/churchillexhibition/churchill-the-orator/gold-standard/\">Gold Standard</a>, the first budget of a parliament has often been one that lives in the memory.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a cast-iron rule. Sir Geoffrey Howe\u2019s most controversial budget was in 1981 \u2013 midterm in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first administration \u2013 when he raised taxes even though the economy was deep in recession. That decision prompted 364 economists to write to the Times in protest \u2013 and still divides the profession today.</p> <p>But if Rachel Reeves is good to her word and has a tough package of measures to announce when she reveals the contents of her red box on Wednesday, she will be following in the footsteps of many of her predecessors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/27/the-guardian-view-on-the-budget-rachel-reeves-must-have-a-narrative-not-just-numbers\">The Guardian view on the budget: Rachel Reeves must have a narrative, not just numbers | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are plenty of reasons why chancellors like to hit the ground running. It is a chance to set the direction for the parliament. It allows big structural reforms time to have an effect. And it allows an incoming government to blame its defeated opponents for any unpopular decisions they need to make.</p> <p>Here are five first budgets (or to be more accurate five budgets and one fiscal event that was as good as a budget) that have made a difference over the past half century, along with a verdict out of five on how much they broke the mould and the legacy they left.</p> <h2>Sir Geoffrey Howe, June 1979</h2>    <p>Howe wasted little time after the Conservative victory in the May 1979 election to signal a decisive break with the postwar economic consensus. His budget marked the beginning of the Tory party\u2019s monetarist experiment, under which controlling inflation through the use of higher interest rates and tough fiscal control took precedence over full employment. Markets were liberalised and there was a shift away from taxes on income in favour of taxes on consumption.</p> <p>The budget cut the top rate of tax on earned income from 83% to 60%, reduced the standard rate of income tax from 33% to 30%, doubled VAT from 8% to 15%, and announced an easing of foreign exchange controls. On the day, the most controversial aspect of the budget was the doubling of VAT, which Labour seized on as a betrayal of an election promise, but Howe\u2019s package set the pattern for years to come.</p> <p><strong>Break with the past 5/5<br>Long-term impact 4/5</strong></p> <h2>Nigel Lawson, March 1988</h2>    <p>Lawson had been chancellor since 1983 but his most memorable budget came in the aftermath of the 1987 election, won comfortably by the Conservatives in part due to their pre-election tax cuts.</p> <p>By the spring of 1988, the economy had recovered from the deep slump of the early 1980s and there were no lasting ill-effects from the stock market crash of October 1987. But Lawson did not stick to the usual post-election template. Instead of tightening policy, he took advantage of buoyant public finances to announce deep across-the-board tax cuts. The top rate of income tax was slashed from 60% to 40%, and the standard rate was cut from 27% to 25%.</p> <p>By far the most tempestuous budget day of the recent past, the deputy speaker was twice forced to clear the Commons chamber as Labour MPs voiced their opposition to the tax cuts for the better off.</p> <p>Lawson also announced that, from August, couples purchasing a home would no longer be able to qualify for double mortgage tax relief \u2013 a decision that set off a property frenzy as buyers raced to beat the deadline.</p> <p>The summer of 1988 was the peak of the Lawson boom, which came crashing down after interest rates were doubled from 7.5% to 15% in a little more than a year to cool an overheating economy.</p> <p><strong>Break with the past 2/5</strong><strong> <br>Long-term impact 2/5</strong></p> <h2>Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke, March and November 1993</h2>    <p>This was the year of two budgets, although they were essentially a single tough package to repair the damage to the public finances caused by the recession of the early 1990s.</p> <p>In March 1993, the economy was in the early stages of a recovery made possible by the pound\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1992/sep/17/emu.theeuro\">departure from the European exchange rate mechanism</a> (ERM) six months earlier.</p> <p>Growth was picking up as a result of cuts in interest rates and a fall in sterling, which made exports cheaper. However, with the recovery still fragile, Lamont announced tax increases that would come into force over time. The most controversial of these was the decision to phase in VAT on domestic gas and electricity.</p> <p>By November, the recovery was further advanced and Lamont had been replaced as chancellor by Clarke, who finished off the job started earlier in the year. In what is still the biggest tightening of fiscal policy since the second world war, Clarke froze personal tax allowances and introduced stealth taxes on insurance and airline passengers.</p> <p>In economic terms, the two 1993 budgets were a success because the tax increases ensured that benefits of lower interest rates and a falling pound went to manufacturers and exporters rather than consumers. Politically, they were massively unpopular.</p> <p><strong>Break with the past 3/5 <br>Long-term impact 3/5</strong></p> <h2>Gordon Brown, April 2002</h2>    <p>Brown had been chancellor for almost five years by the time of the carefully planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/17/economy.uk1\">2002 budget</a>, which raised taxes to pay for higher spending on the NHS.</p> <p>Labour had won a second landslide victory the previous year, but Brown was anxious about possible voter resistance to higher tax.

      "bodyText": "All budgets matter, but some matter more than most. In the 100 years since Sir Winston Churchill used his debut as chancellor in 1925 to put Britain back on the Gold Standard, the first budget of a parliament has often been one that lives in the memory. It\u2019s not a cast-iron rule. Sir Geoffrey Howe\u2019s most controversial budget was in 1981 \u2013 midterm in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first administration \u2013 when he raised taxes even though the economy was deep in recession. That decision prompted 364 economists to write to the Times in protest \u2013 and still divides the profession today. But if Rachel Reeves is good to her word and has a tough package of measures to announce when she reveals the contents of her red box on Wednesday, she will be following in the footsteps of many of her predecessors. There are plenty of reasons why chancellors like to hit the ground running. It is a chance to set the direction for the parliament. It allows big structural reforms time to have an effect. And it allows an incoming government to blame its defeated opponents for any unpopular decisions they need to make. Here are five first budgets (or to be more accurate five budgets and one fiscal event that was as good as a budget) that have made a difference over the past half century, along with a verdict out of five on how much they broke the mould and the legacy they left. Sir Geoffrey Howe, June 1979 Howe wasted little time after the Conservative victory in the May 1979 election to signal a decisive break with the postwar economic consensus. His budget marked the beginning of the Tory party\u2019s monetarist experiment, under which controlling inflation through the use of higher interest rates and tough fiscal control took precedence over full employment. Markets were liberalised and there was a shift away from taxes on income in favour of taxes on consumption. The budget cut the top rate of tax on earned income from 83% to 60%, reduced the standard rate of income tax from 33% to 30%, doubled VAT from 8% to 15%, and announced an easing of foreign exchange controls. On the day, the most controversial aspect of the budget was the doubling of VAT, which Labour seized on as a betrayal of an election promise, but Howe\u2019s package set the pattern for years to come. Break with the past 5/5 Long-term impact 4/5 Nigel Lawson, March 1988 Lawson had been chancellor since 1983 but his most memorable budget came in the aftermath of the 1987 election, won comfortably by the Conservatives in part due to their pre-election tax cuts. By the spring of 1988, the economy had recovered from the deep slump of the early 1980s and there were no lasting ill-effects from the stock market crash of October 1987. But Lawson did not stick to the usual post-election template. Instead of tightening policy, he took advantage of buoyant public finances to announce deep across-the-board tax cuts. The top rate of income tax was slashed from 60% to 40%, and the standard rate was cut from 27% to 25%. By far the most tempestuous budget day of the recent past, the deputy speaker was twice forced to clear the Commons chamber as Labour MPs voiced their opposition to the tax cuts for the better off. Lawson also announced that, from August, couples purchasing a home would no longer be able to qualify for double mortgage tax relief \u2013 a decision that set off a property frenzy as buyers raced to beat the deadline. The summer of 1988 was the peak of the Lawson boom, which came crashing down after interest rates were doubled from 7.5% to 15% in a little more than a year to cool an overheating economy. Break with the past 2/5 Long-term impact 2/5 Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke, March and November 1993 This was the year of two budgets, although they were essentially a single tough package to repair the damage to the public finances caused by the recession of the early 1990s. In March 1993, the economy was in the early stages of a recovery made possible by the pound\u2019s departure from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) six months earlier. Growth was picking up as a result of cuts in interest rates and a fall in sterling, which made exports cheaper. However, with the recovery still fragile, Lamont announced tax increases that would come into force over time. The most controversial of these was the decision to phase in VAT on domestic gas and electricity. By November, the recovery was further advanced and Lamont had been replaced as chancellor by Clarke, who finished off the job started earlier in the year. In what is still the biggest tightening of fiscal policy since the second world war, Clarke froze personal tax allowances and introduced stealth taxes on insurance and airline passengers. In economic terms, the two 1993 budgets were a success because the tax increases ensured that benefits of lower interest rates and a falling pound went to manufacturers and exporters rather than consumers. Politically, they were massively unpopular. Break with the past 3/5 Long-term impact 3/5 Gordon Brown, April 2002 Brown had been chancellor for almost five years by the time of the carefully planned 2002 budget, which raised taxes to pay for higher spending on the NHS. Labour had won a second landslide victory the previous year, but Brown was anxious about possible voter resistance to higher tax. He asked the banker Derek Wanless to conduct a year-long review into the NHS, which concluded the UK was lagging behind other developed economies in health outcomes because it was spending less than they were. This was the finding Brown had wanted and it provided him with political cover to raise national insurance contributions by one percentage point, thus laying the foundations for the largest sustained rise in health spending since the NHS was created in 1948. Louis XIV\u2019s finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, once said: \u201cThe art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing.\u201d Brown\u2019s 2002 budget was an example of skilful goose plucking. Break with the past 3/5 Long-term impact 5/5 Kwasi Kwarteng, September 2022 Technically Kwarteng\u2019s package of measures \u2013 announced less than a month after he became Liz Truss\u2019s chancellor \u2013 was a fiscal statement, not a budget. But it was as meaty as a budget and had the drama of one. Truss and Kwarteng were frustrated by the UK\u2019s sluggish growth and were prepared to do battle with the forces of economic orthodoxy. On his first day in No 11, Kwarteng sacked the Treasury\u2019s top mandarin \u2013 Sir Tom Scholar \u2013 and subsequently made it clear he would not be asking the independent Office for Budget Responsibility to provide an assessment of his plans. The unravelling of the package was swift and brutal. Within hours of Kwarteng announcing a \u00a345bn of tax cuts \u2013 including a drop in the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19%, the abolition of the top 45% rate and the scrapping of a planned increase in NICs \u2013 the pound was in freefall as the financial markets took fright. The Bank of England was forced to intervene to halt a run on UK pension funds. Mortgage rates soared. Kwarteng was called back from the annual meetings of the IMF in Washington to be sacked three weeks later. Truss didn\u2019t last much longer. Break with the past 5/5 Long-term impact 0/5",

The Baltic state, which shares a 179-mile (275km) border with Russia, has been one of the EU\u2019s strongest supporters of Kyiv and fiercest critics of Moscow under its outgoing conservative-led government. Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 promised that would not change. Polls show as many as three-quarters of Lithuania\u2019s 2.8 million people believe it could be the target of a Russian invasion in the near future. The country is already among the top Nato spenders, allocating about 3% of its GDP to defence. According to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, Lithuania is also among the top three countries in terms of aid for Ukraine in relation to the size of its economy. The Social Democrats, who were last in power from 2012 to 2016, are expected to start negotiations on forming a coalition with the centre-left Union of Democrats \u201cFor Lithuania\u201d and the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union. The centre-right party of the outgoing prime minister, Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117, Homeland Union \u2013 Lithuanian Christian Democrats, finished second with 28 seats. Its leader, the foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, resigned on Monday. Analysts have suggested the Social Democrats\u2019 desired three-way coalition, which would have only a slim majority of 74 seats, may prove too fragile to last long without the backing of a new nationalist party, Nemunas Dawn, which won 20 seats. The Social Democrats have ruled out going into government with Nemunas Dawn, led by a former MP, Remigijus Zemaitaitis, who resigned last year over allegedly antisemitic comments and is on trial on charges of inciting hatred, which he denies. In Bulgaria, meanwhile, which also held parliamentary elections \u2013 its seventh in four years on Sunday, provisional results showed the centre-right GERB party of the former prime minister Boyko Borissov finished first with 26.5% of the votes. However, there seems little likelihood of stability returning to the EU\u2019s poorest member state, which has been in in political limbo since 2021 after massive anti-corruption protests in 2020 triggered the downfall of a Borisov-led cabinet. Six elections since then have failed to yield a sustainable government. The reformist coalition We Continue the Change came second on 14.7%, and the ultra-nationalist, pro-Russian Vazrazhdane (Revival) party a close third on 13.5%. Borissov, who served as prime minister for 13 years before his downfall, on Monday described his victory as \u201ccategorical\u201d, promised he was willing compromise and said he would \u201cwork together with everyone except Revival\u201d. But analysts predicted GERB would again struggle to find coalition partners in a fragmented parliament of nine different parties. Political uncertainty has held up the flow of badly needed EU funds into Bulgaria\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and already contributed to Bulgaria\u2019s plans to join the eurozone being twice pushed back. Turnout rose slightly to 38%, up on the 34% recorded in the previous election in June, but polls showed about 60% of Bulgarians found the continuing deadlock \u201cextremely alarming\u201d. Official results are not expected for several days. If confirmed, Borissov would be handed a mandate to try to form his fourth government \u2013 but the results, which are not significantly different from the six most recent elections, do not look promising and could lead to yet another vote.",

The grandmother is short of breath, and tired. Her tiredness \u2013 and the sudden change in routine \u2013 exacerbates her dementia; she finds it hard to follow complex conversations, or even remember where she is. The nurse too is tired, having found herself thrust on to the frontlines of an unprecedented global health crisis. She and her colleagues work long hours under extreme, often traumatising, conditions, fighting a virus for which \u2013 at this point \u2013 there is not yet a vaccine, nor a cure. Go-Stop is a language they both understand.

It\u2019s totally unnecessary. It\u2019s magic. \u2022 The Game Changers: How Playing Games Changed the World and Can Change You Too by Tim Clare is published by Canongate (\u00a316.99).

The brand set out to bridge the gap between hoodies and joggers and more stylish casual wear with a utilitarian feel. Its shirts are designed to be worn both in and out of the home, and the short-sleeve short sets double as beachwear. The clothing is made using natural fibres, surplus fabrics from mills and sustainably sourced organic cotton.</p> <h2><strong>Best high street set</strong></h2> <p><strong>River Island T-shirt and short pyjamas</strong><strong>, \u00a328</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.riverisland.com/p/pink-waffle-t-shirt-and-short-pyjamas-set-379549\"><sub>riverisland.com</sub></a></p> <p>Men\u2019s sleepwear is often more about having something comfy to put on to go to the kitchen, or open the door for a delivery, than for sleeping in \u2013 and indoor shorts tick that box nicely. River Island\u2019s set in pale pink waffle jersey is a refreshing break from the navy, grey and black that dominates this genre, and it won\u2019t break the bank. This loungewear is also available in a pale mint green trouser set version.</p> <h2><strong>Best luxury underwear set</strong></h2> <p><strong>CDLP T-shirt, \u00a380, and trunks, \u00a332</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://cdlp.com/products/mens-midweight-t-shirt-black\"><sub>cdlp.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://cdlp.com/products/mens-boxer-brief-black\"><sub>cdlp.com</sub></a></p> <p>Feeling too hot in pyjamas is a common complaint, hence underwear being the number one sleep attire for many men. CDLP\u2019s trunk-style underpants are made from a soft, breathable jersey that\u2019s derived from renewable wood sources and has natural moisture-wicking properties. The matching crew neck T-shirt is made from a blend of the same jersey and pima cotton for silk-like softness. It\u2019s worth noting that these items are hard-wearing but there may be some fading over time.</p> <h2><strong>Best for traditionalists</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tekla </strong><strong>organic cotton pyjama bottoms, \u00a3140</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://teklafabrics.com/product/poplin-pants-verneuil-stripes\"><sub>teklafabrics.com</sub></a></p> <p>One man\u2019s old fashioned is another\u2019s Instagram fodder. Tekla is the PJ brand of choice for the style set. Its 100% organic cotton <a href=\"https://teklafabrics.com/category/poplin-sleepwear?product=pants\">poplin weave bottoms</a> come in 10 stripe options, including a soft yellow and six blues of varying shades and stripe widths, to satisfy even the fussiest pyjama connoisseur.

Wear them with the matching hoodie and you can even venture outside without raising any eyebrows. The 5% cashmere mix makes for a super-soft feel, but fear not \u2013 you can still chuck these in the washing machine.</p> <h2><strong>Best novelty pyjamas (but make it chic)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer printed set, \u00a33</strong><strong>5</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/pure-cotton-zebra-and-cheetah-pyjama-set/p/clp60701568\"><sub>marksandspencer.com</sub></a></p> <p>Novelty PJs really come into their own in Q4. If those in your household are fans of the matching festive pyjamas look, encourage them towards a more sustainable choice that doesn\u2019t feature reindeer or snowmen for year-long wear. Good old M&amp;S has a host of fun prints for the whole family, including an eye-catching zebra and cheetah design or, for those of us who don\u2019t want to spoil the fun but aren\u2019t bringing main character energy, there\u2019s a cheery <a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/pure-cotton-striped-pyjama-set/p/clp60701547\">candy stripe option</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.komodo.co.uk/collections/organic-cotton-pyjamas/products/jim-jam-pyjmam-mens-trouser-green\">pants in this bundle</a> are also sold individually (\u00a343), so no half-worn sets necessary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contents\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/05/17/small-blue-link-embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

The image is bleak, unnecessary and inescapably grim. So, farewell to disposable vapes, one of the most embarrassingly era-defining trends of the early 2020s.</p> <p>Defenders of the vape will argue that it\u2019s better than smoking, which is true in only a limited sense \u2013 we don\u2019t actually know the long-term effects of vaping yet. One thing I do know is that nothing in life comes without a price, and no cycle of dopamine highs and lows is good in the long run. Beyond physical health, the hedonistic cloud of vape smoke seemed to dull my mind. Lost in the hazy loop of pleasure and relaxation, I was making worse decisions, likely derailing any progress toward my real goals, and most definitely being more self-destructive in small ways. Paediatricians have warned about the effects on young vapers, who report suffering from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667009724000587\">disrupted sleep and trouble concentrating.</a> A few years after these devices gained popularity, it\u2019s clear that disposable vapes have contributed to a culture of self-gratification that\u2019s of a piece with our addiction to social media and digital devices. Together, these habits have created an epidemic of constant pleasure-seeking.</p> <p>In our post-pandemic world, disposable vapes, which notably took off around 2022, offered the ultimate easy \u201clittle treat\u201d: a quick, legal and socially approved hit. Though I\u2019d been a smoker years ago, I\u2019d long since quit and hadn\u2019t looked back. Then, I was introduced to Elf Bars \u2013 the monarch of disposable vapes \u2013 by a friend who loves nothing more than an earthly luxury. She\u2019d later feel guilty for introducing me to them. The nicotine concentration was high, the flavours delightful, the combination so compelling that it seemed like anyone could become hooked. For the masses, disposable vapes led to an unwelcome crash course in addiction \u2013 especially cruel because the habit seemed so harmless, so easy to rationalise and indulge in public. Many young users had never encountered addiction before; many adults were similarly naive about their own susceptibility.</p> <p>When I decided to quit in summer 2023, my behaviour was so erratic that you might have thought I was withdrawing from something much harder. I would toss a vape in the bin only to dig it out from under the trash less than an hour later. I couldn\u2019t work, couldn\u2019t sleep; the headaches were relentless. My entire body screamed for a vape. I\u2019d walk to the corner shop, buy one in self-loathing, and stand outside chaining hits until I tossed it in the bin opposite the shop yet again, convinced this time it was truly the end. Without the vape, I was gripped by exhaustion and the conviction that life was pointless.</p> <p>Through sheer discipline and shame at the number of mini-relapses along the way, I was only on one glorious piece of nicotine gum per day late last year. Soon, after spending a week away on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/01/should-you-trust-your-sixth-sense-the-power-of-intuition\">retreat</a> for work, I broke through into a second phase of quitting, where the idea of vaping would come to mind every half hour or so but I was able to swat it away. Today, I still can\u2019t pass by someone vaping or think about it without feeling something suspiciously close to sorrow. Meanwhile, my itch to shop, scroll, find other more nefarious modes of stimulation, hums along in the background.</p> <p>When we hit our vape-free summer next year, it might be an opportunity to rethink what we call \u201cpleasure\u201d, and consider more intentional ways of treating ourselves. I wonder if it\u2019s even possible for anyone to pull their relationship with vaping back to some moderate level \u2013 to be a \u201cnormal vaper\u201d, if such a thing exists. Disposable vapes demanded total surrender, and they received it. That\u2019s precisely why anyone who has been in my position knows that, to regain control, they need to be fully rejected.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hannah Ewens is a freelance editor and writer, and the author of Fangirls: Scenes From Modern Music Culture</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One thing I do know is that nothing in life comes without a price, and no cycle of dopamine highs and lows is good in the long run. Beyond physical health, the hedonistic cloud of vape smoke seemed to dull my mind. Lost in the hazy loop of pleasure and relaxation, I was making worse decisions, likely derailing any progress toward my real goals, and most definitely being more self-destructive in small ways. Paediatricians have warned about the effects on young vapers, who report suffering from disrupted sleep and trouble concentrating. A few years after these devices gained popularity, it\u2019s clear that disposable vapes have contributed to a culture of self-gratification that\u2019s of a piece with our addiction to social media and digital devices. Together, these habits have created an epidemic of constant pleasure-seeking. In our post-pandemic world, disposable vapes, which notably took off around 2022, offered the ultimate easy \u201clittle treat\u201d: a quick, legal and socially approved hit. Though I\u2019d been a smoker years ago, I\u2019d long since quit and hadn\u2019t looked back. Then, I was introduced to Elf Bars \u2013 the monarch of disposable vapes \u2013 by a friend who loves nothing more than an earthly luxury. She\u2019d later feel guilty for introducing me to them. The nicotine concentration was high, the flavours delightful, the combination so compelling that it seemed like anyone could become hooked. For the masses, disposable vapes led to an unwelcome crash course in addiction \u2013 especially cruel because the habit seemed so harmless, so easy to rationalise and indulge in public. Many young users had never encountered addiction before; many adults were similarly naive about their own susceptibility. When I decided to quit in summer 2023, my behaviour was so erratic that you might have thought I was withdrawing from something much harder. I would toss a vape in the bin only to dig it out from under the trash less than an hour later. I couldn\u2019t work, couldn\u2019t sleep; the headaches were relentless. My entire body screamed for a vape. I\u2019d walk to the corner shop, buy one in self-loathing, and stand outside chaining hits until I tossed it in the bin opposite the shop yet again, convinced this time it was truly the end. Without the vape, I was gripped by exhaustion and the conviction that life was pointless. Through sheer discipline and shame at the number of mini-relapses along the way, I was only on one glorious piece of nicotine gum per day late last year. Soon, after spending a week away on a retreat for work, I broke through into a second phase of quitting, where the idea of vaping would come to mind every half hour or so but I was able to swat it away. Today, I still can\u2019t pass by someone vaping or think about it without feeling something suspiciously close to sorrow. Meanwhile, my itch to shop, scroll, find other more nefarious modes of stimulation, hums along in the background. When we hit our vape-free summer next year, it might be an opportunity to rethink what we call \u201cpleasure\u201d, and consider more intentional ways of treating ourselves. I wonder if it\u2019s even possible for anyone to pull their relationship with vaping back to some moderate level \u2013 to be a \u201cnormal vaper\u201d, if such a thing exists. Disposable vapes demanded total surrender, and they received it. That\u2019s precisely why anyone who has been in my position knows that, to regain control, they need to be fully rejected.

      "body": "<p>In 2009, David Wrench was close to giving it all up. He was working as an engineer in a recording studio in north Wales but wasn\u2019t getting enough work and was struggling to pay the rent each month. An offer to do some lecturing came in and he thought: why not? When he ran this past his friend and collaborator, Julian Cope, he got a sharp response. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018Go and look in the mirror,\u2019\u201d says Wrench. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re unemployable in the real world. Find a way to make this work because you won\u2019t last five minutes, you\u2019ll go completely crazy.\u2019 Annoyingly, I knew he was right.\u201d</p> <p>Wrench didn\u2019t have to wait long for his fortunes to change. In 2010, Odessa, a track he had mixed for Caribou, was released and became a global anthem. \u201cThat opened up a whole different world,\u201d he says. He soon found himself working in New York. The very first cafe he went into was playing Odessa. \u201cHaving spent well over a decade sitting in the studio working 18-hour days, that was a big moment,\u201d he says. The momentum continued. In 2014, when albums he worked on by Jungle, FKA twigs, Glass Animals and Caribou all arrived within about a month of one another, his phone started ringing: \u201cThings haven\u2019t stopped since,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Wrench, 52, is now one of the most in-demand mixers in the game: the person who takes all the different parts of a recorded piece of music and balances them in the version that reaches your ears. \u201cIt\u2019s like the final sculpting,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes it can be a subtle process, or for some artists it\u2019s very much an exploratory part of the creative process.\u201d When FKA twigs asks for her vocals to sound like a sunset on her debut album, Wrench is the man to make that magic happen.</p> <p>He\u2019s also been sought out by Frank Ocean, David Byrne, Blur and Erasure; his sonic fingerprints are all over 2024, having mixed tracks on new or forthcoming releases by Jamie xx, Sampha, Blossoms, Ezra Collective, Kelly Lee Owens, Primal Scream and the 1975\u2019s George Daniel. \u201cWhen I met David it was apparent straight away he was a mixing engineer and musical mind working at the highest level,\u201d says Caribou\u2019s Dan Snaith. \u201cIt was only a matter of time before the world caught on to his talents.\u201d</p> <p>Wrench is also an acclaimed producer, having worked on albums for the likes of the Pretenders and Let\u2019s Eat Grandma. (The latter\u2019s Rosa Walton says he possesses \u201cpossibly the finest ears ever\u201d.) However, his role as mixer is different \u2013 he comes in once the music has already been recorded. While he doesn\u2019t possess a signature style as such, he says he loves a lot of bass, 3D-sounding records and attempting to balance clarity and cohesion. And it\u2019s easy to get a sense of why people want to work with Wrench: he\u2019s kind, patient and a good listener with an equal love for pop and avant sounds.</p>    <p>He has also released several solo albums, spanning experimental folk and synth-pop, and is a member of leftfield electronic pop duo Audiobooks. Despite his recent flush of success, Wrench\u2019s trajectory hasn\u2019t been conventional. At school in the 1980s he was actively discouraged from pursuing music. \u201cMy music teacher said I had no hope of doing anything with production,\u201d he says. He moved schools and his new physics teacher was more encouraging. He wasn\u2019t just any physics teacher, but Gorwel Owen, who would go on to produce records for Super Furry Animals and Gorky\u2019s Zygotic Mynci. He introduced Wrench to the school\u2019s four-track studio.</p> <p>Buoyed by the emerging rave scene, Wrench was soon making what might be the first ever Welsh-language acid house record as Nid Madagascar in 1990, which was released on Welsh label Ofn. He slightly recoils at the mention. \u201cI was excited by it [acid house] and trying to copy it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a school band that wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d Wrench would attend open air raves in the Welsh mountains but as the sound evolved into trance territory he moved on.</p> <p>In 1997 he released a Nick Cave-esque solo album, Blow Winds Blow, and would later support Gorky\u2019s on tour \u2013 but that decade was largely spent figuring things out. \u201cI was on benefits and trying to find something I wanted to do,\u201d he says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much work in north Wales. At the time, I was worried my life was wasting away or that I wasn\u2019t achieving anything but I look back now and those years when I was listening intently to records over and over were an invaluable part of my learning process. I\u2019ve got all those records within me.\u201d</p> <p>He blagged himself into engineering work at Bryn Derwen studios in Bangor, hoping it would get him free studio time; when he was successful, he realised he didn\u2019t know how the equipment worked, and had to cram-read the manuals the night before his first day. Yet he soon realised had a real skill for it. \u201cThe first band I recorded was a local metal band with the biggest drum kit I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he says. \u201cThey seemed happy so I took confidence from that.\u201d Then the late Scottish songwriter Jackie Leven came into the studio. Wrench says he had \u201ca fearsome reputation\u201d \u2013 but it was the start of a relationship that produced 14 albums.</p> <p>In the 00s, Wrench become deeply immersed in the Welsh language music scene, producing the indie-pop of Race Horses and Topper; psychedelic folk records by Georgia Ruth and Lleuwen; hip-hop and pop by MC Mabon and Swci Boscawen alongside more mainstream acts such as Bryn Fon and Tebot Piws. Welsh music was crucial to Wrench\u2019s journey to fine-tuning some of pop\u2019s big hitters. \u201cI could turn on Welsh radio on any night and hear my work,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was invaluable. I could then switch to BBC Radio 1 or 6 and compare, to figure how to make my productions or mixes stand up against not just other Welsh language music, but everything. If you have pride in your language and culture you want it to have the same production values as the very best there is.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear those formative, often difficult, years left their mark on Wrench. \u201cI value anyone who trusts me with working on their music,\u201d he says, with real sincerity. \u201cI never take it for granted and it\u2019s always an honour.\u201d And despite once being told he had no hope whatsoever in his field, he\u2019s even managed to spin that moment into a positive working ethos. \u201cI never say no to an artist in terms of an idea,\u201d he says. \u201cThe studio is not a place where ideas get shot down. The daftest idea can turn out to be a stroke of genius.\u201d</p>",

In 2010, Odessa, a track he had mixed for Caribou, was released and became a global anthem. \u201cThat opened up a whole different world,\u201d he says. He soon found himself working in New York. The very first cafe he went into was playing Odessa. \u201cHaving spent well over a decade sitting in the studio working 18-hour days, that was a big moment,\u201d he says. The momentum continued. In 2014, when albums he worked on by Jungle, FKA twigs, Glass Animals and Caribou all arrived within about a month of one another, his phone started ringing: \u201cThings haven\u2019t stopped since,\u201d he says. Wrench, 52, is now one of the most in-demand mixers in the game: the person who takes all the different parts of a recorded piece of music and balances them in the version that reaches your ears. \u201cIt\u2019s like the final sculpting,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes it can be a subtle process, or for some artists it\u2019s very much an exploratory part of the creative process.\u201d When FKA twigs asks for her vocals to sound like a sunset on her debut album, Wrench is the man to make that magic happen. He\u2019s also been sought out by Frank Ocean, David Byrne, Blur and Erasure; his sonic fingerprints are all over 2024, having mixed tracks on new or forthcoming releases by Jamie xx, Sampha, Blossoms, Ezra Collective, Kelly Lee Owens, Primal Scream and the 1975\u2019s George Daniel. \u201cWhen I met David it was apparent straight away he was a mixing engineer and musical mind working at the highest level,\u201d says Caribou\u2019s Dan Snaith. \u201cIt was only a matter of time before the world caught on to his talents.\u201d Wrench is also an acclaimed producer, having worked on albums for the likes of the Pretenders and Let\u2019s Eat Grandma. (The latter\u2019s Rosa Walton says he possesses \u201cpossibly the finest ears ever\u201d.) However, his role as mixer is different \u2013 he comes in once the music has already been recorded. While he doesn\u2019t possess a signature style as such, he says he loves a lot of bass, 3D-sounding records and attempting to balance clarity and cohesion. And it\u2019s easy to get a sense of why people want to work with Wrench: he\u2019s kind, patient and a good listener with an equal love for pop and avant sounds. He has also released several solo albums, spanning experimental folk and synth-pop, and is a member of leftfield electronic pop duo Audiobooks. Despite his recent flush of success, Wrench\u2019s trajectory hasn\u2019t been conventional. At school in the 1980s he was actively discouraged from pursuing music. \u201cMy music teacher said I had no hope of doing anything with production,\u201d he says. He moved schools and his new physics teacher was more encouraging. He wasn\u2019t just any physics teacher, but Gorwel Owen, who would go on to produce records for Super Furry Animals and Gorky\u2019s Zygotic Mynci. He introduced Wrench to the school\u2019s four-track studio. Buoyed by the emerging rave scene, Wrench was soon making what might be the first ever Welsh-language acid house record as Nid Madagascar in 1990, which was released on Welsh label Ofn. He slightly recoils at the mention. \u201cI was excited by it [acid house] and trying to copy it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a school band that wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d Wrench would attend open air raves in the Welsh mountains but as the sound evolved into trance territory he moved on. In 1997 he released a Nick Cave-esque solo album, Blow Winds Blow, and would later support Gorky\u2019s on tour \u2013 but that decade was largely spent figuring things out. \u201cI was on benefits and trying to find something I wanted to do,\u201d he says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much work in north Wales. At the time, I was worried my life was wasting away or that I wasn\u2019t achieving anything but I look back now and those years when I was listening intently to records over and over were an invaluable part of my learning process. I\u2019ve got all those records within me.\u201d He blagged himself into engineering work at Bryn Derwen studios in Bangor, hoping it would get him free studio time; when he was successful, he realised he didn\u2019t know how the equipment worked, and had to cram-read the manuals the night before his first day. Yet he soon realised had a real skill for it. \u201cThe first band I recorded was a local metal band with the biggest drum kit I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he says. \u201cThey seemed happy so I took confidence from that.\u201d Then the late Scottish songwriter Jackie Leven came into the studio. Wrench says he had \u201ca fearsome reputation\u201d \u2013 but it was the start of a relationship that produced 14 albums. In the 00s, Wrench become deeply immersed in the Welsh language music scene, producing the indie-pop of Race Horses and Topper; psychedelic folk records by Georgia Ruth and Lleuwen; hip-hop and pop by MC Mabon and Swci Boscawen alongside more mainstream acts such as Bryn Fon and Tebot Piws. Welsh music was crucial to Wrench\u2019s journey to fine-tuning some of pop\u2019s big hitters. \u201cI could turn on Welsh radio on any night and hear my work,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was invaluable. I could then switch to BBC Radio 1 or 6 and compare, to figure how to make my productions or mixes stand up against not just other Welsh language music, but everything. If you have pride in your language and culture you want it to have the same production values as the very best there is.\u201d It\u2019s clear those formative, often difficult, years left their mark on Wrench. \u201cI value anyone who trusts me with working on their music,\u201d he says, with real sincerity. \u201cI never take it for granted and it\u2019s always an honour.\u201d And despite once being told he had no hope whatsoever in his field, he\u2019s even managed to spin that moment into a positive working ethos. \u201cI never say no to an artist in terms of an idea,\u201d he says. \u201cThe studio is not a place where ideas get shot down. The daftest idea can turn out to be a stroke of genius.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Gabrielle Goodrick\u2019s day has barely begun and she\u2019s already poring over a stack of legal documents. As the nurses and other doctors at her clinic start seeing the first of what will be upwards of 40 patients that day, the 59-year-old family medicine doctor and owner of Camelback Family Planning \u2013 one of Arizona\u2019s few abortion clinics \u2013 has a decision to make.</p> <p>Since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade<em><strong> </strong></em>in June 2022, Arizona has banned all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 with a small but vague carveout for medical emergencies. In November, Arizona voters will get to weigh in on a ballot measure that would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/13/arizona-abortion-november-vote\">enshrine in the state constitution the right to abortion until viability</a>, or around 24 weeks.</p> <p>But that ballot initiative won\u2019t help the 32-year-old woman in Goodrick\u2019s waiting room. The woman had been thrilled five months ago when she\u2019d become pregnant, seven years after the birth of her first child, until her water broke prematurely 17 weeks into her pregnancy \u2013 far too early for her baby to survive. With no amniotic fluid left in her uterus, it\u2019s only a matter of time until an infection sets in. </p> <p>In the clinic\u2019s break room, Goodrick sets down the stack of papers \u2013 which include <a href=\"https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/R24-011.pdf\">a letter</a> four state representatives wrote to Arizona\u2019s attorney general this summer asking what qualified as a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d and the attorney general\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.azag.gov/opinions/i24-009-r24-011\">response</a>. Dressed in turquoise corduroy trousers and a white button-up, Goodrick pulls her hair into a claw clip before she begins describing the case to a few of the clinic\u2019s nurses. Across the room, her colleague Barbara Zipkin, an obstetrician-gynecologist, listens in as she strokes her 5lb, 16-year-old dog Scooter. The maltese-yorkie mix is a fixture at the clinic, regularly accompanying Zipkin into patient rooms to provide emotional support.</p>    <p>\u201cNo one will do it,\u201d Goodrick says. So far, the only known abortions after 15 weeks in the state have been performed when a patient develops a severe infection, but Goodrick doesn\u2019t want to make this patient wait that long.</p> <p>The woman\u2019s healthcare network has already said it won\u2019t end the pregnancy, and so she and her husband have started talking to a doctor in Las Vegas. But the six-hour drive to Nevada is no small hurdle. And that clinic \u2013 like most offering abortion care in the second and third trimester in the United States \u2013 only offers a procedure called dilation and evacuation. During a D&amp;E, a patient\u2019s cervix is dilated, often using small rods called laminaria that slowly expand over the course of one to two days, before a doctor empties the patient\u2019s uterus using suction or surgical instruments. It\u2019s difficult for providers to remove the fetus intact during a D&amp;E \u2013 but this woman wants to hold her baby to say goodbye.</p> <p>Camelback is one of only a handful of clinics in the US offering an alternative called induction abortion. Like a medication abortion, in which patients take the abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol to end a pregnancy in the first trimester, an induction abortion involves taking the same pills in the second or third trimester. Because the fetus is larger than in the first trimester, the misoprostol triggers contractions that are more akin to labor than an earlier medication abortion, and the procedure usually occurs in a hospital instead of at home. (Camelback manages the pain of that labor \u2013 which is quicker and less severe than childbirth \u2013 with painkillers and conscious sedation). The result is that patients \u2013 like this one \u2013 can hold and grieve the fetus afterwards, and even take home footprints.</p>    <p>There\u2019s legal risk to helping this patient \u2013 Goodrick\u2019s not sure she would do it if the state didn\u2019t have a Democratic governor and attorney general \u2013 but she\u2019ll remark later how frustrating she finds it that more doctors aren\u2019t willing to use their position to more aggressively challenge abortion restrictions. She is in a bind countless doctors have faced in the last two years, as stories of women denied emergency abortions in their home states have piled up.</p> <p>Zipkin agrees they need to act. From her perch on a black office chair, she responds, defiant: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the aftermath of Roe, patients across the United States are <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819135\">seeking abortion care later in pregnancy</a>, as a growing web of restrictions <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9382185/\">makes it increasingly difficult</a> for them to access care sooner. And the procedure most physicians offer after the first trimester, a D&amp;E, is not always the procedure patients want \u2013 for example, if they\u2019d prefer to hold their fetus after or avoid cervical dilation with laminaria.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When she found out that we could see her, she started crying. She was just overwhelmingly relieved</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the United States, abortion pills are FDA-approved through 10 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but it\u2019s still legal to use them \u201coff label\u201d later. While they\u2019re not widely prescribed later in the US, they are the standard for second- and third-trimester care in much of northern Europe \u2013 and the World Health Organization\u2019s abortion care guidelines describe how to use the pills up to and beyond 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p> <p>Goodrick and her colleagues are hopeful that educating more physicians on the use of abortion pills later in pregnancy could expand access to care across the US by allowing more physicians with labor and delivery training, rather than only doctors with the surgical skills required to perform a D&amp;E, to offer the procedure.<strong> </strong>Although<strong> </strong>conservative groups have called the abortion pill \u201cunsafe\u201d in an attempt to undo the FDA\u2019s approval of the medication, Goodrick believes it could be an equalizer for physicians.</p>    <p>In that spirit, this year they published <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590151624000017\">a study</a> sharing their experience providing hundreds of induction abortions to end pregnancies between 18 and 24 weeks before Roe fell. They also regularly host and train medical students.</p> <p>Offering that care has been harder \u2013 but not impossible \u2013 since Arizona banned abortions after 15 weeks. Since the ban went into effect, Camelback has directed patients whose pregnancies are past that mark to a clinic in southern California, where they\u2019re able to receive and take mifepristone, which stops the pregnancy from progressing. The next day, after they\u2019ve returned to Arizona, Goodrick and her team administer misoprostol, which induces contractions. They\u2019re able to do so because the pregnancy has already ended, Goodrick says, meaning they\u2019re essentially treating a stillbirth. It\u2019s a loophole that Goodrick\u2019s attorneys have reassured her is legal \u2013 and it helps patients avoid the cost of a surgical procedure and out-of-state hotel.</p> <p>But this patient, who has found her way to Camelback one day in mid-September, is the first the clinic will treat entirely in Arizona since the state\u2019s 15-week ban went into effect in 2022.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she found out that we could see her, she started crying,\u201d Goodrick said. \u201cShe was so upset still about the hospital not helping her. She was just overwhelmingly relieved.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s scary\u201d for doctors to push back against restrictions, says Goodrick \u2013 and she understands that hospitals and their legal teams are even more risk averse. But she\u2019s steadfast: \u201cI think it\u2019s up to the medical field to say [to the state], \u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Goodrick never intended to provide abortion care \u2013 but early in her career she saw the need.</p> <p>She remembers Henry Morgentaler\u2019s name appearing in the news when she was an undergraduate student at McGill University in Montreal in the 1980s. A Holocaust survivor, Morgentaler had emigrated to Canada, where he began his career, like Goodrick, as a general practitioner. Over time, he became one of the first Canadian doctors to offer vasectomies, IUDs, birth control to unmarried women, and eventually abortions \u2013 and his repeated challenges of Canadian law would lead to abortion being legalized nationwide in 1988. The next year, Goodrick enrolled in medical school.</p> <p>At the University of Vermont, Goodrick felt drawn to women\u2019s health \u2013 but not obstetrics and gynecology, a surgical specialty. Instead, she gravitated toward family medicine, where she could receive some obstetrics training but follow patients through their full lives. In 1990 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/07/us/abortion-foes-clog-vermont-courts.html\">anti-abortion protesters descended</a> on Burlington with the intention of closing two clinics there. That year, she co-founded a pro-choice alliance of medical students at the university.</p>    <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really think of abortions like, \u2018This is what I\u2019m going to do,\u2019\u201d she said. But when Goodrick began her residency at Phoenix Baptist hospital (now Abrazo Central) in 1993, she did a rotation at the local Planned Parenthood and enjoyed it. She would ultimately open a family practice clinic, where she also offered occasional abortions, though they weren\u2019t the focus of her work.</p> <p>That changed after 2000, when the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone for use in the US. Goodrick says she was the first provider in the south-west to offer the abortion pill \u2013 and she remembers patients flying in from across the country to access it.</p> <p>In those years, even though Roe was still standing, there were few physicians providing second-trimester abortions in the US, and one of the most prominent, George Tiller, was murdered in 2009. As she developed her skills in D&amp;E, Goodrick began to wonder, \u201cHow am I going to get help? How am I going to be doing this five days a week for the rest of my life?\u201d The surgical procedure required advanced training, and she worried about finding other physicians to fill in at and eventually take over her practice.</p> <p>In 2018, Goodrick was attending the International Federation of Abortion and Contraception Professionals\u2019 biannual conference in France when she walked into a session led by Swedish midwives. She discovered that it\u2019s standard in Sweden to provide second trimester abortions not with surgical instruments, but with pills.</p>    <p>\u201cWe VERY rarely use D&amp;E and almost exclusively use medical abortion,\u201d or pills, in Sweden, said Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, via email. In the 1980s, she helped develop what would become the WHO protocol for using abortion pills in the second trimester.</p> <p>\u201cDue to our geography and [the fact] that many live far from a hospital, surgical abortion in the second trimester is not feasible,\u201d she said. Today, medication abortion in the second trimester, a rarity in the US, is available \u201cin all OB-GYN clinics in the whole country\u201d, she adds. It is often performed by midwives.</p> <p>When Goodrick returned to Arizona, she told the doctors at her clinic she wanted to bring the practice to the clinic. They were wary at first. D&amp;Es had been in use in the US since the 1970s and were by far the most common way to end a pregnancy in the second trimester; today, they make up about 95% of abortions after 14 weeks in the US. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21422848/\">Studies</a> <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/S0968-8080%2808%2931378-0\">in the late 2000s</a> had found that D&amp;Es resulted in fewer complications than inductions (though <a href=\"https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-020-0889-9\">research</a> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301211522004602\">today</a> suggests they\u2019re equally safe) and many providers preferred a 20-minute procedure to hours-long labor.</p> <p>But Zipkin would get on board and today prefers the inductions. While the risk of perforating the uterus with surgical instruments during a D&amp;E is low, with induction abortions it disappears \u2013 and patients don\u2019t have to spend the day before in discomfort as laminaria dilates their cervix.</p>    <p>Although training in D&amp;E is still vital for any clinic offering care later in pregnancy \u2013 in case, for example, a patient\u2019s uterus doesn\u2019t expel all of the pregnancy tissue with pills alone \u2013 Goodrick believes the medication might allow more providers to offer abortions in areas where OB-GYNs are few and far between. </p> <p>***</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/election-abortion-ballot-measures-states\">Where will abortion be on the ballot in the 2024 US election?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are about half a dozen protesters outside Camelback when Goodrick returns to work the morning after meeting with the patient who needs help as her pregnancy approaches 20 weeks. The sight isn\u2019t unusual, and Goodrick notes that they\u2019ll be gone by the time the Arizona sun is high in the sky, pushing temperatures into the 90s on this relatively cool summer day. Two cheerful clinic escorts greet patients at their cars and use large umbrellas to block them from the protesters\u2019 views.</p> <p>As she holds the clinic door open for patients, one of the escorts \u2013 a 66-year-old sporting a rainbow vest, straw witch\u2019s hat and a bevy of buttons and pins promoting feminism and voting rights \u2013 recalls the second-trimester abortion she received in 1999. She\u2019d been trying to get pregnant and, at one of her regular prenatal appointments, her doctor realized her fetus had stopped growing, probably two weeks earlier. Her regular OB-GYN had been able to offer her a D&amp;E. \u201cNow in Arizona I would not be able to do that,\u201d she says, declining to give her name.</p> <p>The 32-year-old mother in need of care is now resting in a recliner inside. When she arrived at the clinic that morning, Zipkin gave her a small dose of misoprostol to induce labor and painkillers to ease the ensuing cramps. By lunchtime, when Zipkin sits down to sip an orange Sunkist, it\u2019s delivery time: \u201cDoctor!\u201d a nurse beckons down the hall. Within a few minutes, Goodrick joins her in the patient\u2019s room.</p>    <p>Less than an hour later, they\u2019re both back in the break room. The woman is coming out from under sedation; her husband is about to join her to say goodbye to their baby. \u201cShe did great,\u201d Zipkin says.</p> <p>Goodrick has by now spoken with the Arizona attorney general, who has reassured her the case falls under her definition of a medical emergency. But she worries the Arizona department of health will still flag the case after Camelback reports it \u2013 and that the conservative county attorney could decide to prosecute the clinic despite the state AG\u2019s position.</p> <p>She\u2019s hopeful she won\u2019t have to deal with these kinds of concerns after Arizonians vote in November on whether to enshrine the right to abortion until 24 weeks. \u201cObviously what happens federally is very important, but every state needs their own ballot initiative,\u201d Goodrick said.</p> <p>In moments like these, Goodrick reflects on the legacies of abortion providers who came before, like Dr Tiller. \u201cA lot of us still think of him. \u2018What would he do now? How would he act? How would he be calm and sure of himself?\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>It\u2019s why, she says, she told the attorney general, \u201cIn the future, if you hear of these cases and they can\u2019t get done in the hospital, tell us. We\u2019ll see them.\u201d</p>",

As the nurses and other doctors at her clinic start seeing the first of what will be upwards of 40 patients that day, the 59-year-old family medicine doctor and owner of Camelback Family Planning \u2013 one of Arizona\u2019s few abortion clinics \u2013 has a decision to make. Since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022, Arizona has banned all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 with a small but vague carveout for medical emergencies.

With no amniotic fluid left in her uterus, it\u2019s only a matter of time until an infection sets in. In the clinic\u2019s break room, Goodrick sets down the stack of papers \u2013 which include a letter four state representatives wrote to Arizona\u2019s attorney general this summer asking what qualified as a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d and the attorney general\u2019s response. Dressed in turquoise corduroy trousers and a white button-up, Goodrick pulls her hair into a claw clip before she begins describing the case to a few of the clinic\u2019s nurses. Across the room, her colleague Barbara Zipkin, an obstetrician-gynecologist, listens in as she strokes her 5lb, 16-year-old dog Scooter. The maltese-yorkie mix is a fixture at the clinic, regularly accompanying Zipkin into patient rooms to provide emotional support. \u201cNo one will do it,\u201d Goodrick says. So far, the only known abortions after 15 weeks in the state have been performed when a patient develops a severe infection, but Goodrick doesn\u2019t want to make this patient wait that long. The woman\u2019s healthcare network has already said it won\u2019t end the pregnancy, and so she and her husband have started talking to a doctor in Las Vegas. But the six-hour drive to Nevada is no small hurdle. And that clinic \u2013 like most offering abortion care in the second and third trimester in the United States \u2013 only offers a procedure called dilation and evacuation. During a D&amp;E, a patient\u2019s cervix is dilated, often using small rods called laminaria that slowly expand over the course of one to two days, before a doctor empties the patient\u2019s uterus using suction or surgical instruments. It\u2019s difficult for providers to remove the fetus intact during a D&amp;E \u2013 but this woman wants to hold her baby to say goodbye. Camelback is one of only a handful of clinics in the US offering an alternative called induction abortion. Like a medication abortion, in which patients take the abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol to end a pregnancy in the first trimester, an induction abortion involves taking the same pills in the second or third trimester. Because the fetus is larger than in the first trimester, the misoprostol triggers contractions that are more akin to labor than an earlier medication abortion, and the procedure usually occurs in a hospital instead of at home. (Camelback manages the pain of that labor \u2013 which is quicker and less severe than childbirth \u2013 with painkillers and conscious sedation). The result is that patients \u2013 like this one \u2013 can hold and grieve the fetus afterwards, and even take home footprints. There\u2019s legal risk to helping this patient \u2013 Goodrick\u2019s not sure she would do it if the state didn\u2019t have a Democratic governor and attorney general \u2013 but she\u2019ll remark later how frustrating she finds it that more doctors aren\u2019t willing to use their position to more aggressively challenge abortion restrictions. She is in a bind countless doctors have faced in the last two years, as stories of women denied emergency abortions in their home states have piled up. Zipkin agrees they need to act. From her perch on a black office chair, she responds, defiant: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d *** In the aftermath of Roe, patients across the United States are seeking abortion care later in pregnancy, as a growing web of restrictions makes it increasingly difficult for them to access care sooner. And the procedure most physicians offer after the first trimester, a D&amp;E, is not always the procedure patients want \u2013 for example, if they\u2019d prefer to hold their fetus after or avoid cervical dilation with laminaria. In the United States, abortion pills are FDA-approved through 10 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 but it\u2019s still legal to use them \u201coff label\u201d later. While they\u2019re not widely prescribed later in the US, they are the standard for second- and third-trimester care in much of northern Europe \u2013 and the World Health Organization\u2019s abortion care guidelines describe how to use the pills up to and beyond 24 weeks of pregnancy. Goodrick and her colleagues are hopeful that educating more physicians on the use of abortion pills later in pregnancy could expand access to care across the US by allowing more physicians with labor and delivery training, rather than only doctors with the surgical skills required to perform a D&amp;E, to offer the procedure. Although conservative groups have called the abortion pill \u201cunsafe\u201d in an attempt to undo the FDA\u2019s approval of the medication, Goodrick believes it could be an equalizer for physicians. In that spirit, this year they published a study sharing their experience providing hundreds of induction abortions to end pregnancies between 18 and 24 weeks before Roe fell. They also regularly host and train medical students. Offering that care has been harder \u2013 but not impossible \u2013 since Arizona banned abortions after 15 weeks. Since the ban went into effect, Camelback has directed patients whose pregnancies are past that mark to a clinic in southern California, where they\u2019re able to receive and take mifepristone, which stops the pregnancy from progressing. The next day, after they\u2019ve returned to Arizona, Goodrick and her team administer misoprostol, which induces contractions. They\u2019re able to do so because the pregnancy has already ended, Goodrick says, meaning they\u2019re essentially treating a stillbirth. It\u2019s a loophole that Goodrick\u2019s attorneys have reassured her is legal \u2013 and it helps patients avoid the cost of a surgical procedure and out-of-state hotel. But this patient, who has found her way to Camelback one day in mid-September, is the first the clinic will treat entirely in Arizona since the state\u2019s 15-week ban went into effect in 2022. \u201cWhen she found out that we could see her, she started crying,\u201d Goodrick said. \u201cShe was so upset still about the hospital not helping her. She was just overwhelmingly relieved.\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s scary\u201d for doctors to push back against restrictions, says Goodrick \u2013 and she understands that hospitals and their legal teams are even more risk averse. But she\u2019s steadfast: \u201cI think it\u2019s up to the medical field to say [to the state], \u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019\u201d *** Goodrick never intended to provide abortion care \u2013 but early in her career she saw the need. She remembers Henry Morgentaler\u2019s name appearing in the news when she was an undergraduate student at McGill University in Montreal in the 1980s. A Holocaust survivor, Morgentaler had emigrated to Canada, where he began his career, like Goodrick, as a general practitioner. Over time, he became one of the first Canadian doctors to offer vasectomies, IUDs, birth control to unmarried women, and eventually abortions \u2013 and his repeated challenges of Canadian law would lead to abortion being legalized nationwide in 1988. The next year, Goodrick enrolled in medical school. At the University of Vermont, Goodrick felt drawn to women\u2019s health \u2013 but not obstetrics and gynecology, a surgical specialty. Instead, she gravitated toward family medicine, where she could receive some obstetrics training but follow patients through their full lives. In 1990 anti-abortion protesters descended on Burlington with the intention of closing two clinics there. That year, she co-founded a pro-choice alliance of medical students at the university. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think of abortions like, \u2018This is what I\u2019m going to do,\u2019\u201d she said. But when Goodrick began her residency at Phoenix Baptist hospital (now Abrazo Central) in 1993, she did a rotation at the local Planned Parenthood and enjoyed it. She would ultimately open a family practice clinic, where she also offered occasional abortions, though they weren\u2019t the focus of her work. That changed after 2000, when the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone for use in the US. Goodrick says she was the first provider in the south-west to offer the abortion pill \u2013 and she remembers patients flying in from across the country to access it. In those years, even though Roe was still standing, there were few physicians providing second-trimester abortions in the US, and one of the most prominent, George Tiller, was murdered in 2009. As she developed her skills in D&amp;E, Goodrick began to wonder, \u201cHow am I going to get help? How am I going to be doing this five days a week for the rest of my life?\u201d The surgical procedure required advanced training, and she worried about finding other physicians to fill in at and eventually take over her practice. In 2018, Goodrick was attending the International Federation of Abortion and Contraception Professionals\u2019 biannual conference in France when she walked into a session led by Swedish midwives. She discovered that it\u2019s standard in Sweden to provide second trimester abortions not with surgical instruments, but with pills. \u201cWe VERY rarely use D&amp;E and almost exclusively use medical abortion,\u201d or pills, in Sweden, said Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, via email. In the 1980s, she helped develop what would become the WHO protocol for using abortion pills in the second trimester. \u201cDue to our geography and [the fact] that many live far from a hospital, surgical abortion in the second trimester is not feasible,\u201d she said. Today, medication abortion in the second trimester, a rarity in the US, is available \u201cin all OB-GYN clinics in the whole country\u201d, she adds. It is often performed by midwives. When Goodrick returned to Arizona, she told the doctors at her clinic she wanted to bring the practice to the clinic. They were wary at first. D&amp;Es had been in use in the US since the 1970s and were by far the most common way to end a pregnancy in the second trimester; today, they make up about 95% of abortions after 14 weeks in the US. Studies in the late 2000s had found that D&amp;Es resulted in fewer complications than inductions (though research today suggests they\u2019re equally safe) and many providers preferred a 20-minute procedure to hours-long labor. But Zipkin would get on board and today prefers the inductions. While the risk of perforating the uterus with surgical instruments during a D&amp;E is low, with induction abortions it disappears \u2013 and patients don\u2019t have to spend the day before in discomfort as laminaria dilates their cervix. Although training in D&amp;E is still vital for any clinic offering care later in pregnancy \u2013 in case, for example, a patient\u2019s uterus doesn\u2019t expel all of the pregnancy tissue with pills alone \u2013 Goodrick believes the medication might allow more providers to offer abortions in areas where OB-GYNs are few and far between. *** There are about half a dozen protesters outside Camelback when Goodrick returns to work the morning after meeting with the patient who needs help as her pregnancy approaches 20 weeks. The sight isn\u2019t unusual, and Goodrick notes that they\u2019ll be gone by the time the Arizona sun is high in the sky, pushing temperatures into the 90s on this relatively cool summer day. Two cheerful clinic escorts greet patients at their cars and use large umbrellas to block them from the protesters\u2019 views. As she holds the clinic door open for patients, one of the escorts \u2013 a 66-year-old sporting a rainbow vest, straw witch\u2019s hat and a bevy of buttons and pins promoting feminism and voting rights \u2013 recalls the second-trimester abortion she received in 1999. She\u2019d been trying to get pregnant and, at one of her regular prenatal appointments, her doctor realized her fetus had stopped growing, probably two weeks earlier. Her regular OB-GYN had been able to offer her a D&amp;E. \u201cNow in Arizona I would not be able to do that,\u201d she says, declining to give her name. The 32-year-old mother in need of care is now resting in a recliner inside. When she arrived at the clinic that morning, Zipkin gave her a small dose of misoprostol to induce labor and painkillers to ease the ensuing cramps. By lunchtime, when Zipkin sits down to sip an orange Sunkist, it\u2019s delivery time: \u201cDoctor!\u201d a nurse beckons down the hall. Within a few minutes, Goodrick joins her in the patient\u2019s room. Less than an hour later, they\u2019re both back in the break room. The woman is coming out from under sedation; her husband is about to join her to say goodbye to their baby. \u201cShe did great,\u201d Zipkin says. Goodrick has by now spoken with the Arizona attorney general, who has reassured her the case falls under her definition of a medical emergency. But she worries the Arizona department of health will still flag the case after Camelback reports it \u2013 and that the conservative county attorney could decide to prosecute the clinic despite the state AG\u2019s position. She\u2019s hopeful she won\u2019t have to deal with these kinds of concerns after Arizonians vote in November on whether to enshrine the right to abortion until 24 weeks. \u201cObviously what happens federally is very important, but every state needs their own ballot initiative,\u201d Goodrick said. In moments like these, Goodrick reflects on the legacies of abortion providers who came before, like Dr Tiller. \u201cA lot of us still think of him. \u2018What would he do now? How would he act? How would he be calm and sure of himself?\u2019\u201d she says. It\u2019s why, she says, she told the attorney general, \u201cIn the future, if you hear of these cases and they can\u2019t get done in the hospital, tell us. We\u2019ll see them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Schools are turning to innovative techniques to entice children back into the classroom, as school leaders warn that high levels of absence will become \u201cgenerational\u201d unless urgently tackled. Therapy dogs, prize vouchers, wellness sessions, taxi rides and shepherd\u2019s huts are being put to use by schools in England and Wales seeking to draw \u201canxious avoiders\u201d to regularly attend. One of the most ambitious efforts is at Mary Immaculate high school on the outskirts of Cardiff, which this summer opened a \u00a31.7m facility, the Churchill wellness centre, with funding from Cardiff council. \u201cIt\u2019s got lamps and rugs, it\u2019s a lovely open space. It doesn\u2019t look like a school,\u201d said Nadia Yassien, who runs the Bridge, the school\u2019s pastoral support programme within the centre that works with 200 of the school\u2019s 900 pupils. With no alternative provision places available nearby, the centre has become a crucial venue to help children Yassien calls \u201canxious avoiders\u201d come for lessons. \u201cWe know it is working. Pupils who had really low attendance are coming in regularly and on time and happy \u2013 and that\u2019s key because they are not going to learn if they hate the place.\u201d After a steep fall in attendance after Covid, Yassien said Mary Immaculate\u2019s rates were now above the national average for schools in Wales. Some of the improvement is thanks to Teddy, the labradoodle that has become a school celebrity when accompanying a therapist on her visits to the centre. \u201cThe children just love the dog \u2013 she does sessions with pupils one to one, and they absolutely love it. They take Teddy for a walk, and then they speak to [the therapist] and tell her what\u2019s going on, and then she can talk to us and tell us if they need further support,\u201d Yassien said. Attendance rates in England and Wales remain stubbornly lower than before the pandemic. The most recent statistics for England showed 150,000 \u201cseverely absent\u201d children missing 50% or more of school sessions last year. While awards for good attendance have long been used by schools, some are now ramping up efforts with weekly vouchers and prize draws. Southmere primary academy in Bradford offers an escalating series of rewards, including \u00a320 vouchers for classes with 100% attendance. Pupils with perfect records at the end of the year go into a draw to win a new bike. Last year Ellesmere Park high school in Salford offered a week of prize draws of \u00a350 vouchers for pupils arriving on time, rising to \u00a380 on Friday, traditionally the worst day for attendance. But school leaders say the most severely absent pupils require more than prizes. Robert Bell, the head of Evolve in Sunderland, which offers alternative provision for students in the Consilium academies chain, starts each day with a 30-minute \u201cfit to learn\u201d period to discuss each student\u2019s wellbeing. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s potential turbulence that a student might have experienced and I don\u2019t want that to influence the rest of their day. Students might come in with anxieties that they need to talk about, and if they have those things hanging over them then they are going to struggle,\u201d Bell said. The result has been a 79% improvement in attendance but Bell thinks the problem will not get better without talking more about mental health. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s generational, and parents have a diminished idea of what education is and the support the education system has. So we open our doors, three times a year, and have mental health professionals come in, so mum and dad, grandpa, grandma, sister and brother, can sit alongside them and the student and our teachers. Those are some of the most powerful days I\u2019ve ever had in education,\u201d Bell said. Kevin Buchanan, the head of EdStart Schools, which runs independent alternative provision sites in Greater Manchester and Wirral, said he was seeing students who had not had formal education for up to two years. \u201cWe have certainly seen an uptick in referrals of young people who\u2019ve been out of education for a long period of time and we\u2019re also seeing an uptick in referrals of students who have been educated at home but who are now coming back into the system,\u201d Buchanan said. EdStart\u2019s approach is to examine the barriers each child faces and make a plan to overcome them. For one child whose parents struggled to get her ready, staff phoned daily at 7.30am to check, with a taxi booked to pick her up at 8.15am, until she settled into a routine. \u201cWe\u2019ll notice that, for some young people with poor attendance, it\u2019s second or third generation. It\u2019s like: \u2018Well my gran never went to school, my mum didn\u2019t go to school.\u2019 So we say that attendance is not just a whole-school approach, it\u2019s a whole-family approach,\u201d Buchanan said. David Williams, director of inclusion at the Park academies trust (TPat) in Swindon, said he feared today\u2019s absences could also become entrenched. \u201cIt\u2019s generational \u2013 if we have children who don\u2019t go to school then their children won\u2019t,\u201d he said. Frustrated by the lack of specialist support after the pandemic, TPat opened its own \u201cschool of solutions\u201d for students. \u201cIt\u2019s based on the personal knowledge of where a child\u2019s path might lead if we don\u2019t boldly step in,\u201d said Gemma Piper, TPat\u2019s chief executive. One success has been the trust\u2019s use of two oak shepherd\u2019s huts, after Williams spotted one in a garden centre. \u201cI was increasingly conscious that we have children who find it really difficult to walk through the gate of a large, 1,500-pupil secondary school,\u201d Williams said. But the huts have been a solution: \u201cWe have positioned them by the school gates and they were originally used to get children into school in the first place, they\u2019re warm and clean and they don\u2019t look like school. \u201cThere are parents who had really struggled at school themselves and are really anxious and who you can\u2019t get into the main building \u2013 but you can get them into a shepherd\u2019s hut.\u201d",

Yet a rather different form of drama, ostensibly less realistic and less obviously relevant to contemporary politics, may in fact offer analogies that are more illuminating still.</p> <p>Richard Wagner\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgzZ_nLOJJE\">Ring of the Nibelung</a> was first performed in its entirety in the Bavarian town of Bayreuth almost 150 years ago. As the cycle of dramas begins, the dwarf Alberich, the Nibelung from whom it takes its name, gropes the beautiful Rhinemaidens and lasciviously compares their charms. They carelessly reveal that their river contains gold that could make its owner master of the world, but only if he renounces love. Alberich accepts this condition and steals the gold, an act of despoliation whose consequences ripple out through the work\u2019s four evenings. With his brother Mime as his apprentice, he makes a ring and a magic helmet that bring him supreme authority. Similarities with Donald Trump, his beauty contests and gameshows, his misogyny, his exhortations to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d and his amoral lust for power, are not hard to find.</p>    <p>Like Trump, Alberich holds on to power for much less time than he hopes. His enemies exploit his vanity to trick him out of the ring, effecting a transition whose legitimacy he will never accept. Alberich exhorts his followers to revolt, but without success, and regaining the ring is an obsession that endures for the rest of the story. In the final drama, Twilight of the Gods (G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung), Alberich enlists the help of Hagen, the son he has fathered in a loveless union with a mortal woman. Trump, too, relies on younger family members to prosecute his interests: Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner were crucial figures in his presidency, Eric and his wife Lara have recently risen to prominence, Donald Jr is a constant presence.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s latest surrogate is his vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, reputedly selected at Donald Jr\u2019s behest. Like Hagen, Vance is a vociferous advocate of marriage: in Twilight of the Gods, Hagen seeks matches for his half-siblings Gunther and Gutrune, supposedly for their benefit but in fact as part of an elaborate strategy to trick Siegfried into giving up the ring. Both Vance and Hagen offer plausibility, engaging in social interactions and vice-presidential debates with a superficial courtesy of which Trump and Alberich are incapable.</p> <p>But both are less interested in serving their promoters than in securing for themselves the ultimate prize, whether that is the ring or the 2028 Republican nomination.</p>    <p>The parallels between Biden and Wotan \u2013 the character who seizes the ring from Alberich \u2013 are equally striking. Like the 46th president, the king of the gods has accomplished much during his long career as a legislator, notably building the magnificent fortress of Valhalla.</p> <p>But he is tormented by his waning abilities, and the reluctant realisation that the task he wants to accomplish himself \u2013 the recovery of the ring from the dragon, Fafner \u2013 can only be achieved by a younger proxy: stronger, fearless and less tarnished by a lifetime of compromise. Ultimately, it is a female authority figure, older even than himself, who persuades him to abandon his ambitions. Few people know what Nancy Pelosi said to Biden in July, but the agonised confrontation between Wotan and Erda in Act III of Siegfried gives some idea of the likely emotions involved.</p> <p>Wotan\u2019s daughter, the Valkyrie Br\u00fcnnhilde, ends The Ring with an impassioned soliloquy. It is now impossible to predict whether Kamala Harris can emulate Br\u00fcnnhilde by having the last word in this year\u2019s election drama \u2013 but millions across the world cling to the hope that she will. Through most of Twilight of the Gods, Br\u00fcnnhilde is exploited and humiliated by Siegfried, the hero she thought was her husband, and Hagen, the villain who uses her for his own ends. But in the drama\u2019s final minutes, she emerges from her torment to convey a commanding message of love, laughter and joy. Harris\u2019s willingness to embody these same values, conspicuously absent from recent political discourse, fuelled her swift transformation from patronised vice-president to plausible candidate. Journalists covering her campaign frequently comment on her personal warmth; her equally exuberant running-mate, Tim Walz, observes that \u201cshe brings the joy\u201d.</p>    <p>Of course, as many have noted, joy is not a political programme, and despite Harris\u2019s success in changing the campaign\u2019s character, she has struggled to define what she would do differently from the unpopular administration she has served. Late in the day though it came, Harris\u2019s incursion into the hostile territory of Fox News, where she insisted that her presidency would not be a continuation of Biden\u2019s, was a notable effort to do just that. The interview\u2019s equivalent in The Ring is Br\u00fcnnhilde\u2019s searing encounter with Waltraute in act I of Twilight of the Gods, when she resists her sister\u2019s pleas to halt their father\u2019s decline by returning the ring to the Rhine. By doing so, she condemns Wotan to irrelevance, but also articulates what is most important to her, establishing the moral authority that allows her to command the cycle\u2019s ending as she does.</p> <p>Needless to say, the parallels between Wagner\u2019s story and that of the election only stretch so far. Incest and immolation, key motifs in The Ring, have not surfaced as themes even in the most surreal of Trump\u2019s ramblings \u2013 though with a week to go, anything remains possible. Nor are there many swords and spears, dragons or talking birds in today\u2019s American politics. Intrepid heroes, too, are notably absent, though perhaps there have been enough would-be Siegfrieds among Biden\u2019s 45 predecessors. But if we take The Ring less literally, it offers extraordinary insights into how power passes from one generation to another, into the consequences of denuding the Earth of its resources, and into the transformative potential of love.</p> <p>Wagner has often been appropriated by the political right, notoriously during the Third Reich, and there is plenty in his writing to encourage fascists and authoritarians, not least the disgustingly antisemitic tracts that disfigure his posthumous reputation. But at the time he conceived The Ring, Wagner was a leftwing revolutionary, working to overthrow the regime in Saxony that employed him as Kapellmeister. As his idealism curdled into resignation, he experimented with different endings, giving Br\u00fcnnhilde words that echoed the philosophy of renunciation of his new intellectual hero, Arthur Schopenhauer. He ultimately decided not to set these words, giving the final say instead to music, and to an ecstatic melody that he told his wife Cosima represented the \u201cglorification of Br\u00fcnnhilde\u201d.</p>    <p>The Ring is many things: a practical realisation of a revolutionary theory of musical theatre; a compendium of brilliant orchestral sounds; a monumental physical and psychological challenge for singers; for some, a philosophical meditation or political tract. But it is also, perhaps above all, a supreme piece of storytelling, one that only truly exists when played out in a theatre. This need for perpetual recreation makes The Ring inescapably not just a story of its own time but of ours too, one that absorbs and reflects its audience\u2019s preoccupations. And by allowing music to take flight in his drama\u2019s final moments, Wagner invites his listeners to fill the imaginative space he has opened up, connecting his concerns with our own.</p> <p>Like The Ring, this election campaign still permits many possible endings, and like Wagner, the American electorate is leaving it uncomfortably late in the process to clarify which will prevail. The ultimate fate of Alberich is left ambiguous: almost uniquely among The Ring\u2019s major characters, he is neither shown nor described as dying, though his world-view is discredited and his scheming thwarted, and he plays no part in the cycle\u2019s final act. Perhaps the one certainty about this election is that whether defeated or victorious, Trump will not remain similarly silent.

In some cases, paedophiles had commissioned the images, supplying photographs of children with whom they had contact in real life.</p> <p>He was also found guilty of encouraging other offenders to commit rape. </p> <p>He sold his images in internet chatrooms, where he also discussed child sexual abuse with other offenders, making about \u00a35,000 during an 18-month period by selling the images online.</p> <p>While there have been previous convictions for \u201cdeepfakes\u201d, which typically involve one face being transferred to another body, Nelson created 3D \u201ccharacters\u201d from innocent photographs.</p> <p>Sentencing Nelson at Bolton crown court on Monday, judge Martin Walsh said it was \u201cimpossible to know\u201d if children had been raped as a result of his images. Walsh said Nelson had no regard for the harm caused by distributing the \u201charrowing and sickening\u201d material.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere seems to be no limit to the depths of depravity exhibited in the images that you were prepared to create and exhibit to others.\u201d</p> <p>Nelson was caught after he told an undercover police officer in an online chatroom that he charged \u00a380 to create a new character, using supplied pictures, Bolton crown court heard.</p> <p>\u201cHe stated: \u2018I\u2019ve done beatings, smotherings, hangings, drownings, beheadings, necro, beast, the list goes on\u2019 with a laughing emoji,\u201d David Toal, for the prosecution, said.</p> <p>The court heard that Nelson was arrested in June last year. \u201cHe said he felt vile and that his mind was corrupted,\u201d Toal said.</p> <p>\u201cHe considered that his offending had got out of control,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Police searches of his devices also revealed that Nelson had exchanged messages with three separate individuals, encouraging the rape of children under 13.</p> <p>During the course of the investigation, officers identified suspects and victims worldwide, including in Italy, France and the US.</p> <p>Nelson was later found guilty of encouraging the rape of a child under 13, attempting to incite a boy under 16 to engage in a sexual act, distributing and making indecent images, and possessing prohibited images.</p> <p>Nelson appeared in the dock wearing a waistcoat and tie. He waved to his parents in the public gallery as he came into court, but sat with his head down for most of the hearing.</p> <p>Defending Nelson, Robert Elias told the court he had lived a \u201clonely bedroom life in his parents\u2019 home\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he was seeking primarily was validation, congratulations and a sense of belonging in a community. He was earning relatively small amounts of money and desperately wanted validation.<strong><br><br></strong>\u201cHe plunged down the rabbit hole to this sort of fantasy life and became completely engrossed in it. He has brought his life crashing down around him, to the shock and horror of his immediate family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is extremely disturbing that Hugh Nelson was able to take normal photographs of children and, using AI tools and a computer programme, transform them and create images of the most depraved nature to sell and share online,\u201d Jeanette Smith, specialist prosecutor for the CPS, said.</p> <p>\u201cTechnology is rapidly evolving and, unfortunately, so too is its risk to children. I hope this conviction sends a clear message to those who exploit this technology and inflict harm on children: you will be robustly pursued by law enforcement, prosecuted by the CPS and brought to justice.\u201d</p> <p>AI sexual abuse images are presenting new challenges in policing, with other forces turning to GMP for support with new investigations.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason [this case] was very different is because it challenges the kind of view of what an indecent image of a child is,\u201d DCI Jen Tattersall of GMP\u2019s sex offender management unit said.</p> <p>She added: \u201cThe computer-generated imagery trend is now becoming more prevalent, not only in GMP \u2013 but in other forces,\u201d she added, saying that in the last week, detectives had begun investigations into two new cases involving computer-generated images.</p> <p>\u201cSo at some point that is going to not be the exception any more, and it\u2019s going to be the norm.\u201d</p> <p>The Nelson case was \u201cthe first to really test\u201d the law around indecent images that had been digitally manipulated, she said, and GMP had worked with specialists at the CPS and the National Crime Agency to secure the prosecution.</p> <p>As well as advances in technology, changes in behaviour in recent years have made policing the internet offences more difficult. \u201cCovid has had a massive effect in the online space,\u201d Tattersall said. \u201cA lot more people are online.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe amount of platforms has just massively increased, so that\u2019s a real challenge,\u201d she added.</p> <p>While AI can present opportunities for law enforcement, Tattersall said, the increasingly sophisticated technology also presents a significant threat for police forces, particularly as there is a risk that it may evolve faster than existing criminal legislation.</p> <p>She added: \u201cThe reality is, it is going to represent a real challenge for us just because of how easy it is to do, and how easy it is to manipulate an image that is really innocent, and make it into something that is really abusive and indecent.\u201d</p> <p>However, she said the Nelson case \u201csends a clear message to criminals that you might use technology, and manipulate things, and test the flex of the law, but actually we are still going to prosecute you. We\u2019re going to put you in prison\u201d.</p>",

In some cases, paedophiles had commissioned the images, supplying photographs of children with whom they had contact in real life. He was also found guilty of encouraging other offenders to commit rape. He sold his images in internet chatrooms, where he also discussed child sexual abuse with other offenders, making about \u00a35,000 during an 18-month period by selling the images online. While there have been previous convictions for \u201cdeepfakes\u201d, which typically involve one face being transferred to another body, Nelson created 3D \u201ccharacters\u201d from innocent photographs. Sentencing Nelson at Bolton crown court on Monday, judge Martin Walsh said it was \u201cimpossible to know\u201d if children had been raped as a result of his images. Walsh said Nelson had no regard for the harm caused by distributing the \u201charrowing and sickening\u201d material. He added: \u201cThere seems to be no limit to the depths of depravity exhibited in the images that you were prepared to create and exhibit to others.\u201d Nelson was caught after he told an undercover police officer in an online chatroom that he charged \u00a380 to create a new character, using supplied pictures, Bolton crown court heard. \u201cHe stated: \u2018I\u2019ve done beatings, smotherings, hangings, drownings, beheadings, necro, beast, the list goes on\u2019 with a laughing emoji,\u201d David Toal, for the prosecution, said. The court heard that Nelson was arrested in June last year. \u201cHe said he felt vile and that his mind was corrupted,\u201d Toal said. \u201cHe considered that his offending had got out of control,\u201d he added. Police searches of his devices also revealed that Nelson had exchanged messages with three separate individuals, encouraging the rape of children under 13. During the course of the investigation, officers identified suspects and victims worldwide, including in Italy, France and the US. Nelson was later found guilty of encouraging the rape of a child under 13, attempting to incite a boy under 16 to engage in a sexual act, distributing and making indecent images, and possessing prohibited images. Nelson appeared in the dock wearing a waistcoat and tie. He waved to his parents in the public gallery as he came into court, but sat with his head down for most of the hearing. Defending Nelson, Robert Elias told the court he had lived a \u201clonely bedroom life in his parents\u2019 home\u201d. \u201cWhat he was seeking primarily was validation, congratulations and a sense of belonging in a community. He was earning relatively small amounts of money and desperately wanted validation. \u201cHe plunged down the rabbit hole to this sort of fantasy life and became completely engrossed in it. He has brought his life crashing down around him, to the shock and horror of his immediate family.\u201d \u201cIt is extremely disturbing that Hugh Nelson was able to take normal photographs of children and, using AI tools and a computer programme, transform them and create images of the most depraved nature to sell and share online,\u201d Jeanette Smith, specialist prosecutor for the CPS, said. \u201cTechnology is rapidly evolving and, unfortunately, so too is its risk to children. I hope this conviction sends a clear message to those who exploit this technology and inflict harm on children: you will be robustly pursued by law enforcement, prosecuted by the CPS and brought to justice.\u201d AI sexual abuse images are presenting new challenges in policing, with other forces turning to GMP for support with new investigations. \u201cThe reason [this case] was very different is because it challenges the kind of view of what an indecent image of a child is,\u201d DCI Jen Tattersall of GMP\u2019s sex offender management unit said. She added: \u201cThe computer-generated imagery trend is now becoming more prevalent, not only in GMP \u2013 but in other forces,\u201d she added, saying that in the last week, detectives had begun investigations into two new cases involving computer-generated images. \u201cSo at some point that is going to not be the exception any more, and it\u2019s going to be the norm.\u201d The Nelson case was \u201cthe first to really test\u201d the law around indecent images that had been digitally manipulated, she said, and GMP had worked with specialists at the CPS and the National Crime Agency to secure the prosecution. As well as advances in technology, changes in behaviour in recent years have made policing the internet offences more difficult. \u201cCovid has had a massive effect in the online space,\u201d Tattersall said. \u201cA lot more people are online.\u201d \u201cThe amount of platforms has just massively increased, so that\u2019s a real challenge,\u201d she added. While AI can present opportunities for law enforcement, Tattersall said, the increasingly sophisticated technology also presents a significant threat for police forces, particularly as there is a risk that it may evolve faster than existing criminal legislation. She added: \u201cThe reality is, it is going to represent a real challenge for us just because of how easy it is to do, and how easy it is to manipulate an image that is really innocent, and make it into something that is really abusive and indecent.\u201d However, she said the Nelson case \u201csends a clear message to criminals that you might use technology, and manipulate things, and test the flex of the law, but actually we are still going to prosecute you. We\u2019re going to put you in prison\u201d.",

It\u2019s going to be on the ballot on November 5 as Proposition 6, and if it passes, prisoners will no longer be able to be forced to work for slave wages. While it\u2019s going to have a direct and almost immediate impact on all prisoners, no matter their race, it will be felt most by Black Americans, who are disproportionately represented in California state prisons and jails.</p> <p>Another was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/27/california-slavery-apology-reparation\">formal apology bill</a> [which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom\">Newsom</a> signed in September]. When most Americans think about reparations, they think about money or a check, but compensation is just one form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/31/more-than-money-the-logic-of-slavery-reparations\">reparations</a> under international law. The legal definition comprises five forms, one of which is satisfaction (the other three are restitution, rehabilitation and guarantees of non-repetition), which can relate to something like an apology.</p> <p>But an official recognition of wrongdoing from the state does more than check off a box.

We took that mandate very seriously.</p> <p>We hired five trained economists to help us crunch the numbers to figure out what compensation could look like.

So, while most of us think there should be reparations \u2013 and will be in line if that day comes \u2013 the majority of us don\u2019t think that day will ever come.</p> <p>I think the work of the taskforce has truncated that hope gap a little bit.

      "bodyText": "California is often celebrated as a leader in the growing movement for reparations for Black Americans. In 2020, it announced its first-in-the-nation reparations taskforce, which was charged with studying the issue and making recommendations for redress. Since then, it\u2019s inspired similar initiatives across the US. But actually implementing those reparations proposals hasn\u2019t been as easy. Over the past year, members of California\u2019s Legislative Black Caucus put forward a package of bills that drew on the taskforce\u2019s policy recommendations released last June. They included initiatives to increase access to education for Black Californians, prohibit race-based discrimination in schools and workplaces, and offer restitution for mid-century racist eminent domain programs in which the homes and businesses of Black residents were seized by the state. After final votes were taken in August, fewer than half the bills passed. Kamilah Moore, a reparatory justice scholar and attorney who chaired the state\u2019s reparations taskforce, spoke to the Guardian about what these mixed results mean, where the movement goes from here, and how the elections could shape the future fight for reparations. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length. When the legislative session closed at the end of August, six of the 14 priority bills were ultimately passed and signed by the governor. What do you make of this \u2013 is this a success or a setback? It\u2019s a mix of both. The taskforce worked for two years to compile evidence to justify a claim for reparations.

      "bodyText": "In testimony to Congress last year, David McCormick, now the Republican candidate for US Senate in Pennsylvania, said that as CEO of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, he \u201cheld deep reservations\u201d about \u201cthe moral and patriotic hazards of doing business in China\u201d. As CNN reported, between 2017 and 2021, such qualms did not stop McCormick overseeing an increase in Bridgewater\u2019s Chinese holdings from $1.6m to $1.77bn. Nor, according to Bloomberg, did Bridgewater flinch from significant investments in companies that supply the Chinese military. It has also been reported that McCormick oversaw investment in a Chinese fentanyl producer and, as HuffPost put it, \u201cprofited from China trade policies he helped shape\u201d as a deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs under George W Bush. Denying wrongdoing, McCormick throws claims of hypocrisy back at his opponent, the incumbent Democrat Bob Casey, over his own investment links to companies from China and other countries.

      "body": "<p>If the erotic thriller\u2019s task is to seduce its audience, this preposterous film instead subjects you to a sexy ordeal that your mind will attempt to blot out later. It\u2019s almost a match for Tommy Wiseau\u2019s infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/02/tommy-wiseau-james-franco-the-room-the-disaster-artist-best-friends\">The Room</a> in the car-crash Californian melodrama stakes. But a kind of visual floridness, resulting from its penchant for the unspeakably kitsch, nudges it vaguely in the direction of competence and away, sadly, from unmitigated disaster.</p> <p>Kate (played by co-director Crystal J Huang) is a modern-day geisha in Los Angeles assigned assassination jobs by a Japanese secret society. Prolonged meditation would be needed to divine what the poor souls have done to deserve it. Or how anyone could be driven to kill themselves, as is apparently the case with the first victim we see, by someone with all the charisma and body heat of a polygon character in a 1990s video-game cutscene. And then there is the mystery of why Kate takes all these saps to her ballroom dancing class \u2013 attracting the attention of a detective who for some reason asks his ex-detective friend Remy (Gilles Marini) to do some digging on her, before he even knows Remy is married to fiery dance instructor Amelia (Karina Smirnoff).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3amokjpzNM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D3amokjpzNM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It all makes about as much sense as Michael Madsen being part of this shadowy Asian cabal (presumably grasping for Kill Bill kudos).

      "bodyText": "If the erotic thriller\u2019s task is to seduce its audience, this preposterous film instead subjects you to a sexy ordeal that your mind will attempt to blot out later. It\u2019s almost a match for Tommy Wiseau\u2019s infamous The Room in the car-crash Californian melodrama stakes. But a kind of visual floridness, resulting from its penchant for the unspeakably kitsch, nudges it vaguely in the direction of competence and away, sadly, from unmitigated disaster. Kate (played by co-director Crystal J Huang) is a modern-day geisha in Los Angeles assigned assassination jobs by a Japanese secret society. Prolonged meditation would be needed to divine what the poor souls have done to deserve it. Or how anyone could be driven to kill themselves, as is apparently the case with the first victim we see, by someone with all the charisma and body heat of a polygon character in a 1990s video-game cutscene. And then there is the mystery of why Kate takes all these saps to her ballroom dancing class \u2013 attracting the attention of a detective who for some reason asks his ex-detective friend Remy (Gilles Marini) to do some digging on her, before he even knows Remy is married to fiery dance instructor Amelia (Karina Smirnoff). It all makes about as much sense as Michael Madsen being part of this shadowy Asian cabal (presumably grasping for Kill Bill kudos). With this wannabe high-class hotchpotch of paso dobles, private photography sessions and eastern refinement, Huang and co-director Nicholas Ryan obviously feel this is a masterclass in elegance. But that\u2019s hard to maintain after a scene in which Kate cracks a walnut with her lady-parts \u2013 which basically sums up the film\u2019s ruthless approach to plotting. Of course Remy falls under Kate\u2019s spell; just the first in a grimly inevitable daisy-chain of torrid hook-ups.

      "body": "<p>My family had always wanted a dog. We had tried without success to take on a rescue, who had refused to be taken out for a walk and peed on the carpet in a powerful display of petulance. So when the elderly lady who lived opposite us told us that her dog, Flossie, an orange and white border collie cross, was pregnant as a result of what was described as a \u201cstreet accident\u201d, my then husband, two young sons and I said that the puppy might just be the pet we were looking for.</p> <p>And so it proved. We all fell immediately for Flossie\u2019s pup \u2013 she was an adorable little creature. But what were we going to call her? At that time, Shirley Williams, then the education secretary, had unveiled a plan to close down the small college of education in Scarborough where my husband was a lecturer. I no longer remember if it was he or I who suggested: \u201cIf we call the puppy Shirley Williams and train her, we can say that Shirley Williams does whatever we tell her to do.\u201d</p> <p>The name stuck. The puppy had black and brown fur, and was somewhat unruly-looking. It seemed a not inappropriate name.</p> <p>We lived near the sea in a North Yorkshire village. Shirley developed a dislike for fishers in waders and would nip at their rubber-clad heels. On holidays in our favourite part of north Wales, we often tied her up to our windbreak to stop her from chasing fishers down the beach. She never did any damage, as far as I know. She did, however, have an annoying habit of chasing cricket balls at the local recreation ground. </p> <p>Shirley was also a favourite with pupils in the primary schools where my husband was supervising teaching practice. I still have, somewhere, a picture drawn by one such pupil, with the title \u2018I lac Shirley\u2019.</p> <p>We eventually moved to Wiltshire, where Shirley spent her final few years. Until our Yorkshire house was sold, we rented the caretaker\u2019s house of a local primary school.

      "bodyText": "My family had always wanted a dog. We had tried without success to take on a rescue, who had refused to be taken out for a walk and peed on the carpet in a powerful display of petulance. So when the elderly lady who lived opposite us told us that her dog, Flossie, an orange and white border collie cross, was pregnant as a result of what was described as a \u201cstreet accident\u201d, my then husband, two young sons and I said that the puppy might just be the pet we were looking for. And so it proved. We all fell immediately for Flossie\u2019s pup \u2013 she was an adorable little creature. But what were we going to call her? At that time, Shirley Williams, then the education secretary, had unveiled a plan to close down the small college of education in Scarborough where my husband was a lecturer. I no longer remember if it was he or I who suggested: \u201cIf we call the puppy Shirley Williams and train her, we can say that Shirley Williams does whatever we tell her to do.\u201d The name stuck. The puppy had black and brown fur, and was somewhat unruly-looking. It seemed a not inappropriate name. We lived near the sea in a North Yorkshire village. Shirley developed a dislike for fishers in waders and would nip at their rubber-clad heels. On holidays in our favourite part of north Wales, we often tied her up to our windbreak to stop her from chasing fishers down the beach. She never did any damage, as far as I know. She did, however, have an annoying habit of chasing cricket balls at the local recreation ground. Shirley was also a favourite with pupils in the primary schools where my husband was supervising teaching practice. I still have, somewhere, a picture drawn by one such pupil, with the title \u2018I lac Shirley\u2019. We eventually moved to Wiltshire, where Shirley spent her final few years. Until our Yorkshire house was sold, we rented the caretaker\u2019s house of a local primary school. We discovered that Shirley hated being left alone in the house, when we heard her howling as we came back from drinks in a local pub. From then on, she came to work with me and was happy to sit in the car while I got on with work in schools. Once we had bought a house not far outside Swindon, we enjoyed fields and countryside on our doorstep and she was happy to spend the days at home, with early-morning and late-afternoon runs. Shirley survived to the good age of 17 or so. She lived through my elder son leaving home for university and his first job, and the end of my marriage. She died at home while my younger son was away at camp with the Venture Scouts. By then, I had another pet, a cat inherited from my elder son\u2019s student house.

BDI\u2019s research backed up findings from the Brennan Center indicating that 70% of election officials said that threats had increased in 2024, and 38% had personally experienced threats, up from 30% last year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/people/shannon-hiller\">Shannon Hiller, BDI\u2019s executive director</a>, said: \u201cWe continue to face elevated threats and risk to local officials across the board,\u201d however in 2024, \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot more preparation and there\u2019s a clearer understanding about how to address those threats now.\u201d</p> <p>Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) said that talk of election fraud using drop boxes had returned in 2024. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an election-denying organization, whether it\u2019s Mike Lindell, True the Vote or more local outfits in various states that aren\u2019t talking about patrolling drop boxes and watching voters while they\u2019re voting,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>From disinformation to violent threats</h2> <p>Beirich\u2019s warnings are reflected in ongoing AFPP Telegram<strong> </strong>chats, where any prospect of a Harris victory is met with conspiracy theories, apocalyptic narratives, and sometimes threats.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s review of the materials found many instances in which disinformation or exaggerated claims in the media or from rightwing public figures led directly to violent rhetoric from members of the chat.</p> <p>On 13 March, a user linked to a story in the Federalist which <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2024/03/13/doj-is-using-bidenbucks-to-encourage-illegals-and-felons-to-vote-says-mississippi-secretary-of-state/\">uncritically covered</a> a claim by the Mississippi secretary of state, Michael Watson, that the Department of Justice was \u201cusing taxpayer dollars to have jails and the US Marshals Service encourage incarcerated felons and noncitizens to register to vote\u201d on the basis of Joe Biden\u2019s March 2021 <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/\">executive order</a> aimed at expanding access to voting.</p> <p>A user, \u201c@Wilbo17AZ\u201d, replied: \u201cIf we don\u2019t fight this with our every waking breath, we are done. Expect war.\u201d</p> <p>On 24 June, a user posted <a href=\"https://archive.is/eF9Co\">an article</a> from conspiracy-minded, Falun Gong-linked news website Epoch Times, which reported on the supreme court\u2019s rejection of appeals from a Robert F Kennedy-founded anti-vaccine non-profit.</p> <p>The court declined to hear the appeals over lower court\u2019s determinations that the non-profit had no standing to sue the Food and Drug Administration over its emergency authorization of Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic.</p> <p>In response, another user, \u201ccybercav\u201d, wrote: \u201cI do not see any path forward for our Republic that doesn\u2019t include \u2018Purge and Eradicate\u2019 being the general orders for both sides of the next civil war.\u201d</p> <p>In January, the @AFPP_US account posted a link to an opinion column on the Gateway Pundit by conspiracy theorist Wayne Allyn Root. Root characterized cross-border immigration as an invasion in the piece, and concluded by telling readers to \u201cPray to God. Pray for a miracle. Pray for the election in November of President Donald J Trump.\u201d</p> <h2>Fueling paranoia</h2> <p>Over the summer, overseas events fueled the paranoia of chat members.</p> <p>On 6 August the @AFPP_US account posted a link to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/06/police-officers-injured-in-plymouth-and-disorder-in-belfast-as-violence-spreads\">Guardian reporting</a> on anti-immigrant riots that took place in the UK over the summer.</p> <p>The article described the riots as \u201cfar-right violence\u201d; @AFPP_US captioned the link \u201c\u2018Far Right\u2019 = \u2018Stop raping women and stabbing children\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The next day, the same account apparently attempted to link the riots to UK gun laws, which are more restrictive than the US.</p> <p>The stimulus was a story on the riots by conspiracy broadcaster Owen Shroyer, an employee of Alex Jones who was sentenced to two months in prison for entering a restricted area at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.</p>    <p>@AFPP_US wrote: \u201cUK is a failed state and possession of the Calaphite [sic]. The imperialists have become the Imperiled. This is what just a few generations of disarmament and pussification hath wrought.\u201d</p> <p>One major vector of bad information in the A22 chats is the Gateway Pundit, a pro-Maga website operated by Jim Hoft. That website has been a noted source of election disinformation for years. Earlier this month Hoft\u2019s organization <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/gateway-pundit-defamation-lawsuit-election-workers\">settled a defamation suit</a> with two election workers that it had falsely accused of election fraud. Accountability non-profit Advance Democracy Inc <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/09/28/gateway-pundit-election-claims/75419017007/\">reported in August</a> that in the first nine months of 2024 Hoft had published at least 128 articles referencing election fraud and election workers.</p> <p>Gateway Pundit articles were shared many times in the chat.</p> <p>On 21 January, the @AFPP_US account shared a Gateway Pundit story by Hoft in which he claimed that liberal philanthropist and chair of the Open Society Foundation, Alexander Soros, had posted a coded message advocating the assassination of a re-elected President Trump.</p> <p>The basis was that Soros\u2019s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240122183413/https://twitter.com/AlexanderSoros/status/1749234395192414308\">post</a> carried a picture of a bullet hole and a hand holding $47. But those pictures came from a story in the Atlantic, about falling crime rates, that Soros was linking to in the post.</p> <h2>\u2018Millions of illegals\u2019</h2> <p>On at least one occasion, the Gateway Pundit was quoted in the group because it was amplifying the claims of another major source of disinformation for A22: Elon Musk.</p> <p>The Gateway Pundit article posted to the chat in January was titled \u201cJUST IN \u2026 Elon Musk Rips Mark Zuckerberg for Funding Illegal Voting Vans in 2020 Election\u201d. It highlighted Musk\u2019s false claim that Zuckerberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/12/08/943242106/how-private-money-from-facebooks-ceo-saved-the-2020-election\">funding of county-level voting apparatuses</a> in 2020 was illegal.</p> <p>As elections approached, AFPP members added more of Musk\u2019s pronouncements into the stew of disinformation on the site, with a particular emphasis on anti-immigrant material.</p> <p>On 7 September, as rightwing actors stoked panic about Haitian immigrants, @AFPP_US posted a link to a Musk post quote-posting a video of Harris addressing the need to support Haitian migrants with the comment: \u201cVote for Kamala if you want this to happen to your neighborhood!\u201d</p> <p>On 29 September, the AFPP lead account linked to a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840640583972327867\">Musk post</a> that claimed \u201cMillions of illegals being provided by the government with money for housing using your tax dollars is a major part of what\u2019s driving up costs\u201d.</p> <p>On 1 October, the @AFPP_US account <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840409051357696324\">shared an X post</a> in which Musk asserted that \u201cif Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election\u201d, and wove that claim into a narrative resembling the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory, claiming that \u201cDemocrats are expediting\u201d the conversion of \u201cillegals\u201d to citizens in an attempt to make America a \u201cone-party state\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/us-militia-membership-military-police-american-patriot-three-percenter-website-leak\">reported in 2021</a> that a separate AP3 website leak, which exposed the paramilitary organization\u2019s membership list, showed that at that time members included serving military and law enforcement officers.</p> <p>In August, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-secret-ap3-militia-american-patriots-three-percent\">ProPublica</a> reported on an earlier leak of AP3 materials from the same source, showing that AP3 had carried out vigilante operations on the Texas border, and had forged close ties with law enforcement officers around the country.</p> <p>Beirich said that chatter monitored by the organization has obsessively focused on the narrative of illegal immigrants voting in a \u201crigged\u201d election. \u201cNon-citizens voting is the big fraud that they\u2019re talking up,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Wired <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/leaked-messages-militias-ap3-voter-intimidation-plan/\">reported</a> that the current leak showed evidence of plans to carry out operations \u201ccoordinated with election denial groups as part of a plan to conduct paramilitary surveillance of ballot boxes during the midterm elections in 2022\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leaked and public chats from Arizona-based \u201cpoll watching\u201d activists aligned with a far-right militia group show how their election paranoia has been fueled by a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theories and disinformation from rightwing media outlets and influencers, including Elon Musk. The materials come from two overlapping election-denial groups whose activists are mostly based in Arizona, one of seven key swing states that will decide the US election and possibly end up at the center of any disputed results in the post-election period. Chat records from a public-facing channel for the America First Polling Project (AFPP) were made available to reporters by transparency group Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDOSecrets). The activist who leaked those materials to DDOSecrets provided the Guardian directly with an archive of the Arizona 2022 Mid-Term Election Watch (A22) chat channel. The materials offer a window into the way in which the rightwing information environment \u2013 and the unverified, distorted or false information it proffers \u2013 erode faith in elections, and encourage those who would violently disrupt them. From the media to far-right conspiracy The materials underline previously reported links between poll watching groups and the American Patriots Three Percent (AP3) militia, such that the militia provided \u201cparamilitary heft to ballot box monitoring operations\u201d. At least half a dozen pseudonymous activist accounts are present across all of the chats, and early posts in the AFPP chat show activists at \u201ctailgate parties\u201d that brought together election denial groups and militia members ahead of the 2022 midterms election. They also show the broad cooperative effort among a range of election denial groups, whose activities were fueled by disinformation from high-profile conservative activists. On 6 October 2022, in one of the first archived messages on the semi-private A22 chat, a user with the same name as the channel (Arizona 2022 Mid-Term Election Watch) announced to the group that they had \u201cheard back from the cleanelectionsusa.org so I might try to coordinate between the two efforts\u201d. They added: \u201cIn any case I will schedule a couple of zoom calls so we can connect.\u201d Two days later, the same account updated: \u201cThere are 13 drop box only locations in Maricopa county of which only 2 are 24 hour locations,\u201d adding: \u201cWe will need help with getting these watched. I have also been able to connect with cleanelectionsusa and am coordinating with those folks.\u201d Clean Elections USA, founded by Oklahoman Melody Jennings, is one of a number of election denial groups that sprang up in the wake of the 2020 election, after Trump and his allies mounted a campaign to reverse that year\u2019s election result on the basis of false claims that the vote was stolen. During the 2022 election season, the organization was slapped with a restraining order over its ballot monitoring \u2013 some of it carried out by armed activists \u2013 that the federal Department of Justice described in its filing as \u201cvigilante ballot security efforts\u201d that may have violated the Voting Rights Act. That lawsuit was settled in 2023. The organization\u2019s website has shuttered; however, archived snapshots indicate that the organizers were motivated by discredited information from long-running election denial organization True the Vote and 2000 Mules, the title of a conspiracy-minded book and accompanying documentary by rightwing provocateur Dinesh D\u2019Souza. The book and film repeated True the Vote\u2019s allegations that paid \u201cmules\u201d had carried illegal ballots to drop boxes in swing states in 2020. D\u2019Souza\u2019s publisher in June withdrew the book and film from distribution and apologized to a man whom D\u2019Souza falsely accused of criminal election fraud. The \u201cmules\u201d falsehoods were treated as baseline reality in the A22 chat. On 9 November, a user named \u201ctrooper\u201d sought to account for Republicans\u2019 unexpectedly poor showing with the claim \u201c275k drop-off ballots \u2013 meaning the mules flooded the system on election day while the disaster distraction was in play\u201d, adding that \u201cthey swarmed the election day drop boxes like fucking locusts\u201d.

Shannon Hiller, BDI\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cWe continue to face elevated threats and risk to local officials across the board,\u201d however in 2024, \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot more preparation and there\u2019s a clearer understanding about how to address those threats now.\u201d Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) said that talk of election fraud using drop boxes had returned in 2024. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an election-denying organization, whether it\u2019s Mike Lindell, True the Vote or more local outfits in various states that aren\u2019t talking about patrolling drop boxes and watching voters while they\u2019re voting,\u201d she said. From disinformation to violent threats Beirich\u2019s warnings are reflected in ongoing AFPP Telegram chats, where any prospect of a Harris victory is met with conspiracy theories, apocalyptic narratives, and sometimes threats. The Guardian\u2019s review of the materials found many instances in which disinformation or exaggerated claims in the media or from rightwing public figures led directly to violent rhetoric from members of the chat. On 13 March, a user linked to a story in the Federalist which uncritically covered a claim by the Mississippi secretary of state, Michael Watson, that the Department of Justice was \u201cusing taxpayer dollars to have jails and the US Marshals Service encourage incarcerated felons and noncitizens to register to vote\u201d on the basis of Joe Biden\u2019s March 2021 executive order aimed at expanding access to voting. A user, \u201c@Wilbo17AZ\u201d, replied: \u201cIf we don\u2019t fight this with our every waking breath, we are done. Expect war.\u201d On 24 June, a user posted an article from conspiracy-minded, Falun Gong-linked news website Epoch Times, which reported on the supreme court\u2019s rejection of appeals from a Robert F Kennedy-founded anti-vaccine non-profit. The court declined to hear the appeals over lower court\u2019s determinations that the non-profit had no standing to sue the Food and Drug Administration over its emergency authorization of Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic. In response, another user, \u201ccybercav\u201d, wrote: \u201cI do not see any path forward for our Republic that doesn\u2019t include \u2018Purge and Eradicate\u2019 being the general orders for both sides of the next civil war.\u201d In January, the @AFPP_US account posted a link to an opinion column on the Gateway Pundit by conspiracy theorist Wayne Allyn Root. Root characterized cross-border immigration as an invasion in the piece, and concluded by telling readers to \u201cPray to God. Pray for a miracle. Pray for the election in November of President Donald J Trump.\u201d Fueling paranoia Over the summer, overseas events fueled the paranoia of chat members. On 6 August the @AFPP_US account posted a link to Guardian reporting on anti-immigrant riots that took place in the UK over the summer. The article described the riots as \u201cfar-right violence\u201d; @AFPP_US captioned the link \u201c\u2018Far Right\u2019 = \u2018Stop raping women and stabbing children\u2019\u201d. The next day, the same account apparently attempted to link the riots to UK gun laws, which are more restrictive than the US. The stimulus was a story on the riots by conspiracy broadcaster Owen Shroyer, an employee of Alex Jones who was sentenced to two months in prison for entering a restricted area at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. @AFPP_US wrote: \u201cUK is a failed state and possession of the Calaphite [sic]. The imperialists have become the Imperiled. This is what just a few generations of disarmament and pussification hath wrought.\u201d One major vector of bad information in the A22 chats is the Gateway Pundit, a pro-Maga website operated by Jim Hoft. That website has been a noted source of election disinformation for years. Earlier this month Hoft\u2019s organization settled a defamation suit with two election workers that it had falsely accused of election fraud. Accountability non-profit Advance Democracy Inc reported in August that in the first nine months of 2024 Hoft had published at least 128 articles referencing election fraud and election workers. Gateway Pundit articles were shared many times in the chat. On 21 January, the @AFPP_US account shared a Gateway Pundit story by Hoft in which he claimed that liberal philanthropist and chair of the Open Society Foundation, Alexander Soros, had posted a coded message advocating the assassination of a re-elected President Trump. The basis was that Soros\u2019s post carried a picture of a bullet hole and a hand holding $47. But those pictures came from a story in the Atlantic, about falling crime rates, that Soros was linking to in the post. \u2018Millions of illegals\u2019 On at least one occasion, the Gateway Pundit was quoted in the group because it was amplifying the claims of another major source of disinformation for A22: Elon Musk. The Gateway Pundit article posted to the chat in January was titled \u201cJUST IN \u2026 Elon Musk Rips Mark Zuckerberg for Funding Illegal Voting Vans in 2020 Election\u201d. It highlighted Musk\u2019s false claim that Zuckerberg\u2019s funding of county-level voting apparatuses in 2020 was illegal. As elections approached, AFPP members added more of Musk\u2019s pronouncements into the stew of disinformation on the site, with a particular emphasis on anti-immigrant material. On 7 September, as rightwing actors stoked panic about Haitian immigrants, @AFPP_US posted a link to a Musk post quote-posting a video of Harris addressing the need to support Haitian migrants with the comment: \u201cVote for Kamala if you want this to happen to your neighborhood!\u201d On 29 September, the AFPP lead account linked to a Musk post that claimed \u201cMillions of illegals being provided by the government with money for housing using your tax dollars is a major part of what\u2019s driving up costs\u201d. On 1 October, the @AFPP_US account shared an X post in which Musk asserted that \u201cif Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election\u201d, and wove that claim into a narrative resembling the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory, claiming that \u201cDemocrats are expediting\u201d the conversion of \u201cillegals\u201d to citizens in an attempt to make America a \u201cone-party state\u201d. The Guardian reported in 2021 that a separate AP3 website leak, which exposed the paramilitary organization\u2019s membership list, showed that at that time members included serving military and law enforcement officers. In August, ProPublica reported on an earlier leak of AP3 materials from the same source, showing that AP3 had carried out vigilante operations on the Texas border, and had forged close ties with law enforcement officers around the country. Beirich said that chatter monitored by the organization has obsessively focused on the narrative of illegal immigrants voting in a \u201crigged\u201d election. \u201cNon-citizens voting is the big fraud that they\u2019re talking up,\u201d she said. Earlier this month, Wired reported that the current leak showed evidence of plans to carry out operations \u201ccoordinated with election denial groups as part of a plan to conduct paramilitary surveillance of ballot boxes during the midterm elections in 2022\u201d.",

This makes me think of another table, and of a man so frustrated by the stubborn, leathery skin of a boiled chestnut that it pinged out of his hand and hit another man just below his eye. As apologies and ice were offered, the injured man\u2019s wife noted that roasting chestnuts was much better, at which point someone else recalled how they had once watched a chestnut, which seemed to be quietly roasting in a perforated pan, explode and half of it hit the ceiling. But back to Eliza\u2019s soup.</p> <p>It was the first recipe I made from her book, actually my mum\u2019s book and on extended loan. The recipe involves mashing boiled chestnuts with stock, seasoning them with mace and cayenne, and finishing with cream for a wonderful rich, velvety soup, of which this week\u2019s recipe is a variation. It is also inspired by a Piemontese <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/15/rachel-roddy-minestra-potato-red-pepper-soup-recipe\">minestra</a></em> of <em>riso</em>, <em>latte e castagne</em> (rice, milk and chestnuts).

After 15 minutes, unwrap and take them out one by one to peel off the shells and remove the papery skins \u2013 don\u2019t worry if the chestnuts break up while you\u2019re doing this; in fact, embrace the mess, because you\u2019re going to crumble them anyway.</p> <p>If you are using dried chestnuts, which are the most economical (although not in terms of time), they need to be soaked for six to 12 hours (some brands suggest 30 minutes, but I have never found this to be enough), then boiled, before being cooked in the soup (again, some suggest you can cook them directly in the soup, but that would demand a long-cooked soup, which this isn\u2019t). The best way to pre-cook the rehydrated chestnuts is in a pressure cooker, which not only speeds up the cooking time to 25 minutes and saves energy, but maintains nutrients and vitamin C. If you are using vacuum-packed ones, simply unwrap them.</p> <p>As you might imagine from the combination of ingredients, centuries and places, this soup is a mixture of things, both savoury and sweet, and unthreatening.

If a state with such a law \u2013 called a \u201cparental involvement law\u201d<strong> \u2013</strong> passes a measure expanding abortion rights, the law would not immediately be struck down, according to Huberfeld. Instead, a court would need to rule on the issue. And, although the exact wording of each measure would ultimately determine how it was interpreted, Huberfeld said: \u201cI don\u2019t see these issues as being real issues.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cThey are fear and confusion campaigns. There are efforts to try to confuse the people who will be voting on these ballot initiatives, to make it so that they don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re voting on.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, because some forms of gender-affirming care can affect people\u2019s ability to reproduce, opponents have suggested that measures to protect reproductive healthcare would also protect minors\u2019 access to gender-affirming care. But experts say that it has not been firmly established that<strong> </strong>gender-affirming care legally falls under the banner of reproductive health.</p> <p>\u201cEven if you accept that it could have this wild, expansive meaning, there still are ways within the text of the amendment that allow the government to pass laws around this topic,\u201d one law professor <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2024/10/16/missouri-abortion-gender-affirming-health-care-amendment-3/\">told the Missouri Independent</a> after Hawley\u2019s comments.</p> <p>Nevertheless, touting these claims has become a go-to strategy in the anti-abortion playbook.

      "bodyText": "A Maryland ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution is, a Maryland activist claims, a \u201cTrojan horse to trick pro-choice Marylanders into voting away parental rights\u201d. Opponents of a New York referendum, which is meant to cement protections for abortion rights, have started calling it the \u201cParent Replacement Act\u201d and claim it would expand rights for transgender minors. Josh Hawley, the Republican senator from Missouri, has said that his state\u2019s ballot measure would \u201cmandate constitutionally, all reproductive health services, and that includes transgender treatments for minors\u201d. In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, support for abortion rights has soared. Seven states have voted on abortion-related ballot measures, and in every state, voters have sided with supporters of the procedure, including in deep-red states like Kentucky and Ohio. Now, in the run-up to election day, 10 states are set to vote on their own abortion measures \u2013 and anti-abortion activists across the country are trying to disrupt that streak using the specter of \u201cparental rights\u201d. These measures, they say, could strip parents of their right to make decisions for their children \u2013 an argument that, in the years since the Covid pandemic broke out, has become an increasingly potent weapon in US culture wars. Legal experts say these claims are overblown. \u201cIt\u2019s a vast oversimplification of what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Nicole Huberfeld, a professor who leads the Boston University School of Law\u2019s reproductive law program. More than 30 states say minors cannot obtain an abortion without notifying a parent or obtaining their consent. If a state with such a law \u2013 called a \u201cparental involvement law\u201d \u2013 passes a measure expanding abortion rights, the law would not immediately be struck down, according to Huberfeld. Instead, a court would need to rule on the issue. And, although the exact wording of each measure would ultimately determine how it was interpreted, Huberfeld said: \u201cI don\u2019t see these issues as being real issues.\u201d She continued: \u201cThey are fear and confusion campaigns. There are efforts to try to confuse the people who will be voting on these ballot initiatives, to make it so that they don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re voting on.\u201d Meanwhile, because some forms of gender-affirming care can affect people\u2019s ability to reproduce, opponents have suggested that measures to protect reproductive healthcare would also protect minors\u2019 access to gender-affirming care. But experts say that it has not been firmly established that gender-affirming care legally falls under the banner of reproductive health. \u201cEven if you accept that it could have this wild, expansive meaning, there still are ways within the text of the amendment that allow the government to pass laws around this topic,\u201d one law professor told the Missouri Independent after Hawley\u2019s comments. Nevertheless, touting these claims has become a go-to strategy in the anti-abortion playbook. Michigan and Ohio, which respectively passed abortion-related ballot measures in 2022 and 2023, were both hit with messaging around parental rights and warnings from anti-abortion activists that the measures would erase parental involvement laws around abortion and gender-affirming care. Both states still require minors to obtain consent from their parents before undergoing an abortion. And while Michigan permits gender-affirming care for minors \u2013 and did so before the ballot measure passed \u2013 a judge recently upheld Ohio\u2019s ban on it. Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which is backing abortion-rights measures in several states, believes claims about parental rights are a calculated distraction. \u201cIt does reveal that our opponents really do understand that the electorate is not with them on the core, fundamental issue of abortion,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other reason they would be trying to change the subject so dramatically.\u201d \u2018Florida invented this playbook\u2019 The most heated and high-profile abortion-related measure of the election is playing out in Florida, which currently bans the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy \u2013 and is arguably the headquarters of the modern-day parental rights movement. \u201cAmendment 4 would remove the requirement for parental consent for minors seeking an abortion,\u201d Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, posted on X last week. \u201cAmendment 4 would undermine the foundation of parental rights in Florida.\u201d He also shared an ad featuring Dr Grazie Christie, a radiologist, calling Amendment 4 \u201ctoo extreme and not what it seems\u201d.

It\u2019s night and day.\u201d</p> <h2>Climate denialism would return to the Oval Office</h2>  <p>A new Trump administration would bring a jarring rhetorical shift. Unlike almost every other world leader \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/22/us-emissions-climate-crisis-2030-biden\">called</a> the climate crisis an \u201cexistential threat\u201d \u2013 Trump dismisses and even mocks the threat of global heating.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the former president has said that climate change is \u201cone of the great scams of all time, people aren\u2019t buying it any more\u201d and has <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/?intent=121\">falsely claimed</a> the planet \u201chas actually got a bit cooler recently\u201d, that rising sea levels will create \u201cmore oceanfront property\u201d, that wind energy is \u201cbullshit, it\u2019s horrible\u201d and even that cows and windows will be banned by Democrats if he loses.</p> <p>Trump has coupled this with demands for unfettered oil and gas production in all corners of the US and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/18/election-trump-oil-gas-fundraising\">actively courted</a> industry executives for donations. \u201cHe wholeheartedly believes we should produce our own energy sources here in the US, there\u2019s no grey area there,\u201d said Thomas Pyle, president of American Energy Alliance, a free market group.</p>    <p>\u201cPresident Trump marches to the beat of his own drum, he\u2019s his own man.

In its place, oil and gas production, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/24/fossil-fuel-liquified-natural-gas-louisiana\">already at all-time highs</a>, will be boosted by opening up Alaska\u2019s Arctic to drilling and ending a pause on liquified natural gas exports to \u201ccut the cost of energy in half within the first 12 months of taking office\u201d.</p> <p>Achieving a full repeal of the climate bill, named the Inflation Reduction Act, will hinge upon the composition of Congress. Even if Republicans won both the House of Representatives and the US Senate, as well as the White House, there would still be some pushback from conservative members who have seen a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/22/climate-spending-republican-states-clean-energy-funding\">disproportionate torrent of clean energy investment</a> and jobs flow to their districts.</p>    <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the Inflation Reduction Act fully overturned, it will be more surgical than that,\u201d said Kelly Sims Gallagher, an environmental policy expert at Tufts University. \u201cThe US is already a top oil and gas producer but what would likely change is the companion investment in low-carbon energy.

      "bodyText": "The climate crisis may appear peripheral in the US presidential election but a victory for Donald Trump will, more than any other issue, have profound consequences for people around a rapidly heating world, experts have warned. During his push for the White House, Trump has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and \u201cone of the great scams of all time\u201d while vowing to delete spending on clean energy, abolish \u201cinsane\u201d incentives for Americans to drive electric cars, scrap various environmental rules and unleash a \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d wave of new oil and gas. Such an agenda would be carried out over a four year-period that nearly rounds out a crucial decade in which scientists say the US, and the world, must slash planet-heating pollution in half to avoid disastrous climate breakdown. Already, major emitters such as the US are lagging badly in commitments to cut emissions enough to avoid a 1.5C (2.7F) rise in global temperature above the pre-industrial era. With just over 1C in average warming so far, the world already has record heatwaves, a rash of wildfires, turbocharged hurricanes, plunging wildlife losses, a crumbling and increasingly green Antarctica, the looming collapse of the oceans and a faltering ability of forests, plants and soil to absorb carbon. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get off fossil fuels as quickly as possible,\u201d said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see that happening in the event of a Trump victory.\u201d Mann added that \u201ca second Trump presidency is game over for meaningful climate action this decade, and stabilizing warming below 1.5C probably becomes impossible\u201d. So what would a Trump election triumph mean for the environment? A dangerous and uncertain future Amid the frenetic bombast of politics, it is easy to overlook the long legacies of electoral decisions. Action or inaction on the climate crisis in the span of just the next few years will help decide the tolerability of the climate for generations not yet born. \u201cWe have now brought the planet into climatic conditions never witnessed by us or our prehistoric relatives,\u201d as a recent paper authored by more than a dozen scientists warned. \u201cWe are on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster. This is a global emergency beyond any doubt.\u201d There is enough momentum behind the record growth of clean energy that it won\u2019t be utterly derailed by a Trump presidency. But a Trump White House would still have a tangible impact, adding, by some estimates, several billion tonnes of heat-trapping gases that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be in the atmosphere, gumming up the international response, subjecting more people to flood or fire or toxic air. It would help prod societies ever closer to the brink of an unlivable climate. Kamala Harris has declined to lay out much of a vision on how she would tackle the climate crisis, and barely even mentions it on the campaign trail, but to some experts the stakes are compellingly clear. \u201cWith Kamala Harris, there\u2019s a good chance we can avert truly catastrophic global climate impacts,\u201d said Mann. \u201cWith Trump there is not. It\u2019s night and day.\u201d Climate denialism would return to the Oval Office A new Trump administration would bring a jarring rhetorical shift. Unlike almost every other world leader \u2013 such as Joe Biden, who has called the climate crisis an \u201cexistential threat\u201d \u2013 Trump dismisses and even mocks the threat of global heating. In recent weeks, the former president has said that climate change is \u201cone of the great scams of all time, people aren\u2019t buying it any more\u201d and has falsely claimed the planet \u201chas actually got a bit cooler recently\u201d, that rising sea levels will create \u201cmore oceanfront property\u201d, that wind energy is \u201cbullshit, it\u2019s horrible\u201d and even that cows and windows will be banned by Democrats if he loses. Trump has coupled this with demands for unfettered oil and gas production in all corners of the US and has actively courted industry executives for donations. \u201cHe wholeheartedly believes we should produce our own energy sources here in the US, there\u2019s no grey area there,\u201d said Thomas Pyle, president of American Energy Alliance, a free market group. \u201cPresident Trump marches to the beat of his own drum, he\u2019s his own man. He is instinctively in the right place on these issues \u2013 he wants to see more energy production across the board and less government intervention in the cars we drive and the stoves we have.\u201d Others see signs a second Trump presidency will be even more extreme on climate than the first iteration. \u201cThe style, the indifference to empirical evidence and the bold sweeping gestures are familiar,\u201d said Barry Rabe, an energy policy expert at the University of Michigan. \u201cBut this sequel will be an aggressive, revenge-based repudiation of anyone who has challenged him in the past.\u201d Clean energy policies unpicked A primary target for a new Trump administration would be the landmark climate bill signed by Biden that is pushing hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy deployment, electric car production and battery manufacturing. Trump has promised to \u201cterminate Kamala Harris\u2019s green new scam and rescind all of the unspent funds\u201d. In its place, oil and gas production, already at all-time highs, will be boosted by opening up Alaska\u2019s Arctic to drilling and ending a pause on liquified natural gas exports to \u201ccut the cost of energy in half within the first 12 months of taking office\u201d. Achieving a full repeal of the climate bill, named the Inflation Reduction Act, will hinge upon the composition of Congress. Even if Republicans won both the House of Representatives and the US Senate, as well as the White House, there would still be some pushback from conservative members who have seen a disproportionate torrent of clean energy investment and jobs flow to their districts. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the Inflation Reduction Act fully overturned, it will be more surgical than that,\u201d said Kelly Sims Gallagher, an environmental policy expert at Tufts University. \u201cThe US is already a top oil and gas producer but what would likely change is the companion investment in low-carbon energy. That seems less likely under a Trump administration.\u201d Without Congress, Trump will still be able to slow the rollout of spending and demolish regulatory actions taken under Biden, such as rules cutting pollution from coal-fired power plants, cars and trucks and efforts to shield disadvantaged communities from pollution. Penalties for leaking methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is rising at a galloping pace, will also be targeted following complaints from some of Trump\u2019s top oil industry donors. In his first term, Trump squashed more than 100 environmental rules but the courts halted much of his agenda. This time, a more ruthlessly efficient and prepared operation is expected, backed by a conservative-aligned judicial system, including the supreme court itself. \u201cHe will work quickly, I think, to dismantle the Biden approach,\u201d said Pyle. A purge of science A far more ideological slant on science and expertise is likely to emerge should Trump win office, with Project 2025, the conservative manifesto authored by many former Trump officials, calling for civil servants to be replaced by loyal political operatives. Mentions of the climate crisis were sidelined or erased during Trump\u2019s last term and a repeat is widely expected. Climate considerations for new government projects will likely be ditched, states will get less help to prepare for and recover from disasters and public weather forecasts will be privatized, Project 2025 has suggested. Scientists, who remember research being buried and Trump publicly changing an official hurricane forecast map with a Sharpie pen during his first term, fear a reprise. \u201cThe United States will become an unsafe place for scientists, intellectuals and anyone who doesn\u2019t fit\u201d with the Republican agenda, Mann said. Trump has said that \u201cnuclear warming\u201d, which seems to be a reference to nuclear war, is a greater threat than global warming and that while he likes the idea of clean water and air \u201cat the same time you can\u2019t give up your country, you can\u2019t say you can\u2019t have jobs any more\u201d. When disasters, driven by a warming world, do hit the US, Trump has signaled he will withhold federal aid to places that didn\u2019t vote for him in return for unrelated concessions. The former president did this multiple times when in office, his ex-staffers have revealed, and recently threatened California with a repeat. International relations shaken As president, Trump took several months to decide to remove the US from the Paris climate agreement. \u201cThis time I think he would do that on the very first day, likely with a lot of dramatic flourish,\u201d said Rabe. With the US, again, out of the international climate effort, American aid to developing countries vulnerable to floods, droughts and other disasters would also be slashed, along with cooperation with nations on other initiatives, such as cutting methane and curbing deforestation. Trump\u2019s fixation upon tariffs, meanwhile, would probably stymie the import of clean energy components to the US. Retaliatory tariffs, including penalties for carbon-intensive goods, could follow. \u201cI\u2019d expect an aggressive \u2018America first\u2019 role which will be a very interesting moment for the European Union with their carbon border adjustments \u2013 how will they respond to a more bullying America?\u201d Rabe said. As in Trump\u2019s first term, US disengagement would raise fears that other countries will also withdraw from the climate fight, causing global heating to spin out of control. China, the world\u2019s leading emitter, has retained a level of cooperation with the Biden administration on climate despite an overall strained relationship with the US, but this faces rupture if Trump wins. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume there won\u2019t be any climate engagement between Beijing and Washington,\u201d said Li Shuo, a China climate policy specialist at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cIt would be negative for the US and for the world. The US still looms large on the global stage, so I\u2019d expect Trump would sow greater resistance to a climate agenda in China. We will see that commitment to climate start to crumble.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It is generally believed that Americans only start to care about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">presidential elections</a> one month before election day. Hence, it is only in the last month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/23/presidential-polls-kamala-harris-donald-trump-election\">polls</a> become meaningful. If that is true, the polls don\u2019t tell us too much yet.</p> <p>Despite the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/23/presidential-polls-kamala-harris-donald-trump-election\">Donald Trump</a> has become openly <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/185487/trump-maga-legal-war-slow-burn-authoritarianism\">authoritarian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/12/trump-racist-rhetoric-immigrants-00183537\">racist</a> \u2013 promising to <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/185722/donald-trump-dictator-persecute-political-enemies\">jail his \u201cenemies\u201d</a> and referring to immigrants as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/us/donald-trump-hannibal-lecter.html\">cannibals</a>\u201d \u2013 the race is still too close to call. Almost all <a href=\"https://www.270towin.com/2024-presidential-election-polls/national\">national polls</a> have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> ahead of Donald Trump in the popular vote, but the difference is mostly within the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/\">margin of error</a>\u201d \u2013 meaning, in essence, that the difference is too small to be certain. So what should we look out for in the coming weeks?</p> <h2>The polls: national v swing states</h2> <p>First of all, it is important to note that the US president is not directly elected. There is little doubt that Harris will win the popular vote \u2013 Democrats have won the popular vote in all but one of the presidential elections this century. But to become president, a candidate does not need to win the popular vote but the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/about\">electoral college</a> \u2013 ironically, given that the electoral college handed Trump the victory in 2016 and could do so again next month, the institution was introduced by the founders to protect the country from electing a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/electoral-college-founding-fathers-constitutional-convention\">populist</a>\u201d president.</p> <p>So, rather than focusing on the national vote, we should focus on polls in so-called \u201cswing states\u201d. For the 2024 elections, these are expected to be the following <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/7-swing-states-that-could-decide-the-2024-presidential-election\">seven states</a>: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Unsurprisingly, given that they are swing states, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/presidential-election-swing-states.html\">the polls</a> are extremely close in all seven states. It is doubtful that this will change before election day on 5 November.</p> <h2>The electoral coalition</h2> <p>Trump has the most homogeneous electoral coalition, consisting overwhelmingly of religious white voters. Over the last decades, predating Trump, the Republican party has become more evangelical, male and white. Although that demographic is decreasing as a percentage of the population, the enthusiasm for Trump within the group is high. Moreover, polls are indicating that Trump is picking up Hispanic and, to a lesser extent, (male) African American voters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Once the votes are finally counted, and particularly if they don\u2019t hand Trump a victory, we can expect several institutional challenges to the results</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The main worry for the Republican party are (suburban) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/white-women-voters-harris-trump\">white women</a>, who have supported Trump in majority before. Since the Dobbs ruling put <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/10-things-to-know-about-abortion-access-since-the-dobbs-decision/\">abortion</a> back at the top of the agenda, and younger women are much more liberal than previous generations, white women could cost Trump the election \u2013 particularly if young white women vote in similar numbers as older generations.</p> <p>Although Harris has a larger <em>potential</em> <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/the-changing-demographic-composition-of-voters-and-party-coalitions/\">electorate</a>, it is also much more changing and heterogeneous as well as much harder to mobilize. Traditionally, the Democrats win large majorities of both African American and Hispanic voters as well as a large minority of white voters. Although Harris has brought back the enthusiasm lost under Joe Biden\u2019s lackluster campaign and debate performance, and largely closed the gap with Trump, there are several groups that could cost her the elections.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/will-latino-voters-help-lead-the-gop-to-victory-in-2024/\">Hispanic</a> voters have been moving to the Republican party for several years now, while a group of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/g-s1-27633/barack-obama-kamala-harris-black-men-pennsylvania\">African American men</a> seem unwilling to vote for a woman as president. And then there is Gaza, which has turned a lot of <a href=\"https://www.aaiusa.org/library/the-arab-american-vote-2024\">Arab Americans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/how-us-muslims-are-experiencing-the-israel-hamas-war/\">Muslim Americans</a> \u2013 as well as progressive white voters \u2013 off the Democratic party. In most of these cases, the question is not so much whether they will vote for Harris or Trump but rather whether they will vote for Harris or not vote at all.</p> <h2>Election day will not be decision day</h2> <p>If you think it is frustrating that the polls don\u2019t give us a highly likely winner before election day, you will be even more frustrated to hear that you still will probably not know the winner on 5 November. Four years ago, most major networks only called the election on <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/11/joe-biden-president-cnn-1234610930/\">7 November</a>, four days after election day. It will almost certainly take even longer this year, as Republicans have introduced a host of measures to make it more difficult and slower to count the votes (such as <a href=\"https://time.com/7071959/election-2024-hand-count-ballots/\">hand counting</a>).</p> <p>And once the votes are finally counted, and particularly if they don\u2019t hand Trump a victory, we can expect several institutional challenges to the results. Since their failed attempt to challenge the 2020 election, Republicans have tightened their grip on <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/trump-election-boards-swing-states\">electoral boards</a> and <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/politics/high-courts-high-stakes/how-republicans-flipped-americas-state-supreme-courts/\">state courts</a>, including in some swing states like <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-election-rule-could-exclude-votes\">Georgia</a>. No wonder <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/vote-counting-delays-election-states/index.html\">election experts</a> have raised alarm that the vote counting and certifying will not just lead to delays but also to chaos.</p> <h2>Post-electoral violence?</h2> <p>Even when all the votes are counted, and the final result is certified, it is doubtful that the country will move on \u2013 particularly if Trump loses the election. This is in itself not that surprising: both <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-2020-election-lies-debunked-4fc26546b07962fdbf9d66e739fbb50d\">Trump</a> and his vice-presidential candidate, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-trump-lost-new-york-times-interview-e81ea9bc1900cab9eaf691e216d7a49e\">JD Vance</a>, still do not recognize Biden\u2019s election, while <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-indictment-poll-georgia-elections-b6140eed88b3153e41dbf9e008d5a21b\">57% of Republicans</a> believe Biden\u2019s election was \u201cillegitimate\u201d. Moreover, both Trump and Vance have indicated that they would not recognize a defeat in November, a position shared by <a href=\"https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/rule-law-united-states\">almost half of Republican voters</a> (and more than a quarter of Democratic voters).</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, there is a growing worry in the country about <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/08/07/snf-agora-poll-july-2024/\">post-electoral violence</a>, among both Democrats and Republicans. In fact, almost half of the population thinks it is \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d that the country would slip into a <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/08/07/snf-agora-poll-july-2024/\">civil war</a>! While the combination of conspiracy theories and a large number of (semi-automatic) weapons makes some post-electoral violence highly likely, I doubt we will see another insurrection, let alone a civil war.

      "bodyText": "It is generally believed that Americans only start to care about presidential elections one month before election day. Hence, it is only in the last month that polls become meaningful. If that is true, the polls don\u2019t tell us too much yet. Despite the fact that Donald Trump has become openly authoritarian and racist \u2013 promising to jail his \u201cenemies\u201d and referring to immigrants as \u201ccannibals\u201d \u2013 the race is still too close to call. Almost all national polls have Kamala Harris ahead of Donald Trump in the popular vote, but the difference is mostly within the so-called \u201cmargin of error\u201d \u2013 meaning, in essence, that the difference is too small to be certain. So what should we look out for in the coming weeks? The polls: national v swing states First of all, it is important to note that the US president is not directly elected. There is little doubt that Harris will win the popular vote \u2013 Democrats have won the popular vote in all but one of the presidential elections this century. But to become president, a candidate does not need to win the popular vote but the electoral college \u2013 ironically, given that the electoral college handed Trump the victory in 2016 and could do so again next month, the institution was introduced by the founders to protect the country from electing a \u201cpopulist\u201d president. So, rather than focusing on the national vote, we should focus on polls in so-called \u201cswing states\u201d. For the 2024 elections, these are expected to be the following seven states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Unsurprisingly, given that they are swing states, the polls are extremely close in all seven states. It is doubtful that this will change before election day on 5 November. The electoral coalition Trump has the most homogeneous electoral coalition, consisting overwhelmingly of religious white voters. Over the last decades, predating Trump, the Republican party has become more evangelical, male and white. Although that demographic is decreasing as a percentage of the population, the enthusiasm for Trump within the group is high. Moreover, polls are indicating that Trump is picking up Hispanic and, to a lesser extent, (male) African American voters. The main worry for the Republican party are (suburban) white women, who have supported Trump in majority before. Since the Dobbs ruling put abortion back at the top of the agenda, and younger women are much more liberal than previous generations, white women could cost Trump the election \u2013 particularly if young white women vote in similar numbers as older generations. Although Harris has a larger potential electorate, it is also much more changing and heterogeneous as well as much harder to mobilize. Traditionally, the Democrats win large majorities of both African American and Hispanic voters as well as a large minority of white voters. Although Harris has brought back the enthusiasm lost under Joe Biden\u2019s lackluster campaign and debate performance, and largely closed the gap with Trump, there are several groups that could cost her the elections. Hispanic voters have been moving to the Republican party for several years now, while a group of African American men seem unwilling to vote for a woman as president. And then there is Gaza, which has turned a lot of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans \u2013 as well as progressive white voters \u2013 off the Democratic party. In most of these cases, the question is not so much whether they will vote for Harris or Trump but rather whether they will vote for Harris or not vote at all. Election day will not be decision day If you think it is frustrating that the polls don\u2019t give us a highly likely winner before election day, you will be even more frustrated to hear that you still will probably not know the winner on 5 November. Four years ago, most major networks only called the election on 7 November, four days after election day. It will almost certainly take even longer this year, as Republicans have introduced a host of measures to make it more difficult and slower to count the votes (such as hand counting). And once the votes are finally counted, and particularly if they don\u2019t hand Trump a victory, we can expect several institutional challenges to the results. Since their failed attempt to challenge the 2020 election, Republicans have tightened their grip on electoral boards and state courts, including in some swing states like Georgia. No wonder election experts have raised alarm that the vote counting and certifying will not just lead to delays but also to chaos. Post-electoral violence? Even when all the votes are counted, and the final result is certified, it is doubtful that the country will move on \u2013 particularly if Trump loses the election. This is in itself not that surprising: both Trump and his vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, still do not recognize Biden\u2019s election, while 57% of Republicans believe Biden\u2019s election was \u201cillegitimate\u201d. Moreover, both Trump and Vance have indicated that they would not recognize a defeat in November, a position shared by almost half of Republican voters (and more than a quarter of Democratic voters). Unsurprisingly, there is a growing worry in the country about post-electoral violence, among both Democrats and Republicans. In fact, almost half of the population thinks it is \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d that the country would slip into a civil war! While the combination of conspiracy theories and a large number of (semi-automatic) weapons makes some post-electoral violence highly likely, I doubt we will see another insurrection, let alone a civil war. That said, there is little doubt we are in for a very tense period, which will last well beyond 5 November.

      "bodyText": "Fremdscham, the German word for feeling embarrassment that should rightly belong to someone else, may have been invented for many politicians\u2019 ham-fisted attempts to make good use of TikTok. Last week, the MP Christian D\u00fcrr stoically endured an internet shitstorm \u2013 as squalls of virtual vitriol are known even in Germany \u2013 for his 75-second video on the popular video-hosting service, which in Germany is now dominated by the far right. With a tsunami of English-dominated youth slang, the 47-year-old D\u00fcrr explains the virtues of the parliament to young voters on their favoured platform. \u201cWelcome to the Bundestag. Here, where the real tea happens. And not lowkey but full power,\u201d says D\u00fcrr, who leads the pro-business Free Democrats\u2019 parliamentary group, then shows a picture of his party\u2019s cabinet members, the \u201cOGs\u201d who \u201cmaintain the vibes\u201d with \u201cmad energy\u201d. The speeches of his boss, Christian Lindner, the party leader and finance minister, are deemed \u201cpurer slay\u201d while his tailored suits are \u201cdrippy AF\u201d. The good-natured video, which ends with him munching on a canteen sausage that \u201chits different\u201d, borrows from a social media trend in which an older person awkwardly panders to young people by borrowing from their lingo, as if a younger staff member had penned it. D\u00fcrr\u2019s attempt carries the tag: \u201cPOV: Gen Z wrote the script.\u201d The clip, which generated 20,000 views in 24 hours, also triggered a slew of snarky \u201ccringe\u201d comments before it was dragged on to other platforms by critics adding their schadenfreude. Journalist Claas Gefroi captioned the video on X: \u201cDefine Fremdscham\u201d. Another user invoked the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who went viral on TikTok in April with a plodding-yet-somehow-compelling look inside his trademark beat-up leather bag: \u201cI want Scholz\u2019s briefcase back, at least it didn\u2019t talk.\u201d An FDP spokesperson said that those criticising D\u00fcrr had failed to get the joke. \u201cGloating usually happens when people share TikTok videos on another channel without knowing the relevant TikTok trends,\u201d he said, arguing that it was folly to cede the digital space to \u201cconspiracy theorists and the political fringes\u201d. German politicians are under pressure to claw back ground from the anti-migrant, pro-Kremlin Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party, which has flooded TikTok with carefully crafted clips that stoke anger and cynicism. The FDP in particular, whose hard line on debt has hindered plans for public investment, finds its back to the wall. It scored 23% among under-25s at the last general election in 2021 but tallied just 7% in that age group in the European parliament elections in June, while the AfD surged 11 points to 16%. It was the first national poll since the voting age was lowered to 16 and its trend was magnified in three state elections in September. AfD content is seen twice as often on TikTok by first-time voters than videos by all other parties taken together, according to a study last month by the University of Potsdam. One of Germany\u2019s biggest political TikTok stars is the AfD\u2019s Maximilian Krah, a particularly radical member of the European parliament. His \u201cDon\u2019t watch porn\u201d video garnered more than 1.4m clicks. \u201cOne in three men never had a girlfriend,\u201d Krah says. \u201cAre you among them? Don\u2019t watch porn, don\u2019t vote for the Greens \u2026 and don\u2019t let anyone tell you you have to be sweet, soft, weak and leftist. Real men are on the right.\u201d TikTok Germany placed restrictions on Krah\u2019s account for three months owing to \u201crepeated violations of the community guidelines\u201d. The Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a conservative thinktank, last year found that \u201cTikTok appeals most to the people who are least interested in politics\u201d. The site\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d page directs users not to accounts they follow but to those generating engagement \u2013 by definition those that are most provocative. In June, the Anne Frank Educational Centre sounded the alarm that democratic parties were losing the battle against extremists on TikTok for young voters. Johannes Hillje, a political consultant, said the AfD had been a TikTok \u201cfirst mover\u201d, using it systematically and strategically, \u201cwith a whole army of digital supporters boosting its reach\u201d and youthful staffers tailoring the message. \u201cThere\u2019s no platform where the competition for attention is so intense as on TikTok,\u201d with just seconds to grab an audience, Hillje said. \u201cYou need an emotional hook. Politicians don\u2019t have to dance or imitate youth slang but they need to tap into the issues, interests, aesthetic and communication habits of young people.\u201d Sascha Lobo, one of Germany\u2019s leading commentators on technology and politics, called the AfD\u2019s success on TikTok only a \u201csymptom\u201d of a deeper malaise since the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cMany young people feel that politicians don\u2019t take them seriously or ignore their needs \u2013 with catastrophic consequences,\u201d he said in a column for Spiegel magazine. \u201cIf you feel betrayed by all the big parties and the governments of past years, so much that you want revenge, then there\u2019s one party whose voters are seen by all the others as a kick in the arse.\u201d Experts say there is a hunger among young Germans to look to the future with optimism and have their biggest concerns addressed. The climate activist Magdalena Hess in March started a progressive campaign on the platform called #reclaimtiktok under which tens of thousands of users have posted videos that have collected nearly 200m views. \u201cRightwing extremist content was long almost the only political content on TikTok,\u201d she told local media. \u201cWe want to fire up democratic forces and change the conversation.\u201d",

A table is between them and they are in the middle of what they claim is an American forest. \u201cYou want to be as high up on the chain for modern warfare,\u201d one of the men says under garbled voice distortion, while explaining the finer points of a fantasy insurgency against the US government.

Rather than the symmetrical, colour-pop, grid-friendly perfection typically associated with the social media platform, these photos are a lesson in observation, an insight into how these creative minds see the world.</p> <p>Jarvis Cocker has an eloquent way of describing the very particular way that many of us see the world in his introduction: \u201c\u2018Just Looking\u2019 is usually perceived as an apologetic phrase: you might hear it uttered in a shop when a prospective customer is being put under pressure by the shopkeeper to make a purchase. It\u2019s an excuse: it means \u2018I\u2019m not buying, I\u2019m just seeing what you\u2019ve got\u2019. This book attempts to rehabilitate the phrase. Within these pages, \u2018Just Looking\u2019 means something different. Through photographs by people such as David Byrne, Olivia Laing and Kamila Shamsie, this book will try to make you look at the world anew. To actually <em>really</em> see it.\u201d</p> <p>From Cornelia Parker\u2019s beautiful striped tops, artfully strewn on a radiator, to the amusing juxtaposition of signs in a branch of Boots the chemist snapped by author Nick Hornby, these images offer wonderful windows into the minds of these creatives.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theredstoneshop.com/products/just-looking\">Just Looking, Snapshots, Close-Ups and </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theredstoneshop.com/products/just-looking\">Portraits of the Everyday</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theredstoneshop.com/products/just-looking\"> (Redstone)</a> is out on 4 November</em></p> <h2>Cutting a rug</h2>    <p>Painter Winifred Nicholson first discovered the rag rug-making tradition of northern England in 1923, after she had moved to Bankshead, a farmhouse near Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Cumbria. Hooky or proggy rugs are made from recycled rags of old clothing and textiles hooked through a piece of hessian and were commonly found in the rural communities around Nicholson\u2019s house. In the 1960s-70s, Nicholson worked with local makers to create proddy rugs designed by her, her grandchildren and friends which were sold at a Cambridge art gallery.</p> <p>This month, Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art is holding a show of this craft, featuring rag rugs, paintings, postcards and Nicholson\u2019s design sketches. It\u2019s a fascinating insight into her inventive way of working and the skilled process of creating these rugs.</p> <p>The artist\u2019s grandson, art historian Jovan Nicholson, is co-curator of the show. \u201cOne of the problems with rag rugs is that by their very nature of being placed on a floor and hard use, very few survive. What is exciting is to have found so many rugs with lively images, and many of them in excellent condition.\u201d</p> <p>Elinor Morgan, artistic director at Mima, says: \u201cJovan\u2019s research raises fascinating connections between art and life and traces the work of many previously forgotten makers. The tradition of rag rugging has long roots in the Tees Valley as well as the wider north, and we\u2019re pleased to platform this important vernacular tradition.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://mima.art/exhibition/winifred-nicholson-cumbrian-rag-rugs/\">Winifred Nicholson: Cumbrian Rag Rugs</a> is at M</em><em>ima until 23 March 2025</em></p> <h2>It\u2019s curtains for Ramdane Touhami<br></h2>    <p>Few designers have covered as much creative ground as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/sep/02/sweet-smell-of-success-the-couples-making-scents\">Ramdane Touhami</a>. This French Moroccan first drew attention for reinventing the fragrance and toiletries brand Officine Universelle Buly. With his wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/paris-home-creative-couple-colourful-apartment\">Victoire de Taillac Touhami</a>, the creative director made a magical brand of ornate boutiques and scents inspired by the likes of Empress Josephine\u2019s rose garden and a Russian pine forest after the rain. Since then he\u2019s started a podcast company, revived Cire Trudon, the candle maker which once made tapers for Marie Antoinette and his latest adventure is as a hotelier. The Swiss Hotel Drei Berge \u2013 originally opened in 1907 \u2013 has been redesigned and renovated under Touhami\u2019s careful eye. Existing furniture and features were restored where possible but with the additions of bold colour and modern touches.</p> <p>And now you can not only stay in the hotel but bring a little touch of its style into your home. The Drei Berge textile collection was previewed earlier this year at Salone del Mobile and is now available for interiors.</p> <p>\u201cMe, I hate to change curtains,\u201d says Touhami. \u201cSo the idea is to have this winter-y thing, you push it to the side, and you have the summer one. And it\u2019s beautiful. In the winter, you want cover, but you still want to have the light because there\u2019s not so much light. In the summer, you really want dark. It\u2019s the idea of playing with the light.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the concept. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work, no one\u2019s done it like that.\u201d</p> <p>Looking at Touhami\u2019s track record, chances are \u2013 it will.</p> <p><em>The Drei Berge Collection by Ramdane Touhami for <a href=\"https://fischbacher1819.com/\">Fischbacher 1819</a> is available now from Fischbacher\u2019s stockists</em></p> <h2>Up tick</h2>    <p>The Timex brand is known for producing a great variety of watches at prices that are within reach of most people. Now it has stretched the definition by producing a watch that costs \u00a31 \u2013 or $1. The idea is informed by the 170th anniversary of the Waterbury Clock Company, the Connecticut-based brand that Timex grew from. The WCC also had ideals of democratising time. As its name suggests, it was originally in clocks \u2013 freestanding and mantlepiece versions, made out of brass and wood. Great for the home, not so practical for getting around with.</p> <p>Waterbury then beat out competition to develop a pocket watch that could be sold as cheaply as possible, and in 1896 launched \u201cthe Yankee\u201d, which retailed for $1. It proved so successful, and a boon to factory workers, farmers and railway men alike, that it became known as \u201cthe watch that made the dollar famous\u201d. On 16 November, Timex will release 1,000 wristwatches inspired by \u201cthe Yankee\u201d and designed by the respected watchmaker Giorgio Galli. \u201cIt just became a no-brainer, Shari Fabiani, CMO of Timex Group, says. \u201cAnd really fun when we started talking about it.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://timex.co.uk/pages/1-dollar-watch?srsltid=AfmBOoqm9tSPIy9kOb3BjCdaFu5AVW_vG17ovDrKWdxEoLoisiSdUH-c\">Timex $1 watch</a> is available from 16 November</em></p> <ul> <li><p>Just Looking edited by Julian Rothenstein (Redstone Press, \u00a316.95).

Rather than the symmetrical, colour-pop, grid-friendly perfection typically associated with the social media platform, these photos are a lesson in observation, an insight into how these creative minds see the world. Jarvis Cocker has an eloquent way of describing the very particular way that many of us see the world in his introduction: \u201c\u2018Just Looking\u2019 is usually perceived as an apologetic phrase: you might hear it uttered in a shop when a prospective customer is being put under pressure by the shopkeeper to make a purchase. It\u2019s an excuse: it means \u2018I\u2019m not buying, I\u2019m just seeing what you\u2019ve got\u2019. This book attempts to rehabilitate the phrase. Within these pages, \u2018Just Looking\u2019 means something different. Through photographs by people such as David Byrne, Olivia Laing and Kamila Shamsie, this book will try to make you look at the world anew. To actually really see it.\u201d From Cornelia Parker\u2019s beautiful striped tops, artfully strewn on a radiator, to the amusing juxtaposition of signs in a branch of Boots the chemist snapped by author Nick Hornby, these images offer wonderful windows into the minds of these creatives. Just Looking, Snapshots, Close-Ups and Portraits of the Everyday (Redstone) is out on 4 November Cutting a rug Painter Winifred Nicholson first discovered the rag rug-making tradition of northern England in 1923, after she had moved to Bankshead, a farmhouse near Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Cumbria. Hooky or proggy rugs are made from recycled rags of old clothing and textiles hooked through a piece of hessian and were commonly found in the rural communities around Nicholson\u2019s house. In the 1960s-70s, Nicholson worked with local makers to create proddy rugs designed by her, her grandchildren and friends which were sold at a Cambridge art gallery. This month, Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art is holding a show of this craft, featuring rag rugs, paintings, postcards and Nicholson\u2019s design sketches. It\u2019s a fascinating insight into her inventive way of working and the skilled process of creating these rugs. The artist\u2019s grandson, art historian Jovan Nicholson, is co-curator of the show. \u201cOne of the problems with rag rugs is that by their very nature of being placed on a floor and hard use, very few survive. What is exciting is to have found so many rugs with lively images, and many of them in excellent condition.\u201d Elinor Morgan, artistic director at Mima, says: \u201cJovan\u2019s research raises fascinating connections between art and life and traces the work of many previously forgotten makers. The tradition of rag rugging has long roots in the Tees Valley as well as the wider north, and we\u2019re pleased to platform this important vernacular tradition.\u201d Winifred Nicholson: Cumbrian Rag Rugs is at Mima until 23 March 2025 It\u2019s curtains for Ramdane Touhami Few designers have covered as much creative ground as Ramdane Touhami. This French Moroccan first drew attention for reinventing the fragrance and toiletries brand Officine Universelle Buly. With his wife, Victoire de Taillac Touhami, the creative director made a magical brand of ornate boutiques and scents inspired by the likes of Empress Josephine\u2019s rose garden and a Russian pine forest after the rain. Since then he\u2019s started a podcast company, revived Cire Trudon, the candle maker which once made tapers for Marie Antoinette and his latest adventure is as a hotelier. The Swiss Hotel Drei Berge \u2013 originally opened in 1907 \u2013 has been redesigned and renovated under Touhami\u2019s careful eye. Existing furniture and features were restored where possible but with the additions of bold colour and modern touches. And now you can not only stay in the hotel but bring a little touch of its style into your home. The Drei Berge textile collection was previewed earlier this year at Salone del Mobile and is now available for interiors. \u201cMe, I hate to change curtains,\u201d says Touhami. \u201cSo the idea is to have this winter-y thing, you push it to the side, and you have the summer one. And it\u2019s beautiful. In the winter, you want cover, but you still want to have the light because there\u2019s not so much light. In the summer, you really want dark. It\u2019s the idea of playing with the light. \u201cThis is the concept. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work, no one\u2019s done it like that.\u201d Looking at Touhami\u2019s track record, chances are \u2013 it will. The Drei Berge Collection by Ramdane Touhami for Fischbacher 1819 is available now from Fischbacher\u2019s stockists Up tick The Timex brand is known for producing a great variety of watches at prices that are within reach of most people. Now it has stretched the definition by producing a watch that costs \u00a31 \u2013 or $1. The idea is informed by the 170th anniversary of the Waterbury Clock Company, the Connecticut-based brand that Timex grew from. The WCC also had ideals of democratising time. As its name suggests, it was originally in clocks \u2013 freestanding and mantlepiece versions, made out of brass and wood. Great for the home, not so practical for getting around with. Waterbury then beat out competition to develop a pocket watch that could be sold as cheaply as possible, and in 1896 launched \u201cthe Yankee\u201d, which retailed for $1. It proved so successful, and a boon to factory workers, farmers and railway men alike, that it became known as \u201cthe watch that made the dollar famous\u201d. On 16 November, Timex will release 1,000 wristwatches inspired by \u201cthe Yankee\u201d and designed by the respected watchmaker Giorgio Galli. \u201cIt just became a no-brainer, Shari Fabiani, CMO of Timex Group, says. \u201cAnd really fun when we started talking about it.\u201d Timex $1 watch is available from 16 November Just Looking edited by Julian Rothenstein (Redstone Press, \u00a316.95).

      "body": "<p>\u201cBut stupidity is not enough,\u201d wrote George Orwell in 1984. The facts must be eliminated. \u201cApplied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts.\u201d Followers must \u201cforget that one has ever believed the contrary\u201d. Memory must be erased. \u201cThis demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink.\u201d The past, like the facts, must be reinvented. \u201cFor when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the past, and no different past can ever have existed.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump keeps saying that if he is elected to a second term he will prosecute his political opponents, \u201cthe enemies within\u201d. On 22 October he stated, once again, that as president he would use \u201cextreme power \u2026 We can\u2019t play games with these people. These are people that are dangerous people<em> \u2026 </em>an enemy from within.\u201d</p> <p>At the very moment Trump delivered his remarks highlighting his campaign for a dictatorship, the Atlantic published an <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-military-generals-hitler/680327/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">article</a> by Jeffrey Goldberg confirming his motive. He reported that Trump, as president, had rebuked the US military command, stating: \u201cI need the kind of generals that Hitler had. People who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders.\u201d</p> <p>Then, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, the former general John Kelly, stepped from behind the curtain in an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">interview</a> with the New York Times. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said, \u201cthe former president is in the far-right area, he\u2019s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators \u2013 he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure. He certainly prefers the dictator approach to government.\u201d Kelly added, the Times wrote, that \u201cin his opinion, Mr Trump met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law\u201d.</p> <p>The warning of the generals against Trump\u2019s fascism is unanimous among those who have served most closely with him. The former chair of the joint chiefs, the retired general Mark Milley, told Bob Woodward, in his new book War, that Trump was \u201cfascist to the core\u201d. Trump\u2019s secretary of defense, the former general James Mattis, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4940720-bob-woodward-james-mattis-donald-trump-war-book/\">emailed</a> Woodward to express his agreement with Milley that Trump was \u201cthe most dangerous person ever\u201d, and \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we don\u2019t try to downplay the threat, because the threat is high.\u201d It\u2019s Defcon 1.</p> <p>In a case of exquisitely poor timing, two days before the latest revelations of Trump\u2019s despotic intent and his own insistent bellicose demands for absolute power to use against his \u201cenemies\u201d, the Wall Street Journal editorial board <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-fascist-meme-returns-donald-trump-election-voters-5e513359\">assured</a> its readers that Trump doesn\u2019t mean it. There is no reason to take him seriously. In any case \u201cthe public isn\u2019t buying this Democratic claim about Trump\u201d. The \u201cfascist meme\u201d is just partisan propaganda. \u201cThe answer is that most Americans simply don\u2019t believe the fascist meme, and for good reasons. The first is the evidence of Mr Trump\u2019s first term. Whatever his intentions, the former President was hemmed in by American checks and balances.\u201d</p> <p>Not satisfied with absurdly dismissing Trump\u2019s unapologetic statement, the Wall Street Journal felt compelled to airbrush the present and the past in the Orwellian tradition of \u201cdoublethink\u201d. Within 48 hours, however, its dismissal of the supposedly \u201cDemocratic claim\u201d about \u201cthe fascist meme\u201d was swept away by Kelly. Having discarded Milley\u2019s and Mattis\u2019s earlier statements, the Journal must have figured it could deposit Kelly\u2019s as well in the burn bag for facts in order to be able to embroider its sophistry. But, at least for the moment, creating doublethink is a demanding job.</p> <p>An essential element in the normalization of Trump and his fascism is the erasure of his crimes and transgressions when he was president \u2013 his \u201cfirst term\u201d, as the Journal disingenuously describes it, as though he\u2019s already elected to his second. Conjuring up an air of inevitability is another demoralizing Newspeak tactic. Trump\u2019s threats, when they are not dismissed as mere rhetoric, are too generally reported as if they are something new, that they exist solely in the vacuum of this campaign, and that he has no past. Trump\u2019s history is consigned to the memory hole.</p>    <p>But Trump\u2019s presidency was a rehearsal for fascism. Quite apart from his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/trump-scandals.html?searchResultPosition=2\">record</a> of kleptocracy, allegedly pervasive corruption and obstructions of justice, pardons of criminal associates and dangling of pardons to insure their silence, contempt for the law, maniacal obsession with Hitler, who \u201cdid some good things\u201d, scorn for military service (\u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers\u201d), worship of foreign tyrants, congenital lying, paranoid conspiracy mongering, disdain for climate science, willful neglect of public health, ignoring warnings and spreading falsehoods in the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9115435/\">Covid-19 pandemic</a> resulting in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands, the organization and incitement of the January 6 insurrection, and indifference to the near-assassination of his vice-president by a mob he had unleashed (\u201cSo what?\u201d), Trump systematically abused the Department of Justice to investigate, harass and prosecute his \u201cenemies within\u201d. Trump\u2019s current rage is hardly a new threat. In a second term he intends to smash through the constraints that inhibited him in his first.</p> <p>The Just Security website of the New York University School of Law <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/98703/chronology-trump-justice-department/\">reports</a>: \u201cThe cascade of election coverage, commentary and speculation about how Donald Trump might use the power of the presidency to retaliate against his perceived political enemies has overlooked important context: Trump has done just that, while he was president.\u201d Just Security distilled \u201cA Dozen Times Trump Pushed to Prosecute His Perceived Enemies\u201d, but there were many more.</p> <p>\u201cThe saddest thing is that because I\u2019m the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the justice department,\u201d Trump said on 2 November 2017. \u201cI am not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing. And I am very frustrated.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s years in office showed him on a learning curve of fascism. He saw democracy as a plot against him that he had to break down. Like a hotel burglar jimmying door locks, through trial and error he discovered how to turn the keys. He pushed and prodded looking for weaknesses and loopholes. He located the places where he encountered resistance. He felt for the limits and how to go beyond them. He found out who would deter him and who would enable him. He calculated the price of everyone. He discovered those whose craven ambition would serve him. He realized that ideology was a tool he could use like a crowbar. He absorbed the lessons of crime and punishment in order to commit greater crimes without punishment. His administration was a school for the making of a fascist.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Trump was frustrated that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself so that he could not kill the former FBI director Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign connections to the Russians. The Mueller report stated: \u201cAccording to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton \u2026\u201d</p> <p>After publicly attacking the justice department for not investigating \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d, Trump succeeded in intimidating Sessions into naming a special counsel to investigate the already <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/facts-uranium-one/\">debunked</a> conspiracy theory that Uranium One, a Canadian company, made a deal with the Russians in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. A grand jury was empaneled, issued subpoenas and prosecutors concluded there was no \u201cthere\u201d there. But it was not until two years later that the case was closed without any charges on 15 January 2021, five days before Trump left office.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think people like the fact that you got somebody at the top basically trying to dictate whether somebody should be prosecuted. I just think it\u2019s a banana republic when we go down that road</p> <footer> <cite>Federal judge Reggie Walton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump blamed the FBI for the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 campaign. His paranoia morphed into ever widening conspiracy theories about the \u201cdeep state\u201d. He fired the FBI director, James Comey, for not exonerating him. He forced the firing of the deputy director, Andrew McCabe, on 16 March 2018, two days before McCabe\u2019s scheduled retirement. The justice department opened an investigation into whether McCabe illegally leaked information about the Clinton email and Clinton Foundation probes. The federal judge overseeing the McCabe case, Reggie Walton, a George W Bush appointee, stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think people like the fact that you got somebody at the top basically trying to dictate whether somebody should be prosecuted. I just think it\u2019s a banana republic when we go down that road \u2026\u201d</p> <p>The case against McCabe was dropped without charges on 14 February 2020, and his back pay and pension were restored.</p> <p>On 20 May 2018, Trump demanded a justice department investigation into a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theory going all the way up to Barack Obama, in which Trump stated that \u201cthe FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes\u201d \u2013 \u201cSpygate\u201d. An investigation was opened. But on 11 December 2019, the justice department inspector general, Michael Horowitz, issued a <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/node/1100\">report</a> stating that, contrary to Trump\u2019s assertions, there was \u201cno evidence that the FBI attempted to place any [confidential human sources] within the Trump campaign \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>On 23 August 2018, Trump declared that his appointment of Sessions was a terrible mistake. In response, Sessions issued a statement: \u201cWhile I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\u201d The next day Trump tweeted a long list of his people he designated as enemies whom he demanded Session should investigate. \u201cCome on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!\u201d On 8 November, he forced Sessions to resign. The new attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, a compliant mid-level rightwing operative from Iowa, was a stand-in until William Barr took over in February 2019.</p> <p>Barr, who had been attorney general under George HW Bush, was advertised as a conservative Republican institutionalist. He knew how to game the system for the gamester in the interest of his own game. The cultural reactionary, on the board of the reactionary Opus Dei organization\u2019s Washington DC front, the Catholic Information Center, believed he was using the depraved Trump in a <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/news/william-barr-nations-top-lawyer-culture-warrior-catholic\">crusade</a> for the restoration of traditional morality. More importantly, Trump was the useful idiot to stock the federal bench with Federalist Society-stamped judges. Leonard Leo, chair of the Federalist Society, served on the Opus Dei group\u2019s board with Barr.</p> <p>Barr was the adult in the room who became Trump\u2019s enabler, enforcer and teacher. On 24 March 2019, Barr issued a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mueller-report-key-findings-from-william-barr-summary-letter-to-congress-today-2019-03-24/\">letter</a> pre-empting the release of the full Mueller report so that he could to distort its conclusions and present those distortions as truthful. He wrote that Trump\u2019s campaign had not \u201cconspired or coordinated\u201d with the Russians, that Trump had fully cooperated with the investigation and that Trump had not committed obstruction of justice. He redacted and withheld from the public key sections of the report. \u201cMueller\u2019s core premise \u2013 that the President acts \u2018corruptly\u2019 if he attempts to influence a proceeding in which his own conduct is being scrutinized \u2013 is untenable,\u201d Barr wrote to justify his cover-up.</p>    <p>The US House of Representatives held Barr in contempt for withholding the full report. It revealed that Trump had committed 10 indictable obstructions of justice to keep evidence and witnesses from investigators, which neither Barr nor his Biden-appointed successor, Merrick Garland, ever prosecuted. The report identified 272 contacts between Trump agents and Russian operatives, not one of which Trump reported to the FBI. Judge Walton ruled that Barr had \u201cdistorted\u201d and been \u201cmisleading\u201d about the contents of the report. On 30 September 2020, he <a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/judge-finds-doj-violated-federal-law-with-certain-mueller-report-redactions-orders-pages-released-before-election/\">decided</a> Barr had violated federal law and that the redacted sections should be released, which they were, only days before the 2020 election. But Barr was not about to open a prosecution of himself.</p> <p>The bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, released on 18 August 2020, <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/senate-intelligence-committee-russian-interference/8cf58e574d235164/full.pdf\">disclosed</a> literally hundreds of instances of Trump campaign involvement with Russian operations. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, regularly shared \u201csensitive internal polling data or Campaign strategy\u201d with a Russian intelligence officer, Konstantin Kilimnik, with whom he had a long relationship on behalf of Russian interests in Ukraine.</p> <p>One of Trump\u2019s obstructions, cited by Mueller, was his dangling of pardons for Manafort, who was convicted of numerous tax and financial frauds, and for Mike Flynn, the former national security adviser convicted for lying to the FBI and not registering as a foreign agent. Trump was enticing them not to testify. Both stonewalled, and both received pardons.</p> <p>After Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime dirty trickster, was convicted of lying to the Congress and obstructing justice about acting as a conduit for Russian intelligence through WikiLeaks on hacked Clinton campaign documents, among other murky things, and sentenced to nine years in prison, Trump expressed <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227122206783811585\">outrage</a>: \u201cThe real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them.\u201d Barr instantly intervened to reduce the sentence. The four prosecutors on the case <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/roger-stone-sentencing.html\">resigned</a> in protest.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227561237782855680\">tweeted</a>: \u201cCongratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought &amp; tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!\u201d Just before leaving office Trump would commute Stone\u2019s sentence.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as soon as Barr assumed his post he revived the \u201cSpygate\u201d conspiracy theory, declared \u201cspying did occur\u201d and appointed a special prosecutor to investigate what Trump called an \u201cattempted coup\u201d against him. Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/us/politics/barr-trump-campaign-spying.html\">denounced</a> the Mueller investigation as \u201cillegal\u201d: \u201cEverything about it was crooked \u2013 every single thing about it. There were dirty cops. These were bad people.\u201d</p> <p>Barr appointed John Durham, the former US attorney for Connecticut, who spent four years trying to prove Trump\u2019s accusation that the FBI\u2019s \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d investigation into Russian interference was a \u201choax\u201d, as Trump claimed. Durham\u2019s chief prosecutor, Nora Dannehy, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/20/former-prosecutor-resigned-trump-russia-probe-barr-00117255\">quit</a> because she thought he was running a political operation and that Barr had \u201cviolated DoJ guidelines\u201d. Durham interviewed nearly 500 witnesses, including Hillary Clinton, to determine \u201cwhether the conduct of these individuals or entities [with ties to the Clinton campaign] constituted a federal offense and whether admissible evidence would be sufficient to obtain a conviction for such an offense\u201d.</p> <p>Durham\u2019s two high-profile cases, against the attorney Michael Sussmann and the Russian analyst Igor Danchenko, resulted in embarrassing acquittals. Durham wound up convicting an FBI lawyer for altering an email in his effort to shortcut a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant, for which he received probation and community service. Durham ended his snark hunt by criticizing the FBI\u2019s investigation of Russian interference as \u201cseriously flawed\u201d, but without anything of consequence to show. Trump tweeted: \u201cWOW! After extensive research, Special Counsel John Durham concludes the FBI never should have launched the Trump-Russia Probe! In other words, the American Public was scammed \u2026\u201d</p> <p>For two years, Barr waged a war against Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, a Republican, who indicted Trump\u2019s personal attorney Michael Cohen on campaign finance charges for paying hush money to the adult film star Stormy Daniels to silence her about a sexual relationship with Trump. Trump clearly appeared in the indictment as Unindicted Co-Conspirator No 1. Barr pressured Berman to reopen the case in order to toss it out. Berman refused.</p> <p>Barr then tried to strong-arm Berman at Trump\u2019s instigation into indicting the former secretary of state John Kerry for trying to keep alive the Iran nuclear deal he negotiated during the Obama administration. Berman refused. Barr pushed Berman to indict Greg Craig, Obama\u2019s former legal counsel, on flimsy charges of not registering as a foreign agent, in order to have a prominent Democrat\u2019s scalp. Barr sent a deputy to tell Berman he should prosecute Craig to \u201ceven things out\u201d before the election. Again, Berman refused.</p> <p>Barr moved the Craig case to the District of Columbia, where he leveraged an indictment. On 4 September 2019, the jury acquitted Craig in less than five hours. \u201cThroughout my tenure as US attorney,\u201d Berman wrote in a memoir, \u201cTrump\u2019s Justice Department kept demanding that I use my office to aid them politically, and I kept declining \u2013 in ways just tactful enough to keep me from being fired. I walked this tightrope for two and a half years. Eventually, the rope snapped.\u201d</p> <p>Berman was conducting a criminal investigation into Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s attorney who had sought to fabricate dirt against Joe Biden in Trump\u2019s blackmailing of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in exchange for Stinger missiles, which precipitated Trump\u2019s first impeachment. On 19 June 2020, Barr announced Berman was resigning. It was news to him. He refused to go. Then, Trump fired him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It was all bullshit</p> <footer> <cite>Former attorney general William Barr, on Trump\u2019s claim of a fixed election</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After Trump lost the election of 2020, Barr was on board with Trump\u2019s claim it was stolen, sending a memo to DoJ prosecutors to investigate \u201cvote tabulation irregularities\u201d.

Later, Barr acknowledged, of Trump\u2019s assertion that the election was fixed: \u201cIt was all bullshit.\u201d On 14 December 2020, Trump attempted to get Barr\u2019s involvement in the fake electors scheme.

On the eve of 6 January, Barr relinquished the Tom Hagen role for his godfather. Trump was done with the disloyal consigliere. He turned to other helpers.</p> <p>After the January 6 insurrection, Barr <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/07/barr-trump-committed-betrayal-of-his-office-455812\">accused</a> Trump of a \u201cbetrayal of his office\u201d. \u201cAll of a sudden, Bill Barr changed.

Based on the fact that I greatly appreciate his wholehearted Endorsement, I am removing the word \u2018Lethargic\u2019 from my statement. Thank you Bill.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The conservative majority on the US supreme court, three of whose members Trump appointed, rescued him from facing trial for January 6 before the 2024 election. Taking up Trump\u2019s appeal, the court languidly spent months to render an opinion bestowing on him and future presidents absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for \u201cofficial acts\u201d. In its ruling, with a sharp understanding of Trump\u2019s methods, the court stated that a president could order a sham investigation of his political enemies, if he wished, without any restraint or accountability.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf\">decision</a> was explicit in granting free license to political prosecutions: \u201cThe indictment\u2019s allegations that the requested investigations were shams or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials. Because the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.\u201d</p> <p>The court has ruled: Trump\u2019s past efforts to stage \u201csham\u201d show trials of his \u201cenemies\u201d and launch a coup involving the DoJ are above the law.

Now do you begin to understand me?\u201d</p> <p>On 24 October of this month, Trump boasted about the unlimited power that he would possess once he is back in the White House. Speaking to the rightwing radio talkshow host Hugh Hewitt, he declared that he would at the start fire the special prosecutor Jack Smith, who has indicted him for his crimes of January 6 and stealing national security secrets. \u201cWe got immunity at the supreme court,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBut stupidity is not enough,\u201d wrote George Orwell in 1984. The facts must be eliminated. \u201cApplied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts.\u201d Followers must \u201cforget that one has ever believed the contrary\u201d. Memory must be erased. \u201cThis demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink.\u201d The past, like the facts, must be reinvented. \u201cFor when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the past, and no different past can ever have existed.\u201d Donald Trump keeps saying that if he is elected to a second term he will prosecute his political opponents, \u201cthe enemies within\u201d. On 22 October he stated, once again, that as president he would use \u201cextreme power \u2026 We can\u2019t play games with these people. These are people that are dangerous people \u2026 an enemy from within.\u201d At the very moment Trump delivered his remarks highlighting his campaign for a dictatorship, the Atlantic published an article by Jeffrey Goldberg confirming his motive. He reported that Trump, as president, had rebuked the US military command, stating: \u201cI need the kind of generals that Hitler had. People who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders.\u201d Then, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, the former general John Kelly, stepped from behind the curtain in an interview with the New York Times. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said, \u201cthe former president is in the far-right area, he\u2019s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators \u2013 he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure. He certainly prefers the dictator approach to government.\u201d Kelly added, the Times wrote, that \u201cin his opinion, Mr Trump met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law\u201d. The warning of the generals against Trump\u2019s fascism is unanimous among those who have served most closely with him. The former chair of the joint chiefs, the retired general Mark Milley, told Bob Woodward, in his new book War, that Trump was \u201cfascist to the core\u201d. Trump\u2019s secretary of defense, the former general James Mattis, emailed Woodward to express his agreement with Milley that Trump was \u201cthe most dangerous person ever\u201d, and \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we don\u2019t try to downplay the threat, because the threat is high.\u201d It\u2019s Defcon 1. In a case of exquisitely poor timing, two days before the latest revelations of Trump\u2019s despotic intent and his own insistent bellicose demands for absolute power to use against his \u201cenemies\u201d, the Wall Street Journal editorial board assured its readers that Trump doesn\u2019t mean it. There is no reason to take him seriously. In any case \u201cthe public isn\u2019t buying this Democratic claim about Trump\u201d. The \u201cfascist meme\u201d is just partisan propaganda. \u201cThe answer is that most Americans simply don\u2019t believe the fascist meme, and for good reasons. The first is the evidence of Mr Trump\u2019s first term. Whatever his intentions, the former President was hemmed in by American checks and balances.\u201d Not satisfied with absurdly dismissing Trump\u2019s unapologetic statement, the Wall Street Journal felt compelled to airbrush the present and the past in the Orwellian tradition of \u201cdoublethink\u201d. Within 48 hours, however, its dismissal of the supposedly \u201cDemocratic claim\u201d about \u201cthe fascist meme\u201d was swept away by Kelly. Having discarded Milley\u2019s and Mattis\u2019s earlier statements, the Journal must have figured it could deposit Kelly\u2019s as well in the burn bag for facts in order to be able to embroider its sophistry. But, at least for the moment, creating doublethink is a demanding job. An essential element in the normalization of Trump and his fascism is the erasure of his crimes and transgressions when he was president \u2013 his \u201cfirst term\u201d, as the Journal disingenuously describes it, as though he\u2019s already elected to his second. Conjuring up an air of inevitability is another demoralizing Newspeak tactic. Trump\u2019s threats, when they are not dismissed as mere rhetoric, are too generally reported as if they are something new, that they exist solely in the vacuum of this campaign, and that he has no past. Trump\u2019s history is consigned to the memory hole. But Trump\u2019s presidency was a rehearsal for fascism. Quite apart from his record of kleptocracy, allegedly pervasive corruption and obstructions of justice, pardons of criminal associates and dangling of pardons to insure their silence, contempt for the law, maniacal obsession with Hitler, who \u201cdid some good things\u201d, scorn for military service (\u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers\u201d), worship of foreign tyrants, congenital lying, paranoid conspiracy mongering, disdain for climate science, willful neglect of public health, ignoring warnings and spreading falsehoods in the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands, the organization and incitement of the January 6 insurrection, and indifference to the near-assassination of his vice-president by a mob he had unleashed (\u201cSo what?\u201d), Trump systematically abused the Department of Justice to investigate, harass and prosecute his \u201cenemies within\u201d. Trump\u2019s current rage is hardly a new threat. In a second term he intends to smash through the constraints that inhibited him in his first. The Just Security website of the New York University School of Law reports: \u201cThe cascade of election coverage, commentary and speculation about how Donald Trump might use the power of the presidency to retaliate against his perceived political enemies has overlooked important context: Trump has done just that, while he was president.\u201d Just Security distilled \u201cA Dozen Times Trump Pushed to Prosecute His Perceived Enemies\u201d, but there were many more. \u201cThe saddest thing is that because I\u2019m the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the justice department,\u201d Trump said on 2 November 2017. \u201cI am not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing. And I am very frustrated.\u201d Trump\u2019s years in office showed him on a learning curve of fascism. He saw democracy as a plot against him that he had to break down. Like a hotel burglar jimmying door locks, through trial and error he discovered how to turn the keys. He pushed and prodded looking for weaknesses and loopholes. He located the places where he encountered resistance. He felt for the limits and how to go beyond them. He found out who would deter him and who would enable him. He calculated the price of everyone. He discovered those whose craven ambition would serve him. He realized that ideology was a tool he could use like a crowbar. He absorbed the lessons of crime and punishment in order to commit greater crimes without punishment. His administration was a school for the making of a fascist. *** Trump was frustrated that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself so that he could not kill the former FBI director Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign connections to the Russians. The Mueller report stated: \u201cAccording to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton \u2026\u201d After publicly attacking the justice department for not investigating \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d, Trump succeeded in intimidating Sessions into naming a special counsel to investigate the already debunked conspiracy theory that Uranium One, a Canadian company, made a deal with the Russians in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. A grand jury was empaneled, issued subpoenas and prosecutors concluded there was no \u201cthere\u201d there. But it was not until two years later that the case was closed without any charges on 15 January 2021, five days before Trump left office. Trump blamed the FBI for the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 campaign. His paranoia morphed into ever widening conspiracy theories about the \u201cdeep state\u201d. He fired the FBI director, James Comey, for not exonerating him. He forced the firing of the deputy director, Andrew McCabe, on 16 March 2018, two days before McCabe\u2019s scheduled retirement. The justice department opened an investigation into whether McCabe illegally leaked information about the Clinton email and Clinton Foundation probes. The federal judge overseeing the McCabe case, Reggie Walton, a George W Bush appointee, stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think people like the fact that you got somebody at the top basically trying to dictate whether somebody should be prosecuted. I just think it\u2019s a banana republic when we go down that road \u2026\u201d The case against McCabe was dropped without charges on 14 February 2020, and his back pay and pension were restored. On 20 May 2018, Trump demanded a justice department investigation into a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theory going all the way up to Barack Obama, in which Trump stated that \u201cthe FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes\u201d \u2013 \u201cSpygate\u201d. An investigation was opened. But on 11 December 2019, the justice department inspector general, Michael Horowitz, issued a report stating that, contrary to Trump\u2019s assertions, there was \u201cno evidence that the FBI attempted to place any [confidential human sources] within the Trump campaign \u2026 \u201d On 23 August 2018, Trump declared that his appointment of Sessions was a terrible mistake. In response, Sessions issued a statement: \u201cWhile I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\u201d The next day Trump tweeted a long list of his people he designated as enemies whom he demanded Session should investigate. \u201cCome on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!\u201d On 8 November, he forced Sessions to resign. The new attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, a compliant mid-level rightwing operative from Iowa, was a stand-in until William Barr took over in February 2019. Barr, who had been attorney general under George HW Bush, was advertised as a conservative Republican institutionalist. He knew how to game the system for the gamester in the interest of his own game. The cultural reactionary, on the board of the reactionary Opus Dei organization\u2019s Washington DC front, the Catholic Information Center, believed he was using the depraved Trump in a crusade for the restoration of traditional morality. More importantly, Trump was the useful idiot to stock the federal bench with Federalist Society-stamped judges. Leonard Leo, chair of the Federalist Society, served on the Opus Dei group\u2019s board with Barr. Barr was the adult in the room who became Trump\u2019s enabler, enforcer and teacher. On 24 March 2019, Barr issued a letter pre-empting the release of the full Mueller report so that he could to distort its conclusions and present those distortions as truthful. He wrote that Trump\u2019s campaign had not \u201cconspired or coordinated\u201d with the Russians, that Trump had fully cooperated with the investigation and that Trump had not committed obstruction of justice. He redacted and withheld from the public key sections of the report. \u201cMueller\u2019s core premise \u2013 that the President acts \u2018corruptly\u2019 if he attempts to influence a proceeding in which his own conduct is being scrutinized \u2013 is untenable,\u201d Barr wrote to justify his cover-up. The US House of Representatives held Barr in contempt for withholding the full report. It revealed that Trump had committed 10 indictable obstructions of justice to keep evidence and witnesses from investigators, which neither Barr nor his Biden-appointed successor, Merrick Garland, ever prosecuted. The report identified 272 contacts between Trump agents and Russian operatives, not one of which Trump reported to the FBI. Judge Walton ruled that Barr had \u201cdistorted\u201d and been \u201cmisleading\u201d about the contents of the report. On 30 September 2020, he decided Barr had violated federal law and that the redacted sections should be released, which they were, only days before the 2020 election. But Barr was not about to open a prosecution of himself. The bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, released on 18 August 2020, disclosed literally hundreds of instances of Trump campaign involvement with Russian operations. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, regularly shared \u201csensitive internal polling data or Campaign strategy\u201d with a Russian intelligence officer, Konstantin Kilimnik, with whom he had a long relationship on behalf of Russian interests in Ukraine. One of Trump\u2019s obstructions, cited by Mueller, was his dangling of pardons for Manafort, who was convicted of numerous tax and financial frauds, and for Mike Flynn, the former national security adviser convicted for lying to the FBI and not registering as a foreign agent. Trump was enticing them not to testify. Both stonewalled, and both received pardons. After Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime dirty trickster, was convicted of lying to the Congress and obstructing justice about acting as a conduit for Russian intelligence through WikiLeaks on hacked Clinton campaign documents, among other murky things, and sentenced to nine years in prison, Trump expressed outrage: \u201cThe real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them.\u201d Barr instantly intervened to reduce the sentence. The four prosecutors on the case resigned in protest. Trump tweeted: \u201cCongratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought &amp; tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!\u201d Just before leaving office Trump would commute Stone\u2019s sentence. Meanwhile, as soon as Barr assumed his post he revived the \u201cSpygate\u201d conspiracy theory, declared \u201cspying did occur\u201d and appointed a special prosecutor to investigate what Trump called an \u201cattempted coup\u201d against him. Trump denounced the Mueller investigation as \u201cillegal\u201d: \u201cEverything about it was crooked \u2013 every single thing about it. There were dirty cops. These were bad people.\u201d Barr appointed John Durham, the former US attorney for Connecticut, who spent four years trying to prove Trump\u2019s accusation that the FBI\u2019s \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d investigation into Russian interference was a \u201choax\u201d, as Trump claimed. Durham\u2019s chief prosecutor, Nora Dannehy, quit because she thought he was running a political operation and that Barr had \u201cviolated DoJ guidelines\u201d. Durham interviewed nearly 500 witnesses, including Hillary Clinton, to determine \u201cwhether the conduct of these individuals or entities [with ties to the Clinton campaign] constituted a federal offense and whether admissible evidence would be sufficient to obtain a conviction for such an offense\u201d. Durham\u2019s two high-profile cases, against the attorney Michael Sussmann and the Russian analyst Igor Danchenko, resulted in embarrassing acquittals. Durham wound up convicting an FBI lawyer for altering an email in his effort to shortcut a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant, for which he received probation and community service. Durham ended his snark hunt by criticizing the FBI\u2019s investigation of Russian interference as \u201cseriously flawed\u201d, but without anything of consequence to show. Trump tweeted: \u201cWOW! After extensive research, Special Counsel John Durham concludes the FBI never should have launched the Trump-Russia Probe! In other words, the American Public was scammed \u2026\u201d For two years, Barr waged a war against Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, a Republican, who indicted Trump\u2019s personal attorney Michael Cohen on campaign finance charges for paying hush money to the adult film star Stormy Daniels to silence her about a sexual relationship with Trump. Trump clearly appeared in the indictment as Unindicted Co-Conspirator No 1. Barr pressured Berman to reopen the case in order to toss it out. Berman refused. Barr then tried to strong-arm Berman at Trump\u2019s instigation into indicting the former secretary of state John Kerry for trying to keep alive the Iran nuclear deal he negotiated during the Obama administration. Berman refused. Barr pushed Berman to indict Greg Craig, Obama\u2019s former legal counsel, on flimsy charges of not registering as a foreign agent, in order to have a prominent Democrat\u2019s scalp. Barr sent a deputy to tell Berman he should prosecute Craig to \u201ceven things out\u201d before the election. Again, Berman refused. Barr moved the Craig case to the District of Columbia, where he leveraged an indictment. On 4 September 2019, the jury acquitted Craig in less than five hours. \u201cThroughout my tenure as US attorney,\u201d Berman wrote in a memoir, \u201cTrump\u2019s Justice Department kept demanding that I use my office to aid them politically, and I kept declining \u2013 in ways just tactful enough to keep me from being fired. I walked this tightrope for two and a half years. Eventually, the rope snapped.\u201d Berman was conducting a criminal investigation into Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s attorney who had sought to fabricate dirt against Joe Biden in Trump\u2019s blackmailing of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in exchange for Stinger missiles, which precipitated Trump\u2019s first impeachment. On 19 June 2020, Barr announced Berman was resigning. It was news to him. He refused to go. Then, Trump fired him. After Trump lost the election of 2020, Barr was on board with Trump\u2019s claim it was stolen, sending a memo to DoJ prosecutors to investigate \u201cvote tabulation irregularities\u201d. Sixteen assistant US attorneys resigned in protest. Later, Barr acknowledged, of Trump\u2019s assertion that the election was fixed: \u201cIt was all bullshit.\u201d On 14 December 2020, Trump attempted to get Barr\u2019s involvement in the fake electors scheme. Barr declined to be ensnared in an obviously illegal act in a losing cause. He saved himself from becoming incriminated and resigned. Trump had already got whatever he wanted from Barr up to the last minute, when Barr\u2019s instinct for personal self-preservation asserted itself. On the eve of 6 January, Barr relinquished the Tom Hagen role for his godfather. Trump was done with the disloyal consigliere. He turned to other helpers. After the January 6 insurrection, Barr accused Trump of a \u201cbetrayal of his office\u201d. \u201cAll of a sudden, Bill Barr changed. You hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d Trump remarked. Yet this past April, Barr endorsed Trump for re-election, explaining that \u201cthe threat to freedom and democracy has always been on the left.\u201d Trump sneered: \u201cWow! Former AG Bill Barr, who let a lot of great people down by not investigating Voter Fraud in our Country, has just Endorsed me for President despite the fact that I called him \u2018Weak, Slow Moving, Lethargic, Gutless, and Lazy\u2019. Based on the fact that I greatly appreciate his wholehearted Endorsement, I am removing the word \u2018Lethargic\u2019 from my statement. Thank you Bill.\u201d *** The conservative majority on the US supreme court, three of whose members Trump appointed, rescued him from facing trial for January 6 before the 2024 election. Taking up Trump\u2019s appeal, the court languidly spent months to render an opinion bestowing on him and future presidents absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for \u201cofficial acts\u201d. In its ruling, with a sharp understanding of Trump\u2019s methods, the court stated that a president could order a sham investigation of his political enemies, if he wished, without any restraint or accountability. The decision was explicit in granting free license to political prosecutions: \u201cThe indictment\u2019s allegations that the requested investigations were shams or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials. Because the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.\u201d The court has ruled: Trump\u2019s past efforts to stage \u201csham\u201d show trials of his \u201cenemies\u201d and launch a coup involving the DoJ are above the law. His future dictatorship in which he could exact retribution from his \u201cenemies within\u201d, deploying the DoJ, has received advance approval. The supreme court\u2019s immunity decision justifying Trump despotism, presented by Chief Justice John Roberts, was better explained in the twisted language of an apparatchik from the Ministry of Truth in Orwell\u2019s 1984: \u201cWe know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?\u201d On 24 October of this month, Trump boasted about the unlimited power that he would possess once he is back in the White House. Speaking to the rightwing radio talkshow host Hugh Hewitt, he declared that he would at the start fire the special prosecutor Jack Smith, who has indicted him for his crimes of January 6 and stealing national security secrets. \u201cWe got immunity at the supreme court,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy. I would fire him within two seconds.\u201d Trump would then have 86,398 seconds left to be a dictator on \u201cday one\u201d. Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel and All the Powers of Earth.

      "body": "<h2>Travel at a discount</h2> <p>There are regional schemes that offer cheap or free travel to young people. In London, travel on buses is free with a 16+ Zip Oyster photocard, rather than \u00a31.75 a trip, and you get 50% off adult pay as you go fares on the tube, DLR and London Overground until 30 September in the year after your 18th birthday. If you are 19 and turned 18 before 31 August, live in Greater London and are in the sixth form, college or training, you are still eligible for the concession. </p> <p>You would usually need to <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/free-and-discounted-travel/11-15-zip-oyster-photocard?intcmp=55575\">apply for a card</a>, provide a photo of yourself and pay a \u00a315 admin fee. However, Transport for London has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/17/london-students-fear-abandoning-courses-over-inability-to-apply-for-discounted-fares\">suspended applications</a> for discounted travelcards because of a cybersecurity incident.</p> <p>When the suspension is lifted, if you are 18 or over, a student and living in a London borough, you can get 30% off adult-rate travelcards and bus and tram pass season tickets with an 18+ Student Oyster photo card. However, you don\u2019t get the discount for pay as you go fares. It lasts three years. There is a \u00a320 administration cost for the 16+ zipcard and 18+ photocard.</p> <p>System One membership lets you buy discounted Greater Manchester travel tickets on buses and trains if you are aged between 16 and 21. Membership is free and lasts until the day before your 22nd birthday, and you have to upload a photo of your passport to qualify. Through the scheme a 28-day Bee AnyBus Young Person pass costs \u00a361.90, whereas for adults it is \u00a385.40 \u2013 a \u00a323.50 saving.</p> <p>In Scotland, if you are under 22, you are eligible to apply for free bus travel across the country under the Free Bus Travel Scheme.

You need to apply for a pass but it is free to sign up.</p> <p>To travel cross-country, you can use a National Express young person coachcard if you are between 16 and 26. It offers 15% off travel for \u00a315 a year, or \u00a335 for three years, plus \u00a33 for postage and packaging. You can use it to travel at any time as there are no restrictions on peak and off peak tickets.</p>    <p>A National Railcard lets you buy discounted tickets on trains in England, Scotland, and Wales. The 16-25 railcard costs \u00a330 for a year, or \u00a370 for three years, and you get a third off rail fares. If you buy a three-year pass the day before your 24th birthday, it will run until you are 27.</p> <p>You can connect your railcard to your Oyster card to save on some journeys in London. Once connected, you get a third off on off-peak pay as you go travel. The Oyster card costs \u00a37 to buy.

You must be 27 or younger on the date you start your trip. The five-day pass costs \u20ac239 (\u00a3198) for second class compared with \u20ac318 (\u00a3264) for an adult pass.</p> <h2><strong>Watch films for less</strong></h2> <p>Many cinemas offer cheaper showings for those under 25.

Curzon cinemas offer a similar under-25 membership, which gives you 10% off food and drink, discounts on home cinema rentals, and tickets from \u00a39 at peak times and \u00a36 during off-peak hours. Both are free to join. </p> <p>If you are under the age of 26, you can also get \u00a33 film tickets at BFI Southbank in London and discounted tickets to BFI festivals.

You may need to show ID to a member of staff on arrival.</p> <p>At Sadler\u2019s Wells in London, you can get \u00a310 tickets if you sign up to the Barclays Dance Pass for 16- to 30-year-olds. You can book up to two tickets for each performance.</p> <p>Also in London, the National Theatre offers similar cut-rate tickets to under-25s, at \u00a310 or under for shows, and more are released every month. Tickets are limited to two each. You may be asked for ID on the door.</p> <h2><strong>Visit a gallery</strong></h2> <p>Many galleries offer young person discounts or free entry to exhibitions and events. Tate Collective for 16- to 25-year-olds is free to join and gets you \u00a35 exhibition tickets, free events and discounts across Tate galleries. You can also get \u00a35 tickets to exhibitions at the Barbican with the Young Barbican membership.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.artfund.org/national-art-pass?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Brand&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsJO4BhDoARIsADDv4vB9UubBZHd7n25qPlX9NZ5VzXNNY8NCbzZ2zPqeAFL_uJIZdzEMqoIaAuZpEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">under-30 National Art pass</a> costs \u00a336 annually if you sign up to a direct debit, or \u00a348 for a one-off card payment, and gets you reduced entry to museums, galleries and historic places across the UK. You get free entry to more than 250 places and 50% off some exhibitions. You can also get discounts in some of the museums\u2019 shops and cafes.</p>    <h2><strong>Get moving</strong></h2> <p>Look out for discounted membership at gyms and sports clubs. Village Health and Wellness Club gym has sites from Aberdeen to Watford, and offers a young peoples membership to those aged 16 to 22. The prices vary by location, but in Liverpool it costs \u00a346 a month, compared with \u00a370 for a similar adult membership.</p> <p>In London, Paddington sports club offers a young person fitness membership, which gives you access to the gym and classes, for \u00a3263 a year if you are aged between 18 and 24. That is just under \u00a322 a month, or about \u00a39 cheaper than the adult membership.</p> <h2><strong>Shop around</strong></h2> <p>If you are at university or a graduate it is worth checking out discount directories such as <a href=\"https://www.savethestudent.org/save-money\">Save the Student</a> as you can find lots of reductions that aren\u2019t always well advertised. </p> <p>\u201cA couple of the major student discount providers run graduate discount schemes, too, helping you retain access to hundreds of discounts even after you leave uni,\u201d says Tom Allingham, a money expert at Save the Student.

      "body": "<p>How do you like your horror? Elevated arthouse or sleazy splatter? Comfortably cliched or disturbingly groundbreaking? Disgustingly gruesome or so subtle you can\u2019t work out why you\u2019re uneasy? Do you limit your consumption of horror films to Halloween but steer clear the rest of the year? Or are you a horror fiend who just can\u2019t get enough of it, whatever the season?</p> <p>The good news is that the horror genre has been going strong for more than a century, so you\u2019ll never run out of films to scare you. From early silents Le Manoir du diable (1896) and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) to this year\u2019s genuinely gruesome slasher hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/10/terrifier-3-review-killer-clown-is-tooled-up-for-third-helping-of-gleeful-gorefest\">Terrifier 3</a> \u2013 which recently knocked Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux off the top of the US box office \u2013 there has never been any shortage of audiences lining up to be chilled, unsettled or downright freaked out. Just look at this year\u2019s robust box office on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/18/abigail-movie-review-dracula-daughter\">Abigail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/20/immaculate-sydney-sweeney-review\">Immaculate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jul/10/longlegs-review-nicolas-cage-horror-movie\">Longlegs</a>, as well as artier offerings such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/19/the-substance-review-demi-moore-coralie-fargeat\">The Substance</a>. The future of cinema, it seems, is horror. And not just in terms of profit, but in visual imagination, envelope-pushing and audience enjoyment.</p> <p>Every genre fan knows Dracula and&nbsp;Frankenstein, King Kong,&nbsp;The Exorcist, Carrie, An American Werewolf in London, The&nbsp;Silence of the Lambs and so on. But behind every gamechanger, there&nbsp;are antecedents and influences, both direct and indirect. And however beloved the canon, there&nbsp;are always less familiar treasures to be unearthed. So here I have traced the evolution of the horror genre in 10 films. For&nbsp;the most part I have avoided the big beasts and instead highlighted some less familiar, but no less significant efforts in the long history of the genre.</p> <p>If the most recent title in this selection is from 2001, it doesn\u2019t mean&nbsp;21st-century horror is in decline. On the contrary, the genre is thriving, with film-makers such as Jordan Peele exploring new avenues, more female directors adding their voices to the mix,&nbsp;and subgenres overlapping in surprising new ways. It takes time for trends to coalesce; it wasn\u2019t until 30&nbsp;years after its release that The Wicker Man (1973), and films with related themes, were given the label \u201cfolk horror\u201d. But of one thing you can&nbsp;be sure: the genre is a constantly evolving beast, and horror films will continue to shock, delight and terrify us for many years to come.</p> <h2><strong>Monsters: </strong><strong>N</strong><strong>osferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922)</strong></h2>    <p><em>\u201c</em><em>And when he crossed the bridge, the&nbsp;phantoms came to meet him</em><em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>FW Murnau\u2019s unofficial adaptation of Dracula provided a blueprint for the gothic monster movie. From Universal\u2019s creature features to Hammer\u2019s dark fairytales, the monsters were invariably foreign interlopers injecting polite society with erotic energy. Murnau\u2019s silent expressionist masterpiece also introduced a&nbsp;specifically cinematic feature that has since become lore: the&nbsp;vampire destroyed by daylight. Werner Herzog remade it in 1979, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/the-northman-director-robert-eggers-interview\">Robert Eggers</a>\u2019s new version hits cinemas at the end of 2024.</p> <h2><strong>Mad science: </strong><strong>D</strong><strong>r Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1931)</strong></h2>    <p><em>\u201c</em><em>I\u2019ve played with dangerous knowledge!</em><em>\u201d</em></p> <p>In Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s 1886 novella and its umpteen adaptations, the horror comes not from outside, but from within. From Frankenstein and The Invisible Man to Re-Animator, hubristic experiments invariably end in carnage. Fredric March won an Oscar for his bravura mad scientist performance in Rouben Mamoulian\u2019s version, which anticipates slasher movie conventions with its first-person point-of-view camerawork, and raised the special effects bar with an extraordinary onscreen transformation, achieved with coloured filters.</p> <h2><strong>Satanism: </strong><strong>T</strong><strong>he Seventh Victim (1943)</strong></h2>    <p><em>\u201c</em><em>If one believes in God, one must believe&nbsp;in the </em><em>devil.</em><em>\u201d</em></p> <p>Val Lewton, who produced a series of low-key, low-budget horror films for RKO in the 1940s, anticipated Roman Polanski\u2019s Rosemary\u2019s Baby by 25 years with this poetically downbeat tale of New York satanism. And it was Night of the Demon (1957), directed by Lewton alumnus Jacques Tourneur, that bridged the gap between shadowy witch cults and the unambiguous devilry that would flood cinemas with in-your-face demonic possessions and unnatural pregnancies in Rosemary\u2019s wake.</p> <h2><strong>Dreams and hallucinations: </strong><strong>D</strong><strong>ead of Night (1945)</strong></h2>    <p><em>\u201c</em><em>Everybody in this room is part of my&nbsp;dream</em><em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>An architect experiences extreme deja vu at a country house party where the guests tell spooky stories. Ealing Studios\u2019 anthology takes the \u201cit was all a dream\u201d cliche to its logical, terrifying conclusion. The blurred line between dreams<strong> </strong>and reality has never been evoked so well as in horror films, embracing such variations as death dreams, premonitions, characters revealed as figments of the imagination, and the uncanny non-linear visions of Nicolas Roeg (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/05/dont-look-now-review-roeg-horror-julie-christie-donald-sutherland\">Don\u2019t Look Now</a>) and David Lynch (Eraserhead onwards).</p> <h2><strong>Aliens: I</strong><strong>nvasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)</strong></h2>    <p><em>\u201c</em><em>Some weird alien organism, a&nbsp;mutation of some kind</em><em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>Horror and science fiction have always gone hand in hand. But aliens emerged as an amorphous peril in their own right in Don Siegel\u2019s film of Jack Finney\u2019s The Body Snatchers, which channelled cold war paranoia and McCarthyism into a nightmare where even loved ones can\u2019t be trusted. Two successful remakes (and a botched one) followed. Meanwhile, Italian maestro Mario Bava prefigured Alien with his eerie Planet of the Vampires (1965), and Quatermass and the Pit (1967) showed us the Martians are already here \u2013 and they\u2019re us!</p> <h2><strong>Slashers: </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>eeping Tom (1960)</strong></h2>    <p><em>\u201cImagine \u2026 someone coming towards you \u2026 who wants to kill you \u2026 regardless of the consequences</em><em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>The Spiral Staircase (1946) featured proto-slasher elements, but it wasn\u2019t until 1960 that Peeping Tom and Psycho sowed the seeds of the modern slasher movie, in which the mortal threat arises from psychiatric disorder rather than anything supernatural. Bava, ever prescient, got in early with&nbsp;Blood and Black Lace (1964) and&nbsp;A&nbsp;Bay of Blood (1971), followed by&nbsp;Black Christmas, Halloween and Friday the 13th. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/23/how-we-made-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-robert-englund-heather-langenkamp\">A Nightmare on Elm&nbsp;Street</a> (1984) reintroduced supernatural elements to the formula, while Vincent Price horror-comedies The Abominable Dr Phibes (1971) and&nbsp;Theatre of Blood (1973) laid the groundwork for the theme-killing of&nbsp;Se7en (1995) and its imitators.</p> <h2><strong>Sadeian cinema: </strong><strong>T</strong><strong>wo Thousand Maniacs!

      "bodyText": "How do you like your horror? Elevated arthouse or sleazy splatter? Comfortably cliched or disturbingly groundbreaking? Disgustingly gruesome or so subtle you can\u2019t work out why you\u2019re uneasy? Do you limit your consumption of horror films to Halloween but steer clear the rest of the year? Or are you a horror fiend who just can\u2019t get enough of it, whatever the season? The good news is that the horror genre has been going strong for more than a century, so you\u2019ll never run out of films to scare you. From early silents Le Manoir du diable (1896) and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) to this year\u2019s genuinely gruesome slasher hit Terrifier 3 \u2013 which recently knocked Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux off the top of the US box office \u2013 there has never been any shortage of audiences lining up to be chilled, unsettled or downright freaked out. Just look at this year\u2019s robust box office on Abigail, Immaculate and Longlegs, as well as artier offerings such as The Substance. The future of cinema, it seems, is horror. And not just in terms of profit, but in visual imagination, envelope-pushing and audience enjoyment. Every genre fan knows Dracula and Frankenstein, King Kong, The Exorcist, Carrie, An American Werewolf in London, The Silence of the Lambs and so on. But behind every gamechanger, there are antecedents and influences, both direct and indirect. And however beloved the canon, there are always less familiar treasures to be unearthed. So here I have traced the evolution of the horror genre in 10 films. For the most part I have avoided the big beasts and instead highlighted some less familiar, but no less significant efforts in the long history of the genre. If the most recent title in this selection is from 2001, it doesn\u2019t mean 21st-century horror is in decline. On the contrary, the genre is thriving, with film-makers such as Jordan Peele exploring new avenues, more female directors adding their voices to the mix, and subgenres overlapping in surprising new ways. It takes time for trends to coalesce; it wasn\u2019t until 30 years after its release that The Wicker Man (1973), and films with related themes, were given the label \u201cfolk horror\u201d. But of one thing you can be sure: the genre is a constantly evolving beast, and horror films will continue to shock, delight and terrify us for many years to come. Monsters: Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922) \u201cAnd when he crossed the bridge, the phantoms came to meet him.\u201d FW Murnau\u2019s unofficial adaptation of Dracula provided a blueprint for the gothic monster movie. From Universal\u2019s creature features to Hammer\u2019s dark fairytales, the monsters were invariably foreign interlopers injecting polite society with erotic energy. Murnau\u2019s silent expressionist masterpiece also introduced a specifically cinematic feature that has since become lore: the vampire destroyed by daylight. Werner Herzog remade it in 1979, and Robert Eggers\u2019s new version hits cinemas at the end of 2024. Mad science: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1931) \u201cI\u2019ve played with dangerous knowledge!\u201d In Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s 1886 novella and its umpteen adaptations, the horror comes not from outside, but from within. From Frankenstein and The Invisible Man to Re-Animator, hubristic experiments invariably end in carnage. Fredric March won an Oscar for his bravura mad scientist performance in Rouben Mamoulian\u2019s version, which anticipates slasher movie conventions with its first-person point-of-view camerawork, and raised the special effects bar with an extraordinary onscreen transformation, achieved with coloured filters. Satanism: The Seventh Victim (1943) \u201cIf one believes in God, one must believe in the devil.\u201d Val Lewton, who produced a series of low-key, low-budget horror films for RKO in the 1940s, anticipated Roman Polanski\u2019s Rosemary\u2019s Baby by 25 years with this poetically downbeat tale of New York satanism. And it was Night of the Demon (1957), directed by Lewton alumnus Jacques Tourneur, that bridged the gap between shadowy witch cults and the unambiguous devilry that would flood cinemas with in-your-face demonic possessions and unnatural pregnancies in Rosemary\u2019s wake. Dreams and hallucinations: Dead of Night (1945) \u201cEverybody in this room is part of my dream.\u201d An architect experiences extreme deja vu at a country house party where the guests tell spooky stories. Ealing Studios\u2019 anthology takes the \u201cit was all a dream\u201d cliche to its logical, terrifying conclusion. The blurred line between dreams and reality has never been evoked so well as in horror films, embracing such variations as death dreams, premonitions, characters revealed as figments of the imagination, and the uncanny non-linear visions of Nicolas Roeg (Don\u2019t Look Now) and David Lynch (Eraserhead onwards). Aliens: Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) \u201cSome weird alien organism, a mutation of some kind.\u201d Horror and science fiction have always gone hand in hand. But aliens emerged as an amorphous peril in their own right in Don Siegel\u2019s film of Jack Finney\u2019s The Body Snatchers, which channelled cold war paranoia and McCarthyism into a nightmare where even loved ones can\u2019t be trusted. Two successful remakes (and a botched one) followed. Meanwhile, Italian maestro Mario Bava prefigured Alien with his eerie Planet of the Vampires (1965), and Quatermass and the Pit (1967) showed us the Martians are already here \u2013 and they\u2019re us! Slashers: Peeping Tom (1960) \u201cImagine \u2026 someone coming towards you \u2026 who wants to kill you \u2026 regardless of the consequences.\u201d The Spiral Staircase (1946) featured proto-slasher elements, but it wasn\u2019t until 1960 that Peeping Tom and Psycho sowed the seeds of the modern slasher movie, in which the mortal threat arises from psychiatric disorder rather than anything supernatural. Bava, ever prescient, got in early with Blood and Black Lace (1964) and A Bay of Blood (1971), followed by Black Christmas, Halloween and Friday the 13th. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) reintroduced supernatural elements to the formula, while Vincent Price horror-comedies The Abominable Dr Phibes (1971) and Theatre of Blood (1973) laid the groundwork for the theme-killing of Se7en (1995) and its imitators. Sadeian cinema: Two Thousand Maniacs! (1964) \u201cBrutal \u2026 evil \u2026 ghastly beyond belief!\u201d Low-budget exploitation director Herschell Gordon Lewis advanced the cause of gore for gore\u2019s sake in films such as this splatter version of Brigadoon, in which southern rednecks butcher Yankee tourists in graphic ways. Sadeian Cinema (alluding to the Marquis de Sade, who derived pleasure from the suffering of others) pushes boundaries of what is acceptable on screen, and provides young horror fans with a gruelling rite of passage. It eventually morphed into the New French Extremity genre, the Saw franchise (2004 onwards) and A Serbian Film (2010). Sadeian masterpieces, if you\u2019re brave enough, include Tobe Hooper\u2019s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975). Zombies and gore: Dawn of the Dead (1978) \u201cThey\u2019re us, that\u2019s all.\u201d George A Romero\u2019s Night of the Living Dead (1968) broke all the horror rules (entrail-eating, no comic relief, everybody dies) and had as drastic an effect on horror cinema as Easy Rider had on mainstream Hollywood, but it wasn\u2019t until his first sequel that flesh-ripping zombies became the monster du jour. Italian film-makers such as Lucio Fulci took this template and added even more splatter, while low-budget cinema was overrun with walking cadavers of all persuasions. Shuffling or sprinting, comic or poignant, they can be metaphors for everything, from viral contagion to any depersonalised social group. Body horror: Videodrome (1983) \u201cLong live the New Flesh!\u201d Canadian director David Cronenberg virtually invented the body horror subgenre with his gruesome thought experiments featuring sexual parasites, armpit implants and \u2013 in this ahead-of-its-time media meltdown \u2013 James Woods as a cable TV programmer who develops a pulsating VCR slot in his stomach. With the expanding interest in piercings, tattoos, cosmetic surgery and gender fluidity, it\u2019s not surprising Cronenberg\u2019s successors have continued to explore physical modification themes in films such as Titane (2021). Meanwhile, Japanese director Shinya Tsukamoto pushed that modification into cyberpunk territory with Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989). Techno horror and ghosts: Kairo, AKA Pulse (2001) \u201cI just feel like something\u2019s wrong.\u201d The Blair Witch Project (1999) kickstarted the found-footage phenomenon already glimpsed in Cannibal Holocaust (1980). But it was Japanese film-makers who most fruitfully explored the horror of new technology: a cursed video in Ring (1998), mobile phones in One Missed Call (2003), and an internet of ghosts feeding off the alienation of the living in Kiyoshi Kurosawa\u2019s unnerving masterpiece, Kairo. The new wave of horror that followed took its cue from chatrooms, hackers and the dark web. Kurosawa\u2019s slow-burn approach, shared by Hideo Nakata (Dark Water) and Takashi Shimizu (The Grudge), also triggered a global resurgence in ghost stories, shying away from the graphic Sadeian horrors of Saw and harking back to the subtler chills of The Uninvited (1944), The Innocents (1961) and The Haunting (1963).",

      "body": "<p>I heard <em>The Hotel</em> before I read it \u2013 Daisy Johnson\u2019s second short story collection was broadcast on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mrcg\">Radio 4</a>, at night, during a Covid lockdown. The 15 gothic tales went out over several weeks and were beautifully produced, summoning the uncanny atmosphere of the Fens, the lost, broken, female narrators like ghosts coming over the airwaves on those bleak winter evenings. Johnson has always been about atmosphere: her prose slops and shifts, weird and unsettling, asking you to check your footing with each step into her marshy world.</p> <p>The stories are linked by place first of all. The Fenland hotel is built on a site that already has something cursed about it: \u201cthe earth\u2026 looks as if darkness itself has slipped from the sky and filled the ground\u201d. A woman who was<strong> </strong>thought a witch had been<strong> </strong>drowned there and now haunts the place. \u201cThis land and I share some similarities,\u201d she tells us in the first story, \u201cthis land knows the way I know, this land can see everything, it can see us and what lies ahead.\u201d</p>    <p>The tales build and magnify, reflecting and working in eerie harmony on the reader as we are drawn deeper into the hotel\u2019s mysterious world. The most obvious point of comparison is Shirley Jackson\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/07/haunting-hill-house-shirley-jackson\">The Haunting of Hill House</a></em>, but Johnson is a more accomplished stylist than Jackson, her sentences more elegant and impactful, her project more ambitious and literary.

      "bodyText": "I heard The Hotel before I read it \u2013 Daisy Johnson\u2019s second short story collection was broadcast on Radio 4, at night, during a Covid lockdown. The 15 gothic tales went out over several weeks and were beautifully produced, summoning the uncanny atmosphere of the Fens, the lost, broken, female narrators like ghosts coming over the airwaves on those bleak winter evenings. Johnson has always been about atmosphere: her prose slops and shifts, weird and unsettling, asking you to check your footing with each step into her marshy world. The stories are linked by place first of all. The Fenland hotel is built on a site that already has something cursed about it: \u201cthe earth\u2026 looks as if darkness itself has slipped from the sky and filled the ground\u201d. A woman who was thought a witch had been drowned there and now haunts the place. \u201cThis land and I share some similarities,\u201d she tells us in the first story, \u201cthis land knows the way I know, this land can see everything, it can see us and what lies ahead.\u201d The tales build and magnify, reflecting and working in eerie harmony on the reader as we are drawn deeper into the hotel\u2019s mysterious world. The most obvious point of comparison is Shirley Jackson\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House, but Johnson is a more accomplished stylist than Jackson, her sentences more elegant and impactful, her project more ambitious and literary. Folk horror from MR James through The Wicker Man to the likes of Andrew Michael Hurley and Zoe Gilbert is another clear influence. What Johnson adds to this lineage is a fierce interrogation of women\u2019s roles within these types of tales. All of the stories are narrated by women and there is a sense that the hotel is a prison and a means of escape for them. I last encountered Johnson\u2019s words spoken by Helena Bonham Carter in Punchdrunk\u2019s brilliantly immersive Viola\u2019s Room. There, she used the power of suggestion, the dark edges of fairytales, the way we are all haunted by our own pasts to create a work of extraordinary power.

She had a business school, podcast, festival and two clothing lines and was chief executive of seven international companies.</p> <p>But as journalist Hayley Phelan puts it in Breath of Fire, \u201cI never understood why there weren\u2019t more questions about a white woman in a turban.\u201d Griggs was also a would-be cult leader who bullied staff, practised cultural appropriation and embraced conspiracy theories such as QAnon before her unexpected death at the age of 41.

This is combined with new interviews with those who fell under Griggs\u2019s spell as they sought community, rituals and spiritual fulfillment outside established religion.</p> <p>This aspect struck a chord with the film\u2019s directors, Hayley Pappas and Smiley Stevens, themselves millennials with an interest in spirituality. Pappas, 34, says via Zoom from Los Angeles: \u201cSo much of it spoke to a shared sentiment that we could feel and our peers could feel. This sense of seeking and looking for spirituality in less conventional places, particularly as these traditional religious institutions have lost their influence with our peers.\u201d</p> <p>Griggs was born on a Colorado farm in the summer of 1979. She was raised by a single mother, a dance movement therapist who exposed Griggs to different forms of spirituality, from tarot cards to Tibetan prayer flags. Pappas says: \u201cKatie was raised around a lot of fascinating conversations and discussions around self-transformation and exploration of the psyche and spirituality.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWV-5tMgLKo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OWV-5tMgLKo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Griggs dropped out of university in her early 20s but went on to earn a degree from Antioch College in Ohio. She looked for answers outside the old religions and found them in kundalini, a form of yoga that involves intense breath work, repetitive poses and wearing all white to expand the aura by exactly 1ft, as well as abstention from recreational drugs and alcohol.</p> <p>Kundalini was popularised in America by Harbhajan Singh Khalsa, a customs inspector at the Delhi airport who, having got a woman pregnant, fled India for the US in the late 1960s. In classic American fashion, he had a blank canvas on which to reinvent himself and make his fortune.</p> <p>Styling himself as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/09/us/yogi-bhajan-75-boss-of-worlds-spiritual-and-capitalistic-dies.html\">Yogi Bhajan</a>, he claimed that kundalini was an ancient form of yoga long kept secret; in reality he made it up himself. Bhajan gained a grassroots following, built ashrams all over America and helped create 17 businesses. He was accused of rape and sexual abuse by several dozen of his female followers, as well as child abuse and widespread fraud. <a href=\"https://www.gurumag.com/yogi-bhajan-investigation-finds-rape-group-sex-abuse/?ref=gurumag.com\">An investigation</a> carried out after his death in 2004 found the allegations to be credible.</p> <p>Yet Griggs presented herself as his spiritual heir and staunch defender; to some, his unlikely reincarnation. She claimed that Bhajan gave her the name Guru Jagat. She founded <a href=\"https://ramayogainstitute.com/\">the Ra Ma Institute</a>, turning a kundalini yoga studio into a multimillion-dollar commercial empire. She combined mastery of social media with charisma, humour and a brand of Cardi B-style feminism that resonated with millennial women.</p> <p>Stevens, 36, reflects: \u201cWe had to watch lots and lots of footage of her teaching and we were like, we could actually hang out with this person. We actually thought she\u2019s super charismatic and would make funny jokes all the time too. That definitely helped her in her ascent.\u201d</p> <p>Griggs was also adept at marketing and branding her Ra Ma studio. \u201cThey did a really good job of delivering something that spoke to millennials and had great graphic design and cool colours and funny videos. She was on TikTok and she was on Instagram and she was doing all of the things that actually spoke to millennials. She was intentional about her marketing and did quite a good job of that.\u201d</p> <p>Pappas adds: \u201cShe leveraged social media in an intentional and effective way. She brought spirituality, particularly kundalini, into the social media landscape and she also tapped into a feminist ideology and sentiment.</p> <p>\u201cShe converged with girlboss culture and she embodied and became the girlboss, if you will, of the spiritual circles in a lot of ways. Katie was somebody who was always looking for her own stage and this was the stage where she found her audience and she found what she would say her calling.\u201d</p> <p>Griggs wore white flowing clothes and wrapped her hair in a turban in what critics saw as a blatant attempt to adopt the trappings of the Sikh religion and imbue herself with faux-spirituality. <a href=\"https://sundeepmorrison.com/\">Sundeep Morrison</a>, a Sikh activist and journalist, says in the film: \u201cAs a Sikh it was alarming and it was heartbreaking seeing our scriptures, our prayers used as decoration. And even the article of faith of the turban is seen as a sacred symbol and for to her to wear it with her hair sticking out is bastardising the article of faith.\u201d</p> <p>Other interviewees have mixed feelings, recalling how they came to regard Griggs as a friend yet how she could also be abusive to them. <em>\u201c</em>They could still access what it was that drew them to her, what it was that kept them there so long and the good parts of her that they did enjoy.</p> <p>\u201cAnd at the same time, they were very aware of and angry about her various wrongdoings and the way that she treated individuals and who she ultimately became in the end. It was particularly messy because of how drastically she evolved over those years.\u201d</p>    <p>Griggs fell for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/01/02/1146318331/yoga-guru-qanon-conspiracy-theories\">QAnon and other far-right conspiracy theories</a>. She questioned the existence of Covid-19 and refused to be vaccinated. She also presided over a toxic atmosphere at her company</p> <p>Phelan, who interviewed Griggs and is among the talking heads in the documentary, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/11/the-second-coming-of-guru-jagat\">wrote in Vanity Fair magazine in 2021</a>: \u201cJagat could be abusive, irrational, and was prone to lying; she spent money like water and often came up short when it was time to pay her employees \u2013 many of whom, despite being full-time staffers with \u2018director\u2019 in their titles, made far below minimum wage and were asked to file as independent contractors, depriving them of benefits like health care.</p> <p>\u201cIn a company-wide group chat, Jagat wrote, \u2018Fuck you all\u2019 for not drafting a promotional email as she\u2019d wished and threatened another group: \u2018I will ring [<em>sic</em>] your figurative necks if not every photo youve ever taken up until now isnt in the dropbox.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Pappas says: \u201cShe was taking advantage of people\u2019s various vulnerabilities. She was, as a spiritual teacher, learning a lot of sensitive information about these people but then when they misstepped, when they did wrong in her eyes, she would use that against them in front of others in public.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of behaviour if she was in squarely one box, as a spiritual teacher or as a boss or as a colleague, perhaps would have been a little bit more understandable or you could make sense of it, but where it became so complicated was that she was filling all of these roles simultaneously for these people.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to resist parallels with Holmes, the young entrepreneur whose startup company promised to revolutionise blood testing, only to be eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/15/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-ramesh-balwani-criminal-charges\">indicted</a> and jailed on charges involving defrauding investors and deceiving patients and doctors.</p> <p>Pappas comments: \u201cYou can draw a clear line in comparison to their ambition. You can draw a pretty clear comparison to both their rapid ascent and to everybody\u2019s gleefulness to cheer them on while they were on that rise. At the same time as and when they made mistakes and they showed their human flaws, perhaps an outsized reaction to those.</p> <p>\u201cNot to dismiss or excuse any of their behaviour, but one of the things that felt important to us was to make it clear that, when looking at Guru Jagat and Yogi Bhajan, we\u2019re talking about two very different people and two very different extents of harm. Guru Jagat\u2019s wrongdoings pale in comparison to those of Yogi Bhajan and his abuses, and in some ways \u2013 and perhaps the Elizabeth Holmes comparison \u2013 comes with a bit of the female double standard that we see for women who rise to power in this way.\u201d</p> <p>Griggs\u2019s business and personal health both went into decline.<em> </em>Pappas says: \u201cThe walls are caving in on her with comments that she\u2019s made publicly. As this self-proclaimed feminist, she winds up defending a man who has been accused and now been proven to have sexually assaulted and abused many women of various ages.

      "bodyText": "\u201cReality is a trance. Your reality is a trance of your own making. Or someone else\u2019s making who doesn\u2019t have your greatest good in mind.\u201d The words are spoken by a woman wearing a white turban and dark jacket over a flowing white robe, sitting next to a glass of water perched on a metal table. So begins Breath of Fire, a documentary about Katie Griggs, aka Guru Jagat. The film tells how Griggs went from YouTube astrologer to yoga master, spiritual guru and wellness girlboss with followers including celebrities such as Russell Brand, Kate Hudson and Alicia Keys. She had a business school, podcast, festival and two clothing lines and was chief executive of seven international companies. But as journalist Hayley Phelan puts it in Breath of Fire, \u201cI never understood why there weren\u2019t more questions about a white woman in a turban.\u201d Griggs was also a would-be cult leader who bullied staff, practised cultural appropriation and embraced conspiracy theories such as QAnon before her unexpected death at the age of 41. She has been called \u201cthe Elizabeth Holmes of yoga\u201d. The four-part docuseries, which began last week on HBO, is a smartly edited collage of 35mm films, VHS footage from the 1980s and videos mined from TikTok and Instagram. This is combined with new interviews with those who fell under Griggs\u2019s spell as they sought community, rituals and spiritual fulfillment outside established religion. This aspect struck a chord with the film\u2019s directors, Hayley Pappas and Smiley Stevens, themselves millennials with an interest in spirituality. Pappas, 34, says via Zoom from Los Angeles: \u201cSo much of it spoke to a shared sentiment that we could feel and our peers could feel. This sense of seeking and looking for spirituality in less conventional places, particularly as these traditional religious institutions have lost their influence with our peers.\u201d Griggs was born on a Colorado farm in the summer of 1979. She was raised by a single mother, a dance movement therapist who exposed Griggs to different forms of spirituality, from tarot cards to Tibetan prayer flags.

The circumstances have not been made public but what we know beyond doubt is this: the 24\u2011year\u2011old security guard fell from the uppermost concourse at Lusail Stadium three days previously, about two hours after the World Cup quarter-final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/netherlands-argentina-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report\">between Argentina and the Netherlands</a> had finished.</p> <p>On went the show. Hours after Kibue died Argentina were back at Lusail to face Croatia, thousands of supporters unwittingly walking close to the spot where Kibue landed. Five days after that, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 treated the same venue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/world-cup-final-argentina-france-match-report\">the greatest final</a>. Few of those basking in the post-match fireworks or goggling at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/22/fifa-investigating-how-chef-salt-bae-got-on-to-world-cup-final-pitch\">Salt Bae\u2019s effrontery</a> would have brought Kibue to mind.</p> <p>Kibue\u2019s sister said he had been working long hours, a fact later corroborated to the Guardian by colleagues. His funeral, back home in Kenya, took place on New Year\u2019s Eve; it was streamed online and has been watched more than 3,500 times. The faces of relatives and friends paying their final respects to his body convey the sheer agony of their loss; a short eulogy later encapsulated the richness this young man had imparted on his loved ones and the community around him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/22/world-cup-fifa-saudi-arabia-human-rights\">Fifa accused again over human rights risks in Saudi Arabia\u2019s World Cup bid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We may never know exactly how many migrant workers died on stadium and infrastructure projects that served Qatar 2022. This newspaper\u2019s own figures show that at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022\">6,751 people from a handful of Asian&nbsp;countries</a> died in the country between 2010 and 2020. Statistics from African embassies, such as Kenya\u2019s, have been harder to acquire. It is the grimmest&nbsp;of numbers games that thousands of people simply could not win.</p> <p>Here is another number: 21,000. It is the total of Nepali, Bangladeshi and Indian workers reported to have died in Saudi Arabia since its Vision 2030 plan was launched in April 2016. That was just one revelation from an ITV documentary, undertaken amid extreme risk, screened on Sunday night. Kingdom Uncovered: Inside Saudi Arabia<em> </em>showed snapshots of a world those reimagining the vast desert state would rather you did not see; images Fifa might prefer you believe are merely a trick of the light. Six and a half weeks before the Saudis\u2019 2034 World Cup bid goes through on the nod, we really are back here.</p> <p>It is easy to scoff at some of the stadium designs revealed in the Saudis\u2019 official bid submission three months ago. They\u2019re not seriously going to build a three\u2011sided venue at the top of a cliff, opening up to reveal a mind-boggling panorama of the country\u2019s most dramatic mountain range? Surely nobody could follow through on an arena 350 metres above the ground in a city called Neom, 110 miles long and 200 metres wide, that has not been built yet?</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has already made a mockery of anyone doubting whether, when something needs doing, it will be made to happen at all costs. Take the example of Neom, on which the ITV programme dwells at particular and appropriate length. It detailed how much of the land earmarked for the project was inhabited by the Huwaitat tribe, many of whom were subjected to forced evictions and brutality in order that the land be cleared for construction.

      "bodyText": "On 13 December, two years will have passed since John Njau Kibue died. The circumstances have not been made public but what we know beyond doubt is this: the 24\u2011year\u2011old security guard fell from the uppermost concourse at Lusail Stadium three days previously, about two hours after the World Cup quarter-final between Argentina and the Netherlands had finished. On went the show. Hours after Kibue died Argentina were back at Lusail to face Croatia, thousands of supporters unwittingly walking close to the spot where Kibue landed. Five days after that, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 treated the same venue to the greatest final. Few of those basking in the post-match fireworks or goggling at Salt Bae\u2019s effrontery would have brought Kibue to mind. Kibue\u2019s sister said he had been working long hours, a fact later corroborated to the Guardian by colleagues. His funeral, back home in Kenya, took place on New Year\u2019s Eve; it was streamed online and has been watched more than 3,500 times. The faces of relatives and friends paying their final respects to his body convey the sheer agony of their loss; a short eulogy later encapsulated the richness this young man had imparted on his loved ones and the community around him. We may never know exactly how many migrant workers died on stadium and infrastructure projects that served Qatar 2022. This newspaper\u2019s own figures show that at least 6,751 people from a handful of Asian countries died in the country between 2010 and 2020. Statistics from African embassies, such as Kenya\u2019s, have been harder to acquire. It is the grimmest of numbers games that thousands of people simply could not win. Here is another number: 21,000. It is the total of Nepali, Bangladeshi and Indian workers reported to have died in Saudi Arabia since its Vision 2030 plan was launched in April 2016. That was just one revelation from an ITV documentary, undertaken amid extreme risk, screened on Sunday night. Kingdom Uncovered: Inside Saudi Arabia showed snapshots of a world those reimagining the vast desert state would rather you did not see; images Fifa might prefer you believe are merely a trick of the light. Six and a half weeks before the Saudis\u2019 2034 World Cup bid goes through on the nod, we really are back here. It is easy to scoff at some of the stadium designs revealed in the Saudis\u2019 official bid submission three months ago. They\u2019re not seriously going to build a three\u2011sided venue at the top of a cliff, opening up to reveal a mind-boggling panorama of the country\u2019s most dramatic mountain range? Surely nobody could follow through on an arena 350 metres above the ground in a city called Neom, 110 miles long and 200 metres wide, that has not been built yet? Saudi Arabia has already made a mockery of anyone doubting whether, when something needs doing, it will be made to happen at all costs. Take the example of Neom, on which the ITV programme dwells at particular and appropriate length. It detailed how much of the land earmarked for the project was inhabited by the Huwaitat tribe, many of whom were subjected to forced evictions and brutality in order that the land be cleared for construction. The earth on which the Saudi government\u2019s flagship scheme is being built was scorched without compromise. The documentary paints a bleak enough picture but anyone minded to discover exactly what happened here would be advised to read a report, The Dark Side of Neom, by the local human rights organisation ALQST, which details the human cost of staging World Cup fixtures in mid-air. Or maybe only some of it. Because we are taken to modern-day Neom, where railway tunnels are being bored and an interminable trench cleaves. The project is already running behind schedule, with timescales stretching and suggestions that elements of the project are being scaled back. So how might this megacity be ready to host an elite football tournament in time?

      "body": "<h2>Wan-Bissaka torments United replacement</h2> <p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka looked as if he had a point to prove against Manchester United. The right-back has had an intriguing role for West Ham this season. Julen Lopetegui has spotted hidden creative tendencies in the defender and given him freedom to attack. Wan-Bissaka has inverted and he was irrepressible against United. Noussair Mazraoui, his replacement at United, could not contain the former Crystal Palace player. Wan-Bissaka kept running clear and delivering crosses, and he should have had an assist when his ball reached Emerson Palmieri, who scuffed wide. If there is a concern, though, it is that Wan-Bissaka\u2019s positioning does make West Ham open. Alejandro Garnacho had a lot of space and did not make enough of it. United were ridiculously frustrating in front of goal. A better team would have punished West Ham during the first half. They got the win, though, and at the end Wan-Bissaka was making a vital lunging tackle to deny Garnacho. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/west-ham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham 2-1 Manchester United</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Iwobi finding new peak</h2> <p>Alex Iwobi played for six different managers in four years at Everton including caretakers \u2013 Marco Silva, Duncan Ferguson (twice), Carlo Ancelotti, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Frank Lampard and Sean Dyche \u2013 so perhaps it is no surprise it took him time to reach a level that satisfied the Goodison Park crowd. But his name never reverberated around the old stadium like it did on Saturday when Fulham supporters serenaded the midfielder not only for a fine goal \u2013 one that should have been the platform for a comfortable victory over a poor opponent \u2013 but for a mature and influential display. The 28-year-old is enjoying a fine season and Silva, Iwobi\u2019s one manager during his time at Craven Cottage, believes there is more to come. \u201cWhat Alex has done this season has been so good, he is improving game-by-game and he is more decisive for us,\u201d said the Fulham manager. \u201cLast season was probably the best from him at this level and I think he\u2019s going to be even better this season. He is taking much more responsibility and pushing the team forward.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/everton-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">Everton 1-1 Fulham</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Van Dijk turns table on set-piece coach</h2> <p>Nicolas Jover is Arsenal\u2019s now world-famous set-piece coach. Once at Brentford, a finishing school for corner and free-kick gurus, and then at Manchester City, Jover was the genius behind 26 Premier League set-piece goals last season, a record 16 from corners. A problem with being a set-piece specialist is being only as good as the last set piece. As Virgil van Dijk stooped to score Liverpool\u2019s first goal, Jover\u2019s name was mud, only to be revived by Mikel Merino scoring Arsenal\u2019s second from Declan Rice\u2019s free-kick. Premier League technical areas are lately full of such operatives, Aston Villa\u2019s Austin MacPhee\u2019s Doobie-Brothers-stylings are part of the furniture, as is Carlos Vicens by Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. It can be a cut-throat, results business; Wolves sacked Jack Wilson from the role earlier this month. And then there\u2019s the problem that football isn\u2019t just set pieces. Against Liverpool, Arsenal won only one attacking corner. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal 2-2 Liverpool</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Howe needs upturn in results</h2> <p>Newcastle show little sign of rising above mid-table irrelevance, which was certainly not the plan when Saudi Arabia\u2019s public investment fund took over three years ago. Eddie Howe professed himself happy with most of their performance at Chelsea, where better decision-making from Alexander Isak might have brought a draw, and took it as a sign of movement in the right direction. But the Magpies look blunt and they will certainly cross their fingers that Anthony Gordon\u2019s groin injury, which ruled him out on Sunday, is of no longer-term consequence. While a Carabao Cup rematch with Enzo Maresca\u2019s side on Wednesday, this time at home, offers scope for a confidence boost the Premier League tests keep on coming. On Saturday they host Arsenal and the victories need to start coming again soon. \u201cA couple of wins changes the picture very quickly,\u201d Howe said. \u201cAs long as the players are giving everything and are committed I will take the results.\u201d Others with an interest in their fortunes might want something more to show for that attitude. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/chelsea-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea 2-1 Newcastle</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Nuno not getting carried away</h2> <p>Nottingham Forest looked like scoring with every attack at rivals Leicester on Friday but their defensive structure has been imperative to their success so far this season. Only Liverpool have conceded fewer goals than Forest, for whom Chris Wood has scored seven of their 11 league goals. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo has turned Forest into formidable opponents and, aside from a trip to Arsenal, their November looks like an opportunity to build on their brilliant start, with home matches against West Ham, Newcastle and Ipswich. Nuno has told Forest supporters to enjoy this moment but the Portuguese is the last person who will get carried away. Asked about riding high in the table, Nuno was quick to extinguish the question. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is important is [training on] Monday. We are going to prepare for West Ham. We have to correct details \u2013 you can see the [Leicester] goal, we have to try to improve.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/25/leicester-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester 1-3 Nottingham Forest</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Tottenham\u2019s midfield weaknesses on display</h2> <p>Playing both Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison in a three-man midfield should be exciting. It\u2019s a risky approach but it means there are two fine creative presences there alongside Yves Bissouma. Yet the evidence of Tottenham\u2019s victory over West Ham last week was that Spurs look better-balanced with only one of them, and Pape Sarr alongside Bissouma at the base of midfield. Against West Ham, the issue was that Spurs were open on the counter; against Crystal Palace the problem was more they seemed to lack the physical presence to relieve the pressure. Perhaps, as Ange Postecoglou intimated, the issue was psychological as much as anything else, but Kulusevski seemed unusually rattled while Maddison couldn\u2019t impose himself. Not that things improved much after the hour when both were withdrawn and Sarr came on, but by then, perhaps, the damage was done. Not for the first time, Spurs looked a team who could be got at. <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/crystal-palace-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Crystal Palace 1-0 Tottenham</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Harsh lesson for Wieffer</h2> <p>\u201cHe will be disappointed and he should be,\u201d said Fabian H\u00fcrzeler of Mats Wieffer, the late Brighton substitute whose lack of composure supplied Wolves\u2019 late, counterattacking equaliser. As a Feyenoord player, Wieffer\u2019s team averaged 2.52 points, a joint-record for the Eredivisie, but here was the ruthlessness of the Premier League. In those closing moments, and despite Evan Ferguson\u2019s well-taken goal, Brighton had shown off their inexperience. Their manager must shoulder some of the blame, though perhaps Wolves\u2019 surge to salvation might have been averted had more battle-hardened players such as Danny Welbeck, who tired after his goal, or Lewis Dunk, denied his 250th appearance by a warm-up injury, or James Milner, missing since August, been on the field. Still, credit Wolves for a comeback few saw coming. They\u2019re not done yet. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be fine this season and that only reaffirms my thoughts,\u201d said Gary O\u2019Neil, despite his team\u2019s total of two points. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/brighton-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">Brighton 2-2 Wolves</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Do Villa really suffer European hangovers?</h2> <p>Despite conceding a last-gasp equaliser against Bournemouth on Saturday, the data suggests Aston Villa are not actually tending to suffer a drop-off in performance after Champions League matches. Unai Emery\u2019s team have won all three matches on their return to Europe\u2019s elite competition to top the table. But the thinking, after a poor first half in the 3-1 win over Wolves and a goalless draw with Manchester United before Saturday\u2019s disappointment against Bournemouth, that the emotion of the Champions League is costing them is countered by the data. According to SofaScore\u2019s stats for possession, expected goals and big chances created, Villa are actually performing less convincingly in the matches before their Champions League games than the ones after. . <strong>Peter Lansley</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/aston-villa-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Aston Villa 1-1 Bournemouth</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Lewis-Potter impresses in thriller</h2> <p>After 43 minutes of what Thomas Frank described as some of Brentford\u2019s worst football during his time in charge, the ball arrived at Keane Lewis-Potter\u2019s feet on the left wing against Ipswich. Injuries meant the start of Lewis-Potter\u2019s Brentford career did not quite go to plan after his then club-record move from Hull in the summer of 2022, which came with hefty expectations. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect everyone to be Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior or [Kylian] Mbapp\u00e9,\u201d empathised Frank. But Saturday provided full proof of his abilities. With his side two goals down, Lewis-Potter cut inside with a deft first touch, before jinking his way through two players to release Vitaly Janelt for Yoane Wissa\u2019s opener. \u201cIt was one action that sparks everything,\u201d said Frank of Lewis-Potter\u2019s move. \u201cBoom, 2-1 and suddenly a little belief.\u201d In a bonkers match that repeatedly swung both ways, Lewis-Potter regularly caught the eye, always driving forward and drawing both the yellow cards that prematurely ended Harry Clarke\u2019s full Premier League debut. \u201cProbably his best game,\u201d said Frank. \u201cI\u2019m very, very pleased with his performance.\u201d <strong>Ben Bloom</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/brentford-ipswich-premier-league-match-report\">Brentford 4-3 Ipswich</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Injuries mount for City</h2> <p>Injuries are a concern as Manchester City take to the road for four matches at Tottenham (EFL Cup), Bournemouth (Premier League), Sporting (Champions League) and Brighton (PL). Pep Guardiola named only five outfield replacements against Southampton as he did, too, for Wednesday\u2019s victory over Sparta Prague due to the unavailability of Jack Grealish, Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri, Oscar Bobb, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku and Kyle Walker. The manager said: \u201cWe talked about that, we have to take care of ourselves. Good sleep, drinks, good food, sleep a lot, training and recovery. I would love to have everyone \u2013 it\u2019s not the position. OK. We have to do what we have to do.\u201d He may rest players. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to think against Spurs about some players from the academy. If players are fine they are going to play against Spurs but if they have doubts I\u2019m not going to take a risk \u2013 that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Guardiola said. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p>

      "bodyText": "Wan-Bissaka torments United replacement Aaron Wan-Bissaka looked as if he had a point to prove against Manchester United. The right-back has had an intriguing role for West Ham this season. Julen Lopetegui has spotted hidden creative tendencies in the defender and given him freedom to attack. Wan-Bissaka has inverted and he was irrepressible against United. Noussair Mazraoui, his replacement at United, could not contain the former Crystal Palace player. Wan-Bissaka kept running clear and delivering crosses, and he should have had an assist when his ball reached Emerson Palmieri, who scuffed wide. If there is a concern, though, it is that Wan-Bissaka\u2019s positioning does make West Ham open. Alejandro Garnacho had a lot of space and did not make enough of it. United were ridiculously frustrating in front of goal. A better team would have punished West Ham during the first half. They got the win, though, and at the end Wan-Bissaka was making a vital lunging tackle to deny Garnacho. Jacob Steinberg Match report: West Ham 2-1 Manchester United Iwobi finding new peak Alex Iwobi played for six different managers in four years at Everton including caretakers \u2013 Marco Silva, Duncan Ferguson (twice), Carlo Ancelotti, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Frank Lampard and Sean Dyche \u2013 so perhaps it is no surprise it took him time to reach a level that satisfied the Goodison Park crowd. But his name never reverberated around the old stadium like it did on Saturday when Fulham supporters serenaded the midfielder not only for a fine goal \u2013 one that should have been the platform for a comfortable victory over a poor opponent \u2013 but for a mature and influential display. The 28-year-old is enjoying a fine season and Silva, Iwobi\u2019s one manager during his time at Craven Cottage, believes there is more to come. \u201cWhat Alex has done this season has been so good, he is improving game-by-game and he is more decisive for us,\u201d said the Fulham manager. \u201cLast season was probably the best from him at this level and I think he\u2019s going to be even better this season. He is taking much more responsibility and pushing the team forward.\u201d Andy Hunter Match report: Everton 1-1 Fulham Van Dijk turns table on set-piece coach Nicolas Jover is Arsenal\u2019s now world-famous set-piece coach. Once at Brentford, a finishing school for corner and free-kick gurus, and then at Manchester City, Jover was the genius behind 26 Premier League set-piece goals last season, a record 16 from corners. A problem with being a set-piece specialist is being only as good as the last set piece. As Virgil van Dijk stooped to score Liverpool\u2019s first goal, Jover\u2019s name was mud, only to be revived by Mikel Merino scoring Arsenal\u2019s second from Declan Rice\u2019s free-kick. Premier League technical areas are lately full of such operatives, Aston Villa\u2019s Austin MacPhee\u2019s Doobie-Brothers-stylings are part of the furniture, as is Carlos Vicens by Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. It can be a cut-throat, results business; Wolves sacked Jack Wilson from the role earlier this month. And then there\u2019s the problem that football isn\u2019t just set pieces. Against Liverpool, Arsenal won only one attacking corner. John Brewin Match report: Arsenal 2-2 Liverpool Howe needs upturn in results Newcastle show little sign of rising above mid-table irrelevance, which was certainly not the plan when Saudi Arabia\u2019s public investment fund took over three years ago. Eddie Howe professed himself happy with most of their performance at Chelsea, where better decision-making from Alexander Isak might have brought a draw, and took it as a sign of movement in the right direction. But the Magpies look blunt and they will certainly cross their fingers that Anthony Gordon\u2019s groin injury, which ruled him out on Sunday, is of no longer-term consequence. While a Carabao Cup rematch with Enzo Maresca\u2019s side on Wednesday, this time at home, offers scope for a confidence boost the Premier League tests keep on coming. On Saturday they host Arsenal and the victories need to start coming again soon. \u201cA couple of wins changes the picture very quickly,\u201d Howe said. \u201cAs long as the players are giving everything and are committed I will take the results.\u201d Others with an interest in their fortunes might want something more to show for that attitude. Nick Ames Match report: Chelsea 2-1 Newcastle Nuno not getting carried away Nottingham Forest looked like scoring with every attack at rivals Leicester on Friday but their defensive structure has been imperative to their success so far this season. Only Liverpool have conceded fewer goals than Forest, for whom Chris Wood has scored seven of their 11 league goals. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo has turned Forest into formidable opponents and, aside from a trip to Arsenal, their November looks like an opportunity to build on their brilliant start, with home matches against West Ham, Newcastle and Ipswich. Nuno has told Forest supporters to enjoy this moment but the Portuguese is the last person who will get carried away. Asked about riding high in the table, Nuno was quick to extinguish the question. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is important is [training on] Monday. We are going to prepare for West Ham. We have to correct details \u2013 you can see the [Leicester] goal, we have to try to improve.\u201d Ben Fisher Match report: Leicester 1-3 Nottingham Forest Tottenham\u2019s midfield weaknesses on display Playing both Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison in a three-man midfield should be exciting. It\u2019s a risky approach but it means there are two fine creative presences there alongside Yves Bissouma. Yet the evidence of Tottenham\u2019s victory over West Ham last week was that Spurs look better-balanced with only one of them, and Pape Sarr alongside Bissouma at the base of midfield. Against West Ham, the issue was that Spurs were open on the counter; against Crystal Palace the problem was more they seemed to lack the physical presence to relieve the pressure. Perhaps, as Ange Postecoglou intimated, the issue was psychological as much as anything else, but Kulusevski seemed unusually rattled while Maddison couldn\u2019t impose himself. Not that things improved much after the hour when both were withdrawn and Sarr came on, but by then, perhaps, the damage was done. Not for the first time, Spurs looked a team who could be got at. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Crystal Palace 1-0 Tottenham Harsh lesson for Wieffer \u201cHe will be disappointed and he should be,\u201d said Fabian H\u00fcrzeler of Mats Wieffer, the late Brighton substitute whose lack of composure supplied Wolves\u2019 late, counterattacking equaliser. As a Feyenoord player, Wieffer\u2019s team averaged 2.52 points, a joint-record for the Eredivisie, but here was the ruthlessness of the Premier League. In those closing moments, and despite Evan Ferguson\u2019s well-taken goal, Brighton had shown off their inexperience. Their manager must shoulder some of the blame, though perhaps Wolves\u2019 surge to salvation might have been averted had more battle-hardened players such as Danny Welbeck, who tired after his goal, or Lewis Dunk, denied his 250th appearance by a warm-up injury, or James Milner, missing since August, been on the field. Still, credit Wolves for a comeback few saw coming. They\u2019re not done yet. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be fine this season and that only reaffirms my thoughts,\u201d said Gary O\u2019Neil, despite his team\u2019s total of two points. John Brewin Match report: Brighton 2-2 Wolves Do Villa really suffer European hangovers? Despite conceding a last-gasp equaliser against Bournemouth on Saturday, the data suggests Aston Villa are not actually tending to suffer a drop-off in performance after Champions League matches. Unai Emery\u2019s team have won all three matches on their return to Europe\u2019s elite competition to top the table. But the thinking, after a poor first half in the 3-1 win over Wolves and a goalless draw with Manchester United before Saturday\u2019s disappointment against Bournemouth, that the emotion of the Champions League is costing them is countered by the data. According to SofaScore\u2019s stats for possession, expected goals and big chances created, Villa are actually performing less convincingly in the matches before their Champions League games than the ones after. . Peter Lansley Match report: Aston Villa 1-1 Bournemouth Lewis-Potter impresses in thriller After 43 minutes of what Thomas Frank described as some of Brentford\u2019s worst football during his time in charge, the ball arrived at Keane Lewis-Potter\u2019s feet on the left wing against Ipswich. Injuries meant the start of Lewis-Potter\u2019s Brentford career did not quite go to plan after his then club-record move from Hull in the summer of 2022, which came with hefty expectations. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect everyone to be Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior or [Kylian] Mbapp\u00e9,\u201d empathised Frank. But Saturday provided full proof of his abilities. With his side two goals down, Lewis-Potter cut inside with a deft first touch, before jinking his way through two players to release Vitaly Janelt for Yoane Wissa\u2019s opener. \u201cIt was one action that sparks everything,\u201d said Frank of Lewis-Potter\u2019s move. \u201cBoom, 2-1 and suddenly a little belief.\u201d In a bonkers match that repeatedly swung both ways, Lewis-Potter regularly caught the eye, always driving forward and drawing both the yellow cards that prematurely ended Harry Clarke\u2019s full Premier League debut. \u201cProbably his best game,\u201d said Frank. \u201cI\u2019m very, very pleased with his performance.\u201d Ben Bloom Match report: Brentford 4-3 Ipswich Injuries mount for City Injuries are a concern as Manchester City take to the road for four matches at Tottenham (EFL Cup), Bournemouth (Premier League), Sporting (Champions League) and Brighton (PL). Pep Guardiola named only five outfield replacements against Southampton as he did, too, for Wednesday\u2019s victory over Sparta Prague due to the unavailability of Jack Grealish, Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri, Oscar Bobb, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku and Kyle Walker. The manager said: \u201cWe talked about that, we have to take care of ourselves. Good sleep, drinks, good food, sleep a lot, training and recovery. I would love to have everyone \u2013 it\u2019s not the position. OK. We have to do what we have to do.\u201d He may rest players. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to think against Spurs about some players from the academy. If players are fine they are going to play against Spurs but if they have doubts I\u2019m not going to take a risk \u2013 that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Guardiola said.

This was in part due to the invention of the printing press.</p> <p>One of the first \u2013 and deadliest \u2013 publications to fuel this fervour was the Malleus Maleficarum (\u201cThe Hammer of Witches\u201d). This comprehensive witchcraft manual, first published in 1486, was written by German monk Heinrich Kramer. It gathered many of these inflamed stories, claiming witches were involved in cannibalism, had sex with the devil and could cause impotence in men. Kramer said midwives offered babies to the devil. \u201cNo one does more harm to the Catholic faith,\u201d he stated.</p>    <p>The Malleus was one of the main reasons that witchcraft stopped being seen as something harmless. It pushed the belief that it was solely women who practised witchcraft, a point of view even expressed its title, which chose the term \u201cmalefic<em>a</em>rum\u201d, as opposed to the original Latin masculine term, \u201cmalefic<em>o</em>rum\u201d. At the dawn of the 1500s, when witchcraft was becoming the stuff of literary discussions, artists working in print \u2013 especially in southern Germany \u2013 took note, visualising and shaping this new character. Albrecht D\u00fcrer (godson of Kramer\u2019s publisher), drawing from classical sources, pictured the witch in two ways: young and seductive, alluring others to her coven; and haggard and old, riding backwards on a goat (a symbol of the devil).</p> <p>D\u00fcrer even wrote his signature backwards on The Witch, a work from 1500, to emphasise the \u201cdisorder\u201d of an \u201cordered\u201d patriarchal culture. His student, Hans Baldung, established similar codes. He depicted witches mostly as sexualised women conspiring in groups, and his works were copied and distributed to the masses, to the Italian states and beyond.

About half are thought to have been killed. Although it was believed that witches could be people of different genders and ages, including children, most of those killed (as well as stigmatised and demonised) were women.</p> <p>So if you\u2019re thinking of dressing up as an evil old green-skinned witch for Halloween, could I offer an alternative? Why not go back to those ancient times, celebrate the woman who was powerful: knowledgable about herbs, able to heal, take part in rituals and perform what seemed like magic.</p> <p>One artist who relished such characters was Remedios Varo, the Spanish-born painter who spent from 1941 until her death mostly living in Mexico City \u201csurrounded by cats, stones, crystals and talismans\u201d. Varo \u2013 with her best friend, the \u00e9migr\u00e9 surrealist Leonora Carrington \u2013 studied and practised ancient forms of witchcraft. Determined to \u201ctake back the mysteries which were ours and which were violated\u201d, as Carrington once said, both painters delighted in creating cosmic images of formidable women shapeshifting through wonderfully imaginative worlds.</p> <p>In Varo\u2019s Creation of the Birds, from 1957, an androgynous owl-like figure shows off her ambidextrous skills, painting with one hand a bird fluttering into life before her, while in the other holding aloft a prism that refracts light from a distant star. Then there\u2019s her Witch Going to the Sabbath, showing a hybridised figure (perhaps based on herself) wrapped from head to toe in red hair, holding a bird-like creature in her left hand, and a prism leaking light in her right.</p> <p>Varo\u2019s images feel worlds away from the witch works that helped to demonise women. They celebrate an ancient wisdom, honouring their female subjects rather than exploiting them. Varo\u2019s witches are beautiful, emanating strength, knowledge and power.</p>",

Varo \u2013 with her best friend, the \u00e9migr\u00e9 surrealist Leonora Carrington \u2013 studied and practised ancient forms of witchcraft. Determined to \u201ctake back the mysteries which were ours and which were violated\u201d, as Carrington once said, both painters delighted in creating cosmic images of formidable women shapeshifting through wonderfully imaginative worlds. In Varo\u2019s Creation of the Birds, from 1957, an androgynous owl-like figure shows off her ambidextrous skills, painting with one hand a bird fluttering into life before her, while in the other holding aloft a prism that refracts light from a distant star. Then there\u2019s her Witch Going to the Sabbath, showing a hybridised figure (perhaps based on herself) wrapped from head to toe in red hair, holding a bird-like creature in her left hand, and a prism leaking light in her right. Varo\u2019s images feel worlds away from the witch works that helped to demonise women. They celebrate an ancient wisdom, honouring their female subjects rather than exploiting them. Varo\u2019s witches are beautiful, emanating strength, knowledge and power.",

      "body": "<p>Four years of economic turmoil. High inflation, then high interest rates, then an (albeit mild) recession. A pre-election budget with some distinctly dodgy looking tax cuts. All leaving an election-winning, but nevertheless very unpopular, government with a big fiscal hole to fill. What does the chancellor do? Put up taxes, of course.</p> <p>And indeed that is precisely what Norman Lamont did in March 1993. By a lot \u2013 by most measures, it was the <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/articles/taxes-and-elections-are-they-any-chance-related\">largest tax-raising budget</a> in at least the previous half century. It was followed by a decade and a half of macroeconomic stability and mostly steady growth, averaging almost 3% per year, a level recent chancellors could only dream of.</p> <p>The context today is entirely different, but it illustrates both the scale of Rachel Reeves\u2019s task and the fact that taking tough decisions can pay off. Lamont\u2019s task was not just to fix the public finances, but to restore economic credibility after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/13/black-wednesday-brexit-sterling-crisis\">fiasco of the UK\u2019s exit</a> from the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday.</p> <p>Reeves\u2019s challenge is similarly both economic and political. We risk a cycle where low growth leads to less money for public services and higher taxes. That in turn leads to distrust in politicians and the democratic process itself, manifesting itself in general apathy, political fragmentation and, worse still, the growth of far-right ideologies that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/09/how-did-robert-jenrick-go-from-centrist-tory-to-anti-immigration-hardliner\">blame immigration</a> for all of these problems, despite all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/sep/02/the-big-idea-why-were-getting-the-immigration-debate-all-wrong\">evidence to the contrary</a>.</p> <p>If the response from mainstream politicians is short-termism \u2013 for example, unrealistic promises not to put up taxes or to slash immigration, while ignoring fundamental long-term challenges such as the steady degradation of the public realm, ranging from roads to hospitals, the crisis in social care, lack of special needs provision in schools and the funding problems in higher education \u2013 then the downward spiral will continue.</p> <p>So how to break out of the doom loop? Reeves needs to address the short and the long term \u2013 to make a visible difference to people\u2019s lives now, at the same time as putting in place longer-term policies that will generate growth.</p> <p>What would that look like in practice? Here are a few tests by which to measure the budget.</p> <p>First, taxes. We already know that they\u2019re going to go up, and by quite a lot. And we already know that while the letter of Labour\u2019s promise not to put up the main rates of VAT, income tax, national insurance and corporation tax may be honoured, the spirit will be pushed to \u2013 and perhaps beyond \u2013 the limits of plausibility. Moreover, there will be lots of tweaks to other taxes designed to raise revenue.</p> <p>In the circumstances, and given how Labour has boxed itself in, this is perhaps the best that can be hoped for in the short term. However, further complicating an already byzantine system will reduce growth. Reeves should at the very least commit to radical simplification of a whole host of badly designed taxes, from the <a href=\"https://taxpolicy.org.uk/2023/01/30/vat_brake2/\">VAT threshold</a> to council tax and stamp duty to the bizarre structure of the income tax system that leads to <a href=\"https://taxpolicy.org.uk/2023/09/24/70percent/\">marginal rates</a> of 70% or more. A simpler, fairer system will make raising more money less economically damaging and more politically palatable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/opinion_tax-and-ni_chart/giv-4559QRQ879ZnY0YF/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing marginal tax rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/opinion_tax-and-ni_chart/giv-4559QRQ879ZnY0YF/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Second, the fiscal rules. Again, we already know that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/29/rachel-reeves-political-manoeuvre-fisical-hole-austerity\">discredited debt rule</a> will go, and that should be welcomed wholeheartedly. But simply substituting the current rule with another one written behind the closed doors of the Treasury \u2013 as has happened numerous times in the past decade \u2013 may get the chancellor through this budget, but could well come back to haunt her later in the parliament. It may be less comfortable for the Treasury, but long-term credibility would be much better served by a proper <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/economists-have-urged-rachel-reeves-to-loosen-the-purse-strings-heres-why-its-not-that-easy-239352\">independent process</a> with a role for parliament and external experts.</p> <p>Third, investment, not just in infrastructure \u2013 essential though that is \u2013 but in people, especially children. We know now that <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/publications/short-and-medium-term-impacts-sure-start-educational-outcomes\">Sure Start</a> didn\u2019t just help poor families when their kids were young, but improved GCSE results and reduced crime a decade later. More recently, we saw <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66fab285a31f45a9c765eeba/kickstart-scheme-quantitative-impact-assessment.pdf\">long-lasting benefits</a> from the Kickstart programme for young unemployed people. That doesn\u2019t mean we can budget on the basis that these or similar programmes \u201cpay for themselves\u201d: that\u2019s almost impossible to say in advance. But it does mean that we should be prioritising spending on programmes \u2013 for example, mental health support for children and young people \u2013 that we think will plausibly benefit individuals and society over the long term.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/george-osborne-two-child-benefit-cap-britain-poorest-children\">two-child benefit cap</a>, and the resulting hardship, remains a stain on our collective consciences. The forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/22/labour-sure-start-tax-tories-child-poverty\">child poverty strategy</a> offers an opportunity to begin the task of reversing some of this; Reeves will not pre-empt this, but she can use the budget to make clear that there will be real resources behind the strategy when it comes. Reducing child poverty is just as much an investment in our future as HS2.</p> <p>Fourth, improving public services. The NHS is understandably the public\u2019s top priority and it\u2019s therefore understandable that it will take the lion\u2019s share of the available funds. But simply trumpeting the amount of money spent on it will not convince the public, unless productivity recovers. It has suffered not just from underinvestment in buildings and equipment, but in management. It may not be popular to hire experts in workflow management or procurement rather than nurses or doctors, but if it enables the latter to be used properly that will improve both morale and productivity. The same applies to the courts and the criminal justice system. Simply claiming that \u201cefficiency savings\u201d will enable public services to do \u201cmore with less\u201d won\u2019t be enough. Setting a target for a sustained improvement in public sector productivity \u2013 and requiring departments to have credible strategies, backed by investment plans, for delivering those improvements \u2013 would be a start.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/opinion_nhs_productivity/giv-4559ktkn0F4Q0Jfl/\" data-alt=\"Graph showing NHS productivity over time\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/opinion_nhs_productivity/giv-4559ktkn0F4Q0Jfl/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Fifth, fairness. This isn\u2019t just about putting up taxes for the \u201crich\u201d. When it comes to income, we already have a strongly progressive tax system. But much less so on wealth, especially property. Council tax, never progressive, has morphed into something that in many parts of the country is not much better than the poll tax it replaced; while at the same time, George Osborne deliberately targeted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/26/the-guardian-view-on-local-councils-osborne-is-creating-a-northern-poorhouse\">cuts to local authority funding</a> on more deprived areas. Shifting that back in the other direction, while at the same time devolving much more control over tax and spending to mayors and local authorities, will take time, but can start now, and could help deliver meaningful improvements to people\u2019s lives immediately.</p> <p>Even delivering all this \u2013 and it would be a tall order \u2013 may not be enough. Lamont\u2019s budget may have been an economic success, but politically, not so much: he lost his job a few months later. Strong growth did not restore the Conservatives\u2019 reputation for economic competence, or save them at the 1997 election. Reeves is likely to have more time, and one budget, important as it is, will not make or break the government. But, after the vagueness of Labour\u2019s manifesto, there will never be a better opportunity to articulate not just a budget but an agenda for meaningful change.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London and a former senior civil servant<br></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Miscarriages, premature babies and harm to mothers caused by the climate crisis are a \u201cblind spot\u201d in action plans, according to a report aimed at the decision-makers who will attend the Cop29 summit in November. Potential collapse of the Amazon rainforest, vital Atlantic Ocean currents and essential infrastructure in cities are also among the dangers cited by an international group of 80 leading scientists from 45 countries. The report collects the latest insights from physical and social science to inform the negotiations at the UN climate summit in Azerbaijan. \u201cThe world faces planetary-scale challenges, from the rise of methane emissions to the vulnerability of critical infrastructure,\u201d said Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, a co-chair of Earth League, one of the groups behind the report. \u201cThe report shows that rising heat, ocean instability and a tipping of the Amazon rainforest could push parts of our planet beyond habitable limits. Yet it also provides clear pathways and solutions, demonstrating that with urgent, decisive action, we still can avoid unmanageable outcomes.\u201d The report follows an ultimatum from the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on the climate emergency: \u201cWe\u2019re playing with fire, but there can be no more playing for time. We\u2019re out of time.\u201d He said global heating was supercharging monster hurricanes, bringing biblical floods and turning forests into tinderboxes, and said governments had to rapidly wean the world off its fossil fuel addiction. Increasing climate extremes are causing more lost babies, premature births and cognitive damage to newborns, the report said. For example, a study in India found a doubled risk of miscarriage in pregnant women suffering heat stress, while another in California found a significant association between long-term heat exposure and stillbirth and premature birth. Flooding is responsible for more than 100,000 lost pregnancies a year in 33 countries in South and Central America, Asia, and Africa, according to another study, with the danger highest for women with lower income and education levels. Rising heat also increases the intimate partner violence suffered by women, a south Asian analysis found. However, only 27 out of 119 national climate plans submitted to the UN include action related to mothers and newborns, making this a major \u201cblind spot\u201d, the report said. \u201cGlobal temperature records continue to break, exacerbating threats to maternal health,\u201d said Prof Jemilah Mahmood at the Sunway Centre for Planetary Health in Malaysia. She said the breakdown of healthcare services, sanitation and food supplies during extreme weather compounded the problems for pregnant women. \u201cPreparedness for heat extremes, including early warning systems, must be a priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout action, the consequences could be catastrophic.\u201d The report cites recent analysis that found global heating would drive billions of people out of the \u201cclimate niche\u201d of habitable temperatures in which humanity has flourished for millennia. Fossil fuel emissions are still rising, heating the land and oceans to record highs in the last year, the report said. This heating appears to be making El Ni\u00f1o events more intense, it said, with the impacts potentially causing damage of $100tn by the end of the century. Recent research on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation has documented its slowdown and suggested the system of ocean currents could collapse much sooner than previously estimated. \u201cSuch an event would have truly catastrophic consequences for our societies,\u201d the report said.

      "body": "<p>Thirty-five years ago, I sat on the sofa in my living room watching a tape of The Rumble in the Jungle with Muhammad Ali beside me. I was researching the book that ultimately became Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times. Over the course of a year, Ali and I watched tapes of every one of his fights together.</p> <p>Time plays funny tricks. Ali v George Foreman seemed like long ago history on that afternoon in 1989. And now \u2026</p> <p>This Wednesday will mark the 50th anniversary of Ali-Foreman. There have been other sporting events that captured the imagination of the world. But no athletic contest in history inspired as much global joy as Muhammad\u2019s victory in Kinshasa, Zaire, during the pre-dawn hours of 30 October 1974. It was the classic tale of a handsome prince, unfairly stripped of his crown, who battles back against adversity to recapture what rightfully belongs to him. Let\u2019s put that night in perspective.</p> <p>Ali was a great fighter and possibly the most beautiful fighting machine ever. His victories over Sonny Liston were the stuff of legend. In the two years immediately after those triumphs, he dominated a pretty good crop of heavyweights, rarely losing a round.</p> <p>But Ali was more than a fighter. He was a beacon of hope for oppressed people all over the world. Every time he looked in the mirror and preened, \u201cI\u2019m so pretty,\u201d he was saying \u201cBlack is beautiful\u201d at a time when many people of color thought it was better to be white. When he refused induction into the United States Army during the height of the war in Vietnam, he stood up for the principle that, unless there\u2019s a very good reason for killing people, war is wrong.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to understand the shockwaves that Muhammad sent through society in the 1960s unless one lived through those years and experienced them one day at a time.</p> <p>\u201cTo say Ali is an original is to understate the truth,\u201d Dave Kindred later wrote. \u201cHe is a universe of one. He is the first, the last, and the only. What he did, he did. Only he could have done it.\u201d</p> <p>But as the 1960s progressed, forces beyond Ali\u2019s control weighed against him. He was indicted, tried, and convicted for refusing induction into the Army and faced five years imprisonment. He was stripped of his title and precluded from fighting for more than three years. Richard Nixon, who mocked everything that Ali stood for, ascended to the presidency. When, at last, Ali was allowed to return to the ring, his legs were no longer young. He lost to Joe Frazier and then to Ken Norton.</p> <p>Ali avenged his defeats to Frazier and Norton. But by then, a new king had been crowned. George Foreman\u2019s professional record stood at 40 wins with no losses and 37 knockouts. His eight most recent bouts had ended in the first or second round. His victims in those fights included Frazier and Norton. This was the mountain that Ali had to climb.</p> <p>\u201cMy opponents don\u2019t worry about losing,\u201d Foreman bragged. \u201cThey worry about getting hurt.\u201d That view was seconded by Dave Anderson of the New York Times who wrote, \u201cGeorge Foreman might be the heaviest puncher in the history of the heavyweight division. For a few rounds, Ali might be able to escape Foreman\u2019s sledgehammer strength, but not for 15 rounds. Sooner or later, the champion will land one of his sledgehammer punches and, for the first time in his career, Muhammad Ali will be counted out. That could happen in the first round.\u201d</p>    <p>The fight began in the early hours of the morning to accommodate closed-circuit audiences in the United States. Had Muhammad fought Foreman in Las Vegas or New York, the mystique of that night and the Ali legend would not have been the same. Foreman was a three-to-one betting favorite. Sixty thousand fans jammed Stade du 20 Mai.</p> <p>Heavy storm clouds had gathered overhead by the time the bell for round one rang. But the night was touched by stardust.</p> <p>In round one, Ali tested Foreman at long range. Then, 30 seconds into the second stanza, he retreated to the ropes. Conventional wisdom dictated that the ropes were the last place an opponent wanted to be against the most feared puncher in boxing. Ali\u2019s corner was screaming at him to dance. But Muhammad remained in place, determined to fight out of a defensive posture, blocking some punches, leaning back against the ropes to avoid others, and absorbing the sledgehammer blows that landed. For the next six rounds, that was how he fought. But Ali didn\u2019t just take punches. He threw them as well. Fighting off the ropes, he won three of the first four rounds. Then, in round five, Foreman began landing thunderous right hands to Muhammad\u2019s body. Ali looked tired. The end seemed near. But Muhammad rallied at the end of the round, survived rounds six and seven, and at the start of round eight, told Foreman, \u201cNow it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really plan what happened that night,\u201d Ali told me as we watched the fight together. \u201cBut when a fighter gets in the ring, he has to adjust to the conditions he faces. Against George, the ring was slow. Dancing all night, my legs would have got tired. And George was following me too close, cutting off the ring. In the first round, I used more energy staying away from him than he used chasing me. I was tireder than I should have been with 14 rounds to go. I knew I couldn\u2019t keep dancing, because by the middle of the fight I\u2019d be really tired and George would get me. So between rounds, I decided to do what I did in training when I got tired. It was something Archie Moore used to do. He let younger men take their shots and blocked everything in scientific fashion. Then, when they got tired, Archie would attack. Not everyone can do that. It takes a lot of skill. But I figured I\u2019d be able to handle George off the ropes early in the fight when I was fresh. And if he hit too hard, I\u2019d just start dancing again.</p> <p>\u201cSo starting in the second round, I gave George what he thought he wanted. And he hit hard. A couple of times, he shook me bad, especially with the right hand. But I blocked and dodged most of what he threw. And each round, his punches got slower and hurt less when they landed. Then I started talking to him. \u2018Hit harder! Show me something, George. That don\u2019t hurt. I thought you were supposed to be bad.\u2019 And George was trapped. I was on the ropes, but he was trapped because attacking was all he knew how to do. By round six, I knew he was tired. His punches weren\u2019t as hard as before. And because of the way George fought, one punch at a time with his head not moving, it was getting easy to hit him with counterpunches.\u201d</p> <p>Later, when I talked with Foreman about the fight, he had similar memories.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the fight, I thought I\u2019d knock him out easy,\u201d Foreman told me. \u201cOne round, two rounds. I was very confident. And what I remember most about the fight was, I went out and hit Muhammad with the hardest shot to the body I ever delivered to any opponent. Anybody else in the world would have crumbled. Muhammad cringed. I could see it hurt. And then he looked at me. He had that look in his eyes, like he was saying, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna let you hurt me.\u2019 And to be honest, that\u2019s the main thing I remember about the fight. Everything else happened too quick. I got burned out. Muhammad started talking to me. I remember Angelo [Dundee] shouting from the corner, \u2018Muhammad, don\u2019t play with that sucker.\u2019 But Muhammad just kept playing. The \u2018rope-a-dope\u2019 was what he called it later, and it worked.</p> <p>\u201cYou see, Muhammad\u2019s antennas were built to look out for big punches. And with the style I had, my height, and my tendency to throw big punches \u2013 no matter how hard I hit, Muhammad had the instinct to get ready for each punch, ride it through, and be waiting for the next one. I was the aggressor. There was no doubt about that. I was throwing the most punches. But I knew that in some way I was losing. In fact, I remember thinking during the fight, \u2018Hey, this guy wasn\u2019t champion before because someone bought the title for him. He\u2019s good.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The end came in round eight.</p>    <p>\u201cThe punch I knocked him out with, if I\u2019d knocked him down in the first round, he would have gotten up,\u201d Ali told me. \u201cBut by the time I got him, he was so exhausted that to pull himself up was just too much.\u201d</p> <p>Ten years after beating Sonny Liston, seven years after he\u2019d been stripped of his title, Ali had reclaimed the heavyweight championship of the world.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never know what this means to me,\u201d Ali said afterward. \u201cNow that I got my championship back, every day is something special. I wake up in the morning, and no matter what the weather is like, every day is a sunny day.\u201d</p> <p>Foreman, of course, experienced the aftermath of the fight differently.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a process of grieving after a loss like that,\u201d Foreman acknowledged years later. \u201cWhen you are the heavyweight champion of the world, it\u2019s not like you have lost a fight. You have lost a part of yourself. One day, you\u2019re going through the airport, going to Africa, and everybody is afraid of you. Then, coming back from Africa, they\u2019re patting you on the back. \u2018It\u2019s all right. You\u2019ll be OK.\u2019 From praise to pity. I\u2019ve never been so devastated in my life.\u201d</p> <p>But a bond had been formed. And after Ali died, Foreman reminisced about telephone conversations that he and Muhammad had when they were much older men. Many of those conversations centered on religion.</p> <p>\u201cWe agreed that good is good and bad is bad,\u201d George recalled. \u201cAnd most people, whatever their religion is or even if they don\u2019t follow a particular religion, know the difference. When I heard his voice, it would always bring me happiness. It seemed with us there was something greater than religion \u2013 a longing to love and belonging to each other, a thankfulness we had each other.\u201d</p> <p>And looking back on Zaire, Foreman observed, \u201cI think Muhammad needed that victory back then a lot more than I needed it.\u201d</p> <p>Ali agreed.</p> <p>\u201cThe fight when I was at my best as a boxer was against Cleveland Williams,\u201d Ali told me. \u201cThe fight that was the best for fans was against Joe Frazier in Manila. But the fight that meant the most to me was beating George Foreman to win the championship of the world again.\u201d</p> <p>And Ali offered the coda, \u201cSo many people come up to me and tell me they remember where they were when I whupped George Foreman. I remember where I was too.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Thomas Hauser\u2019s email address is <a href=\"mailto:thomashauserwriter@gmail.com\">thomashauserwriter@gmail.com</a>.

He lost to Joe Frazier and then to Ken Norton. Ali avenged his defeats to Frazier and Norton. But by then, a new king had been crowned. George Foreman\u2019s professional record stood at 40 wins with no losses and 37 knockouts. His eight most recent bouts had ended in the first or second round. His victims in those fights included Frazier and Norton. This was the mountain that Ali had to climb. \u201cMy opponents don\u2019t worry about losing,\u201d Foreman bragged. \u201cThey worry about getting hurt.\u201d That view was seconded by Dave Anderson of the New York Times who wrote, \u201cGeorge Foreman might be the heaviest puncher in the history of the heavyweight division. For a few rounds, Ali might be able to escape Foreman\u2019s sledgehammer strength, but not for 15 rounds. Sooner or later, the champion will land one of his sledgehammer punches and, for the first time in his career, Muhammad Ali will be counted out. That could happen in the first round.\u201d The fight began in the early hours of the morning to accommodate closed-circuit audiences in the United States. Had Muhammad fought Foreman in Las Vegas or New York, the mystique of that night and the Ali legend would not have been the same. Foreman was a three-to-one betting favorite. Sixty thousand fans jammed Stade du 20 Mai. Heavy storm clouds had gathered overhead by the time the bell for round one rang. But the night was touched by stardust. In round one, Ali tested Foreman at long range. Then, 30 seconds into the second stanza, he retreated to the ropes. Conventional wisdom dictated that the ropes were the last place an opponent wanted to be against the most feared puncher in boxing. Ali\u2019s corner was screaming at him to dance. But Muhammad remained in place, determined to fight out of a defensive posture, blocking some punches, leaning back against the ropes to avoid others, and absorbing the sledgehammer blows that landed. For the next six rounds, that was how he fought. But Ali didn\u2019t just take punches. He threw them as well. Fighting off the ropes, he won three of the first four rounds. Then, in round five, Foreman began landing thunderous right hands to Muhammad\u2019s body. Ali looked tired. The end seemed near. But Muhammad rallied at the end of the round, survived rounds six and seven, and at the start of round eight, told Foreman, \u201cNow it\u2019s my turn.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t really plan what happened that night,\u201d Ali told me as we watched the fight together. \u201cBut when a fighter gets in the ring, he has to adjust to the conditions he faces. Against George, the ring was slow. Dancing all night, my legs would have got tired. And George was following me too close, cutting off the ring. In the first round, I used more energy staying away from him than he used chasing me. I was tireder than I should have been with 14 rounds to go. I knew I couldn\u2019t keep dancing, because by the middle of the fight I\u2019d be really tired and George would get me. So between rounds, I decided to do what I did in training when I got tired. It was something Archie Moore used to do. He let younger men take their shots and blocked everything in scientific fashion. Then, when they got tired, Archie would attack. Not everyone can do that. It takes a lot of skill. But I figured I\u2019d be able to handle George off the ropes early in the fight when I was fresh. And if he hit too hard, I\u2019d just start dancing again. \u201cSo starting in the second round, I gave George what he thought he wanted. And he hit hard. A couple of times, he shook me bad, especially with the right hand. But I blocked and dodged most of what he threw. And each round, his punches got slower and hurt less when they landed. Then I started talking to him. \u2018Hit harder! Show me something, George. That don\u2019t hurt. I thought you were supposed to be bad.\u2019 And George was trapped. I was on the ropes, but he was trapped because attacking was all he knew how to do. By round six, I knew he was tired. His punches weren\u2019t as hard as before. And because of the way George fought, one punch at a time with his head not moving, it was getting easy to hit him with counterpunches.\u201d Later, when I talked with Foreman about the fight, he had similar memories. \u201cBefore the fight, I thought I\u2019d knock him out easy,\u201d Foreman told me. \u201cOne round, two rounds. I was very confident. And what I remember most about the fight was, I went out and hit Muhammad with the hardest shot to the body I ever delivered to any opponent. Anybody else in the world would have crumbled. Muhammad cringed. I could see it hurt. And then he looked at me. He had that look in his eyes, like he was saying, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna let you hurt me.\u2019 And to be honest, that\u2019s the main thing I remember about the fight. Everything else happened too quick. I got burned out. Muhammad started talking to me. I remember Angelo [Dundee] shouting from the corner, \u2018Muhammad, don\u2019t play with that sucker.\u2019 But Muhammad just kept playing. The \u2018rope-a-dope\u2019 was what he called it later, and it worked. \u201cYou see, Muhammad\u2019s antennas were built to look out for big punches. And with the style I had, my height, and my tendency to throw big punches \u2013 no matter how hard I hit, Muhammad had the instinct to get ready for each punch, ride it through, and be waiting for the next one. I was the aggressor. There was no doubt about that. I was throwing the most punches. But I knew that in some way I was losing. In fact, I remember thinking during the fight, \u2018Hey, this guy wasn\u2019t champion before because someone bought the title for him. He\u2019s good.\u2019\u201d The end came in round eight. \u201cThe punch I knocked him out with, if I\u2019d knocked him down in the first round, he would have gotten up,\u201d Ali told me. \u201cBut by the time I got him, he was so exhausted that to pull himself up was just too much.\u201d Ten years after beating Sonny Liston, seven years after he\u2019d been stripped of his title, Ali had reclaimed the heavyweight championship of the world. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know what this means to me,\u201d Ali said afterward. \u201cNow that I got my championship back, every day is something special. I wake up in the morning, and no matter what the weather is like, every day is a sunny day.\u201d Foreman, of course, experienced the aftermath of the fight differently. \u201cThere is a process of grieving after a loss like that,\u201d Foreman acknowledged years later. \u201cWhen you are the heavyweight champion of the world, it\u2019s not like you have lost a fight. You have lost a part of yourself. One day, you\u2019re going through the airport, going to Africa, and everybody is afraid of you. Then, coming back from Africa, they\u2019re patting you on the back. \u2018It\u2019s all right. You\u2019ll be OK.\u2019 From praise to pity. I\u2019ve never been so devastated in my life.\u201d But a bond had been formed. And after Ali died, Foreman reminisced about telephone conversations that he and Muhammad had when they were much older men. Many of those conversations centered on religion. \u201cWe agreed that good is good and bad is bad,\u201d George recalled. \u201cAnd most people, whatever their religion is or even if they don\u2019t follow a particular religion, know the difference. When I heard his voice, it would always bring me happiness. It seemed with us there was something greater than religion \u2013 a longing to love and belonging to each other, a thankfulness we had each other.\u201d And looking back on Zaire, Foreman observed, \u201cI think Muhammad needed that victory back then a lot more than I needed it.\u201d Ali agreed. \u201cThe fight when I was at my best as a boxer was against Cleveland Williams,\u201d Ali told me. \u201cThe fight that was the best for fans was against Joe Frazier in Manila. But the fight that meant the most to me was beating George Foreman to win the championship of the world again.\u201d And Ali offered the coda, \u201cSo many people come up to me and tell me they remember where they were when I whupped George Foreman. I remember where I was too.\u201d Thomas Hauser\u2019s email address is thomashauserwriter@gmail.com.

      "bodyText": "A world-first greenwashing case that seeks to hold oil and gas company Santos accountable for its net zero commitments began in the federal court today, brought by one of its own shareholders, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR). The organisation claims Santos did not have a proper basis for saying it had a clear pathway to reduce emissions by 26% to 30% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2040, which constituted misleading or deceptive conduct in breach of Australian corporate and consumer laws. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cWe\u2019ll be submitting that Santos lacked reasonable grounds for making these statements,\u201d the centre\u2019s barrister, Noel Hutley SC, said as a 13-day trial began on Monday. In addition to emissions reductions targets, the case was expected to focus on the company\u2019s representations related to its description of natural gas as a \u201cclean fuel\u201d and representations of blue hydrogen (produced using natural gas with carbon capture and storage) as \u201cclean\u201d and \u201czero emissions\u201d. Hutley told the court Santos\u2019s climate change \u201cplan\u201d was not a plan at all, but rather \u201clittle more than a series of speculations \u2026 cobbled together in a matter of weeks\u201d. The centre holds shares in firms such as Santos to try to force them to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, an international treaty on climate change that was signed by the majority of nations, including Australia, in 2016. Santos, which has operations in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and the US, has been accused of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d through claims it could help Australia meet the Paris target of net zero emissions by 2040. Hutley referred to documents that indicated Santos was aware that hydrogen production would increase its direct emissions, which he said wasn\u2019t adequately reflected in its reports and net zero roadmap. Neil Young KC, representing Santos, disputed the nature of the documents and how they were being interpreted. He said investors would have understood that not everything included in the roadmap was an established project. They would have also been aware that a \u201cstep change\u201d transformation was required to support the development of markets for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, he said. Santos\u2019s claim that natural gas was a clean fuel related to the fuel\u2019s role as a transition fuel and the relative greenhouse emissions compared to coal, he said. Young said the company\u2019s commitment to net zero emissions by 2040 was a target, and not a promise for achievement or a prediction. ACCR was asking the court to make declarations that Santos had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct, and for injunctions prohibiting Santos from engaging in deceptive conduct in future and forcing it to issue a corrective notice about the environmental impacts of its operations. Opening statements will continue into Tuesday, with the case due to conclude on Friday 15 November. \u2013 With Australian Associated Press",

But it wasn\u2019t unexpected. And there are lessons for us, but there are also differences.</p> \n   <p>Theirs was a government, as Cameron Dick said on TV yesterday, that had been there for almost a decade. Ours is a government in its first term. So there are obvious differences. But I don\u2019t want to pretend that there aren\u2019t lessons for us as well. Of course there are. There are always lessons in elections like this one. There are always things that we can learn. There are always things that we can do better.</p> \n   <p>And we will go through the results with that in mind. We have always believed, and we have always acted in relation to this belief \u2013 governments are always best when they go in for the whole place. The regions, the suburbs, and the cities. When they govern for the whole place. And that\u2019s what Anthony Albanese does as prime minister.</p> \n   <p>You mentioned the outer suburbs that I represent. You were there not that long ago. One of the heartening things \u2013 despite some big swings in areas like mine, I\u2019ve got six state seats in my federal electorate \u2013 we\u2019re looking like holding at least five, but probably six of those.</p> \n   <p>So what that tells us - we\u2019ve got these wonderful state members in my part of Queensland - what that tells us [is] if you make the right decisions for the right reasons and you\u2019re a good local representative, then you can hang on even when things are turning against the government. So, good local representation, good, responsible decisions.</p> \n   <p>Queenslanders are pragmatic and practical people. And the Albanese government is a pragmatic and practical government.

      "bodyText": "And with that, we are going to put the blog to bed. Before we go, let\u2019s re-cap the big headlines: Incoming Queensland premier David Crisafulli said that his government will be pulling together a plan for the Olympics within its first 100 days. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the Greens\u2019 blocking of legislation in the Senate and MP Max Chandler-Mather\u2019s support for the CFMEU led to poor Queensland result. But Greens leader Adam Bandt said it was Labor targeting their seats with Greens policies that resulted in the hit. The employment minister, Murray Watt, refused to comment on reports Anthony Albanese used his membership in Qantas\u2019s chairman\u2019s lounge to solicit flight upgrades when he was transport minister and opposition leader. The Coalition did not approach Geoscience Australia to ask about the suitability of any of the seven sites where it wants to put nuclear reactors. The New South Wales government is moving towards legalising the use of e-scooters on streets. Renewable energy helped push demand to record low levels on Saturday in the national electricity market that serves the eastern states including South Australia, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) said. New South Wales teachers voted to endorse a three-year pay offer from the New South Wales government. Thank you for spending part of your day with us. We will be back tomorrow to do it all again. No ill effects from ACT drug decriminalisation, advocates say Canberra was tipped to become \u201cthe drug capital of Australia\u201d after the ACT decriminalised personal use of illicit substances. But 12 months on, safety advocates are not noticing any ill effects, reports AAP. Erin Lalor, chief executive of the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, says the ongoing criminalisation of drugs elsewhere in Australia continues to do more harm than good. \u201cWe know that the criminalisation of personal drug use continues to cause harm to individuals who come into contact with the justice system while they fail to stop all illicit drug use,\u201d she told a parliamentary inquiry into drug and alcohol harm on Monday. Dr Lalor said the treatment system was overwhelmed and more work needed to be done to prevent alcohol and drug harm early, rather than react to it. \u201cWe cannot continue to park an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must build better fences.\u201d Slow start for Australian share market The Australian share market has had a quiet start to what\u2019s expected to be a volatile two weeks filled with big events across politics, corporate earnings and macroeconomics, AAP has reported. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Monday finished 10.2 points, or 0.12%, higher, at 8,221.5, while the broader All Ordinaries gained 10.9 points, or 0.13%, to 8,478.2. The Australian dollar had fallen below 66 US cents for the first time since mid-August, buying 65.89 US cents, down from 66.25 US cents at Friday\u2019s ASX close. Renewable energy helped push demand to record low levels on Saturday in the national electricity market that serves the eastern states including South Australia, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) says. Spring and autumn are when demand for power can decrease as there\u2019s often not a lot of call for heating or cooling. The seasons can be quite windy and the longer days bring more sunshine. The relentless take-up of low-cost rooftop solar means also that more and more households are generating their own power. As we noted in this recent piece, periods of so-called minimum system load (MSL) are going to become more common. Indeed, there was another MSL alert from Aemo over the weekend for Victoria. And, lo and behold, the operator has just issued an alert this afternoon for that state for this Saturday - before cancelling it about half an hour later. Aemo had said Victoria\u2019s demand may drop to as low as 1491MW at 12.30pm (that\u2019s Aest in Aemo time, so 1.30pm Aedt). Authorities will no doubt be watching to see if other actions will be needed to keep the grid stable, perhaps including asking big batteries to soak up surplus rooftop solar output. Insurer facing major penalties over allegedly misleading life-insurance policies HCF claimed on some of its life-insurance policies that it could deny coverage to customers with a pre-existing condition, even if they were not aware of the illness when signing up, AAP is reporting. The health insurance giant could face major penalties over the claims, which the federal court ruled on Monday might have been misleading. Several policies offered by the non-profit fund\u2019s life insurance arm, HCF Life, included a \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d term, purporting to allow it to deny coverage if a customer did not disclose a condition before entering the contract. Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) said it would seek penalties for misleading conduct. The watchdog alleged the pre-existing condition term was an unfair contract term under corporate regulations, but that element of the case was dismissed by the court. New South Wales teachers have voted to endorse a three-year pay offer from the New South Wales government. It deliver pay increases of 3% annually for the next three years. More to come. Six added to list of endangered species in Australia The fluffy heath mouse is among the Australian animals added to the international red list of threatened species, with conservationists warning of an escalating global extinction crisis, AAP has reported. There are 742 endangered Australian plants and animals on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list of threatened species, which grew by six species in the past year. Australian Conservation Foundation campaigner Jess Abrahams said disappearing wildlife was a dire warning for the planet: Wildlife populations across Australia and across the planet are in decline, and we will lose many species if urgent action isn\u2019t taken to stop rampant deforestation, invasive species and climate change. The species now at risk of extinction include the heath mouse, found in south-west Victoria, southern South Australia and southern Western Australia. Man arrested over fatal stabbing in Geelong A 26-year-old man has been arrested following the alleged fatal stabbing of another man in Geelong yesterday. The 20-year-old victim was allegedly stabbed during an altercation on Little Malop Street about 5.30am. He was taken to hospital where he later died. Two other men, aged 23 and 26, presented at a hospital with non life-threatening injuries yesterday morning. Police said they will be interviewing them \u201cat a later date\u201d. Investigations into the incident are ongoing. Greenwashing case against Santos gets under way A world-first greenwashing case that seeks to hold oil and gas company Santos accountable for its net zero commitments commenced in the federal court today. The case, brought by the shareholder group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), was the first to challenge the veracity of a company\u2019s net zero emissions plan. ACCR alleged Santos made representations related to its net zero target and roadmap, which constituted misleading or deceptive conduct in breach of corporate and consumer laws. Proceedings began with Noel Hutley, SC establishing key parameters in the case, including the meaning of net zero. In opening remarks, Hutley quoted extensively from Santos\u2019 public climate reports and company documents, drawing attention to the company\u2019s reliance on blue hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and nature based offsets to achieve net zero, and its failure to disclose anticipated growth in emissions from oil and gas exploration. Opening statements will continue into Tuesday, with the case due to conclude on Friday 15 November. Coalition nuclear plan a \u2018smokescreen\u2019 for fossil fuels, renewables advocate tells inquiry More from the inquiry running in parliament today about nuclear energy generation in Australia, where renewables industry advocate John Grimes launched a bitter attack on the Coalition\u2019s plans. Grimes, the chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, told the inquiry the Coalition\u2019s plan was \u201call about attacking renewables and boosting fossil fuels\u201d. Recalling Scott Morrison\u2019s 2017 stunt where he brought a lump of coal into parliament, Grimes said: This nuclear proposal is today\u2019s version of a lump of coal in parliament. The motivation [of the Coalition\u2019s plan] is to attack renewables and hold them back. Nothing has changed. This is a smokescreen. In a less measured and more graphic analogy, Grimes said the Coalition\u2019s energy policy was \u201ca bit like a dog, circling around and around finally coming back to eat its own vomit, only this time it\u2019s nuclear flavoured\u201d. We have seen this vomit before. It\u2019s all about smashing renewables and delivering for fossil fuels. And with that, I leave the blog in the hands of Cait Kelly. Thanks for reading. Greens vow to fight nuclear power \u2018tooth and nail\u2019 Greens leader Adam Bandt has vowed to fight \u201ctooth and nail\u201d against nuclear power, after telling reporters the Queensland election result was \u201cone step closer\u201d to a change in energy policy: Australia is now one step closer to having nuclear power. Peter Dutton has made it clear that [he will] now use this result to push Australia a step closer to having nuclear power. The Greens will fight Peter [Dutton\u2019s] nuclear push tooth and nail. David Crisafulli and Jarrod Bleijie have held their first press conference after being sworn in as Queensland premier and deputy premier. The duo said their focus in the next days is changes to the \u201cmachinery of government\u201d, referring to the structure and leadership of departments. What we don\u2019t want to see is the constant changes to government departments that we have seen in recent years. That doesn\u2019t give the stability for the public service. It also creates a situation where there\u2019s no single point of accountability into the long term. The duo were sworn in as an \u201cinterim\u201d cabinet at Government House this morning. But they intend to announce and then swear in their full cabinet by the end of the week. Before the election, they had promised to appoint all members of the shadow cabinet in the portfolios they held in opposition. Crisafulli appeared to be edging away from meeting that pledge on Monday. The people who you have seen and who have done a really good job will be the people who you see and will be rewarded. And just one other thing to clear it up, that senior leadership team that\u2019s done the job and worked really hard will continue to be that senior leadership team, Jarrod [Bleijie], David [Janetzski], Ros [Bates] and Dale [Last]. You know, they come to it with different perspectives, but they\u2019ve done a really good job, and they\u2019ll remain that senior leadership team. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be too many surprises when the cabinet is announced. Albanese government \u2018not serious\u2019 about airline competition, Spender says Teal MP Allegra Spender has accused the government of not being \u201cserious\u201d about airline competition. Taking to X to share her view on allegations in a new book that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, requested flight upgrades from Qantas. Spender said the government\u2019s actions meant \u201chigher prices for Australians\u201d. She also alleged Albanese has a \u201ccosy relationship\u201d with former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce: The Albanese govt hasn\u2019t been serious about airline competition. Qatar Air and foot dragging on Sydney landing slots mean higher prices for Australians. His flight upgrades and cosy relations with Alan Joyce create a perception of conflict (whether they influence him or not). TGA issues fine to unauthorised vape retailer The medicines regulator has fined a retailer in the central Queensland city of Bundaberg $18,780 after more than 350 vapes were located at their store. The vapes were seized on 1 August 2024 when officers from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) executed a warrant, as part of a joint enforcement operation with Queensland Health. The infringement notice comes as both the TGA and state health bodies are ensuring compliance with the government\u2019s vaping reforms passed in July which prohibit retailers, including tobacconists and convenience stores, from selling any type of vape. Only pharmacies are allowed to supply vapes in Australia. The TGA said since the reforms were passed, enforcement officers have been visiting retail stores across various states and territories to educate and issue warnings about unlawful advertising, supply and commercial possession of vaping goods, with informational materials being disseminated widely. After the health minister, Mark Butler, last week said the government would start prosecuting vape vendors, the head of the TGA has echoed the need to take action for the good of public health. The head of the TGA and chief medical officer, Prof Anthony Lawler, said: The unlawful possession and sale of vaping products endangers public health and undermines our efforts to regulate vaping goods in accordance with the legislation that passed on 1 July 2024. The TGA continues to work with state and territory partners to remove illicit vaping goods from the market and will take action against those entities found to not be complying, including retailers. David Crisafulli has been sworn in as Queensland\u2019s 41st premier. He is just the second from the Liberal National party. Crisafulli and his deputy Jarrod Bleijie were sworn in at a ceremony at Government House on Monday. Governor Jeannette Young also swore them in as an interim cabinet of two. He defeated Labor premier Steven Miles at the weekend\u2019s election. Crisafulli is expected to do a brief press conference in a few moments. NSW government offer $1m reward in effort to solve 2015 murder of Prabha Arun Kumar A $1m reward has been offered for information that helps solve the near-decade-old murder of an Indian mother as authorities desperately seek answers to crack the case open. Prabha Arun Kumar was found dead on a footpath in Parramatta Park, in Sydney\u2019s west, on 7 March 7 2015. The 41-year-old was on the phone to her husband Arun in India when she was stabbed in the neck, with Mr Kumar reportedly hearing his wife confronted by her attacker. The NSW government and police announced the reward on Monday for anyone who could provide information that led to the arrest and conviction of the killer. Mr Kumar, who lived in Bangalore with the couple\u2019s daughter, flew into Australia when he learned of his wife\u2019s death. She was only weeks away from moving back to India because she missed her family. \u201cMy wife was the most caring and beautiful soul,\u201d Mr Kumar said at the time. Ms Kumar, who lived about 300m from where she was killed, moved to Australia in 2012 for a project with tech firm Mindtree. Police said they had pursued multiple lines of inquiry and made several public appeals for information but the case remains unsolved. Investigators previously dismissed the prospect of the attack being racially motivated. Via AAP. Victorian premier dodges question on implications of Queensland election result The Victorian Labor premier, Jacinta Allan, has congratulated Queensland\u2019s incoming premier, David Crisafulli. Speaking in Footscray on Monday, she also acknowledged the \u201cstrong work of Steven Miles and the Labor team up there as well\u201d. Asked what the result means for the Victorian government, given the parallels with Queensland, she brushed off the question: When it comes to the priorities of Queensland, I\u2019ll let the Queensland premier talk to them. My priorities are building homes for Victorians. Miles, similarly to Allan, took over the premiership after Annastacia Palaszczuk resigned. The third term Labor government was voted out, in part due to a successful law and order campaign by Crisafulli\u2019s Liberals. Allan said the Victorian government has \u201calready taken very strong action in strengthening the youth justice regime\u201d. She went on: We\u2019ve strengthened bail. We put youth justice legislation through the Victorian parliament recently that has passed \u2026 opposed along the way by the Liberal party. They opposed the strengthening of bail that was contained in that youth justice package ... We\u2019re giving Victoria police the additional resources they need to deal with this group of repeat serious youth offenders. Next up, Dutton is asked about the incoming Queensland premier\u2019s rejection of nuclear energy. Earlier this morning, David Crisafulli said it was still a \u201cno\u201d to any nuclear proposal, and Dutton said he \u201crespected\u201d that. I respect that is David\u2019s position. It has been long-standing and I knew before the election and I know it now. Same as Chris Minns. I think you can have a conversation with sensible premiers and I put them in that category. Peter is the champion of the nuclear submarine in south Australia. It is safe or labour would not have signed up to it and I think the question is we have to say and ask is why is Anthony Albanese staying in the way of a bipartisan view on nuclear energy? It would make us internationally competitive. So let\u2019s have a mature conversation. The issue people raise all the time, is that all of that can be resolved if Anthony Albanese stands up in a bipartisan way is to present a position on nuclear and that would give certainty around investment and the future supply of energy at a cheaper price in our country but at the moment he\u2019s playing this childlike game and unfortunately we will see increases in electricity prices under Labor hapless promises. Dutton defends his own flight upgrades, which he says are about \u2018passenger load\u2019 Dutton outlines the number of flights he takes a year and how often he recalls getting an upgrade: Generally, you arrive at the airport and there is an upgrade of the seat available and that is generally as I understand it how it happens. But I have been in parliament since 2001 and as you say there are 15 upgrades since then. I probably do 190 flight this year. I prefer to be doing none at all actually, but I am here in Melbourne today very happily and I am off to Perth shortly and we go from one side of the country to another. I average 180, 190 flights per year. None of it happens as a result of me calling my best friend Alan Joyce at Qantas. Asked how and when upgrades are offered, Dutton said it was about \u201cpassenger load\u201d. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has stepped up for a press conference in Melbourne where he is immediately asked about the prime minister\u2019s reported flight upgrades. It comes after a book from the former Australian Financial Review columnist Joe Aston alleged Anthony Albanese solicited flight upgrades from then Qantas CEO Alan Joyce during his time as transport minister. Dutton begins by saying it is \u201ca bit strange\u201d that Albanese might have contacted a \u201cCEO of an airline when he is the minister for transport\u201d. As you know, I very strongly believe in the need for people to declare their \u2026 interests and sometimes there are oversights and human error involved but when you\u2019re talking about having a personal phone call to ask for an upgrade, as the transport minister or shadow transport minister. And I presume the prime minister will answer questions about that. Its a strange arrangement when you can pick the phone up to the CEO and ask, as a transport minister, for an upgrade for your arrangements. If you go to the airport and either full load factors or for decisions airline makes otherwise for them to upgrade, that is perfectly appropriate, as the rules apply equally to everyone. But if you are the transport minister and you are picking up the phone to one of the most important stakeholders in your portfolio, asking for a free upgrade, then again I think the prime minister would be able to ask those questions more effectively than anyone else because I am not aware of anyone else having done it. Chalmers says he never asked Alan Joyce for Qantas upgrade I just wanted to return to the Chalmers press conference earlier, where he ducked and weaved questions on the prime minister\u2019s flight upgrades. Chalmers said politicians\u2019 travel declarations need to be \u201crobust\u201d and said he hadn\u2019t personally asked former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce for an upgrade: I haven\u2019t asked Alan Joyce, no. I\u2019m not sure if I have received one. I don\u2019t think so, but I\u2019d have to have a look. Asked if the process for the disclosure of interests should be strengthened, Chalmers said he had \u201cnot given much thought to it\u201d. I\u2019m focused on inflation this week, the G20 discussions, the lessons from Saturday\u2019s campaign. You know, I\u2019m broadly aware, and I was asked this morning about some of these issues... It\u2019s appropriate that the arrangements are robust. The New South Wales government is moving towards legalising the use of e-scooters on streets, amid a new E-micromobility Action Plan. The plan is intended to address a regulatory blind spot, where e-scooters can be purchased in NSW but can\u2019t be ridden on the streets or footpaths. The plan also includes actions on reviewing how shared e-bikes are operated in local communities, reviewing the road rules in relation to e-micromobility, including exploring options for the legal use of e-scooters on streets and roads, and delivering more shared e-scooter trials. A pilot is already under way for marked, dedicated parking bays for shared e-bikes at nine train stations around Sydney: Central, Circular Quay, Wynyard, Barangaroo Metro, Newtown, Sydenham, Marrickville and Bondi Junction. Transport minister Jo Haylen said it was a \u201cstrange\u201d regulatory blind spot: There are already 1.35 million e-micromobility devices in homes across NSW. Almost 460,0000 of these are e-scooters. But only 22% of people across the state know it\u2019s illegal to ride e-scooters on our roads and streets. It\u2019s a strange regulatory blind spot, and it has to change. E-bikes and e-scooters aren\u2019t without controversy, which is exactly why we\u2019re taking action. It\u2019s clear we need a regulatory framework that will allow people to make the most of this transport option, without compromising on community safety. Allowing people to ride an e-scooter to the shops or nearby train stations will take pressure off our roads and lessen competition for parking. It\u2019s a big win for everyone, we just have a bit more work to do to get the balance right. Barnaby Joyce on MP flight upgrades: \u2018It\u2019s a difference when you solicit it\u2019 Returning to the issue of the prime minister\u2019s flights, the Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce says the problem is \u201cwhen you solicit\u201d the upgrades. While Anthony Albanese declared yesterday that all upgrades were declared, Joyce said on Sunrise this morning that reports the PM asked for them did not pass the \u201cpub test.\u201d A lot of people that fly generally get offered upgrade and take them. We all do that. It\u2019s a difference when you solicit it. When you ring up Alan Joyce and say, \u2018Alan I would like an upgrade. My name is Anthony Albanese.\u2019 That\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t pass the pub test. If every person who gets an upgrade is in trouble we will have a lot of people in trouble. I acknowledge 100% a lot of politicians get upgrades, me included. It\u2019s whether you solicit it, especially if you ring up Alan Joyce. That\u2019s the issue. That\u2019s an issue Mr Albanese has to explain. Asked if Labor should be concerned that it is losing \u201ctouch with people in the outer suburbs or urban fringes\u201d, Chalmers says the party needs to be \u201cvigilant about it\u201d. You always need to be vigilant about it. I\u2019ve certainly acknowledged it on other occasions. We understand that people are doing it tough and they expressed that at the ballot box, which is their right. What we\u2019ve tried to do is we\u2019ve tried to take a series of well-informed economic decisions \u2026 for the right reasons. Because I believe if you do that \u2026 the politics will take care of themselves. This is not the kind of government that chases the fortnightly ups and downs of opinion polls. We try to do the right thing at every turn, in three budgets, all of the updates and all of the decisions we\u2019ve taken. The right thing is recognising people are doing it tough, doing what you can to help them, but recognising that you have to do that in the most responsible way that you can. Chalmers on Queensland election: \u2018We won\u2019t be ignoring the lessons of Saturday\u2019 Building on that, Chalmers says there were a couple of takeaways from the result in Queensland: First of all, the outcome on Saturday night was decisive. But it wasn\u2019t unexpected. And there are lessons for us, but there are also differences. Theirs was a government, as Cameron Dick said on TV yesterday, that had been there for almost a decade. Ours is a government in its first term. So there are obvious differences. But I don\u2019t want to pretend that there aren\u2019t lessons for us as well. Of course there are. There are always lessons in elections like this one. There are always things that we can learn. There are always things that we can do better. And we will go through the results with that in mind. We have always believed, and we have always acted in relation to this belief \u2013 governments are always best when they go in for the whole place. The regions, the suburbs, and the cities. When they govern for the whole place. And that\u2019s what Anthony Albanese does as prime minister. You mentioned the outer suburbs that I represent. You were there not that long ago. One of the heartening things \u2013 despite some big swings in areas like mine, I\u2019ve got six state seats in my federal electorate \u2013 we\u2019re looking like holding at least five, but probably six of those. So what that tells us - we\u2019ve got these wonderful state members in my part of Queensland - what that tells us [is] if you make the right decisions for the right reasons and you\u2019re a good local representative, then you can hang on even when things are turning against the government. So, good local representation, good, responsible decisions. Queenslanders are pragmatic and practical people. And the Albanese government is a pragmatic and practical government. But we will go through the lessons from Saturday night. We won\u2019t telegraph those lessons to our opponents by running through them in detail for you at a press conference. But we won\u2019t be ignoring the lessons of Saturday. We understand that people are doing it tough. We understand that people often express that at the ballot box, which is their right. And so we will go through the lessons of Saturday with that in mind. Chalmers congratulates Crisafulli on Queensland election win Treasurer Jim Chalmers is speaking to reporters, where he congratulated David Crisafulli and the Liberal National party for their victory in the Queensland election. He said he intended to work with Crisafulli and the new Queensland government: I offer them my warmest congratulations and we will work with the new LNP government in Queensland in the same constructive way that we worked with the former Labor government in Queensland. I\u2019ve been able to relay my congratulations to incoming treasurer Janetzki already. We have agreed to catch up this week, most likely on Thursday, subject to the timing of the new government\u2019s swearing-in. But we\u2019ve had a very warm exchange, and I look forward to talking with him later in the week and working with him on behalf of the people of Queensland as well. Chalmers went on to say that the result wouldn\u2019t change how Labor will prepare for the next federal election. I want to reassure people that we will continue to put responsible economic management as the defining feature of this Albanese Labor government. This election was never going to be, from our side, a free-for-all of public spending. It wasn\u2019t going to be before Saturday\u2019s outcome, and it\u2019s not going to be after Saturday\u2019s outcome. The Coalition has not approached Geoscience Australia to ask about the suitability of any of the seven sites where it wants to put nuclear reactors, including for risks from earthquakes, a parliamentary hearing has just heard. The government\u2019s parliamentary inquiry into nuclear energy has its second hearing today and officials from Geoscience Australia are giving evidence. The officials confirmed the Coalition had not asked for its view on the suitability of any of the sites it is proposing, and said it would likely take two years to deliver a full assessment of the risks from a range of hazards, including earthquakes, tsunamis and the condition of the earth underneath each site. Ted O\u2019Brien, the opposition\u2019s energy spokesman, said this two-year timeframe was in line with the Coalition\u2019s policy. O\u2019Brien revealed the Coalition had been taking advice from Prof Andrew Whittaker, a US-based expert on seismic events in relation to nuclear energy. O\u2019Brien said Whittaker has told him that recent earthquakes in the Hunter valley, near the Liddell power station - a site earmarked for a reactor by the Coalition - and these would be \u201centirely inconsequential\u201d to the operation of a nuclear power plant. But John Dawson, a branch head of community safety at Geoscience Australia, said any assessment of a site would require \u201cdetailed investigation\u201d before \u201canyone can say definitively if these sites are suitable.\u201d Bandt on his Qantas chairman\u2019s lounge membership: \u2018We have always declared this and let people make their own judgments\u2019 I wanted to just return to Bandt\u2019s appearance on RN Breakfast earlier, where he was also questioned about his membership of the Qantas chairman\u2019s lounge. But Bandt said he had declared his membership: We\u2019ve been calling for at times, when Qantas has come with its cap in hand and said that they need assistance, we\u2019ve said, well maybe we should have a look at government owning a stake in this essential service, in our transport yet again. The Greens don\u2019t take donations from big corporations. Look, I\u2019ll let people make their own decisions. We declare it since the beginning. We have always declared this and let people make their own judgments and then separately have a look at the policies that we\u2019re advancing. Watt asked about Australia\u2019s decision to block Qatar from increasing flights Watt continued discussing the prime minister\u2019s relationship with Qantas on RN Breakfast earlier, where he said accusations of favouritism are \u201chypocritical\u201d. It all comes from a book by former Australian Financial Review columnist Joe Aston which goes into the recent tumultous years at Qantas. Aston said the decision to block Qatar Airways from increasing flights to Australia was \u201cimpossible to justify\u201d earlier on RN Breakfast, but Watt questioned why those same criticisms aren\u2019t made of previous Coalition governments who made the same call. Watt specifically pointed to former Coalition transport minister Michael McCormack, who he said made the same decision. \u201cMcCormack has said that he made that decision to knock back Qatar based on the national interest at the time, and that was the basis for our decision as well. \u201c[Transport minister] Catherine King has approved, since the Qatar decision, extra flights for Turkish Airways, so it\u2019s not as if we have some sort of blanket ban against airlines flying into Australia to protect Qantas.\u201d Watt said the decision was made \u201con its merits\u201d like each application of its kind. Employment minister Murray Watt has refused to comment on reports Anthony Albanese used his membership in Qantas\u2019s chairman\u2019s lounge to solicit flight upgrades when he was transport minister and opposition leader. Watt was on RN Breakfast, where he refused to be drawn on what he called \u201cunsourced claim by a journalist\u201d that Albanese would reach out directly to former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce directly about his travel. Watt also took the opportunity to preemptively criticise any opposition focus on the issue: If you have a look at Peter Dutton behaviour, for example, several upgrades from the Qantas and other airlines, he\u2019s had free flights paid for by Gina Rinehart. I really would wonder whether it\u2019s wise for the opposition to start calling this kind of stuff into question. Asked about his own membership of the lounge, Watt said \u201cpretty much everyone\u201d is also a member: We obviously spend an enormous amount of time at airports. I think this week, I\u2019m going to be in about three or four different cities, flying from place to place. And it is helpful from time to time, to be able to have private meetings or private environments, to be able to have teams meetings with your office, which I do every time I fly. The prime minister was adamant yesterday he had declared all previous free upgrades to Qantas flights he had received as \u201cappropriate\u201d, adding that those reported in the Nine papers over the weekend \u201cgo back a long, a long period of time\u201d. He said that \u201cfrom time to time, members of parliament receive upgrades\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that they are declared. All of mine have been declared.\u201d \u2018We are up for negotiation\u2019: Adam Bandt to Labor Bandt continues, saying the Greens won\u2019t be changing their approach federally despite the Queensland poll result. He said the Greens want to negotiate with Labor on their policies: We want Labor to negotiate like we did in the previous housing legislation, where we not only improved and passed Labour\u2019s housing legislation, but we got $3bn to start building public and community housing. I think this is part of the message that we\u2019re trying to give to the government. We are up for negotiation. The Greens leader Adam Bandt has blamed Labor for his party\u2019s poor showing in the Queensland election. Bandt was on RN Breakfast earlier, and said Labor had adopted Greens policies like cheap public transport and free school lunches to undermine them: We may end up with the two seats that we went in with. The postal votes are still being counted, but look, those are seats that, yes, we were hoping to win. And I guess those are the seats that I\u2019m talking about where Labor gave up on the suburbs, gave up on the regions, and instead focused their attentions in those seats. This is, this is part of the reason that we that we\u2019re pushing these policies, is that people need help, right? There\u2019s a there\u2019s a massive cost of living crisis. People are in dire straits. It was the adoption of policies and people seeing them in practice that is largely responsible for Labor, I guess, sandbagging and holding on to some of those seats. Labor to launch grants to help women get into \u2018male dominated\u2019 industries The government will soon open applications for a new grants program to help women into \u201ctraditionally male dominated\u201d industries like construction and manufacturing, as part of a $60m training and workplace initiative. The \u2018Building Women\u2019s Careers Program\u2019 partnership is aimed at projects like changing workplace cultures and behaviours, more flexible rostering approaches to support men and women with caring responsibilities, and boosting existing projects which have already increased recruitment rates. \u201cProjects will address the barriers for women entering, remaining and advancing in the traditionally male-dominated industries of construction, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and digital and technology,\u201d minister for women Katy Gallagher and skills minister Andrew Giles said in a statement. The grants will be available for industry and community projects, with applications open from 14 November. Albanese defends his government\u2019s industrial relations reforms Anthony Albanese has backed in his government\u2019s Same Job Same Pay laws for labour hire loopholes, saying they are securing big pay rises for blue-collar workers nationwide. The prime minister\u2019s latest full-throated defence of the Labor government\u2019s industrial relations changes comes ahead of what is expected to be a heated debate on workplace laws at the coming election, with criticism from the Coalition and big business groups wanting to roll back the reforms. In a speech to the Mining and Energy Union\u2019s national convention in Brisbane on Monday, Albanese will also accuse opposition leader Peter Dutton of seeking to \u201cwreck every bit of progress\u201d Labor had made in government. In the speech, Albanese will say critics of the laws had made \u201cbizarre comparisons and baseless claims\u201d. \u201cWe were not deterred - and Australians weren\u2019t fooled,\u201d he will say, in advance speech notes shared by his office. The PM claims one worker will get a $33,000 pay rise under the changes, and that \u201cthousands of mining workers\u201d are in line for big pay bumps too. \u201cI\u2019m proud we\u2019ve worked together to deliver this change - now we have to stand together and defend it,\u201d he will say. Albanese will tell the convention that \u201cthere is a lot that Peter Dutton is not telling the Australian people about his agenda\u201d, citing the Coalition\u2019s nuclear power plan, and raising doubt over potential cuts to Medicare, pensions, rent assistance and energy bill relief. \u201cBut he is crystal clear about one thing. He wants to rip up every new right workers have negotiated. He wants to wreck every bit of progress we have made. And wants to cut every pay rise your members have earned,\u201d Albanese will say. Reactions to the Queensland election result are continuing this morning, with environment minister Tanya Plibersek focusing on the Greens\u2019 disappointing one-seat haul. Speaking on Channel 7\u2019s Sunrise, she said the Greens\u2019 blocking of legislation in the Senate and MP Max Chandler-Mather\u2019s support for the CFMEU were to blame: People were saying they were shocked [by] Max Chandler-Mather standing up and defending the... criminal elements of the CFMEU on the back of a truck with a megaphone, instead of voting for housing, cheaper housing and more of it to be built. They\u2019re holding up housing reform. In my area, holding up environmental law reform, the establishment of an environment protection agency is something environmentalists have been calling on for decades and it\u2019s the Greens that are blocking it. People look at that and go \u2018these people aren\u2019t serious about making progress. They are only about opposition. They\u2019re only about making a point\u2019. \u2018Stronger laws do act as a deterrent\u2019 Finally, the incoming Queensland premier is asked about his \u201cadult time for adult crimes\u201d policy, and specifically if it might lead to an unsustainable boom in jail population. But Crisafulli dismissed concerns: At the moment, you\u2019ve got kids in watch houses because the government hasn\u2019t planned and delivered those things. We will. I do believe we do need corrective facilities. But we also need other alternates. I\u2019ve spoken about circuit-breaker sentencing where we can send kids to remote areas that aren\u2019t a jail but give the education, structure and discipline to turn their life around. I\u2019ve spoken about early intervention skills. We\u2019ll deliver those early in Queensland. The question is a very relevant one, but the answer has to be in two parts. Stronger laws do act as a deterrent. Stronger laws do make sure there are consequences for bad behaviour. If you aren\u2019t doing early intervention and rehabilitation, it means nothing. At the moment, what\u2019s happening in Queensland is there\u2019s a 72-hour plan when a child leaves youth detention, and half the kids aren\u2019t even getting that \u2026 72 hours isn\u2019t enough. We need a 12-month plan, six months intensive, to give every person the ability to turn their life around. The 91% reoffending rate is broken. You\u2019ve got to try and do better than that. Crisafuli on nuclear: \u2018It was no before the election, and it\u2019s no after\u2019 Crisafulli is next asked about nuclear power, and if he would implement a potential Dutton government\u2019s plan after the next federal election. And his answer was clear: It was no before the election, and it\u2019s no after. I think that\u2019s what people want to see from me. I want to reset the relationship with Canberra to one of respect but also being forceful and putting forward our point of view. I will do that whether or not Mr Albanese or Mr Dutton is there. I\u2019ve got a good relationship with Peter. We\u2019ve been friends for a long time. I also have a good relationship with the prime minister. I spoke with him yesterday. I don\u2019t support the reduction in 80/20 for funding for the Bruce Highway. I was up-front about that. That will be done respectfully. So too, if Peter was to become prime minister. I\u2019ve seen in recent times the public lose faith particularly with what I saw in Queensland when government changed in Canberra. It was a completely different approach. I\u2019ve got to be on the Maroon team and I\u2019ve got to put forward our case to get our fair share of funding \u2013 and in return, I say to Canberra, we\u2019ll do things on time and on budget, which hasn\u2019t happened. The incoming Queensland premier David Crisafulli has said that his government will be pulling together a plan for the Olympics within its first 100 days. Asked on ABC News if he was personally leaning towards a refurbishment of the Gabba, Crisafulli said people see these Olympics as \u201can opportunity for generational infrastructure.\u201d: What I\u2019m talking about is exactly the model that\u2019s been used successfully before. The problem is when you have things as knee-jerk reactions where politicians say this has to happen and you get the mess that we\u2019ve seen. I don\u2019t want that to happen. I want the best and brightest to be around the room. Within 100 days, you\u2019ll get a plan that Queenslanders can buy into. I think, overwhelmingly, that\u2019s what the state wants to see. \u2026 Within days, we can fix what we haven\u2019t seen in 1,200 days. I think, overwhelmingly, people will see an opportunity for generational infrastructure. That\u2019s what hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games has always been about. Good morning. Mostafa Rachwani with you today to take you through the day\u2019s news. We start with 3G as Telstra and Optus begin the process of switching off the network today. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has urged all Australians to check if they will be affected and to upgrade their tech if needed. Over to Queensland, where incoming premier David Crisafulli is due to be sworn in as the Liberal National party is on track to form a majority government. Crisafulli and his deputy Jarrod Bleijie will be sworn into interim leadership roles when they meet with governor Jeannette Young later today, and they will remain interim until counting is finalised. We\u2019re bring you the latest developments there and across the country as they come.",

      "body": "<p>The Aaron Rodgers era, which never really began in New York, is officially over.</p> <p>Last season after eight games, the New York Jets were 4-4 with Zach Wilson at quarterback, and a defense led by head coach Robert Saleh and defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich that at least kept the team in games, until everything fell apart during the second half, and the Jets finished 7-10.</p> <p>It was automatically assumed that when Aaron Rodgers, a four-time MVP and future Hall of Famer, returned from the torn achilles that cost him all but four snaps in 2023, things would be much better.</p> <p>Spoiler alert: Things are not much better. In fact, they\u2019re worse than they were under Wilson, a quarterback who rarely looked like he belonged in the NFL. After their <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671618\">25-22 Sunday loss</a> to a New England Patriots team whose own head coach, Jerod Mayo, <a href=\"https://www.patriots.com/news/new-england-patriots-postgame-quotes-10-20\">agreed with the idea that his team was playing \u201csoft\u201d</a> after a Week 7 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Jets are 2-6, at the very bottom of the AFC East.</p> <p>Whatever\u2019s worse than the \u201csoft\u201d descriptor for an NFL team, and there aren\u2019t many more grievous insults to levy, that\u2019s where the Jets are now.</p> <p>Saleh was fired after a 2-3 start, which now seems like much happier times. Ulbrich\u2019s promotion to interim head coach has affected the defense, the team\u2019s strength, in profoundly negative ways. And Rodgers is going to run out of people <a href=\"https://x.com/NFLonCBS/status/1850616444880310378\">to be angry with</a> sooner rather than later.</p> <p>The fact is that Rodgers will be 41 in December, and it\u2019s starting to show. Even his opponents feel bad for him. \u201cHate to see him go out that way,\u201d said the Patriots\u2019 Davon Godchaux after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cHe definitely don\u2019t look the same. He kept moving back there \u2013 shit, I could run him down and catch him. He don\u2019t look mobile at all.\u201d</p> <p>Godchaux, it should be noted, is no Noah Lyles. He is a 330lb defensive tackle who ran a 5.27sec 40-yard dash at the combine in 2016. He\u2019s probably even slower now.</p> <p>Then again, Rodgers completed 17 of 28 passes for 233 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 111.2 in the Patriots loss, so it wasn\u2019t all on him. But the trade for Rodgers before the 2023 season, which was supposed to presage a Jets quarterback era that hasn\u2019t existed since Joe Namath\u2019s salad days in the late 1960s, has been a complete and utter wash. The last time Rodgers topped 300 passing yards in a game was in Week 13 of the 2021 season.</p> <p>That\u2019s a not-so-subtle reminder that even in his 2022 season, <a href=\"https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/lists/aaron-rodgers-new-york-jets-trade/\">Rodgers was no longer the quarterback he once had been</a>.</p> <p>The Jets took a serious chance on a declining quarterback with a capricious mind who is <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/aaron-rodgers-blames-media-jets-150128855.html\">quick to blame others for his problems</a>, and they caved into his desperate need for organizational control, bringing in players who <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/07/18/sports/randall-cobbs-next-job-revealed-after-jets-flop/\">were his friends</a> rather than assets and a (now former) offensive coordinator who was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38081850/sean-payton-rips-nathaniel-hackett-broncos-job-jabs-jets\">derided by his peers</a>. Now, they\u2019re paying the price with a lost season, and some serious questions to answer soon. Rodgers signed a revised <a href=\"https://overthecap.com/player/aaron-rodgers/1085\">three-year, $112.5m contract</a> with the Jets in 2023 that includes $75m in guarantees. If Rodgers is on the roster in 2025, he carries a salary cap hit of $23.5m, which isn\u2019t the <em>worst</em> thing in the world. But if Rodgers wants to be on the roster and the Jets disagree, the Jets would have to eat $49m in dead salary cap to absorb his absence.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/07/aaron-rodgers-darkness-retreat-dmt-nfl-future\">I\u2019ve been in the darkness</a>,\u201d said Rodgers after the game. \u201cYou have to go in there and make peace with it.\u201d</p> <p>The Jets should listen: it looks like they\u2019re going to be in there long after Rodgers has left the building.</p> <h2>MVP of the week</h2>    <p><strong>Jameis Winston, QB, Cleveland Browns. </strong>Let\u2019s start with this: Winston <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVzwIxQXoOQ\">defending Deshaun Watson as a person</a> pretty much tells you everything you need to know about him off the field. But it\u2019s tough to argue with the effect he had on the field after taking over from Watson. In a 29-24 win over the high-flying Ravens on Sunday, Winston completed 27 of 41 passes for 334 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 115.3.

      "bodyText": "The Aaron Rodgers era, which never really began in New York, is officially over. Last season after eight games, the New York Jets were 4-4 with Zach Wilson at quarterback, and a defense led by head coach Robert Saleh and defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich that at least kept the team in games, until everything fell apart during the second half, and the Jets finished 7-10. It was automatically assumed that when Aaron Rodgers, a four-time MVP and future Hall of Famer, returned from the torn achilles that cost him all but four snaps in 2023, things would be much better. Spoiler alert: Things are not much better. In fact, they\u2019re worse than they were under Wilson, a quarterback who rarely looked like he belonged in the NFL. After their 25-22 Sunday loss to a New England Patriots team whose own head coach, Jerod Mayo, agreed with the idea that his team was playing \u201csoft\u201d after a Week 7 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Jets are 2-6, at the very bottom of the AFC East. Whatever\u2019s worse than the \u201csoft\u201d descriptor for an NFL team, and there aren\u2019t many more grievous insults to levy, that\u2019s where the Jets are now. Saleh was fired after a 2-3 start, which now seems like much happier times. Ulbrich\u2019s promotion to interim head coach has affected the defense, the team\u2019s strength, in profoundly negative ways. And Rodgers is going to run out of people to be angry with sooner rather than later. The fact is that Rodgers will be 41 in December, and it\u2019s starting to show. Even his opponents feel bad for him. \u201cHate to see him go out that way,\u201d said the Patriots\u2019 Davon Godchaux after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cHe definitely don\u2019t look the same. He kept moving back there \u2013 shit, I could run him down and catch him. He don\u2019t look mobile at all.\u201d Godchaux, it should be noted, is no Noah Lyles. He is a 330lb defensive tackle who ran a 5.27sec 40-yard dash at the combine in 2016. He\u2019s probably even slower now. Then again, Rodgers completed 17 of 28 passes for 233 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 111.2 in the Patriots loss, so it wasn\u2019t all on him. But the trade for Rodgers before the 2023 season, which was supposed to presage a Jets quarterback era that hasn\u2019t existed since Joe Namath\u2019s salad days in the late 1960s, has been a complete and utter wash. The last time Rodgers topped 300 passing yards in a game was in Week 13 of the 2021 season. That\u2019s a not-so-subtle reminder that even in his 2022 season, Rodgers was no longer the quarterback he once had been. The Jets took a serious chance on a declining quarterback with a capricious mind who is quick to blame others for his problems, and they caved into his desperate need for organizational control, bringing in players who were his friends rather than assets and a (now former) offensive coordinator who was derided by his peers. Now, they\u2019re paying the price with a lost season, and some serious questions to answer soon. Rodgers signed a revised three-year, $112.5m contract with the Jets in 2023 that includes $75m in guarantees. If Rodgers is on the roster in 2025, he carries a salary cap hit of $23.5m, which isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world. But if Rodgers wants to be on the roster and the Jets disagree, the Jets would have to eat $49m in dead salary cap to absorb his absence. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the darkness,\u201d said Rodgers after the game. \u201cYou have to go in there and make peace with it.\u201d The Jets should listen: it looks like they\u2019re going to be in there long after Rodgers has left the building. MVP of the week Jameis Winston, QB, Cleveland Browns. Let\u2019s start with this: Winston defending Deshaun Watson as a person pretty much tells you everything you need to know about him off the field. But it\u2019s tough to argue with the effect he had on the field after taking over from Watson. In a 29-24 win over the high-flying Ravens on Sunday, Winston completed 27 of 41 passes for 334 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 115.3. Every time Lamar Jackson and the explosive Baltimore offense put points on the board, Winston was there for yet another ridiculous throw to keep things in check. His 23-yard touchdown pass to David Njoku in the third quarter was but one example. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Winston game without a few ups and downs. On the play before his game-winning touchdown pass to Cedric Tillman, Winston threw a pass in the general direction of receiver Elijah Moore that should have been intercepted by Ravens super-safety Kyle Hamilton, which would have effectively won the game for Baltimore. All in a day\u2019s work for the only quarterback in pro football history to throw at least 30 touchdowns and 30 interceptions in the same season. But there\u2019s no question that Winston gives the Browns more at quarterback than Watson ever could. Video of the week A rather easy decision. Sunday\u2019s game between the Washington Commanders and the Chicago Bears was between the first two picks in the 2024 draft \u2013 Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels. When Daniels was able to go despite the rib injury he suffered in Week 7, the hope was that the game would live up to the hype. It did.

From Week 4 through Week 7, Jared Goff performed at a level that matched some of the greatest quarterbacks in history. Goff became just the fourth quarterback in NFL annals with a passer rating of 140.0 or higher in three consecutive games (Detroit had a Week 5 bye). So, what are we to make of Detroit\u2019s 52-14 thrashing of the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, when Goff completed 12 of 15 passes for just 85 yards? Perhaps the Lions don\u2019t need their quarterback to be great or prolific to succeed, which is a frightening thought for the rest of the NFL.

Detroit beat the Chicago Bears 48-23 despite Hall of Fame quarterback Bobby Layne completing four of 16 passes for 84 yards. Layne had a viral infection and a temperature of 102 degrees, and was replaced by Tom Dublinski in the first half. Elsewhere around the league -- On Sunday, the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers played a tightly contested game for control of the NFC South that ended 31-26 in Atlanta\u2019s favor. But is that how it should have ended? With 7:27 left in the first half, Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins threw a pass to Kyle Pitts, who rumbled downfield for what may or may not have been a 49-yard touchdown.

The measure takes into account liabilities, including government debt, but also assets, including land, roads, railways, hospitals, schools, fire stations and military aircraft.</p> <p>It\u2019s a measure Reeves has explored. However, the Guardian has been told by a senior government source that she has picked a narrower measure: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/27/how-rachel-reeves-could-release-billions-more-for-investment-in-the-budget\">public sector net financial liabilities</a> (PSNFL), nicknamed \u201cpersnuffle\u201d. This accounts for financial assets, including student loans and company shares, but not physical ones.</p> <p>Still, the chancellor could set a supplementary net worth target with a view to focusing government attention on the benefits of investment. Treasury sources have said Reeves is keen to change the \u201cculture\u201d of the institution to do so.</p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s approach has similarities with Britain\u2019s position. The Wellington government, as London has over recent years, had been through a string of economic and fiscal crises before it moved to adopt a net worth target. But there are also differences. Rather than moving the goalposts to free up more room for investment spending, New Zealand\u2019s decision was taken to focus attention on reducing its national debt pile.</p> <p>Ian Ball, who was the architect of New Zealand\u2019s reforms during his time as a senior Treasury official, says the background is important. \u201cIt was a Labour government, but at the time I would think some of their reforms would be described as among the most rightwing in the world. New Zealand moved basically from being facetiously referred to as the Albania of the south Pacific to one of the most economically free countries in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/03/obr---fiscal-rules/giv-13425A544kBlLMGiA/\" data-alt=\"A chart showing the longevity of fiscal rules across the world economy\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/03/obr---fiscal-rules/giv-13425A544kBlLMGiA/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Successive governments had run budget deficits for decades in the hope of rescuing New Zealand from years of crises and recessions \u2013 including the loss of trade from the UK joining the EU common market in 1973, and oil price shocks.</p> <p>The government launched its fiscal rules in 1994 to signal to investors it was committed to sustainable public finances, as most advanced economies now do. But its rules were broad in nature, including a target to maintain \u201cprudent\u201d debt levels, alongside its net worth rule.</p> <p>Britain rarely records budget surpluses, having done so only five times since 1970, most recently in 2000-01. However, the UK economy is significantly larger than that of New Zealand. Still, London has tested its creditors recently; through Brexit, years of political instability, and Liz Truss\u2019s mini budget. Debt is near 100% of GDP, the highest level since the 1960s.</p> <p>Unlike in New Zealand, which has a net worth of <a href=\"https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/year-end/financial-statements-2024\">NZ$191bn</a> (\u00a388bn), about 46% of GDP, the UK\u2019s net worth is in deficit, by \u00a3731bn.</p> <p>The UK changes its fiscal rules faster than almost any other OECD country, with <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publication/strengthening-uk-fiscal-framework\">nine sets</a> since they were first introduced in the 1990s. The Tories replaced them seven times since 2010. Helped by their broad definition, New Zealand\u2019s have never changed.</p> <p>Debt as a share of New Zealand\u2019s economy fell from almost 50% in 1994 to 16% before the 2008 financial crisis. It has since risen but remains below 50%. The net worth target helped, says Ball, by focusing the attention of government departments to drive efficiencies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-4559Hqmmkm6UYiiu/\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-4559Hqmmkm6UYiiu/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cA really good understanding of what assets you\u2019ve got in the public sector is important, including how you generate revenue from them. In a lot of countries, governments own vast assets that are poorly utilised,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I read in the UK is there\u2019s a temptation to choose a fiscal rule that gives you more fiscal headroom. That was absolutely not the objective in New Zealand. It was to find a way to get the government finances to have less debt, not more.\u201d</p> <p>Labour sources suggest Reeves will not utilise the full headroom that changing the fiscal rules could unlock \u2013 a possible \u00a350bn or more under PSNFL. She has also spoken of the importance of \u201cguardrails\u201d to ensure borrowing is well spent, including beefing up the National Audit Office and a new Office for Value for Money.</p> <p>Part of the problem with the net worth approach is the difficulty in valuing certain assets, particularly ones without readily available market prices, including social infrastructure such as schools and hospitals, and military equipment.</p> <p>Ball says that as well as the right fiscal rules, wider changes are important to overcome this. New Zealand introduced more regular, detailed accounts, and brought in more private sector practices into its civil service.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-4559xiO8PVY47Yo1/\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-4559xiO8PVY47Yo1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Now a professor of public finance management at Victoria University in Wellington, Ball is a co-author of the book <em><a href=\"https://publicnetworth.com/\">Public Net Worth</a> </em>with other leading economists and accountants.

But only as part of wider reforms.</p> <p>\u201cIf they see enough being done, that the government is serious about fixing the problem [of high debt]. To me that\u2019s the test. Are they persuasive?

New Zealand moved basically from being facetiously referred to as the Albania of the south Pacific to one of the most economically free countries in the world.\u201d Successive governments had run budget deficits for decades in the hope of rescuing New Zealand from years of crises and recessions \u2013 including the loss of trade from the UK joining the EU common market in 1973, and oil price shocks. The government launched its fiscal rules in 1994 to signal to investors it was committed to sustainable public finances, as most advanced economies now do. But its rules were broad in nature, including a target to maintain \u201cprudent\u201d debt levels, alongside its net worth rule. Britain rarely records budget surpluses, having done so only five times since 1970, most recently in 2000-01. However, the UK economy is significantly larger than that of New Zealand. Still, London has tested its creditors recently; through Brexit, years of political instability, and Liz Truss\u2019s mini budget. Debt is near 100% of GDP, the highest level since the 1960s. Unlike in New Zealand, which has a net worth of NZ$191bn (\u00a388bn), about 46% of GDP, the UK\u2019s net worth is in deficit, by \u00a3731bn. The UK changes its fiscal rules faster than almost any other OECD country, with nine sets since they were first introduced in the 1990s. The Tories replaced them seven times since 2010. Helped by their broad definition, New Zealand\u2019s have never changed. Debt as a share of New Zealand\u2019s economy fell from almost 50% in 1994 to 16% before the 2008 financial crisis. It has since risen but remains below 50%. The net worth target helped, says Ball, by focusing the attention of government departments to drive efficiencies. \u201cA really good understanding of what assets you\u2019ve got in the public sector is important, including how you generate revenue from them. In a lot of countries, governments own vast assets that are poorly utilised,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I read in the UK is there\u2019s a temptation to choose a fiscal rule that gives you more fiscal headroom. That was absolutely not the objective in New Zealand. It was to find a way to get the government finances to have less debt, not more.\u201d Labour sources suggest Reeves will not utilise the full headroom that changing the fiscal rules could unlock \u2013 a possible \u00a350bn or more under PSNFL. She has also spoken of the importance of \u201cguardrails\u201d to ensure borrowing is well spent, including beefing up the National Audit Office and a new Office for Value for Money. Part of the problem with the net worth approach is the difficulty in valuing certain assets, particularly ones without readily available market prices, including social infrastructure such as schools and hospitals, and military equipment. Ball says that as well as the right fiscal rules, wider changes are important to overcome this. New Zealand introduced more regular, detailed accounts, and brought in more private sector practices into its civil service. Now a professor of public finance management at Victoria University in Wellington, Ball is a co-author of the book Public Net Worth with other leading economists and accountants. He thinks Britain has little to fear from the financial markets with a switch to a net worth target. But only as part of wider reforms. \u201cIf they see enough being done, that the government is serious about fixing the problem [of high debt]. To me that\u2019s the test. Are they persuasive? Are they serious about this?\u201d However, most economists believe Britain\u2019s big problem is not the level of debt, but finding ways within a tight fiscal position to overcome the consequences of years of chronic underinvestment. Earlier this summer the IMF wrote in its Article IV review of the UK: \u201cThe main fiscal policy challenge is how to address pressing service delivery and investment needs, including for the green transition, while assuredly stabilising debt in the medium term.\u201d Ball says there could still be lessons from New Zealand. \u201cWe still have a lot of assets which aren\u2019t used well. But at least we know what they are and have a way of tracking of them.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024. An earlier version of the top graph had an incorrect label which said that the y-axis showed UK public sector debt when in fact it showed % of GDP for different measures of public sector net debt.",

From that point on, however, every time I have voted things have gone smoothly. By mid-September this year, a thick envelope landed in my mailbox in Paris, containing the six-page ballot with little blank ovals waiting to be bubbled in with a pen. Not just the presidential race, but also for Senate and the House of Representatives, a host of state offices, a dozen or so races to elect various judges and, finally, state and local ballot initiatives.

      "bodyText": "The United States doesn\u2019t show much love to its citizens who live abroad. For instance, it was impossible for me to declare my driving licence lost and request a reprint because my home state of Ohio\u2019s state government website seems to frequently not work outside the US. And while a VPN provides a potential workaround, the steps to verify your identity require \u2026 a US phone number. No, the infamous citizenship-based taxation and financial reporting regime \u2013 meaning Americans worldwide have to report their accounts held in foreign financial institutions to the IRS \u2013 doesn\u2019t only affect wealthy tax cheats, it makes life difficult for plenty of normal people. And if you\u2019re fed up enough to want to ditch your US citizenship, well, I hope you\u2019ve got money to burn, because that will cost you a $2,350 administrative processing fee. The one thing that\u2019s always worked pretty well for me, though, is voting from a distance. Some states are more online than others, allowing you to email a request for an \u201cabsentee ballot\u201d, whereas Ohio makes me sign a paper form and send it in the mail. From that point on, however, every time I have voted things have gone smoothly. By mid-September this year, a thick envelope landed in my mailbox in Paris, containing the six-page ballot with little blank ovals waiting to be bubbled in with a pen. Not just the presidential race, but also for Senate and the House of Representatives, a host of state offices, a dozen or so races to elect various judges and, finally, state and local ballot initiatives. (If you\u2019re curious \u2013 yes, I voted to raise local taxes on alcohol and cigarettes to increase funding for Cleveland municipal schools.) This year, I\u2019ve felt a lot more love and attention than normal from my electioneering compatriots.

By the time we reach Nice the skies are still grey and I\u2019m starting to wonder how far south I\u2019ll have to go before I get some late-in-the-year sun. Of course, I\u2019m not the first Briton to flee damp, cold drizzle.</p> <p>Back in the autumn of 1820 a sickly John Keats took the same decision. In his case, however, the situation was more critical. His heartfelt line in Ode to a Nightingale, \u201cO for a beaker full of the warm South\u201d, written the previous year, had an edge of desperation. My own goal is Pompeii. That should be far enough, I reckon, to guarantee a warm sun. Not only that, but I have been drawn by recent stories of new discoveries at the ancient site. How much, I wonder, is that stalwart of the tourist circuit changing? An out-of-season visit seems like a good opportunity to see one of the world\u2019s tourist honey pots without the crowds, and feel the sun on my face.</p>    <p>Next morning, when I change trains at Genoa, the sun finally comes out. I\u2019m wishing I had planned a few stopovers in all the eye-catching places that I\u2019m speeding through: La&nbsp;Spezia (Cinque Terre villages), Pisa (the leaning tower is an easy walk from the station), and Tarquinia, with its Unesco world heritage status Etruscan tombs. When did air travel throw up such possibilities? When did you last hear someone say: \u201cIsn\u2019t Terminal 3 divine at this time of year. Let\u2019s linger\u201d? Surveys of travel trends, such as <a href=\"https://www.vrbo.com/magazine/travel-trends-unpack-25/jomo-travel/\">Vrbo\u2019s Unpack 25</a>, point to an increasing demand for slow travel \u2013 the type railways offer, with opportunities for diversion and digression.

No crowds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Procida is very much a living island, not some tourist-powered gentrification experiment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the train curls through Rome\u2019s outer suburbs, there is a definite feeling that I\u2019ve reached a warmer climate zone. I stay near Vatican City, and walk everywhere, including to the Spanish Steps where Keats took lodgings that he was destined never to leave. He had made it to the warm south, but too late. The bedroom is still there, unchanged except that when you look out of his window you see TikTok influencers doing silly dances on the steps. </p> <p>I take the train south to Naples on a&nbsp;Saturday, where I arrive in time to watch Napoli play Juventus on TV amid much excitement while eating pizza at a street cafe. On Sunday it seems half the city\u2019s inhabitants troop down to the port and head to the nearby islands, and I go too, hopping on a ferry to Procida (Ischia and Capri are other day-trip options). Procida is very much a living island, not some tourist-powered gentrification experiment.</p>    <p>The locals drive as hard and fast as Neapolitans, many heading for the waterfront restaurants where they tuck into seafood dishes, among them <em>spaghetti al pesto di limone</em> (the island\u2019s large sweet lemons are famous and appear in lots of dishes). The beaches have become equally famous through the films Il Postino and The Talented Mr Ripley, but they are not so special. It\u2019s the food, labyrinthine back streets and tumbles of colourful houses that count, many still occupied by fishers\u2019 families rather than Airbnb customers.</p> <p>When Keats came to Italy, Pompeii was a newly rediscovered site and archaeology had barely risen above the level of treasure-hunting. Tunnels were dug into the pumice and ash layers to retrieve valuables and cart them 15 miles back to Naples. Some excavations undoubtedly destroyed more than they found. The 20th century saw the site become a major tourist attraction and there was a sense of stasis: the story of Pompeii had been worked out and catalogued. The tourist circuit was soon equally well established: you caught the Circumvesuviana train from Napoli Centrale to Pompei Scavi. You took a guide. Someone in the group would ask to see the brothel; another would demand to see the bodies. You would do the House of the Faun, the Tragic Poet, and three or four more, then someone would sing in the theatre and everyone would ignore the old chap reminiscing about Pink Floyd playing the amphitheatre in 1972.</p>    <p>But something has changed. The current director, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, has shaken up the status quo. There have been new discoveries. I meet Alessandro Russo, one of the archaeologists. \u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting time to work here,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe have the artefacts from old excavations, but now we are digging new areas and getting the untouched context. That is helping us reinterpret the areas previously excavated.\u201d</p> <p>Alessandro takes me into zone \u201cRegio IX\u201d, where the team are shovelling pumice out of rooms before the more delicate work of uncovering the spectacular wall-paintings, the colours apparently as vivid as in AD79. A gantry overhead means that visitors can watch this happening. Alessandro points to a portrait of a young girl. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual painting, possibly of a real child.\u201d She gazes back at me, chubby arms full of fresh grapes, figs and pomegranates. Next to her is a hole in&nbsp;the wall, the place where an 18th-century explorer had smashed a&nbsp;tunnel through the tons of pumice and rubble, narrowly missing the unnoticed precious portrait.</p>    <p>Further inside the building, behind a plastic sheet, are the remains of a stable, the skeletons of six horses in the positions that they died. \u201cThis will probably be on show by the end of the year,\u201d says Alessandro. He leads me up&nbsp;on to the top layer of ash that still covers one-third of Pompeii. This is what hid the town for about 1,700 years, a greyish-white landscape dotted with scrub and trees.</p> <p>Down a&nbsp;ramp, however, we enter a newly uncovered house. \u201cIt\u2019s a bakery,\u201d says Alessandro, pointing out the oven and even a wall painting of what looks vaguely like a pizza. \u201cThey were actually doing construction work when Vesuvius erupted.\u201d Here there are still fallen roof timbers and piles of volcanic dust hiding, no doubt, further treasures, but around the corner is an exquisite blue room and a huge black-painted dining chamber.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Pompeii dominates the Neapolitan tourist scene so completely it\u2019s easy to forget there are other sites worth visiting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The sensation of being there at the moment of discovery is not entirely left to the archaeologists. One of Pompeii\u2019s best new developments is to&nbsp;allow visitors to sign up for a tour of&nbsp;the current archaeological work. At the moment it\u2019s the only way to view new treasures like that blue sacrarium.</p> <p>One other great treasure that should soon be back on view is the Alexander the Great mosaic. This four-million-tile depiction of Alexander\u2019s battle with the Persian king Darius III was found in the House of the Faun in 1831 and taken to Naples. Dated to around 100BC, it is now undergoing vital preservation work, but should be back on view in Naples\u2019s National Archaeological Museum next year.</p>    <p>Pompeii dominates the Neapolitan tourist scene so completely that it\u2019s easy to forget there are other sites worth visiting. Conveniently for me, still hungry for hotter sunshine, one of the best is an hour by direct train further south. Repeated recommendations from travellers had convinced me to go to Paestum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/apr/11/banquet-room-with-preserved-frescoes-unearthed-among-pompeii-ruins\">Banquet room with preserved frescoes unearthed among Pompeii ruins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the moment I step off the train, I\u2019m glad I listened. Paestum was founded by the Greeks in about 600BC and has three spectacular temples among other buildings. In the museum the real gem is the Tomb of the Diver: five painted panels from a tomb found outside the city in 1968, one of which depicts a youth diving from a great height into a river or the sea. Nothing similar has yet been found and archaeologists are not even sure which culture produced this masterpiece. Some regard it as a symbol of the dive into the unknown that death represents; others believe it may be a yet more complex allegory. But I know exactly what it means: it means the water wasn\u2019t too cold. And there is a sandy beach less than a mile away.

I take the train south to Naples on a Saturday, where I arrive in time to watch Napoli play Juventus on TV amid much excitement while eating pizza at a street cafe. On Sunday it seems half the city\u2019s inhabitants troop down to the port and head to the nearby islands, and I go too, hopping on a ferry to Procida (Ischia and Capri are other day-trip options). Procida is very much a living island, not some tourist-powered gentrification experiment. The locals drive as hard and fast as Neapolitans, many heading for the waterfront restaurants where they tuck into seafood dishes, among them spaghetti al pesto di limone (the island\u2019s large sweet lemons are famous and appear in lots of dishes). The beaches have become equally famous through the films Il Postino and The Talented Mr Ripley, but they are not so special. It\u2019s the food, labyrinthine back streets and tumbles of colourful houses that count, many still occupied by fishers\u2019 families rather than Airbnb customers. When Keats came to Italy, Pompeii was a newly rediscovered site and archaeology had barely risen above the level of treasure-hunting. Tunnels were dug into the pumice and ash layers to retrieve valuables and cart them 15 miles back to Naples. Some excavations undoubtedly destroyed more than they found. The 20th century saw the site become a major tourist attraction and there was a sense of stasis: the story of Pompeii had been worked out and catalogued. The tourist circuit was soon equally well established: you caught the Circumvesuviana train from Napoli Centrale to Pompei Scavi. You took a guide. Someone in the group would ask to see the brothel; another would demand to see the bodies. You would do the House of the Faun, the Tragic Poet, and three or four more, then someone would sing in the theatre and everyone would ignore the old chap reminiscing about Pink Floyd playing the amphitheatre in 1972. But something has changed. The current director, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, has shaken up the status quo. There have been new discoveries. I meet Alessandro Russo, one of the archaeologists. \u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting time to work here,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe have the artefacts from old excavations, but now we are digging new areas and getting the untouched context. That is helping us reinterpret the areas previously excavated.\u201d Alessandro takes me into zone \u201cRegio IX\u201d, where the team are shovelling pumice out of rooms before the more delicate work of uncovering the spectacular wall-paintings, the colours apparently as vivid as in AD79. A gantry overhead means that visitors can watch this happening. Alessandro points to a portrait of a young girl. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual painting, possibly of a real child.\u201d She gazes back at me, chubby arms full of fresh grapes, figs and pomegranates. Next to her is a hole in the wall, the place where an 18th-century explorer had smashed a tunnel through the tons of pumice and rubble, narrowly missing the unnoticed precious portrait. Further inside the building, behind a plastic sheet, are the remains of a stable, the skeletons of six horses in the positions that they died. \u201cThis will probably be on show by the end of the year,\u201d says Alessandro. He leads me up on to the top layer of ash that still covers one-third of Pompeii. This is what hid the town for about 1,700 years, a greyish-white landscape dotted with scrub and trees. Down a ramp, however, we enter a newly uncovered house. \u201cIt\u2019s a bakery,\u201d says Alessandro, pointing out the oven and even a wall painting of what looks vaguely like a pizza. \u201cThey were actually doing construction work when Vesuvius erupted.\u201d Here there are still fallen roof timbers and piles of volcanic dust hiding, no doubt, further treasures, but around the corner is an exquisite blue room and a huge black-painted dining chamber. The sensation of being there at the moment of discovery is not entirely left to the archaeologists. One of Pompeii\u2019s best new developments is to allow visitors to sign up for a tour of the current archaeological work. At the moment it\u2019s the only way to view new treasures like that blue sacrarium. One other great treasure that should soon be back on view is the Alexander the Great mosaic. This four-million-tile depiction of Alexander\u2019s battle with the Persian king Darius III was found in the House of the Faun in 1831 and taken to Naples. Dated to around 100BC, it is now undergoing vital preservation work, but should be back on view in Naples\u2019s National Archaeological Museum next year. Pompeii dominates the Neapolitan tourist scene so completely that it\u2019s easy to forget there are other sites worth visiting. Conveniently for me, still hungry for hotter sunshine, one of the best is an hour by direct train further south. Repeated recommendations from travellers had convinced me to go to Paestum. From the moment I step off the train, I\u2019m glad I listened. Paestum was founded by the Greeks in about 600BC and has three spectacular temples among other buildings. In the museum the real gem is the Tomb of the Diver: five painted panels from a tomb found outside the city in 1968, one of which depicts a youth diving from a great height into a river or the sea. Nothing similar has yet been found and archaeologists are not even sure which culture produced this masterpiece. Some regard it as a symbol of the dive into the unknown that death represents; others believe it may be a yet more complex allegory. But I know exactly what it means: it means the water wasn\u2019t too cold. And there is a sandy beach less than a mile away. I set off on the last leg of my journey to the sun. The trip was provided by Byway, which creates European rail trips. A 10-day journey to Italy starts at about \u00a3994pp. In Rome accommodation was provided by Vrbo (apartments from \u00a3145 a night) and the Cardo Roma hotel (doubles from \u00a3130). Pompeii admission is \u00a318. Get admission to many museums (including Pompeii), and travel to and from Naples, with the Campania Artecard 365, from \u00a335.

      "body": "<p>After his 92-year-old mother died in 2019, Stephen Payne decided it was time for a change. But having spent the previous six months at her home in Torquay, where he is from, and the 27 years before that living in Los Angeles, Payne, a 60-year-old photographer, wasn\u2019t sure where to go next. \u201cI was complaining too much about Trump while living in the US and it felt like it would be a struggle to get work in the UK with Brexit,\u201d he says. \u201cI woke up one morning and had an idea to buy a boat. I knew nothing at all about them but thought it would allow me to live cheaply and be free to move wherever I wanted. It was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d</p> <p>Payne bought his 11-metre, nine-tonne motorised boat in January 2020<strong>,</strong> and has lived on it full-time since, travelling solo across the Channel before making his way along the French coast and through the country\u2019s rivers to reach the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, the Italian coast and finally Malta. \u201cNo one ever says on their deathbed that they wish they hadn\u2019t travelled as much, since it\u2019s the best way to become a better person,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced new cultures, become more accepting of the ways people live, and I\u2019ve met fantastic people.\u201d</p> <p>Payne\u2019s experience hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing.

      "bodyText": "After his 92-year-old mother died in 2019, Stephen Payne decided it was time for a change. But having spent the previous six months at her home in Torquay, where he is from, and the 27 years before that living in Los Angeles, Payne, a 60-year-old photographer, wasn\u2019t sure where to go next. \u201cI was complaining too much about Trump while living in the US and it felt like it would be a struggle to get work in the UK with Brexit,\u201d he says. \u201cI woke up one morning and had an idea to buy a boat. I knew nothing at all about them but thought it would allow me to live cheaply and be free to move wherever I wanted. It was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d Payne bought his 11-metre, nine-tonne motorised boat in January 2020, and has lived on it full-time since, travelling solo across the Channel before making his way along the French coast and through the country\u2019s rivers to reach the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, the Italian coast and finally Malta. \u201cNo one ever says on their deathbed that they wish they hadn\u2019t travelled as much, since it\u2019s the best way to become a better person,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced new cultures, become more accepting of the ways people live, and I\u2019ve met fantastic people.\u201d Payne\u2019s experience hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing. After buying the boat, called Jaywalking the World, he taught himself how to operate it and was ready to take his maiden voyage when Covid hit and the world went into lockdown. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to move, so I found myself trapped in a marina in Bray, Berkshire, completely alone,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as we could leave, I moved it along the Thames to Chatham in Kent.\u201d Navigating the Hammersmith Bridge and commercial traffic on the Thames in central London was hair-raising, topped only by his Channel crossing in June 2021. \u201cMy friend, who is experienced with boats, was going to come with me, but then had to stay as he had a baby on the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI found myself navigating one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.

      "body": "<p>Good morning. The violent confrontation between Israel and Iran is still pretty novel, but the beats that govern it are already familiar: first an attack, then the delicate dance of assessing the damage, and then the wait to see how the other side will respond. After Israel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran\">launched airstrikes</a> on military targets in Iran on Saturday, that choreography is again well under way.</p> <p>On Sunday, satellite imagery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/israel-strikes-iran-air-defence-systems-energy-sites\">appeared to indicate</a> that the targets were air defence systems protecting oil and gas facilities, as well as military sites linked to Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme and production of ballistic missiles. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel had \u201chit hard Iran\u2019s defence capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed at us\u201d. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/iran-supreme-leader-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-israel-attack\">said that</a> \u201cthe evil committed by the Zionist regime [Israel] two nights ago should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated\u201d, and implied that the nature of any response would be left up to the military authorities.</p> <p>Khamenei\u2019s remarks have been interpreted as a sign that no immediate military response is planned. But they were also too opaque to allow any firm conclusions to be drawn \u2013 and even if Iran\u2019s response is delayed, it will still carry the risk of escalation should it eventually come. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of <a href=\"https://amwaj.media/\">Amwaj.media</a>, a news website covering Iran, about how the attack is being assessed in Tehran \u2013 and whether it increases the risk of all-out war. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Israel-Gaza war </strong></em>| Approximately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/israeli-strikes-gaza-ramat-hasharon-bus-stop-un-chief\">70 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes</a> in the past day, health officials in Gaza said, as Israel\u2019s renewed campaign in the north of the strip shows no sign of slowing despite the revival of ceasefire talks after a three-month-long hiatus.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Budget</strong></em> | Keir Starmer will promise to \u201cembrace the harsh light of fiscal reality\u201d on Monday as his chancellor prepares to unveil the budget on Wednesday. Rachel Reeves is expected to announce billions of pounds worth of tax rises, spending cuts, and higher borrowing to pay for a boost to capital spending.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Labour </strong></em>| Labour has suspended the whip from the MP Mike Amesbury after footage appeared to show him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/27/labour-mp-mike-amesbury-filmed-punching-man-to-the-ground-in-cheshire\">punching a man repeatedly</a>, the party said. Security camera footage appeared to show Amesbury hitting the man and knocking him to the floor before aiming six more blows at his head.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>ICC </strong></em>| The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court allegedly responded to a formal complaint of sexual misconduct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/oct/27/icc-prosecutor-karim-khan-allegedly-tried-suppress-sexual-misconduct-claims\">by trying to persuade the alleged victim to deny the claims</a>, the Guardian has been told by multiple staff at the court. Khan denied asking the woman to withdraw any allegations.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>US</strong></em> | <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/27/trump-madison-square-garden-rally\">Anger and vitriol took centre stage</a> at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden on Sunday night, as Donald Trump and a cabal of campaign surrogates held a rally marked by racist comments, coarse insults, and dangerous threats about immigrants. One speaker called Puerto Rico \u201can island of garbage\u201d, while another declared Kamala Harris \u201cthe antichrist\u201d.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018This will not be the last attack \u2013 it\u2019s become normalised\u2019</h2>    <p>There has been some ambiguity in how the strikes have been described within Iran, with state media downplaying the impact even as hardliners said the attacks breached Iran\u2019s red lines and demanded a swift response. Details of the damage which have not yet emerged could prove crucial, Shabani said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still processing the data that\u2019s available,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s necessary to any understanding of what happens next.\u201d And he questioned claims that Iran\u2019s missile programme <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/satellite-photos-show-israel-hit-iran-missile-fuel-mixing-facilities-researchers-2024-10-26/#:~:text=Eveleth%20said%20the%20Israeli%20strikes%20may%20have%20%22significantly%20hampered%20Iran%27s%20ability%20to%20mass%20produce%20missiles.%22\">has been severely set back</a>: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the evidence of that yet, and I don\u2019t think anyone does. But Iran has a very diverse range of missiles, and the idea they won\u2019t be able to produce them for years doesn\u2019t sound credible.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What message was Israel trying to send?</strong></p> <p>What does seem safe to conclude is that Israel\u2019s attack was calibrated, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-oil-nuclear-sites-biden-f5dd702de7d990dd1d00f665e1484dee\">reportedly under pressure from the US</a>, to avoid triggering an all-out war by stopping short of attacks on Iranian nuclear or oil sites.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/world/middleeast/israel-air-defenses-iran-energy-sites.html\">The New York Times reported</a> senior Israeli and Iranian officials saying the strikes hit air defence systems defending oil and petrochemical sites, a large gas field and a major port \u2013 leaving them vulnerable to future attack but still intact for now.

Shabani points to reports that four soldiers who were killed were members of the regular army, not the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), as an example of the risks.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Why might the soldiers\u2019 deaths be significant?</strong></p> <p>Iran has a highly unusual military structure, with <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/irans-revolutionary-guards\">two parallel armed forces</a>. The conventional military comprises about 420,000 personnel; the IRGC has about 185,000 standing troops, with another 600,000 said to be available for swift mobilisation.</p> <p>\u201cThe IRGC was established after the revolution in 1979 out of fear of a military coup,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cIt is not the most popular institution, because of claims of corruption and its role in clamping down on protest. But the army is the one national institution that has respect, because it is not political. And so the deaths of regular soldiers may make it easier to command support for a reaction.\u201d</p> <p>That is not to say that this course of events is guaranteed, he cautioned. \u201cBut it suggests how the threshold for a response can be lowered. A lot of the calculus is to do with saving face. And it is an example of the fact that it doesn\u2019t matter how precise your munitions and planning are if someone is in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What was Khamenei saying?</strong></p>    <p>The supreme leader\u2019s non-committal observation that the attack should \u201cneither be downplayed nor exaggerated\u201d is fairly typical of the man, Shabani said. \u201cKhamenei has always been very wary about taking clear decisions. He understands that to remain as supreme leader, you need to be a supreme follower, as well.\u201d While Khamenei is conservative, \u201che has always preferred to work with a reformist civilian administration.\u201d</p> <p>Until president Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/first-edition-iran-ebrahim-raisi\">death in a helicopter crash in May</a>, \u201cit was difficult for Khamenei \u2013 all of the branches of power were dominated by his camp, and there was often not a face-saving way out.\u201d That may be part of why he accepted reformist Masoud Pezeshkian as president after Raisi: \u201cif an opposing power centre holds some authority, if they have success, great \u2013 if they fail, it\u2019s \u2018I told you so\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Khamenei\u2019s stance is therefore unsurprising \u2013 but it is implausible to claim that the nature of a response is merely a tactical military matter. \u201cHe\u2019s the micromanager in chief,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cHe sounds like he\u2019s just an observer \u2013 but he\u2019s the commander in chief of the Iranian armed forces.\u201d</p> <p>Pezeshkian struck a similar note yesterday, saying that Iran would \u201cgive an appropriate response\u201d and that the country does not seek war.

He pointed to <a href=\"https://x.com/MazMHussain/status/1850290095967842437\">a post on X</a> from Murtaza Hussain of Drop Site News: \u201cThe modern western style of war is based on \u2018shock and awe\u2019 style operations with short timeframes. The opposing style is based on long attritional warfare. This is why Russia deemed prematurely to fail in Ukraine and Israeli wars in Gaza and Lebanon nowhere near a horizon.\u201d</p> <p>Iran may therefore not feel that speed is a necessary component of a significant response, which suggests that claims Khamenei has shown caution could be at best premature. \u201cPerhaps Iran will act faster this time,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t, we know that it can still take place.

There has been a flurry of nationalist messages on social media saluting the dead soldiers, but that doesn\u2019t mean that is what normal people think. But perhaps they are a little more ready for war than they were 48 hours ago.\u201d</p> <p>One frightening variable in assessing all of this is the danger that the significant damage to Iran\u2019s conventional defences may strengthen the hand of those in Tehran who make the case for building a nuclear weapon. That might take 18 months to complete, but any progress would be almost certain to trigger a more intense conflict, drawing in the United States. </p> <p>\u201cWeaponising the nuclear programme is the one game-changer at Iran\u2019s disposal,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cOf course Iran doesn\u2019t want war with the United States, but there will be those who question whether that is really still a choice, and who say that it is already paying the price for a bomb it hasn\u2019t built yet.\u201d</p> <p>Even short of that calamity, Shabani\u2019s prognosis is gloomy. \u201cThis will not be the last attack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s become normalised now. And when these things happen and people see that actually it doesn\u2019t lead to a cataclysm, you are on a slippery slope \u2013 that instead of waking up at war one morning through shock and awe, you slide into it by attrition.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. The violent confrontation between Israel and Iran is still pretty novel, but the beats that govern it are already familiar: first an attack, then the delicate dance of assessing the damage, and then the wait to see how the other side will respond. After Israel launched airstrikes on military targets in Iran on Saturday, that choreography is again well under way. On Sunday, satellite imagery appeared to indicate that the targets were air defence systems protecting oil and gas facilities, as well as military sites linked to Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme and production of ballistic missiles. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel had \u201chit hard Iran\u2019s defence capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed at us\u201d. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that \u201cthe evil committed by the Zionist regime [Israel] two nights ago should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated\u201d, and implied that the nature of any response would be left up to the military authorities. Khamenei\u2019s remarks have been interpreted as a sign that no immediate military response is planned. But they were also too opaque to allow any firm conclusions to be drawn \u2013 and even if Iran\u2019s response is delayed, it will still carry the risk of escalation should it eventually come. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of Amwaj.media, a news website covering Iran, about how the attack is being assessed in Tehran \u2013 and whether it increases the risk of all-out war. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Gaza war | Approximately 70 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes in the past day, health officials in Gaza said, as Israel\u2019s renewed campaign in the north of the strip shows no sign of slowing despite the revival of ceasefire talks after a three-month-long hiatus. Budget | Keir Starmer will promise to \u201cembrace the harsh light of fiscal reality\u201d on Monday as his chancellor prepares to unveil the budget on Wednesday. Rachel Reeves is expected to announce billions of pounds worth of tax rises, spending cuts, and higher borrowing to pay for a boost to capital spending. Labour | Labour has suspended the whip from the MP Mike Amesbury after footage appeared to show him punching a man repeatedly, the party said. Security camera footage appeared to show Amesbury hitting the man and knocking him to the floor before aiming six more blows at his head. ICC | The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court allegedly responded to a formal complaint of sexual misconduct by trying to persuade the alleged victim to deny the claims, the Guardian has been told by multiple staff at the court. Khan denied asking the woman to withdraw any allegations. US | Anger and vitriol took centre stage at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden on Sunday night, as Donald Trump and a cabal of campaign surrogates held a rally marked by racist comments, coarse insults, and dangerous threats about immigrants. One speaker called Puerto Rico \u201can island of garbage\u201d, while another declared Kamala Harris \u201cthe antichrist\u201d. In depth: \u2018This will not be the last attack \u2013 it\u2019s become normalised\u2019 There has been some ambiguity in how the strikes have been described within Iran, with state media downplaying the impact even as hardliners said the attacks breached Iran\u2019s red lines and demanded a swift response. Details of the damage which have not yet emerged could prove crucial, Shabani said. \u201cWe are still processing the data that\u2019s available,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s necessary to any understanding of what happens next.\u201d And he questioned claims that Iran\u2019s missile programme has been severely set back: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the evidence of that yet, and I don\u2019t think anyone does. But Iran has a very diverse range of missiles, and the idea they won\u2019t be able to produce them for years doesn\u2019t sound credible.\u201d *** What message was Israel trying to send? What does seem safe to conclude is that Israel\u2019s attack was calibrated, reportedly under pressure from the US, to avoid triggering an all-out war by stopping short of attacks on Iranian nuclear or oil sites. The New York Times reported senior Israeli and Iranian officials saying the strikes hit air defence systems defending oil and petrochemical sites, a large gas field and a major port \u2013 leaving them vulnerable to future attack but still intact for now. The attack might therefore be understood as scaled to give Iran a plausible off-ramp \u2013 but also a warning that the next wave could be far more devastating. But even if that was the aim, such an attack inevitably carries the danger of unintended consequences. Shabani points to reports that four soldiers who were killed were members of the regular army, not the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), as an example of the risks. *** Why might the soldiers\u2019 deaths be significant? Iran has a highly unusual military structure, with two parallel armed forces. The conventional military comprises about 420,000 personnel; the IRGC has about 185,000 standing troops, with another 600,000 said to be available for swift mobilisation. \u201cThe IRGC was established after the revolution in 1979 out of fear of a military coup,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cIt is not the most popular institution, because of claims of corruption and its role in clamping down on protest. But the army is the one national institution that has respect, because it is not political. And so the deaths of regular soldiers may make it easier to command support for a reaction.\u201d That is not to say that this course of events is guaranteed, he cautioned. \u201cBut it suggests how the threshold for a response can be lowered. A lot of the calculus is to do with saving face. And it is an example of the fact that it doesn\u2019t matter how precise your munitions and planning are if someone is in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d *** What was Khamenei saying? The supreme leader\u2019s non-committal observation that the attack should \u201cneither be downplayed nor exaggerated\u201d is fairly typical of the man, Shabani said. \u201cKhamenei has always been very wary about taking clear decisions. He understands that to remain as supreme leader, you need to be a supreme follower, as well.\u201d While Khamenei is conservative, \u201che has always preferred to work with a reformist civilian administration.\u201d Until president Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s death in a helicopter crash in May, \u201cit was difficult for Khamenei \u2013 all of the branches of power were dominated by his camp, and there was often not a face-saving way out.\u201d That may be part of why he accepted reformist Masoud Pezeshkian as president after Raisi: \u201cif an opposing power centre holds some authority, if they have success, great \u2013 if they fail, it\u2019s \u2018I told you so\u2019.\u201d Khamenei\u2019s stance is therefore unsurprising \u2013 but it is implausible to claim that the nature of a response is merely a tactical military matter. \u201cHe\u2019s the micromanager in chief,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cHe sounds like he\u2019s just an observer \u2013 but he\u2019s the commander in chief of the Iranian armed forces.\u201d Pezeshkian struck a similar note yesterday, saying that Iran would \u201cgive an appropriate response\u201d and that the country does not seek war.

Today in Focus The child skincare boom The Guardian\u2019s resident beauty columnist Sali Hughes charts a growing skincare obsession among children and teenagers, and how it\u2019s being exploited by big brands Cartoon of the day | Edith Pritchett The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad In the months after his 92-year-old mother\u2019s death, Stephen Payne realised that it was time for a big change. Done with life in Los Angeles and not wanting to return to the UK, Payne decided to go with his gut and travel, so he bought a boat and set sail. The pandemic complicated his plans initially, as boats could not move, but he figured it out. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to learn new things as it teaches you a lot about yourself in the process,\u201d he says. \u201cI realised I can keep calm and stay the course no matter what is happening around me.\u201d Once he got moving, he travelled across the Channel before making his way along the French coast and through the country\u2019s rivers to reach the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, Italian coast and finally Malta. It has been liberating for Payne to be able to change his plans when he wants and not think of the future beyond where to drop anchor for the night. \u201cAll I can say is that right now, this feels like the best kind of life for me and one I\u2019m very glad I embarked on,\u201d he says. Bored at work? And finally, the Guardian\u2019s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day. Until tomorrow. Quick crossword Cryptic crossword Wordiply",

Which flights do politicians get access to? All federal politicians have access to taxpayer-funded travel, including flights, for their parliamentary and political business. This includes flying to and from Canberra for sitting weeks, around their electorates for local business, or across the country to attend meetings and conduct ministerial duties.

Who gets chairman\u2019s lounge access? Nearly all politicians across the parliament \u2013 including Albanese, Bandt and Dutton \u2013 have declared accepting chairman\u2019s lounge and Beyond club memberships on their registers, with a few notable exceptions. According to the declarations on their registers, Labor\u2019s Tony Sheldon, Greens politicians including Max Chandler-Mather, Stephen Bates and Barbara Pocock, independents David Pocock and Monique Ryan, and Liberals Melissa McIntosh and Michaelia Cash do not have access. The perks are also enjoyed by senior government officials and public servants, including Department of Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet secretary, Glyn Davis; Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy; home affairs secretary, Stephanie Foster; Australian Border Force commissioner, Michael Outram; the Australian Tax Office commissioner, Rob Heferen; and secretaries and senior executives at numerous other departments, according to gift registers maintained online. Disclosure rules for those public servants were updated last year, amid intense speculation over the influence Qantas wields through access to the chairman\u2019s lounge.

Zoe\u2019s Place, a charity that cares for children with life-limiting conditions from birth to the age of five, announced that it had just weeks to raise the \u00a35m needed to fund a new building, with the lease on its current site set to expire. People in the city, many of whom have had family members or friends cared for by the centre, have thrown themselves into collective fundraising efforts which have already resulted in half of the total amount needed being donated in a matter of weeks. Supporters have taken on physical challenges such as walks and runs, and social media pledges in efforts to save the charity. Their support has been matched by pledges from local celebrities including former Liverpool FC footballers Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher, and actor Claire Sweeney. Liverpool football fans held up a \u201cSave Zoe\u2019s Place\u201d banner at Anfield before the club\u2019s game against Chelsea on Sunday, after raising \u00a3150,000 for the hospice. \u201cThe support has been astonishing,\u201d said Summa Gill from the charity. \u201cBecause [Liverpool is] a big place and because it\u2019s such a loyal and committed and compassionate city, we are just absolutely blown away by the support we\u2019ve seen.

      "bodyText": "Pubs and restaurants are warning of closures and a tough Christmas ahead if Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget this week raises taxes and ends a Covid-era relief on business rates. Reeves is expected to reveal a tax-raising budget on Wednesday, to pay for improved public services, with Labour sources indicating the government is intending to raise taxes and cut spending by a combined \u00a340bn. Businesses across the economy are bracing for higher taxes, which could dent consumer spending. However, hospitality businesses are particularly worried because of the scheduled end next spring of the business rates relief, which could mean the tax bills charged on their properties will quadruple. Rates relief was introduced in 2020 for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes when the government ordered all hospitality to close during the Covid-19 pandemic. Reeves\u2019s Conservative predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, last extended the business rates relief in November. The relief offers a 75% discount, capped at \u00a3110,000, until 1 April. The British Beer and Pub Association, the British Institute of Innkeeping and UKHospitality issued a joint call on Monday for Reeves to effectively make the relief permanent for hospitality businesses. The lobby groups said a new survey by NielsenIQ showed that 54% of the companies surveyed said they would reduce their employment levels, and 51% said they would cancel planned investment, if full business rates were reintroduced. More than a quarter of the businesses surveyed said they would close at least one site if their rates bills returned to pre-pandemic levels. In a joint statement, the lobby groups said: \u201cMany cash-strapped pubs, brewers, bars, restaurants and cafes, to name a few, would simply be unable to survive their rates bills quadrupling. \u201cNot only does inaction risk half of businesses having to cut jobs and cancel investment, but it also means a quarter would have to consider closing at least one site, which might be their entire business.\u201d A higher business rates bill could come with consumer spending still struggling. UK consumer confidence fell this month, according to the long-running GfK consumer confidence survey. Some analysts have warned of a \u201cvibecession\u201d that could mean spending falls even as the economy holds up relatively well. Tax-raising measures on consumers are expected to include a \u201cstealth\u201d freeze on income tax thresholds that would raise revenues while leaving headline rates the same. Some economists also believe that employers could limit pay rises in response to widely expected higher employer national insurance contributions. The accountancy firm RSM UK said 42% of UK consumers will spend less on Christmas this year if tax rises affect incomes in the budget, according to a survey of 2,000 people. Saxon Moseley, partner and head of leisure and hospitality at RSM UK, said: \u201cDespite real wages increasing, if tax changes impact consumer confidence then the hospitality industry may well see a spending hit over the all-important festive period.\u201d",

Perhaps, instead, we can talk of confrontation. Perhaps we can talk about how, over the past couple of weeks, Israel\u2019s campaign in northern Gaza has confronted the world with what has become increasingly difficult to deny: ethnic cleansing is upon the residents of Gaza. Civilians, including children, are being killed in ways that can only suggest an indiscriminate assault to eliminate Palestinians, or scare them into moving en masse from ever-expanding zones of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/oct/24/palestinians-scramble-for-bread-as-gazas-humanitarian-crisis-worsens-video-report\">death and starvation</a>. \u201cThe entire population of northern Gaza,\u201d said the UN\u2019s acting humanitarian chief on Saturday, \u201cis at risk of dying.\u201d</p> <p>Where are they to go?

Within earshot of artillery and gunfire, Israelis gathered to decide what to do with Gaza and those who live in it once the war is over. One young woman suggested: \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/YasmeenSerhan/status/1848683215805931709\">We should kill them</a>, every one of them.\u201d Israel\u2019s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was a little more reasonable. \u201cWe will encourage voluntary transfer of all Gazan citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will offer them the opportunity to move to other countries because that land belongs to us.\u201d</p> <p>What does such \u201cencouragement\u201d look like?

I recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/07/living-nightmare-palestine-peace-stability\">visited several cities</a> in the West Bank, and it was obvious how much the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements was secured by giving Palestinians no choice but to move \u2013 through intimidation, suffocating economic activity by sealing off market areas and populating them with checkpoints and soldiers, and the bureaucratic chicanery that licenses house demolitions and shop closures. The Palestinian city of Hebron is getting higher and denser, as people build apartments to relocate from the old historic area whose population is being thinned out, \u201cvoluntarily\u201d, through measures that make the area unliveable. The Palestinians who remain find themselves locked into confrontations with settlers and soldiers, then branded security risks and killed for defying the plan.</p> <p>There is a loud echo of this in Gaza. Prof Uzi Rabi, the head of the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University, said in a radio interview in September that he hopes there would be a removal of \u201cthe entire civilian population from the north, and those who remain there will be lawfully sentenced as terrorists and subjected to a <a href=\"https://www.972mag.com/northern-gaza-liquidation-scenario-eiland-rabi/\">process of starvation or extermination</a>\u201d. This is in keeping with the so-called generals\u2019 plan, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hamas-israel-generals-plan-eiland-gaza-219d7eb9a3050e281ccc032d5a56263c\">proposal</a> to the Israeli government in early October by a number of retired generals, advocating giving Palestinians a few days to leave northern Gaza, then declaring it a military zone and killing and starving those who remain.</p> <p>There is something paralysing about this new, blatant, even celebratory phase of the war.

      "bodyText": "More than a year into Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, it is hard to talk of \u201cescalation\u201d. Because to isolate single moments of military escalation, such as Israel\u2019s attack on Iran on Saturday, seems to suggest that otherwise, what is taking place in Gaza is normal or acceptable. Perhaps, instead, we can talk of confrontation. Perhaps we can talk about how, over the past couple of weeks, Israel\u2019s campaign in northern Gaza has confronted the world with what has become increasingly difficult to deny: ethnic cleansing is upon the residents of Gaza. Civilians, including children, are being killed in ways that can only suggest an indiscriminate assault to eliminate Palestinians, or scare them into moving en masse from ever-expanding zones of death and starvation. \u201cThe entire population of northern Gaza,\u201d said the UN\u2019s acting humanitarian chief on Saturday, \u201cis at risk of dying.\u201d Where are they to go? Well, we also have an answer to this question. Earlier this month, a conference called Preparing to Resettle Gaza, attended by hundreds of people, was held outside the Gaza Strip. Within earshot of artillery and gunfire, Israelis gathered to decide what to do with Gaza and those who live in it once the war is over. One young woman suggested: \u201cWe should kill them, every one of them.\u201d Israel\u2019s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was a little more reasonable. \u201cWe will encourage voluntary transfer of all Gazan citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will offer them the opportunity to move to other countries because that land belongs to us.\u201d What does such \u201cencouragement\u201d look like? Based on the events of the past year, it is safe to say it does not involve reason and persuasion. What encouragement looks like is the \u201crelentless\u201d airstrikes on northern Gaza, as the UN has described the latest phase of the assault. The burning alive of patients in hospital beds, as happened to Sha\u2019ban al-Dalou, with an IV line still connected to his arm. The targeting of children with drones, and then \u201cdouble tapping\u201d: sending a secondary strike to hit those who gathered around to help. The creation of conditions of starvation by blocking supplies. The ordering of medical and civil defence teams to leave Jabalia refugee camp. And designating several Al Jazeera reporters still working in the area as \u201cterrorists\u201d. These are extreme strategies but broadly in keeping with an approach, practised across the occupied territories, of forcing the \u201cvoluntary\u201d movement of Palestinians by scorching the earth on which they live. I recently visited several cities in the West Bank, and it was obvious how much the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements was secured by giving Palestinians no choice but to move \u2013 through intimidation, suffocating economic activity by sealing off market areas and populating them with checkpoints and soldiers, and the bureaucratic chicanery that licenses house demolitions and shop closures. The Palestinian city of Hebron is getting higher and denser, as people build apartments to relocate from the old historic area whose population is being thinned out, \u201cvoluntarily\u201d, through measures that make the area unliveable. The Palestinians who remain find themselves locked into confrontations with settlers and soldiers, then branded security risks and killed for defying the plan. There is a loud echo of this in Gaza. Prof Uzi Rabi, the head of the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University, said in a radio interview in September that he hopes there would be a removal of \u201cthe entire civilian population from the north, and those who remain there will be lawfully sentenced as terrorists and subjected to a process of starvation or extermination\u201d. This is in keeping with the so-called generals\u2019 plan, a proposal to the Israeli government in early October by a number of retired generals, advocating giving Palestinians a few days to leave northern Gaza, then declaring it a military zone and killing and starving those who remain. There is something paralysing about this new, blatant, even celebratory phase of the war. Something stunning in its unfathomable cruelty, which the rest of the world must swallow every morning. All the discursive and legalistic wins from the past year, all the protests and outcry and condemnations from international organisations, count for nothing if where we have ended up is a place where Palestinian children now carry their injured siblings for hours. Yet still it cannot, no, will not be stopped. What Israel is confronting the world with now is not the knowledge that the system is broken, but that it is working precisely as designed. And that design is one where the self-interested calculations of the imperial powers and their allies are all that matters. Palestinians sit in the crosshairs not only of Israel, but of Arab regimes stabilised by their closeness with a US that demands quiescence when it comes to Israel\u2019s actions.

Do you want a fuller belly or no more dead Palestinians? What a choice. We are catapulted back into history, where only might is right, and our votes and voices turn to dust. If the mangled bodies of babies have not moved a hair on Harris\u2019s head, then what difference does it make if one votes for her or not, if one votes at all? How can one rationalise the unfolding erasure of a people in plain sight, find some way to incorporate it into a political logic where their suffering under another Democratic administration is still the lesser of two evils?

And that\u2019s not where the comparisons end \u2013 like dual-sport international Perry, Bray also excels in a second game \u2013 she is currently also a goalkeeper for the Young Matildas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/25/wbbl-womens-big-bash-league-t20-season-2024-start-date-revamp\">Less is more: WBBL season starts amid revamp to keep T20 league on top of the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Bray told the Seven Network of her debut. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting for it to go that well. It literally is a dream come true. She [Perry] gave me my cap before the game and I was crying a little bit, maybe more than a little bit.</p> <p>\u201cPerry is such a big player. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m at that level, but obviously love people saying, \u2018oh, you\u2019re like Ellyse<strong> </strong>Perry? She\u2019s definitely a big role model of mine.\u201d</p> <p>But like Perry, if she continues to excel at both sports, she may have to make a tough choice before too long. By the age of 16, Perry had featured for both the Australian national cricket and football teams and was eventually forced to pick one sport to focus on.

      "bodyText": "In an alternative world, Caoimhe Bray would have been doing as most other year 9 students would on a Sunday night: finishing off some homework, perhaps, or preparing for the week ahead at school. But Bray, who only turned 15 last month, is different and her studies were the last thing on her mind in Adelaide as she capped a sensational WBBL debut by hitting the winning runs for the Sydney Sixers. With six balls to spare against the Melbourne Renegades, the latest rising star of women\u2019s cricket defied her tender years with a meaty shot that flew over cover to secure a three-wicket win in the Sixers\u2019 opening game of the new season \u2013 after earlier taking the Adelaide Oval to become the youngest player to feature in the WBBL. Before the game, an emotional Bray was handed her cap by her idol and now teammate, Ellyse Perry, who herself shot to prominence as an all-rounder at a young age. And that\u2019s not where the comparisons end \u2013 like dual-sport international Perry, Bray also excels in a second game \u2013 she is currently also a goalkeeper for the Young Matildas. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Bray told the Seven Network of her debut. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting for it to go that well. It literally is a dream come true. She [Perry] gave me my cap before the game and I was crying a little bit, maybe more than a little bit. \u201cPerry is such a big player. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m at that level, but obviously love people saying, \u2018oh, you\u2019re like Ellyse Perry? She\u2019s definitely a big role model of mine.\u201d But like Perry, if she continues to excel at both sports, she may have to make a tough choice before too long. By the age of 16, Perry had featured for both the Australian national cricket and football teams and was eventually forced to pick one sport to focus on. In 2015 she opted to invest all her energies in cricket and call time on her football career. It is a crossroads Bray knows she will also reach at some point in the future. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a bit easier when soccer and cricket are in different seasons, but some teams are in the same season, so it gets a bit hard there,\u201d Bray said. \u201cBut it is still working, still playing both. And I\u2019ll try to do that for as long as I can. \u201cI still don\u2019t know which one I will choose, but I know that will eventually have to come around, but hopefully not too soon.\u201d For now, Bray will continue to juggle the two sports and her education, all while living away from her home in Newcastle; she will stay temporarily in Sydney while playing for the Sixers, with her school supporting the move by facilitating online learning for the remainder of the year. \u201cThe school posts a bit, whenever I make a team or something,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they\u2019re pretty good with that. And I feel my friends, they don\u2019t really understand cricket, but they\u2019re like, \u2018good job\u2019.\u201d It was Perry who laid the groundwork for Bray\u2019s match-winning feat on Sunday \u2013 the 33-year-old hit 81 from 38 balls to set up the chance for victory and the third-highest run chase in WBBL history.

Now two British academics \u2013 who are magicians themselves \u2013 have written what is believed to be the first detailed study examining what is known in the trade as \u201cexposure\u201d. Gustav Kuhn and Brian Rappert, academics from the universities of Plymouth and Exeter, asked hundreds of magicians from around the world about attitudes to exposure. They found that exposing another magician\u2019s trick when they are still alive was a big no-no, with fewer than 3% feeling this was acceptable. However, it was deemed much more justifiable to expose a trick invented by a magician who was dead or to explain how an illusion you had developed yourself was done. It was seen as wrong to reveal a trick for self-promotion and, while many thought it reasonable to pass on the secrets of a trick to a fellow magician, it was much less acceptable to draw back the curtain to someone who just wanted to know how it was done for the sake of it. Rappert and Kuhn, both members of the Magic Circle, are readying themselves for flak when their paper is published on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge, really controversial topic within the magic community,\u201d said Kuhn, of the school of psychology at the University of Plymouth and an exponent of closeup and street magic. \u201cMagicians get emotional about it.\u201d As in most aspects of modern life, money appears to come into it.

Investor-entrepreneur Tim Ferriss calls stoicism the \u201cideal operating system\u201d, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/30/elizabeth-holmes-enters-prison-11-year-sentence\">entrepreneur-fraudster</a> Elizabeth Holmes constantly cited Marcus Aurelius\u2019s Meditations, before her imprisonment. Sports stars from James McGee (Irish tennis pro) to Garrett Gilkey (NFL lineman) can quote from Holiday\u2019s The Obstacle Is the Way, while celebs from Arnold Schwarzenegger to LL Cool J hat-tip Holiday in interviews.</p> <p>The ancient philosophy of stoicism centres on four virtues: courage, temperance, justice and wisdom. Marshalling these will give you complete self-control, enabling you to react with equanimity to all outside stimuli, and not whine about stuff (giving us our modern, shorthand definition of stoicism, \u201cuncomplaining\u201d). Material wealth should mean nothing to the stoic, which makes it ironic that some of the richest people on Earth claim to live by stoicism.</p> <p>The wild popularity of of the philosophy as a way to live is showing no sign of ebbing. Holiday\u2019s various books (of which there are roughly a gazillion) have sold at least 5m copies. The Daily Stoic, Holiday\u2019s brand, which spans a website, newsletter, podcast and Instagram account, has 3 million followers.</p> <p>It was in 2019 that he hit No 1 in the New York Times bestseller list with his book Stillness Is the Key. This was actually his fourth foray into stoicism as a code to live by: in 2014, he had published The Obstacle Is the Way; then in 2016 Ego Is the Enemy and The Daily Stoic.</p> <p>When The Obstacle Is the Way came out, \u201cit sold maybe 3,000 copies in its first week\u201d, says Holiday. \u201cIt did not exceed anyone\u2019s expectations ... It wasn\u2019t until a year or so later that the sales really started to take off, when it began to make its way through professional sports.\u201d Whole teams \u2013 Miami Heat (basketball), Seattle Seahawks (American football) \u2013 adopted his books as bibles, \u201cand I found this to be true in every country, in sports that I honestly didn\u2019t even know existed\u201d.</p> <p>From there he got on to CEO reading lists (Twitter founder Jack Dorsey swears by stoicism, as do venture capitalist Brad Feld and the former chief executive of GoDaddy Blake Irving). Holiday is a bit riled at the criticism, which I don\u2019t put to him, but has been made many times before: that it\u2019s a bit rich, some might say nauseating, to listen to men who have more wealth than they could possibly spend pontificate about self-denial (ice-baths and whatnot); men who hoard material goods and drive gaping inequality bang on about their passion for justice and the Good Life. On his popularity in Silicon Valley, Holiday says, with equanimity, \u201cI\u2019ve always been curious about why that\u2019s a bad thing. What else would you want them to be studying, other than a philosophy built around virtue? You could argue that they\u2019re missing the point, or they\u2019re picking and choosing what they take from it. But there are much darker rabbit holes that people have chosen to go down.\u201d</p> <p>Unmistakably, the stoics would hate this era \u2013 hysteria and volatility everywhere you look. So why have so many people been drawn to the ancient philosophy? \u201cThere\u2019s a Flaubert quote,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cHe says that between Cicero and Marcus Aurelius, after the gods had ceased to be and Christ had not yet come, man stood alone in the universe. He\u2019s totally wrong, as far as the timing goes, because Jesus and Cicero were roughly the same time period. But this idea of standing alone in the universe: this is the heyday of stoicism.\u201d</p> <p>Holiday is an unbelievably charming speaker, and it\u2019s something in the contrasts and reversals of expectation; he looks incredibly clean cut and quite serious minded, but he\u2019s happy to take a drive-by at Flaubert, or anyone else (Zeno, founder of the stoics, \u201ca total failure of a merchant\u201d; Chrysippus, the unserious stoic, \u201cliterally died of laughter\u201d) and it\u2019s always counterbalanced with a wry self-criticism. If you imagine Tom Cruise in Magnolia \u2013 that messianic zeal and self-assurance \u2013 but then give the character a sense of humour about <em>himself</em>, you\u2019re approaching Holiday\u2019s appeal. He\u2019s not so much charismatic as just very surprising.</p> <p>Anyway, back to our era: \u201cWhen the old understanding of the universe had not given way to the Christian understanding, where was a person to turn for meaning and purpose and structure? A way of living? Stoic philosophy, and indeed all the schools of ancient philosophy, cynicism and Epicureanism, this was a heyday of philosophy as a sort of civic religion.\u201d</p> <p>OK, fine, who am I to argue? \u201cI think you could argue that we stand alone in the universe again,\u201d he continues. \u201cPeople are increasingly not religious. People have lost faith in institutions, a lot of old ideas or explanations that people drew structure and comfort from have fallen away. How should a person live? What is the code by which you\u2019re supposed to be a good person? I think the ancient traditions are some of the best answers that man has come up with.\u201d</p> <p>Which is all completely fine: except don\u2019t people always say that? Aren\u2019t we always saying that the old world has died and the new one is struggling to be born? But this thought only occurs to me after I\u2019ve left the Zoom (Holiday is talking to me from Austin, Texas); in the moment, Ryan Holiday completely deactivated my bullshit-sensors, and for millions of people, he can even do that on the page.</p>    <p>The 37-year-old grew up in Sacramento, California \u201ca sleepy, government town\u201d. He had a straight upbringing \u2013 his father was a police detective, his mother a high school principal. I ask if the lack of adversity is a bit of a disappointment to him: in his writing, heroism is framed, defined by the hardscrabble childhood, the stoic who grew up blind, or orphaned, or bitten by beasts or whatever. No, he chastises me (but <em>so charmingly) </em>\u201cbecause that seems kind-of offensive to the people who did have hard upbringings\u201d. He continues: \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone whose childhood was easy to them. Even if on the sociological level it was privileged, everyone\u2019s childhood is rough. When I talk about Demosthenes, I relate to it in the sense that I feel like we all know what it means to not have the life you wanted, or not have things go your way. I had two parents that stayed together, that had good jobs, I never really wanted for anything other than maybe some semblance of understanding and support about who I was as a person. We all want Daddy to be proud of us at some level.\u201d</p> <p>Holiday dropped out of college without graduating, which troubled his parents greatly, not because they had any particular ambition for him, but because they couldn\u2019t imagine life off the school-college-job conveyor belt. \u201cAs a maverick or as a rule breaker, I\u2019m pretty tame,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is like the most milquetoast rebellion of all time, to become a writer of ancient philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>In the first instance, though, he dropped out because opportunities were coming at him. He was offered work by the immensely popular author Robert Greene, as well as getting a job as an assistant at a big talent agency in Beverly Hills. All that, when he was only 19. For years, \u201cI was this wunderkind. I was always the youngest specialist person in the room. Now that I have kids, and my hair is starting to go grey, I feel like I\u2019m finally just being treated as a regular person.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve no way of proving this, but he\u2019s hardly a nepo baby: I\u2019m pretty sure his early success was because he\u2019s so likable. It\u2019s an almost comically unstoical trait.</p> <p>From Beverly Hills, he found more (very early) success as director of marketing at American Apparel, the buzzy, values-driven brand that turned out to be run by a serial sexual harasser, Dov Charney. Drawing lessons from that time, Holiday remembers, \u201cDov Charney had to do so many things that were totally insane, right? Like, I\u2019m going to make clothes in America, I\u2019m going to pay workers a fair wage, I\u2019m not going to have branding on them, I\u2019m going to run my own stores. Every one of those things is a bad idea. But it works.</p> <p>\u201cAn entrepreneur, by definition, succeeds by not listening to all the people who told him that it wasn\u2019t going to work. But then you learn this incredibly dangerous lesson, which is, don\u2019t listen to other people when they tell you something is a bad idea. It sows the seeds of your destruction.\u201d This, he says, is a \u201ctimeless historical archetype\u201d. I nod. And then, later, realise; that is <em>total rubbish</em>. You don\u2019t learn not to be a sex pest by listening to your executive board; you don\u2019t unlearn it by selling too many T-shirts. There are worlds of human values really not covered by the commercial experience.</p> <p>It was around the time he was at American Apparel, in his early-to-mid 20s, that Holiday started writing The Obstacle Is the Way, and even though I read the edition that he\u2019s recently revised, it still reads like a young man enamoured of the Great (business)Man theory of history. It\u2019s a compendium of people who don\u2019t listen to experts and, as a result, win big. When the markets are telling you one thing, do the opposite; when doctors tell you you\u2019ll never walk again, just keep on trying to walk.</p> <p>Rockefeller is the first and probably most jarring example, held up as a role model for overcoming adversity, but really, the only adversity he overcame is that he didn\u2019t start off with all the money in the world, and yet that\u2019s what he ended up with. I can\u2019t help but wonder if, when Marcus Aurelius asked: \u201cDoes what happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness?\u201d, this is what he had in mind. \u201cI was just trying to highlight a specific personality trait,\u201d Holiday says. In Rockefeller\u2019s case, this was an indefatigable can-do attitude.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>His attitudes to stoicism have changed, which is something of a relief to hear, given that all his books seem to say completely different things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Holiday says he has changed a lot since those early days as an author, though his heroes haven\u2019t changed; the revised Obstacles still lauds the former US president Ulysses S Grant for not running away when things exploded (his fables seem to me to be the optimism bias of the histories that get told by people who remain alive; there must have been plenty of other civil war heroes whose stories would have ended better if they had moved away from explosives a bit faster: to take as a wild example, Abraham Lincoln). I\u2019ve missed the point, Holiday says (again, so nicely). \u201cIt\u2019s not Grant\u2019s courage under fire, but what he directs that courage to do, which is to keep the union intact and to free the slaves.\u201d</p> <p>Still, he concedes, his attitudes to stoicism have changed, which is something of a relief to hear given that all his books seem to say completely different things. The first edition of The Obstacle Is the Way is, by Holiday\u2019s own admission, pretty different from the most recent edition. Sometimes it feels that his many books \u2013 Stillness Is the Key; Courage Is Calling; Discipline Is Destiny; Lives of the Stoics; Right Here, Right Now: Good Values. Good Character. Good Deeds \u2013 do not so much represent a meaningful through-line of the ancient philosophy, but instead pick up quotes and notions so freely, attach them to modern exemplars so randomly, that it\u2019s like putting stoicism into a Magimix until the only building block of thought you have left is the alphabet.</p> <p>\u201cMy initial attraction to stoicism is what it can do for you: how it can make you more resilient, more productive, think clearer, be a master of yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a perfectly fine entry point into the philosophy. But if you miss what the philosophy is also asking of you, in terms of ethics and morals and its emphasis on the virtue of justice, how we\u2019re interconnected and interrelated, then really, what you\u2019ve just discovered is a recipe for being a better sociopath. Which is not what stoicism is.\u201d</p> <p>OK, good. Because if stoicism differentiated itself from its contemporary philosophies it was on precisely this point, as Holiday describes: cynics weren\u2019t interested in politics, \u201cthe Epicurean gets involved in politics only if they have to, and the stoic gets involved in politics unless something prevents them\u201d.</p>    <p>Holiday\u2019s own most public political intervention came in 2016, when he wrote an open letter to his Republican father, asking him not to vote for Trump, then another in 2020. Holiday himself is a \u201clower case-c conservative\u201d, he says. \u201cI like the idea of being responsible for yourself. I live in Texas, and I hunt, and I own my own business, and I generally like to be left alone. But directly from my study of stoicism, I have a very strong social conscience, that makes me find almost everything that Republicans stand for to be completely abhorrent.\u201d The 2016 election, he remembers with vaudeville horror, \u201csent my wife into labour\u201d. Sidebar on that baby, the first of two sons, with Samantha Hoover: his stoical approach to parenting, The Daily Dad: 366 Meditations on Parenting, Love and Raising Great Kids, is much less annoying than I expected, tending towards the \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d school of family life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/11/how-would-the-stoics-cope-today\">How would the Stoics cope today? | Ryan Holiday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But back to 2024. \u201cI remember in 2016, not knowing what world this was going to be. Today, it\u2019s not like Americans are facing some unknown \u2013 70-odd million of us want to go back. But on a larger level, I guess people have always been insane. The annals of history are insane.\u201d</p> <p>What is he going to do if Trump wins, I ask. Surely that\u2019s going to put his stoic acceptance of external environments at odds with his passionate belief in a fair society?</p> <p>\u201cMy gut tells me that Kamala\u2019s going to win and by a fairly large margin,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I could be fooling myself.\u201d Do stoics even do that?

It\u2019s a compendium of people who don\u2019t listen to experts and, as a result, win big. When the markets are telling you one thing, do the opposite; when doctors tell you you\u2019ll never walk again, just keep on trying to walk. Rockefeller is the first and probably most jarring example, held up as a role model for overcoming adversity, but really, the only adversity he overcame is that he didn\u2019t start off with all the money in the world, and yet that\u2019s what he ended up with.

In Rockefeller\u2019s case, this was an indefatigable can-do attitude. Holiday says he has changed a lot since those early days as an author, though his heroes haven\u2019t changed; the revised Obstacles still lauds the former US president Ulysses S Grant for not running away when things exploded (his fables seem to me to be the optimism bias of the histories that get told by people who remain alive; there must have been plenty of other civil war heroes whose stories would have ended better if they had moved away from explosives a bit faster: to take as a wild example, Abraham Lincoln). I\u2019ve missed the point, Holiday says (again, so nicely). \u201cIt\u2019s not Grant\u2019s courage under fire, but what he directs that courage to do, which is to keep the union intact and to free the slaves.\u201d Still, he concedes, his attitudes to stoicism have changed, which is something of a relief to hear given that all his books seem to say completely different things. The first edition of The Obstacle Is the Way is, by Holiday\u2019s own admission, pretty different from the most recent edition. Sometimes it feels that his many books \u2013 Stillness Is the Key; Courage Is Calling; Discipline Is Destiny; Lives of the Stoics; Right Here, Right Now: Good Values. Good Character. Good Deeds \u2013 do not so much represent a meaningful through-line of the ancient philosophy, but instead pick up quotes and notions so freely, attach them to modern exemplars so randomly, that it\u2019s like putting stoicism into a Magimix until the only building block of thought you have left is the alphabet. \u201cMy initial attraction to stoicism is what it can do for you: how it can make you more resilient, more productive, think clearer, be a master of yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a perfectly fine entry point into the philosophy. But if you miss what the philosophy is also asking of you, in terms of ethics and morals and its emphasis on the virtue of justice, how we\u2019re interconnected and interrelated, then really, what you\u2019ve just discovered is a recipe for being a better sociopath. Which is not what stoicism is.\u201d OK, good. Because if stoicism differentiated itself from its contemporary philosophies it was on precisely this point, as Holiday describes: cynics weren\u2019t interested in politics, \u201cthe Epicurean gets involved in politics only if they have to, and the stoic gets involved in politics unless something prevents them\u201d. Holiday\u2019s own most public political intervention came in 2016, when he wrote an open letter to his Republican father, asking him not to vote for Trump, then another in 2020. Holiday himself is a \u201clower case-c conservative\u201d, he says. \u201cI like the idea of being responsible for yourself. I live in Texas, and I hunt, and I own my own business, and I generally like to be left alone. But directly from my study of stoicism, I have a very strong social conscience, that makes me find almost everything that Republicans stand for to be completely abhorrent.\u201d The 2016 election, he remembers with vaudeville horror, \u201csent my wife into labour\u201d. Sidebar on that baby, the first of two sons, with Samantha Hoover: his stoical approach to parenting, The Daily Dad: 366 Meditations on Parenting, Love and Raising Great Kids, is much less annoying than I expected, tending towards the \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d school of family life. But back to 2024. \u201cI remember in 2016, not knowing what world this was going to be. Today, it\u2019s not like Americans are facing some unknown \u2013 70-odd million of us want to go back. But on a larger level, I guess people have always been insane. The annals of history are insane.\u201d What is he going to do if Trump wins, I ask. Surely that\u2019s going to put his stoic acceptance of external environments at odds with his passionate belief in a fair society? \u201cMy gut tells me that Kamala\u2019s going to win and by a fairly large margin,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I could be fooling myself.\u201d Do stoics even do that? I guess some of them must. \u2022 The 10th-anniversary edition of The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumphs, by Ryan Holiday, is out now (Profile, \u00a316.99).

      "body": "<p>The interview did not go well. I was in Liverpool as a journalist being shown a model for the city\u2019s future by its proud architect, Graeme Shankland. I told him I regarded his city as the most magnificent port in Europe. He corrected me and said Liverpool was \u201cglaringly obsolete\u201d. His plan, produced in 1965, was to demolish two-thirds of the city centre as well as much of Everton, Toxteth and Sefton. A new metropolis of towers and slabs would rise, pierced by swooping motorway overpasses and tunnels. A few historic buildings might be allowed to survive.</p> <p>I was horrified and said so, making a tactless reference to the RAF\u2019s \u201cBomber\u201d Harris. I was much moved by a visit I had just made with a colleague to see a similar scorched-earth project in Manchester\u2019s Hulme. We watched as Mancunians were herded on to buses with their belongings, to be dumped miles from their old homes on out-of-town estates. Many were in tears or dazed. We compared them with wartime refugees. They were to make way for Europe\u2019s biggest council estate, Hulme Crescents, its blocks bizarrely named after Georgian architects such as William Kent and Robert Adam.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Corbusier\u2019s dream was of vast blocks of buildings as \u2018machines for living\u2019. He became a cult figure to young architects</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Liverpool and Manchester were not alone. A similar plan was under way in Glasgow, where the city engineer Robert Bruce was about to drive 25 miles of motorway, including the M8, through the centre. A cluster of eight towers of council flats would rise at Red Road, said to be the highest in Europe. At the same time in Birmingham, most of the Victorian centre had simply disappeared, including the main market, the central library, the Liberal Club, Mason Science College and the Bishop\u2019s House. An urban motorway took their place.</p> <p>London was no exception, although progress on Patrick Abercrombie\u2019s 1944 plan was slow in starting. Like Liverpool, it was based on the thesis that the existing city was obsolete. Traffic volume forecasts demanded five rings of motorways and 10 radials, destroying more houses than had been lost in the blitz. Apart from selected \u201cvillages\u201d and famous buildings, most of the centre would be cleared. Whitehall was to be demolished from Downing Street to Westminster Abbey. A tunnel would run from Parliament Square to Aldwych. Also set to be demolished were Carlton House Terrace, Piccadilly Circus, Covent Garden, Fitzrovia and Bloomsbury. Shopping hubs would be replaced with large traffic gyratories. A glimmer of humanity lay in the proposal for a green belt and \u201cgreen wedges\u201d.</p>    <p>Abercrombie\u2019s plan for London \u2013 and for other cities such as Plymouth, Hull and Coventry \u2013 had been inspired by the utopian collectivism of the Swiss-born architect Le Corbusier. He became a cult among young interwar British architects. The stylistic debates between classicists and gothicists, neo-Elizabethans and neo-Georgians were cast aside. Le Corbusier\u2019s dream was of vast blocks of buildings as \u201cmachines for living\u201d. His bare modernism took hold of architecture schools and town-planning departments. After the war, the doctrine was that the nation should start afresh.</p> <p>There is no doubt that, by the end of the 1960s, there was a growing reaction against this radicalism. Its cost to the taxpayer would be enormous. Modernist style had lost the cool elegance of the interwar Bauhaus school. Cities now erupted with the so-called brutalism of concrete council estates, shopping centres and motorways. Le Corbusier\u2019s aversion to streets, which he thought fostered disease, and the isolating of people into flats, turned architecture into social engineering, exemplified by London\u2019s Barbican.</p> <p>Shankland\u2019s Liverpool vision soon collapsed for lack of money, though not before 30,000 habitable houses had been cleared and the city\u2019s population nearly halved. Manchester\u2019s Hulme Crescents proved a disaster. Within two years, they were declared unfit for families and were eventually demolished as they were impossible to let. Replacing them would cost \u00a3400m.</p> <p>Newcastle council\u2019s assertive leader, T Dan Smith, began to demolish the city\u2019s Georgian Grainger Town but was jailed for corruption. In Glasgow, the Red Road towers were uninhabitable. In 2014, there was a plan to celebrate the opening of the Commonwealth Games in the city by blowing them up. Instead, they were more discreetly demolished. In south-east London, Thamesmead new town was so unpopular it was eventually privatised in 2010. The new owners, Peabody, claimed it needed \u00a31bn to become lettable.</p> <p>Nobody was ever held responsible for these fiascos. The press and politicians showed little interest. Billions in public money had been wasted and acres of unusable social housing had to be destroyed. There was no apology and no public inquiry into any of them. Architecture was somehow anonymous. If it had gone wrong, it must be an act of God, not of architects.</p>    <p>This year is the 50th anniversary of the worm turning: in 1974, for the first time, the British public rose in protest against this style of urban planning. A scheme for Covent Garden, inherited from Labour by the now Tory Greater London Council, was to clear and redevelop an area of London twice the size of the Barbican. This time, the plan was not to evict working-class tenants. It was to drive out an estimated 17,000 businesses, including 34 publishers and thousands of residents. The micro-economy was to be torn apart \u2013 merely because someone thought it \u201cobsolete\u201d.</p> <p>Protest marches clogged Covent Garden\u2019s streets. Labour councillors, once ardent modernists, sided with the residents. The chair of the relevant GLC committee, Lady Dartmouth, defected to the protesters. Finally, secretary of state for the environment Geoffrey Rippon spent a weekend walking round Covent Garden and \u201clisting\u201d more than 250 buildings for preservation. He thus sabotaged his own party\u2019s plan.</p> <p>The 1974 Covent Garden revolt sparked a flame. A similar uprising took place in Liverpool against the clearance of the Eldonian docks area. People refused to be evicted and instead demanded a say in the style of any new houses. They decided on an exotic neo-Tudor. A rebellion also occurred in Cheshire\u2019s Macclesfield. Slowly but surely, the public insisted their voices be heard.</p> <p>That same year, a Labour government returned to power and did a U-turn on the London plan. In one sweep, the Corbusian revolution was swept aside. The ringways were dropped, apart from the M25. Piccadilly Circus was rescued, as were Whitehall and the Foreign Office. Bloomsbury was reprieved. St Pancras station was saved.</p> <p>In October that year, the V&amp;A museum marked the counter-revolution with an unusually political exhibition, The Destruction of the Country House, inspired by the fact that one historic mansion a week was being demolished for redevelopment. The show attracted much publicity and had an immediate impact. Government preservation orders on historic houses soared.

      "bodyText": "The interview did not go well. I was in Liverpool as a journalist being shown a model for the city\u2019s future by its proud architect, Graeme Shankland. I told him I regarded his city as the most magnificent port in Europe. He corrected me and said Liverpool was \u201cglaringly obsolete\u201d. His plan, produced in 1965, was to demolish two-thirds of the city centre as well as much of Everton, Toxteth and Sefton. A new metropolis of towers and slabs would rise, pierced by swooping motorway overpasses and tunnels. A few historic buildings might be allowed to survive. I was horrified and said so, making a tactless reference to the RAF\u2019s \u201cBomber\u201d Harris. I was much moved by a visit I had just made with a colleague to see a similar scorched-earth project in Manchester\u2019s Hulme. We watched as Mancunians were herded on to buses with their belongings, to be dumped miles from their old homes on out-of-town estates. Many were in tears or dazed. We compared them with wartime refugees. They were to make way for Europe\u2019s biggest council estate, Hulme Crescents, its blocks bizarrely named after Georgian architects such as William Kent and Robert Adam. Liverpool and Manchester were not alone. A similar plan was under way in Glasgow, where the city engineer Robert Bruce was about to drive 25 miles of motorway, including the M8, through the centre. A cluster of eight towers of council flats would rise at Red Road, said to be the highest in Europe. At the same time in Birmingham, most of the Victorian centre had simply disappeared, including the main market, the central library, the Liberal Club, Mason Science College and the Bishop\u2019s House. An urban motorway took their place. London was no exception, although progress on Patrick Abercrombie\u2019s 1944 plan was slow in starting. Like Liverpool, it was based on the thesis that the existing city was obsolete. Traffic volume forecasts demanded five rings of motorways and 10 radials, destroying more houses than had been lost in the blitz. Apart from selected \u201cvillages\u201d and famous buildings, most of the centre would be cleared. Whitehall was to be demolished from Downing Street to Westminster Abbey. A tunnel would run from Parliament Square to Aldwych. Also set to be demolished were Carlton House Terrace, Piccadilly Circus, Covent Garden, Fitzrovia and Bloomsbury. Shopping hubs would be replaced with large traffic gyratories. A glimmer of humanity lay in the proposal for a green belt and \u201cgreen wedges\u201d. Abercrombie\u2019s plan for London \u2013 and for other cities such as Plymouth, Hull and Coventry \u2013 had been inspired by the utopian collectivism of the Swiss-born architect Le Corbusier. He became a cult among young interwar British architects. The stylistic debates between classicists and gothicists, neo-Elizabethans and neo-Georgians were cast aside. Le Corbusier\u2019s dream was of vast blocks of buildings as \u201cmachines for living\u201d. His bare modernism took hold of architecture schools and town-planning departments. After the war, the doctrine was that the nation should start afresh. There is no doubt that, by the end of the 1960s, there was a growing reaction against this radicalism. Its cost to the taxpayer would be enormous. Modernist style had lost the cool elegance of the interwar Bauhaus school. Cities now erupted with the so-called brutalism of concrete council estates, shopping centres and motorways. Le Corbusier\u2019s aversion to streets, which he thought fostered disease, and the isolating of people into flats, turned architecture into social engineering, exemplified by London\u2019s Barbican. Shankland\u2019s Liverpool vision soon collapsed for lack of money, though not before 30,000 habitable houses had been cleared and the city\u2019s population nearly halved. Manchester\u2019s Hulme Crescents proved a disaster. Within two years, they were declared unfit for families and were eventually demolished as they were impossible to let. Replacing them would cost \u00a3400m. Newcastle council\u2019s assertive leader, T Dan Smith, began to demolish the city\u2019s Georgian Grainger Town but was jailed for corruption. In Glasgow, the Red Road towers were uninhabitable. In 2014, there was a plan to celebrate the opening of the Commonwealth Games in the city by blowing them up. Instead, they were more discreetly demolished. In south-east London, Thamesmead new town was so unpopular it was eventually privatised in 2010. The new owners, Peabody, claimed it needed \u00a31bn to become lettable. Nobody was ever held responsible for these fiascos. The press and politicians showed little interest. Billions in public money had been wasted and acres of unusable social housing had to be destroyed. There was no apology and no public inquiry into any of them. Architecture was somehow anonymous. If it had gone wrong, it must be an act of God, not of architects. This year is the 50th anniversary of the worm turning: in 1974, for the first time, the British public rose in protest against this style of urban planning. A scheme for Covent Garden, inherited from Labour by the now Tory Greater London Council, was to clear and redevelop an area of London twice the size of the Barbican. This time, the plan was not to evict working-class tenants. It was to drive out an estimated 17,000 businesses, including 34 publishers and thousands of residents. The micro-economy was to be torn apart \u2013 merely because someone thought it \u201cobsolete\u201d. Protest marches clogged Covent Garden\u2019s streets. Labour councillors, once ardent modernists, sided with the residents. The chair of the relevant GLC committee, Lady Dartmouth, defected to the protesters. Finally, secretary of state for the environment Geoffrey Rippon spent a weekend walking round Covent Garden and \u201clisting\u201d more than 250 buildings for preservation. He thus sabotaged his own party\u2019s plan. The 1974 Covent Garden revolt sparked a flame. A similar uprising took place in Liverpool against the clearance of the Eldonian docks area. People refused to be evicted and instead demanded a say in the style of any new houses. They decided on an exotic neo-Tudor. A rebellion also occurred in Cheshire\u2019s Macclesfield. Slowly but surely, the public insisted their voices be heard. That same year, a Labour government returned to power and did a U-turn on the London plan. In one sweep, the Corbusian revolution was swept aside. The ringways were dropped, apart from the M25. Piccadilly Circus was rescued, as were Whitehall and the Foreign Office. Bloomsbury was reprieved. St Pancras station was saved. In October that year, the V&amp;A museum marked the counter-revolution with an unusually political exhibition, The Destruction of the Country House, inspired by the fact that one historic mansion a week was being demolished for redevelopment. The show attracted much publicity and had an immediate impact. Government preservation orders on historic houses soared. Demolitions came to a virtual halt. Architects had not been used to criticism and they took the events of 1974 badly. When Prince Charles later attacked what he saw as the ugliness of modernism, the head of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Owen Luder, told colleagues to ignore him and just say: \u201cSod you.\u201d Critics of this arrogance dubbed brutalist buildings \u201csod you architecture\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The number of people studying to become nurses has fallen substantially across England, with some areas recording a 40% drop in successful applications, according to analysis by the largest nursing union. The latest regional data from Ucas, the university admissions service, shows the number of people accepted on to nursing courses fell across all parts of England between 2020 and 2023. Acceptances on to pre-registration courses have fallen by 40% in north-east England, making the region the hardest hit, according to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). Yorkshire and Humberside and south-west England each recorded 25% declines, eastern England 22%, the south-east 19%, the north-west 18%, the East Midlands 15%, the West Midlands 14% and London 12%. The RCN said whole regions were being left behind by a failing education system for nurses. It has called on the government to introduce a loan forgiveness model and funding for living costs for students who commit to working in the NHS after graduation, which it said was vital for encouraging recruitment into the profession. The RCN\u2019s chief executive and general secretary, Prof Nicola Ranger, said: \u201cThe prospect of huge debt and lack of financial support is putting off the nurses of the future, threatening to leave patients without the highly trained nursing professionals they desperately need. Nursing is an incredible career, but to fix a broken NHS the government must fix a broken nurse education model. \u201cAcross the NHS alone there are tens of thousands of vacancies and demand for services continues to rise. We desperately need more people to join the profession, but the reality is nursing numbers are going in the wrong direction. \u201cMinisters are right to want to modernise the NHS and shift care into the community, but to do that you must make nursing an attractive career once again. That means forgiving the tuition fee loans of those who commit to working in the health service and funding their living costs. Investment in nursing is always money well spent.\u201d The number of students accepted on to nursing courses has declined for the last two years in succession, which Labour said while in opposition was \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d. Numbers fell by 13% in 2023. The figures come a week after the government launched a consultation on its 10-year plan to transform the NHS, which includes a long-term workforce plan intended to increase the number of nurses from about 350,000 to 550,000 in 2036-37. According to the RCN\u2019s analysis, there are only 1,000 extra people a year forecast to start nursing courses in 2029 compared with a decade earlier, while there are more than 31,000 unfilled nursing posts in the English health service. The RCN said nursing students needed specific funding commitments to reflect their unique circumstances and to encourage more domestic recruitment, and that a fully staffed NHS was crucial to delivering the government\u2019s ambitions to get services back on track, shifting care from hospitals to the community. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS has faced chronic workforce shortages for years, with staff being burnt out and demoralised. \u201cThis government will build a health service fit for the future with the workforce it needs to get patients seen on time. \u201cBringing in the necessary staff will take time, but we are committed to delivering the biggest expansion of NHS staff in history with more midwives, nurses, doctors, and allied health professionals.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The fight for Puerto Rican voters emerged as an unlikely campaign theme on Sunday, after superstar Bad Bunny backed Kamala Harris for president, minutes after a speaker at Donald Trump\u2019s triumphalist New York rally made racist remarks about the US territory. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, speaking ahead of Trump at the rally in Madison Square Garden, said \u201cthere\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now, I think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico.\u201d Millions of mainland US residents with Puerto Rican heritage will be voting on 5 November and the Trump campaign was quick to distance itself from the joke. A slew of Republicans also condemned the remarks, including Rick Scott and Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar from Florida, the state with the largest population of Puerto Ricans in the United States mainland. Here\u2019s what else happened on Sunday: Kamala Harris election news Harris made a pitch for Puerto Rican voters, addressing the need to drive economic growth and job creation. The US territory has struggled after several hurricanes smashed the power grid and faced austerity measures after the local government filed for bankruptcy. Harris promised more effective use of recovery funds for the territory and discussed her plans while visiting a Puerto Rican restaurant in Pennsylvania. Of the swing state\u2019s eligible Latino voters, 580,000 are of Puerto Rican descent. Harris was in Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania, on her 14th trip to the state since Joe Biden withdrew from the race. The vice-president spoke at a church service in west Philadelphia and answered questions on student loan debt at a nearby barbershop. At a rally on Sunday evening, Harris told supporters \u201cno one can sit on the sidelines\u201d ahead of the election, adding: \u201cmake no mistake: we will win.\u201d Harris also targeted younger voters in the crowd. \u201cYou are rightly impatient for change,\u201d she said. \u201cYou, who have only known the climate crisis \u2026 You, who grew up with active shooter drills. You, who right now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers.\u201d Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, released statements acknowledging the sixth anniversary of a mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. \u201cSix years ago today, a white supremacist committed the deadliest attack on American Jews in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Emhoff wrote. \u201cWe honor the lives of those lost on that horrific day by continuing our fight against antisemitism and hate in all its forms.\u201d Governor Tim Walz joined Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to play the American football video game Madden on a Twitch livestream and talk about the election. The unconventional campaign appearance came as the Harris-Walz campaign tried to drum up support among young male voters. Donald Trump election news Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally was marked by racist comments, coarse insults, and dangerous threats about immigrants. Businessman Grant Cardone said Harris \u201cand her pimp handlers will destroy our country\u201d, while Tucker Carlson mocked Harris\u2019s racial background: \u201cAs the first Samoan Malaysian low IQ, former California prosecutor to ever be elected president, no, she\u2019s not impressive.\u201d Wrestler Hulk Hogan, Dr Phil star Phil McGraw, and a rare surprise appearance from Melania Trump also garnered cheers from the 20,000 attenders. Trump promised to introduce a new tax credit for family caregivers and doubled down on his anti-immigration rhetoric. He said his administration would pursue the death penalty for migrants who kill Americans and that he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Trump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, avoided calling Russia an \u201cenemy\u201d in an interview on Meet the Press. Vance said Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201cclearly an adversary\u201d but \u201cwe have to be smart about diplomacy\u201d. Chinese state-affiliated hackers intercepted audio from the phone calls of US political figures, including an unnamed campaign adviser of Donald Trump, the Washington Post reported Sunday. Various media outlets reported on Friday that the Trump campaign was made aware last week that the Republican presidential candidate and his running mate JD Vance were among a number of people inside and outside government whose phone numbers were targeted through the infiltration of Verizon phone systems. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Harris\u2019s campaign has delayed taking up Joe Biden\u2019s offers to campaign for his vice-president, Axios reports. \u201cPresident Biden wants to campaign for vice-president Harris in the last days before the election,\u201d the outlet writes. \u201cHarris\u2019 campaign keeps responding: We\u2019ll get back to you, three people familiar with the dynamic told Axios.\u201d The president will cast his early-voting ballot in the presidential election on Monday, according to the White House.

The Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its longtime junior coalition partner Komeito failed to secure a majority in the lower house on a bruising night in which the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party (CDP) made significant gains. The result \u2013 which left no single party with a clear mandate \u2013 is the LDP\u2019s worst performance since 2009, when it was cast into the wilderness for three years before mounting a comeback under the leadership of Shinzo Abe. A chastened prime minister Shigeru Ishiba, who was due to give an address on Monday afternoon, said voters had issued a \u201csevere judgment\u201d against the LDP. They had \u201cexpressed their strong desire for the LDP to do some reflection and become a party that acts in line with the people\u2019s will\u201d, he told the public broadcaster NHK. Uncertainty over whether the coalition can reach a deal with a third party and secure a working majority sent the yen to a three-month low against the dollar on Monday as investors braced for a period of political and economic uncertainty.

Then in September, he pitched up in the New York City suburbs in Long Island.</p> \n<p>What Trump intends by staging this trilogy of seemingly pointless electoral appearances is unclear. He has used his rambling speeches to take a nostalgic walk down memory lane to what he sees as the golden days of his life as a New York real estate magnate.</p> \n<p>But he has also portrayed New York City in the most dark and dystopian terms, as a rat-infested haven for drug addicts, gangs and \u201cillegal aliens\u201d housed in luxury apartments while military veterans shiver on the sidewalks. His toxic language is perhaps a reflection of his bitterness towards the city of his birth, which in separate court cases has convicted him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/30/trump-trial-hush-money-verdict\">34 felonies</a>, found his company the Trump Organization guilty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/trump-organization-guilty-verdict-tax-fraud\">criminal tax fraud</a>, and found him personally liable for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db\">sexual abuse</a>.</p> \n<p>On Sunday Trump again criticized his home town, claiming that the Biden administration had forced \u201chundreds of thousands of really rough people\u201d into the city and telling New Yorkers, despite police saying <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/07/03/nyc-crime-rate-down-2-in-2024-as-murders-shootings-drop-nypd/\">crime has declined</a>: \u201cYour crime is through the roof.

A comment from the radio personality Sid Rosenberg that Hillary Clinton was a \u201csick bastard\u201d was similarly well received, as was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/27/politics/trump-rally-madison-square-garden-vulgar-attacks/index.html\">Rosenberg\u2019s claim</a> that \u201cthe fucking illegals get everything they want\u201d.</p> \n<p>David Rem, a Republican politician who the Trump campaign described as a childhood friend of the former president, called Harris \u201cthe devil\u201d and \u201cthe antichrist\u201d, to loud cheers. Rem later took a crucifix out of his pocket and announced that he was running for New York City mayor.</p> \n<p>As soon as Trump <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/a07e90aa-b8fa-465d-9f3c-d1969231ca74\">announced</a> his intention to stage a rally at Madison Square Garden just days before the election, critics leapt to point out historical parallels with one of the most notorious events in New York history. On 20 February 1939, just seven months before Germany invaded Poland, the pro-Hitler German American Bund held a <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/pov/films/nightatthegarden/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw4Oe4BhCcARIsADQ0csnBDMEnyGz8fTOLL2rcqEOHAEQAk-HFgWsynYYUcvr9JcWpb0Vs2loaAmixEALw_wcB\">mass Nazi rally</a> in Madison Square Garden.</p> \n<p>The organizers chose George Washington\u2019s birthday as the date to parade their vision of an Aryan Christian country dedicated to white supremacy and American patriotism. They erected a giant portrait of Washington, which they flanked with swastika flags alongside the stars and stripes.</p> \n<p>More than 20,000 American Nazi sympathisers attended, many dressed in storm trooper uniforms and giving the Sieg Heil salute. The \u201cF\u00fchrer\u201d of the American Bund, Fritz Kuhn, told the crowd that America would be \u201creturned to the people who founded it\u201d, and decried the \u201cJewish-controlled press\u201d.</p> \n<p>Hillary Clinton had noted the similarities between the two events in an interview with CNN last week, and at a rally in Nevada earlier on Sunday, Walz was happy to continue the comparison.</p> \n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump\u2019s </a>got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden,\u201d Walz <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCOl4uUqKpo\">said</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden. And don\u2019t think that he doesn\u2019t know for one second exactly what they\u2019re doing there.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Trump campaign reacted furiously to the accusations, describing Clinton\u2019s comments as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. One of the few people to reference the 1939 rally on Sunday <a href=\"https://x.com/atrupar/status/1850656623133348175\">was Hulk Hogan</a>, who emerged to wrestling music, spent several seconds struggling to rip off his shirt, then claimed: \u201cI don\u2019t see no stinkin\u2019 Nazis in here.\u201d</p> \n<p>After a night of fire and fury, it will be up to the American voters to decide.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024 because an earlier version said that the Donald Trump rally was held in \u201cthe exact same arena\u201d as the 1939 pro-Hitler German American Bund Nazi rally. Although the venues of the two rallies share the same name, the 1939 rally was in a different location. The current arena opened in 1968 and is the fourth to be named Madison Square Garden, replacing the third, which opened in 1925.</p>",

On Sunday Trump again criticized his home town, claiming that the Biden administration had forced \u201chundreds of thousands of really rough people\u201d into the city and telling New Yorkers, despite police saying crime has declined: \u201cYour crime is through the roof. Everything is through the roof.\u201d The pugnacious tone had been set earlier in the afternoon, when several of the opening speakers made obscenity-laced and hate-filled remarks. Hinchcliffe\u2019s comments about Puerto Rico \u2013 he also made lewd sexual innuendoes about Latina women \u2013 were met with big laughs from the crowd. A comment from the radio personality Sid Rosenberg that Hillary Clinton was a \u201csick bastard\u201d was similarly well received, as was Rosenberg\u2019s claim that \u201cthe fucking illegals get everything they want\u201d. David Rem, a Republican politician who the Trump campaign described as a childhood friend of the former president, called Harris \u201cthe devil\u201d and \u201cthe antichrist\u201d, to loud cheers. Rem later took a crucifix out of his pocket and announced that he was running for New York City mayor. As soon as Trump announced his intention to stage a rally at Madison Square Garden just days before the election, critics leapt to point out historical parallels with one of the most notorious events in New York history. On 20 February 1939, just seven months before Germany invaded Poland, the pro-Hitler German American Bund held a mass Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden. The organizers chose George Washington\u2019s birthday as the date to parade their vision of an Aryan Christian country dedicated to white supremacy and American patriotism. They erected a giant portrait of Washington, which they flanked with swastika flags alongside the stars and stripes. More than 20,000 American Nazi sympathisers attended, many dressed in storm trooper uniforms and giving the Sieg Heil salute. The \u201cF\u00fchrer\u201d of the American Bund, Fritz Kuhn, told the crowd that America would be \u201creturned to the people who founded it\u201d, and decried the \u201cJewish-controlled press\u201d. Hillary Clinton had noted the similarities between the two events in an interview with CNN last week, and at a rally in Nevada earlier on Sunday, Walz was happy to continue the comparison. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden. And don\u2019t think that he doesn\u2019t know for one second exactly what they\u2019re doing there.\u201d The Trump campaign reacted furiously to the accusations, describing Clinton\u2019s comments as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. One of the few people to reference the 1939 rally on Sunday was Hulk Hogan, who emerged to wrestling music, spent several seconds struggling to rip off his shirt, then claimed: \u201cI don\u2019t see no stinkin\u2019 Nazis in here.\u201d After a night of fire and fury, it will be up to the American voters to decide. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024 because an earlier version said that the Donald Trump rally was held in \u201cthe exact same arena\u201d as the 1939 pro-Hitler German American Bund Nazi rally. Although the venues of the two rallies share the same name, the 1939 rally was in a different location. The current arena opened in 1968 and is the fourth to be named Madison Square Garden, replacing the third, which opened in 1925.",

He mostly repeated some of the issues he aims to tackle if he were to be elected, including immigration, the war between Israel and Hamas, and crime.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kamala Harris</strong> addressed a boisterous crowd in North Philadelphia, promising supporters that she would win a seemingly deadlocked presidential race with just nine days left before election day.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s</strong> warm-up speakers at the Madison Square Garden rally were crude and xenophobic at times, seemingly in an attempt to double down on Trump\u2019s rhetoric and to play to the hardcore fans here.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kamala Harris</strong> shared her plan to create a task force in Puerto Rico geared toward improving the economy in the cash-strapped island. The message came in tandem with offensive remarks by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d during Donald Trump\u2019s rally. </p></li> <li><p>In an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union this morning, <strong>JD Vance</strong> and host Jake Tapper had a heated exchange over statements former Trump administration officials have made calling the ex-president a fascist.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-671ee9438f085a5821813d3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-28T01:33:15.551Z\">1.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> will also be visiting several battleground states ahead of Election Day. </p> <p>His schedule includes a visit to <strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>, on Monday and a rally in <strong>Allentown, Pennsylvania,</strong> on Tuesday. </p> <p>Trump is also slated to travel to <strong>Wisconsin</strong> and <strong>Nevada</strong> this week. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-671ee4628f085a5821813d1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joan-greve\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-28T01:17:51.562Z\">1.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Kamala Harris</strong> addressed a boisterous crowd in <strong>North Philadelphia</strong> on Sunday, promising supporters that she would win a seemingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/23/presidential-polls-kamala-harris-donald-trump-election\">deadlocked</a> presidential race with just nine days left before election day.</p> <p>\u201cNine days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end,\u201d the vice-president told hundreds of supporters. \u201cAnd make no mistake: we will win.\u201d</p> <p>Echoing a message that she has hammered at every campaign stop in recent weeks, Harris framed the election as a choice between \u201ctwo extremely different visions for our nation\u201d. Harris accused Donald Trump of waging a selfish campaign of vengeance while she and her supporters work toward a better future for all Americans.</p> <p>\u201cWe have an opportunity before us to turn the page on the fear and the divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe have the ability to turn the page on that same old tired playbook because we are exhausted with it, and we are ready to chart a new way forward.\u201d</p> <p>Harris took the stage after visiting a predominantly Black church and a barbershop in western Philadelphia, underscoring how important the city will be in her electoral strategy. Harris\u2019 ability to turn out Democrats in Philadelphia will be key to winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>, which could serve as the tipping point state in the electoral college.</p> <p>\u201cThere is too much on the line, and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe election is here, and the choice, Philly, is truly in your hands.

The cornhusker state\u2019s two US senators and three US House representatives are all Republicans, making Osborn\u2019s credible challenge against Fischer that much more notable.</p> <p>Democrats and Republicans are, respectively, trying to defend 23 and 11 US Senate seats during the 5 November presidential election.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us today. This blog is closing soon. Here\u2019s where things stand: Kamala Harris campaigned \u201cneighborhood-to-neighborhood\u201d in Philadelphia and stopped at a Puerto Rican restaurant before delivering her remarks in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Donald Trump delivered a speech in front of thousands of people who traveled to Madison Square Garden in New York City at a campaign rally. He mostly repeated some of the issues he aims to tackle if he were to be elected, including immigration, the war between Israel and Hamas, and crime. Kamala Harris addressed a boisterous crowd in North Philadelphia, promising supporters that she would win a seemingly deadlocked presidential race with just nine days left before election day. Donald Trump\u2019s warm-up speakers at the Madison Square Garden rally were crude and xenophobic at times, seemingly in an attempt to double down on Trump\u2019s rhetoric and to play to the hardcore fans here. Kamala Harris shared her plan to create a task force in Puerto Rico geared toward improving the economy in the cash-strapped island. The message came in tandem with offensive remarks by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d during Donald Trump\u2019s rally. In an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union this morning, JD Vance and host Jake Tapper had a heated exchange over statements former Trump administration officials have made calling the ex-president a fascist. Donald Trump will also be visiting several battleground states ahead of Election Day. His schedule includes a visit to Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday and a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday. Trump is also slated to travel to Wisconsin and Nevada this week. Kamala Harris addressed a boisterous crowd in North Philadelphia on Sunday, promising supporters that she would win a seemingly deadlocked presidential race with just nine days left before election day. \u201cNine days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end,\u201d the vice-president told hundreds of supporters. \u201cAnd make no mistake: we will win.\u201d Echoing a message that she has hammered at every campaign stop in recent weeks, Harris framed the election as a choice between \u201ctwo extremely different visions for our nation\u201d. Harris accused Donald Trump of waging a selfish campaign of vengeance while she and her supporters work toward a better future for all Americans. \u201cWe have an opportunity before us to turn the page on the fear and the divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe have the ability to turn the page on that same old tired playbook because we are exhausted with it, and we are ready to chart a new way forward.\u201d Harris took the stage after visiting a predominantly Black church and a barbershop in western Philadelphia, underscoring how important the city will be in her electoral strategy. Harris\u2019 ability to turn out Democrats in Philadelphia will be key to winning Pennsylvania, which could serve as the tipping point state in the electoral college. \u201cThere is too much on the line, and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe election is here, and the choice, Philly, is truly in your hands. The path to victory runs right through all of the leaders who are here.\u201d Here\u2019s more on the rally in Philadelphia: Vice President Kamala Harris called Donald Trump \u201cincreasingly unstable and unhinged\u201d after delivering his remarks at a rally in New York City. With about a week left for the elections, Harris will be stopping at several battleground states for a final push of support. She will campaign in Reno, Nevada, on Thursday, the same day Harris is scheduled to host a concert and rally with the norte\u00f1o band Los Tigres del Norte in Phoenix, Arizona. Meanwhile, her running mate Tim Walz will be in Manitowoc and Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Monday. Puerto Rican leaders are infuriated over Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s comments about the U.S. territory, calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage,\u201d during Donald Trump\u2019s rally in New York City. Puerto Rico\u2019s resident commissioner, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, called the remarks \u201cdespicable, inappropriate and disgusting.\u201d New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cort\u00e9s asked her Puerto Rican followers to share the clip with their families. Donald Trump has finished delivering his remarks in New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden. He called Election Day \u201cthe most important day in the history of our country.\u201d \u201cWe will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again,\u201d he concluded. Former president Donald Trump is over an hour into his speech at a rally in Madison Square Garden. He has so far promised to cut taxes, raise wages, end the war in Ukraine and the war in the Middle East, rebuild the military, and remove critical race theory from schools. He also proposed a bill to impose a one-year jail sentence for anyone who burns the American flag. At his rally in New York, Donald Trump congratulated his wife, Melania Trump, on the release of her new memoir. \u201cI was nervous when I read it,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI said, \u2018I wonder if she said some bad stuff about me.\u2019 I was very nervous, but she\u2019s great.\u201d He thanked several of the speakers who took the stage before him, as well as the chief executive officer of Madison Square Garden Sports and Madison Square Garden Entertainment, James Dolan, for providing the venue. At a rally in New York City, Donald Trump referenced a report that stated the US would not win if a war were to break out against China. \u201cI said to myself, assuming that\u2019s true, how stupid are you to put out a report like that?\u201d Trump said, possibly referring to a report by The Brookings Institution. \u201cYou don\u2019t put out reports like that, and it\u2019s not true. We would kick their ass.\u201d Later, he once again called Democrats \u201cthe enemy from within.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve done very bad things to this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are indeed the enemy from within, but this is who we\u2019re fighting. These are the people who are doing such harm to our country with their open border policies, record-setting inflation, the green new scam, and everything else that they\u2019re doing.\u201d Donald Trump called Vice President Kamala Harris \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d and a candidate with \u201ca very low IQ.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s unfit for office. Everyone knows it,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one respects her, no one trusts her, no one takes her seriously.\u201d He later repeated misleading criticism of the Biden administration\u2019s hurricane response in North Carolina, where Hurricane Helene ravaged the state, and then boasted about not using a teleprompter. Donald Trump is repeating his usual anti-immigrant comments at a rally in Madison Square Garden. He showed a video montage of television news snippets related to crimes committed by migrants in the US. \u201cThe United States is now an occupied country,\u201d he said. \u201cOn day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history, and get the criminals out.\u201d At his rally in New York City, Donald Trump said that, if elected, he would support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one. \u201cThey add so much to our country and are never spoken of,\u201d he said. Trump also said that he would make interest on car loans fully tax deductible, \u201cbut only for cars made in America.\u201d Donald Trump appeared at 7.11pm \u2013 introduced by Melania \u2013 to a cacophony of noise and Lee Greenwood singing his walkout song God Bless the USA. Trump is essentially bringing back his happy place by recreating the RNC euphoria at this Madison Square Garden rally: the speakers copied his dark rhetoric again, Hulk Hogan ripped his shirt again, Melania spoke again and Trump has the opportunity to bask in his supporters adulation. Trump walked out to a live version of Lee Greenwood\u2019s God Bless the USA, his usual walkout song. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be back in the city I love,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?\u201d he asked. The crowd screamed: \u201cNo!\u201d Melania Trump, the former president\u2019s wife, makes remarks following Elon Musk\u2019s speech. \u201cOur lives are complicated, even during the best of times, and sadly today, a declining quality of life, coupled with economic instability makes it difficult for business to thrive,\u201d she said. \u201cNew York City and America need their magic back,\u201d she added, \u201ca country of tomorrow that will shape our future and reset expectations for the generations.\u201d She introduced the next speaker: Donald Trump. Elon Musk is scheduled late into the series of speakers taking the stage at Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden, highlighting the influence the Tesla CEO holds in the campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAmerica is going to reach heights that it has never seen before. The future is going to be amazing.\u201d During Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rally in New York City, the CEO of the UFC, Dana White, said that Kamala Harris is \u201cnot an agent of change.\u201d \u201cChange is needed, but change will not come from the status quo, and she is the status quo. If you want real change, you\u2019ll vote for proven leadership,\u201d he said. Later, Howard Lutnick, the CEO of the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, took the stage. He spoke about the firm\u2019s history before expressing his support for the former president. \u201cDonald Trump loves this city, no matter how crappy they treat him. He is back because he loves you and he loves this city,\u201d he said. McDonald\u2019s seems to be a recurring theme in the speeches at Donald Trump\u2019s campaign event. Earlier, JD Vance questioned Kamala Harris\u2019s stint at the fast food joint. Now, the former president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr is on the stage and used McDonald\u2019s as an example of rising food costs. \u201cLet me tell you, if Donald Trump Jr has sticker shock at McDonald\u2019s, we have a serious problem,\u201d he said. Lara Trump called New York City \u201cthe greatest city on Earth in the greatest country on Earth,\u201d pointing to her father\u2019s contributions to the city\u2019s development. \u201cNew York City made Donald Trump, but Donald Trump also made New York City,\u201d she said. \u201cHe changed the skyline of this city, rebuilt it.\u201d Former president Donald Trump\u2019s son Eric Trump and his wife, Lara Trump, are speaking at the campaign rally in New York City. \u201cThis is so much more than a political movement. This is the greatest family in the world. We are fighting for a country we love,\u201d Eric said. \u201cSomebody tried to kill him, and despite that, every single time he stands up and he says \u2018fight, fight, fight\u2019,\u201d he added. Senator JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential pick, is speaking at Donald Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden. \u201cI\u2019ve got the easiest job in American politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThink about this. All I\u2019ve got to do is remind people what life was like when Donald J Trump was President of the United States.\u201d Then, Vance said Governor Tim Walz, the Democratic VP pick, has the \u201chardest job in American politics\u201d because he has to defend Vice-President Kamala Harris. \u201cPlease say a prayer for Tim Walz, because they\u2019re asking him to do the impossible,\u201d he added. The international reggaet\u00f3n star Bad Bunny shared Kamala Harris\u2019s message to Puerto Ricans. Bad Bunny has been more involved in politics in recent months, especially in Puerto Rico, where he purchased billboards in protest of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Phil McGraw, best known for his television show Dr Phil, is delivering remarks at Donald Trump\u2019s rally. He said he doesn\u2019t agree with everything the former president says, but still endorses him. He defended Trump from people who call him a bully. \u201cTo be a bully, there has to be an imbalance of power, and when there\u2019s not, it\u2019s just called a debate, and he\u2019s just better at it than anybody else,\u201d McGraw said. Donald Trump\u2019s warm-up speakers at the Madison Square Garden rally have been crude and xenophobic at times, seemingly in an attempt to double down on Trump\u2019s rhetoric and to play to the hardcore fans here. The remarks in some ways are nothing new \u2014 Trumpworld celebrities typically speak in dark and visceral terms to copy Trump and win over his base \u2014 but they were notably pointed on Sunday. From the start, Tony Hinchcliffe, the host of the Kill Tony podcast, stoked racial animus about Latinos and African Americans. Latinos \u201clove making babies\u201d, Hichcliffe said to raucous laughter. \u201cThere\u2019s no pulling out. They come inside, just like they do to our country.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico,\u201d Hinchcliffe also said. Then the radio host Sid Rosenberg leaned into attacking Democrats, using ad hominem slurs to describe Hillary Clinton \u2014 a villain to Trump supporters who lapped it up. \u201cHillary Clinton. What a sick son of a bitch. The whole fucking party. A bunch of degenerates. Lowlives, Jew-haters and lowlives. Every one of \u2018em. Every one of \u2018em,\u201d Rosenberg said. And Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who lost his prime time perch in the wake of the network getting sued for defamation over promulgating false 2020 election fraud claims, went after Kamala Harris. \u201cAs the first Samoan Malaysian low IQ, former California prosecutor to ever be elected president,\u201d Carlson falsely said in a mocking tone of Harris\u2019s racial background, \u201cno, she\u2019s not impressive.\u201d Hulk Hogan, the retired WWE wrestler, has taken the stage, sporting yellow sunglasses and a red \u201cTrump-Vance\u201d tank top. He took a few jabs at Vice-President Kamala Harris. \u201cKamala is responsible for the border crisis, and Kamala is also responsible for inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cShe acts like she\u2019s the victim, and then all of a sudden, she flips, she flops, she spins and turns it around and acts like she\u2019s gonna be the damn hero.\u201d The disgraced former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is expressing his support for former president Donald Trump at a campaign event in New York City. \u201cHe\u2019s liberated us in the deepest and truest sense,\u201d Carlson said about Trump. \u201cAnd the liberation he has brought to us is the liberation from the obligation to tell lies. Donald Trump has made it possible for the rest of us to tell the truth about the world around us, and that\u2019s the single most liberating thing you can do for people.\u201d Vivek Ramaswamy, Tulsi Gabbard, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in that order, took the stage at Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rally at Madison Square Garden. Ramaswamy made transphobic remarks, while Gabbard listed some of the ways she believes Vice President Kamala Harris will harm the country. \u201cA vote for Kamala Harris is a vote for economic hardship, high cost of living, poverty and homelessness,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cAnd a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for economic prosperity and opportunity for every single one of us as Americans.\u201d So far, the speakers at Donald Trump\u2019s rally in New York City have resorted to lewd language and racist remarks in their speeches. A standup routine from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, for example, was filled with racist stereotypes of Latinos, Jews and Black people. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you guys know this, but there\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico,\u201d said Hinchcliffe, whose joke was flagged by Democrat Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign. Speaker Mike Johnson made an appearance at Donald Trump\u2019s rally in New York City. He said he felt a resurgence of the Republican party and pointed to a widespread dissatisfaction with current policies under the Biden administration. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle between two completely different visions for who we are as a nation and who we\u2019re going to be,\u201d Johnson said. '\u201cThis is not your father\u2019s Democratic Party. They are now full on Marxism and socialism.\u201d The vice-president said she would create an \u201copportunity economy taskforce\u201d in efforts to foster economic growth in the Caribbean archipelago by creating more jobs. She also recognized the need to urgently rebuild Puerto Rico\u2019s energy grid. The US territory is still facing the aftermath of several hurricanes that ravaged the power grid. Puerto Rico is also undergoing the effects of austerity measures imposed by a non-elected fiscal board after the local government filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history. \u201cI will cut red tape to ensure disaster recovery funds are used quickly and effectively, and work with leaders across the island to ensure all Puerto Ricans have access to reliable, affordable electricity,\u201d she said. \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and incompetent leader,\u201d she said. \u201cHe abandoned the island, tried to block aid after back-to-back devastating hurricanes and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults,\u201d she added. Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, wrapped up her nearly 15-minute speech in Philadephia. She encouraged the crowd to convince their families and friends to get out and vote, using similar phrases to those in her campaign ads. \u201cThere is too much on the line, and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days,\u201d she said. Vice President Kamala Harris directed her remarks toward younger voters in the Pennsylvania crowd. \u201cIs Gen Z in the house?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou are rightly impatient for change. You are rightly impatient. You who have only known the climate crisis, you are leaders in what we need to do to protect our planet.\u201d \u201cYou, who grew up with active shooter drills,\u201d she said. \u201cYou, who right now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers understand the importance of fighting for the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.\u201d The Vice President spoke about the war in Gaza less than five minutes into her speech. \u201cWe must seize this opportunity to end this war and bring the hostages home,\u201d she said. \u201cI will do everything in my power to meet that end.\u201d Jacob Roberts, a 26-year-old voter from Westchester attending Harris\u2019 rally in North Philadelphia, has already voted early for her. He told the Guardian that he feels optimistic about the outcome of the election, even as polls show a tied race in Pennsylvania. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of Kamala yard signs around,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI actually just drove out to western Pennsylvania. I didn\u2019t see a lot of Trump signs on barns or anything, so I think we\u2019re looking good.\u201d Asked whether he was disappointed to miss some of the Eagles game to attend the rally, Roberts said it was well worth it. \u201cThis is our country we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Roberts said. Brenda Exon, a 60-year-old voter from Wallingford known as the \u201cPhilly Pride Lady,\u201d is at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Philadelphia with her \u201ctimeline to liberty\u201d apron. The apron tells the story of Philadelphia, from the founding of Pennsylvania to the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the civil rights movement. \u201cOur Philly story is our nation\u2019s story, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for really. We don\u2019t want Donald Trump to take this away,\u201d Exon said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up on our 250th [anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence], and who should be president celebrating that in 2026? Kamala Harris.\u201d Trump approved Rudy Giuliani to be on the stage tonight at the Madison Square Garden rally, according to a person familiar. Giuliani walked into the stage at the Trump rally to the loudest cheers so far of the event and a standing ovation from a capacity Madison Square Garden. Giuliani opened by referencing when Pope John Paul came to NY in 1995, a visit Giuliani presumably recalls because it took place while he was mayor. It\u2019s the kind of anecdote that will play well with most of the crowd here but there are many younger Trump supporters here who have no idea what that\u2019s about. Governor Tim Walz joined Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from New York, on a Twitch livestream as the two played the American football video game Madden and talked about the election. The unconventional campaign appearance comes as the Harris-Walz campaign tries to drum up support among young male voters. In 2020, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s first appearance on Twitch was one of the platform\u2019s most-watched events at that time. Here\u2019s Michael Sainato with more on the stream: On the six-year anniversary of a shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff have released statements acknowledging the mass shooting. \u201cSix years ago today, a white supremacist committed the deadliest attack on American Jews in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Emhoff wrote. \u201cWe honor the lives of those lost on that horrific day by continuing our fight against antisemitism and hate in all its forms.\u201d A federal judge blocked the state of Virginia from removing suspected noncitizens from the voter rolls, CNN reported. The court cited potential violations of a federal ban on \u201csystematic\u201d removals within 90 days of an election. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision paves the way for a potential Supreme Court battle as early voting begins in Virginia. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have rallied around the case, arguing that noncitizen voting is a significant election risk, despite its rarity. The order clarifies that Virginia can still prevent noncitizen voting by canceling registrations on an individual basis or prosecuting noncitizens who vote. Today so far Thanks for joining us this morning. As I hand over to my colleague Coral Murphy Marcos, here are the main headlines we\u2019ve been following today so far: In a bevy of Sunday morning talk show appearances, JD Vance defended Donald Trump against claims from former Trump staffers that the ex-president has authoritarian tendencies. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris described her choice to deliver her closing argument speech at The Ellipse, Lindsey Graham denounced attacks against Trump\u2019s character and Bernie Sanders said Trump has \u201cstrong tendency toward authoritarianism\u201d. This morning, Kamala Harris campaigned \u201cneighborhood-to-neighborhood\u201d in Philadelphia, kicking off the morning by attending services at a predominantly Black church before heading to a nearby barbershop to speak with young Black men. She\u2019ll be stopping at a Puerto Rican restaurant later this afternoon before speaking at a rally this evening. Supporters of Donald Trump\u2019s have already begun gathering at Madison Square Garden as the ex-president prepares to deliver his closing arguments there. Campaigning in Nevada today, Tim Walz has criticized the rally as \u201ca direct parallel\u201d to a Nazi rally held at the venue in 1939. Following the news that the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times will not endorse a presidential candidate this year, the New York Times opinion section has published a full page image reminding readers that it endorsed Kamala Harris last month. Earlier this week, our own editorial page strongly endorsed Kamala Harris for president. In the final days of the 2024 election, Harris\u2019s campaign has slowballed Joe Biden\u2019s offers to campaign for his vice-president, Axios reports. We are now in the warmup act-phase of the rally. The jumbotron is playing super-cuts of Kamala Harris saying in TV interviews that she couldn\u2019t think of any Biden administration policies she would change, which gets prolonged boos. Expected to speak later in the program: Rudy Giuliani, the Trump lawyer and co-defendant in the Fulton county election interference case. A long line of people are waiting to enter the venue in North Philadelphia where Kamala Harris will be addressing supporters this afternoon. On the way into the venue, supporters can see signs reading \u201cPhilly for Kamala\u201d and \u201cWe Choose Freedom\u201d. With several hours to go until Trump\u2019s scheduled speaking time at Madison Square Garden, the venue is already fully filled in the lower and mid sections. The difference today compared with some other Trump rallies is that there is seating, including for the space in front of the stage. Overhead, the jumbotron is flashing Trump\u2019s campaign slogans, such as \u201cNo Tax on Tips\u201d and \u201cMake America Wealthy Again\u201d, but there\u2019s also the occasional ad for people to buy Maga hats. Most people here are already wearing Maga hats so it\u2019s unclear how many people are buying. A day after Joe Biden visited Arizona to formally apologize for the federal government\u2019s role in the American Indian boarding school system, Tim Walz visted the state to campaign in the capital of the Navajo Nation \u2013 a symbol of Native voters\u2019 potential sway in the presidential election. Wearing a turquoise necklace and horned toad pin, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate spoke yesterday alongside Arizona senator Mark Kelly as about 750 supporters held aloft signs reading \u201cSko Coach!\u201d (slang for \u201cLet\u2019s Go Coach!\u201d) and \u201cY\u00ediy\u00e1h Man!\u201d (Din\u00e9 for \u201cscary\u201d) alongside a sillouette of Donald Trump. \u201cI understand that it is a privilege to be standing here on Navajo land,\u201d Walz said. \u201cI am grateful that you would see fit during the year as we talk about your vote to make Kamala Harris president of the United States, for your incredible hospitality.\u201d Walz also acknowledged the flags flying at half-staff in the Navajo Nation Veterans Memorial Park, where the event was held. \u201cThe Navajo Nation and the nation of the United States lost a treasure in John Kinsel Sr, one of the original Navajo Code Talkers,\u201d Walz said, noting the code talker who died last week at the age of 107. Navajo Nation president Buu Nygren, who invited the Harris-Walz campaign to visit the capital of the largest tribe in the United States, also spoke at the event. \u201cGovernor Walz coming here today recognizes the voice of Native Americans and the huge impact we will have at the polls this year,\u201d Nygren said. Walz\u2019s visit to the Navajo Nation comes as Kamala Harris is trailing in the polls in Arizona, a state that Biden famously won in 2020, largely due to the support of Native American voters. If Harris wins the election, making Walz her vice-president, Minnesota Lt Gov Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, would become the first Native American woman to serve as a state\u2019s governor. Democratic leaders have tried to make inroads among Native voters in recent weeks. On Friday, Biden traveled to the Gila River Indian Community outside Phoenix to apologize for the US government\u2019s role in forcing thousands of Native American children to attend Indian boarding schools \u2013 a policy which has been widely recognized as an element of genocide. And on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, the Democratic National Committee announced that it had launched a \u201csix-figure ad campaign\u201d aimed at turning out Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska. It is the party\u2019s third Native-focused campaign this year, and \u201cthe most the DNC has ever spent on a campaign targeting Native voters\u201d. An array of big tech executives have spoken with Donald Trump in recent days, seeking to rekindle their relationships with the ex-president as the possibility of his return to office hangs by a narrow margin, CNN reports. In recent weeks, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Amazon\u2019s Andy Jassy have all called Trump. Earlier this summer, Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg also reached out to Trump after his attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania. \u201cThere are some that seem to be waking up to the fact that like: \u2018Holy sh*t, this guy might get elected again. I don\u2019t want to have him, his administration, going after us,\u2019\u201d a person close to Trump told CNN. \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying out loud, I think they hear, and they\u2019re taking it seriously.\u201d As CNN reports: \u201cWhoever is sworn in next year will immediately face decisions over whether to continue President Joe Biden\u2019s crackdown on Big Tech.\u201d The Biden administration has gone after Apple and Google for violating antitrust laws in still pending lawsuits. Read more here: Campaigning in Nevada today, Tim Walz has criticized Donald Trump\u2019s planned rally at Madison Square Garden this evening as \u201ca direct parallel\u201d to a Nazi rally held at the venue in 1939. The comparison comes in the final days of a race where the Harris-Walz campaign has increasingly tried to draw attention to statements previous Trump appointees have made calling their former boss a \u201cfascist\u201d. On 20 February 1939, in the lead-up to the second world war, 20,000 people attended a pro-Hitler rally at Madison Square Garden organized by the German American Bund. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden. There\u2019s a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid 1930s,\u201d Walz said. \u201cDon\u2019t think that he doesn\u2019t know for one second exactly what they\u2019re doing there.\u201d Earlier this month, New York Democratic state senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, whose district includes the Garden, called on the venue to cancel the rally, saying: \u201cAllowing Trump to hold an event at MSG is equivalent to the infamous Nazis rally at Madison Square Garden on February 20, 1939.\u201d Here\u2019s Edward Helmore with more on the 1939 rally: Dan Osborn told ABC News on Sunday that he hopes to kick off a \u201cnational movement\u201d if his run for a US senate seat in Nebraska as an independent candidate topples Republican incumbent Deb Fischer. Describing himself as \u201cfrustrated\u201d with US politics\u2019 two-party system, Osborn has a slight edge \u2013 47.8% to 46.4% \u2013 over Fischer, according to a polling index from the Hill/Decision Desk HQ. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has shifted the contest toward Osborn, moving it from a solidly Republican race to one that now only leans in that direction, as the Hill noted. Osborn has gotten to this point while refusing all party endorsements, even as Democrats have supported his first-time candidacy. He has also effectively portrayed the two-term Fischer as someone beholden to so many interests that in one campaign ad Osborn argued that she should wear sponsorship patches like racecar drivers do. \u201cI think this is the start of something special,\u201d Osborn said Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cPeople are ready for it. And I want to be a part of it.\u201d Fischer\u2019s backers include the Republican White House nominee Donald Trump, who won all five of Nebraska\u2019s electoral college votes when he captured the presidency in 2016 and then took four as Joe Biden defeated him in 2020. The cornhusker state\u2019s two US senators and three US House representatives are all Republicans, making Osborn\u2019s credible challenge against Fischer that much more notable. Democrats and Republicans are, respectively, trying to defend 23 and 11 US Senate seats during the 5 November presidential election. And as ABC also noted, if he wins, Osborn could help decide which party controls the chamber depending with whom he chooses to caucus. Osborn is a Navy veteran and former union president who led a strike against the cereal giant Kellog\u2019s in 2021. In the final days of the 2024 election, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign has slowballed Joe Biden\u2019s offers to campaign for his vice-president, Axios reports. \u201cPresident Biden wants to campaign for Vice President Harris in the last days before the election,\u201d the outlet writes. \u201cHarris\u2019 campaign keeps responding: We\u2019ll get back to you, three people familiar with the dynamic told Axios.\u201d Although it\u2019s grateful for Biden\u2019s service, Harris\u2019s team is wary of aligning her with the increasingly unpopular president. \u201cHe\u2019s a reminder of the last four years, not the new way forward,\u201d a person familiar with the situation told Axios. Yesterday, Biden began campaigning for Harris on his own, attending union events in Pittsburgh. There, he reportedly called Republican White House nominee Donald Trump \u201ca loser as a candidate and \u2026 a loser as a man\u201d, among other remarks. Biden also called said the choice between Trump and Harris in the 5 November election was one of \u201cdecency versus lack of decency\u201d. Members of the president\u2019s team told Axios they believe Harris\u2019s campaign is underestimating the current president\u2019s appeal among white, working-class communities in the state where he was born. Epic scenes outside Madison Square Garden in New York where thousands of Maga supporters have descended to hear the former president speak this evening. Hours before Trump is scheduled on stage the streets of midtown Manhattan are packed. The main line of attendees, standing 20-wide, are filling an entire block of 33rd Street. Periodically they chant \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Go Trump!\u201d. Supporters are carrying placards saying \u201cPardon Trump Now\u201d and \u201cNever Surrender\u201d. A man paraded up and down the line carrying a sign saying \u201cFuck Kamala. We ain\u2019t voting for that hoe (sic)\u201d. Later, an imitator of the North Korean supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, walked the line giving a regal wave. A group of four women from Queens had travelled into Manhattan early, sitting for hours on camping chairs. Lori, who didn\u2019t want to give her last name, said she was passionate about Trump because of \u201ccrime, inflation, the border, lack of respect\u201d. What did she mean by lack of respect? \u201cIf you have a different political opinion you shouldn\u2019t be demonized.\u201d Lori said friends of hers in New York now shunned her after she became a Trump supporter. \u201cYou can\u2019t be mean to people,\u201d she said. But what about Trump, who regularly demeaned and belittled his rivals? \u201cHe\u2019s not mean, he\u2019s joking. It\u2019s like a nervous twitch,\u201d she said. Donald Trump will also air a campaign ad during the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 game today, competing with Kamala Harris\u2019s new ad aimed at turning out Pennsylvania voters. According to the Trump campaign, the two-minute ad will air during the third quarter of the Eagles\u2019 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, which gets under way at 1pm ET. The ad, entitled Never Quit, features the voices of Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Trump\u2019s two elder sons. \u201cPresident Trump is literally putting his life on the line. and he\u2019s willing to risk it all because he loves this country,\u201d White says in the ad. The dueling campaign ads come as polls suggest a neck-and-neck race in Pennsylvania, which could serve as the tipping point state in the electoral college. Following her appearance at a predominantly Black church in Philadelphia this morning, Kamala Harris has just visited Philly Cuts, a barbershop not far from the west Philadelphia church. From a barbershop chair, Harris answered questions from several young Black men, including about student loan debt, in a conversation moderated by Pennsylvania state representative Jordan Harris. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Andrew Lawrence with more about Harris\u2019s strategy of campaigning at barbershops: Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are blazing into the final full week before the election with plans to visit all seven battleground states in four days. The final sprint will be anchored by an address on the Ellipse near the White House on Tuesday where she will deliver what her campaign has described as the candidate\u2019s \u201cclosing argument\u201d. Along the way, Harris and Walz will be joined by musical artists and celebrities, the campaign said, including Maggie Rogers, Man\u00e1, Gracie Abrams, Los Tigres del Norte, Mumford &amp; Sons, Remi Wolf, and The National\u2019s Matt Berninger and Aaron Dessner. Harris\u2019s team argues that their star power can help mobilize and motivate voters who have yet to cast ballots and possibly even reach Americans who have tuned out. Harris is in Pennsylvania today while Trump holds a rally at Madison Square garden in New York. On Monday she will head back to Michigan, overlapping with Walz who will also be in Wisconsin. On Tuesday, she will speak in Washington DC while Walz heads to Georgia. On Wednesday, they will both travel to North Carolina while she stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Then on Thursday she heads west to Arizona and Nevada while he returns to the midwest. Buckle up! As Kamala Harris campaigns across Philadelphia today, her campaign has released a new ad scheduled to air this afternoon during the Eagles\u2019 game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The campaign has also released a second ad geared at Pittsburgh Steelers fans, which will air during the team\u2019s game tomorrow night. At a rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan last night, former first lady Michelle Obama made a strong appeal to men that reproductive justice matters for them too. Here\u2019s Lauren Gambino with more: Directing her comments to the \u201cmen who love us\u201d, Obama asked them to consider the harm that is done when a government \u201ckeeps revoking the basic care from its women\u201d. Earlier this month, Barack Obama delivered a stern message for Black men in his first campaign event for Harris, telling them to drop the \u201cexcuses\u201d and support her. Michelle Obama tried a different tack \u2013 asking American men to listen to women this election. Obama\u2019s appeal reflected the gaping gender divide between the candidates, with women powering Harris and men turning to Trump. She acknowledged the challenges facing the country, and conceded that progress could be too slow, but she argued that sitting out or voting third-party was not the answer. Read the full story here: Following the news that the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times will not endorse a presidential candidate this year, the New York Times opinion section has published a full page image reminding readers that it endorsed Kamala Harris last month. \u201cDonald Trump says he will prosecute his enemies, order mass deportations, use soldiers against citizens, abandon allies, play politics with disasters. Believe him,\u201d the full page endorsement reads. Earlier this week, our own editorial page strongly endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here\u2019s our editor Betsy Reed with more on media ownership and democracy: In a second morning show appearance this morning, JD Vance refused to call Russia an \u201cenemy\u201d and again called John Kelly a \u201cdisgruntled ex-employee\u201d. Speaking on Meet the Press, Vance said Russian president Vladimir Putin was \u201cclearly an adversary\u201d but \u201cwe have to be smart about diplomacy\u201d, and criticized the former Trump administration officials who have called the ex-president a fascist. Vance also said that a Trump-Vance administration would \u201cstay in NATO\u201d and explained that Donald Trump\u2019s earlier comments on eliminating a federal income tax earlier this week were an \u201caspirational goal\u201d. In an appearance on Meet the Press this morning, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said that while he doesn\u2019t like to use words like \u201cfascist\u201d, Trump has a \u201cstrong tendency toward authoritarianism.\u201d \u201cThis is a guy who provoked an insurrection in January, January 6, 2021, to prevent, for the first time in American history, a peaceful transfer of power,\u201d he said. Sanders also spoke about Elon Musk\u2019s alleged contacts with Russian president Vladimir Putin (\u201cWhat really interests me is if ... Trump were to win, whether it would be Elon Musk running the government and Trump working for him or the other way around.\u201d) and the war in Gaza (\u201cTrump is even worse on this issue. ... While I disagree with Biden and Harris \u2014 they are still better.\u201d). In a separate appearance on ABC, billionaire and Democratic supporter Mark Cuban echoed Sanders, saying Trump \u201cabsolutely\u201d has \u201cfascist tendencies\u201d. Campaigning in Philadelphia today, Kamala Harris has started her day by delivering remarks at the Church of Christian Compassion, a Black church in west Philadelphia. Speaking about the Apostle Paul, Harris said, \u201cPaul understood something profound. I believe, pastor, that God\u2019s power doesn\u2019t just work for us, it also works within us.\u201d \u201cWhat feeds my spirit \u2014 I see faith in action all over. Everywhere I go,\u201d she told attendees. \u201cI see a nation determined to turn the page on hatred.\u201d After her remarks, the pastor told congregants that there would be a bus outside to take people to the polls, CNN reports. \u201cThere are 20 buses at places of faith all over the city of Philadelphia,\u201d he added. In an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union this morning, JD Vance and host Jake Tapper had a heated exchange over statements former Trump administration officials have made calling the ex-president a fascist. \u201cSo all those 10 people, including the former vice president Mike Pence, all of these people have this horribly damaged worldview, and they\u2019re all just going after Donald Trump because they want to send people into war? That\u2019s really your argument?\u201d Tapper said. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Vance answered. \u201cAbsolutely that\u2019s my argument.\u201d \u201cThese aren\u2019t conservative Republicans who are concerned about Donald Trump? They\u2019re not? That\u2019s not right?\u201d Tapper asked. \u201cAll of these people, Jake, they came into office thinking that they could control Donald Trump. That when he said he wanted peace in the world--\u201d \u201cMike Pence thought he could control Donald Trump?\u201d \u201cYes, he did. And when he found out, when he found out that he couldn\u2019t, they all turned on Donald Trump, and a lot of them got fired.\u201d Good morning, Cecilia Nowell here today bringing you the latest news of the 2024 election as it happens. As Kamala Harris and Donald Trump prepare to make their closing arguments, Harris is heading today to Philadelphia to campaign \u201cneighborhood-to-neighborhood\u201d while Trump gears up for a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Here are some of the other headlines we\u2019re tracking: JD Vance and Liz Cheney spoke on CNN\u2019s State of the Union this morning about recent comments from former Donald Trump staffers that the ex-president has authoritarian tendencies. Vance denounced the former Trump officials as bitter about being fired, while Cheney criticized Vance for his own past comments on Trump: \u201cI think what we just watched is what it looks like when someone has got to go through just unbelievable contortions to try to find a way to defend the person that JD Vance himself called \u2018America\u2019s Hitler.\u2019\u201d In an interview that aired this morning on CBS, Kamala Harris described her choice to deliver her closing argument speech at The Ellipse, a park near the White House, on Tuesday \u2013 one week before the election. \u201cI\u2019m doing it there because I think it\u2019s very important for the American people to see and think about who will be occupying that space on Jan. 20th,\u201d she said. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Week\u201d this morning also discussing comments from past Trump administration officials calling the ex-president a fascist. \u201cHow about a little self-reflection about the job you did before you criticize others,\u201d he said.\" Michelle Obama joined Kamala Harris for a rally yesterday focused on reproductive freedom in Kalamazoo, Michigan (or as Obama called it, \u201cKamala-zoo\u201d). The former first lady and the vice-president emphasized the stakes for abortion and reproductive healthcare if Donald Trump is re-elected. Earlier in the day, Harris spoke with reproductive healthcare providers at a clinic in Portage, Michigan. On the first day of early voting in Michigan, Donald Trump also held a rally in Michigan. At an event in Novi, the ex-president was joined on stage by several imams and other leaders of the state\u2019s large Muslim and Arab American community, who denounced Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza. Later in the evening, Trump spoke at a second event in State College, Pennsylvania, where he again promised to ban sanctuary cities and launch a massive deportation program all while unleashing more personal attacks against Harris. The Washington Post\u2019s and Los Angeles Times\u2019 decisions not to endorse a presidential candidate has sparked furor (and a slew of resignations) among the papers\u2019 staff.",

The capacity rally at the Garden \u2013 something Trump had talked about for years \u2013 was essentially a reboot of the Republican national convention this summer, widely seen as Trump\u2019s most confident moment. Trump had the more polished speakers from the convention double down on crude and xenophobic rhetoric, while he had Hulk Hogan rip his shirt on stage again, and got Melania Trump to appear again. The rally was a safe space for Trump and the campaign to lean into their most caustic impulses: speakers falsely saying Kamala Harris allowed migrants to \u201crape and kill\u201d Americans or questioning whether Harris was Black or \u201cSamoan-Malaysian\u201d. There was nothing about trying to broaden his base. The rhetoric of Trump and his speakers was designed to give the crowd what they wanted to hear, doubling down on immigration rhetoric which Trump thinks his supporters love to hear the most. That disinterest to reach undecided voters by moderating the rhetoric also underscored the confidence of the Trump team with fewer than nine days until the election \u2013 they have long seen their path to victory as juicing turnout. The Trump team in recent days have in hushed whispers suggested privately they might even get close to winning the popular vote, which Trump lost in 2016, describing him as a comeback story with momentum on his side. Here are the key takeaways from perhaps Trump\u2019s final major rally before election day: Racist and crude remarks Trump\u2019s warm-up speakers appeared to feel particularly emboldened to take shots at Latinos and African Americans at the rally, in an apparent attempt to copy the former president.

But Trump has noted to advisers his crowds seem most energized when he talks about deporting illegal immigrants, and his speech repeatedly veered back to immigration even as he touched on other campaign messaging. Light on economic agenda Trump kept himself disciplined enough to throw out a new economic promise as he competes with Harris to increase disposable incomes for Americans: to introduce a new tax credit for family caregivers. He also promised to cut energy prices in half if he was re-elected and to lower corporate tax rates for businesses. Trump was again light on details for his economic agenda, given changes to the tax code would require the approval of Congress and it is unclear whether Republicans will retain control of the House or take the Senate majority.",

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday sought to clarify comments he had made during a summit earlier in the week, insisting that he was not favouring Russia over Ukraine. \u201cIn declaring President Putin and the people of Russia as \u2018valuable friends and allies\u2019, President Ramaphosa was not projecting any particular country or block of countries as the enemy,\u201d his office said in a statement. \u201cIt is through the policy of non-alignment that South Africa has been able to constructively engage with both Russia and Ukraine,\u201d the statement said. Two civilians were killed in Russian attacks on Sunday in Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region, which is split by the frontline and regularly hit by Russian artillery, drones and missiles, the regional governor said. An elderly man was killed after explosives were dropped on him from a drone and another man was killed by artillery fire, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on the Telegram messenger. Russia said Sunday its military had advanced further in east Ukraine, capturing a frontline village just a few kilometres north of a key Ukrainian-held industrial hub. Moscow has made steady gains on the battlefield for months, pressing their advantage against overstretched and outmanned Ukrainian forces. Russian army units \u201cliberated the settlement of Izmailovka,\u201d the Russian defence ministry said in a daily briefing, using the Russian spelling for the village. Izmailivka had a population of just under 200 people before the conflict.",

On average, they take 184 private jet flights in a single year, spending 425 hours in the air. This produced as much carbon as the average person in the world would in 300 years. Their luxury yachts emitted as much carbon as the average person would in 860 years.</p>    <p>The Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s two private jets spent nearly 25 days in the air over a 12-month period and released as much carbon as a US Amazon employee would emit in 207 years.</p> <p>Two jets of Elon Musk, the second richest person in the world and Tesla chief, jointly discharged as much CO<sub>2</sub> in the same period as 834 years\u2019 worth of emissions generated by an average person.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the three yachts of the Walton family, heirs of the Walmart retail chain, had a combined carbon footprint in one year of 18,000 tonnes \u2013 an amount similar to that of 1,714 Walmart shopworkers.</p> <p>Ahead of the Labour government\u2019s first budget statement on Wednesday, Oxfam is calling on the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to increase taxes on \u201cclimate-polluting extreme wealth\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/18/superyacht-private-jet-oxfam-climate-finance\">starting with private jets and superyachts</a>, to raise funds which could be used to tackle the climate crisis.</p> <p>In response, a UK Treasury spokesperson said \u201cWe do not comment on speculation around tax changes outside of fiscal events\u201d.</p> <p>The Oxfam researchers developed a methodology for calculating the emissions from yachts that included data on the size of the vessel, engine specifications, fuel type, hours at sea and even generators for hot tubs and air conditioning for helicopter hangars.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the key findings for us is that superyachts are by far the most polluting toy that a billionaire can own, except perhaps for a rocket ship,\u201d said Alex Maitland, one of the authors of the report.</p> <p>Far more destructive still are the greenhouse gas emissions from the investments of the ultra-rich, which are 340 times higher than the CO<sub>2</sub> from their yachts and jets.</p> <p>On average, the portfolios of the 50 billionaires in the study were almost twice as polluting as an investment in the main US stock index.

      "bodyText": "The high carbon emissions of the world\u2019s richest 1% are worsening hunger, poverty and excess deaths, a report has found. Owing to luxury yachts, private jets and investments in polluting industries, the consumption of the world\u2019s wealthiest people is also making it increasingly difficult to limit global heating to 1.5C. If everyone on Earth emitted planet-warming gases at the same rate as the average billionaire, the remaining carbon budget to stay within 1.5C would be gone in less than two days, the Oxfam analysis said, rather than current estimates of four years if carbon emissions remain as they are today. Preceding a budget in the UK, a presidential election in the US and the Cop29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, the anti-poverty group\u2019s examination of carbon inequality calls on governments to tax the super-rich in order to curtail excessive consumption and generate revenue for the transition to clean energy, and to compensate those worst affected by global heating. Oxfam\u2019s research found that fifty of the world\u2019s richest billionaires produce on average more carbon emissions in under three hours than the average British person does in their entire lifetime. On average, they take 184 private jet flights in a single year, spending 425 hours in the air. This produced as much carbon as the average person in the world would in 300 years. Their luxury yachts emitted as much carbon as the average person would in 860 years. The Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s two private jets spent nearly 25 days in the air over a 12-month period and released as much carbon as a US Amazon employee would emit in 207 years. Two jets of Elon Musk, the second richest person in the world and Tesla chief, jointly discharged as much CO2 in the same period as 834 years\u2019 worth of emissions generated by an average person. Meanwhile, the three yachts of the Walton family, heirs of the Walmart retail chain, had a combined carbon footprint in one year of 18,000 tonnes \u2013 an amount similar to that of 1,714 Walmart shopworkers. Ahead of the Labour government\u2019s first budget statement on Wednesday, Oxfam is calling on the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to increase taxes on \u201cclimate-polluting extreme wealth\u201d, starting with private jets and superyachts, to raise funds which could be used to tackle the climate crisis. In response, a UK Treasury spokesperson said \u201cWe do not comment on speculation around tax changes outside of fiscal events\u201d. The Oxfam researchers developed a methodology for calculating the emissions from yachts that included data on the size of the vessel, engine specifications, fuel type, hours at sea and even generators for hot tubs and air conditioning for helicopter hangars. \u201cOne of the key findings for us is that superyachts are by far the most polluting toy that a billionaire can own, except perhaps for a rocket ship,\u201d said Alex Maitland, one of the authors of the report. Far more destructive still are the greenhouse gas emissions from the investments of the ultra-rich, which are 340 times higher than the CO2 from their yachts and jets. On average, the portfolios of the 50 billionaires in the study were almost twice as polluting as an investment in the main US stock index. Almost 40% of their shareholdings were in emissions-intensive industries such as oil, mining, shipping and cement. Many of these companies also hire lobbyists and marketing professionals to delay or disrupt action on the climate. Oxfam says investment is also the area that has the greatest potential for positive change because, unlike most poor and middle-income people, billionaires have a choice about how to use their money. If they were to switch their holdings into low-carbon-intensity funds, their investment emissions would be 13 times lower. The report also projects the deadly consequences of carbon inequality: in the coming century, 1.5 million excess deaths will be caused by the consumption emissions of the richest 1% \u2013 those with incomes of at least $140,000 (\u00a3108,000) \u2013 between 2015\u201319. It says the past three decades of consumption emissions of this wealthy group have caused global economic output to fall by $2.9tn and crop losses equivalent to the calorific needs of 14.5 million people a year. Chiara Liguori, Oxfam\u2019s senior climate justice policy adviser, said: \u201cThe evidence is clear: the extreme emissions of the richest, from their luxury lifestyles and even more from their polluting investments, are fuelling inequality, hunger and threatening lives. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unfair that their reckless pollution is fuelling the very crisis threatening our collective future \u2013 it\u2019s lethal.\u201d The findings are the latest in a series of annual carbon inequality reports by Oxfam. As the Guardian reported last year, the wealthiest 1% \u2013 who tend to live climate-insulated, air-conditioned lives, mostly in the global north \u2013 produce as much carbon pollution as the 5 billion people who make up the poorest and most vulnerable two-thirds of the human population, who predominantly live in poorer countries in the global south. The latest report stresses the need to address the climate and inequality crises alongside carbon taxes on high-emitting industries, higher income taxes on the super-rich and restrictions on the use of private jets and luxury yachts. Liguori said: \u201cThis report shows that fairer taxes on extreme wealth are crucial to accelerate climate action and fight inequality \u2013 starting with private jets and super-yachts. \u201cIt\u2019s clear these luxury toys aren\u2019t just symbols of excess; they\u2019re a direct threat to people and the planet.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024 to remove the Stockholm Environment Institute as being one of the organisations involved in producing the latest annual carbon inequality report.",
