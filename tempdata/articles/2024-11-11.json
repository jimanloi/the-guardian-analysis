In light of reports they are seeking increases above 5%, it is worth remembering that private health insurance is a terrible way to deliver good health outcomes. You can\u2019t say public policy is always worse in America, but aside from how they conduct elections, the one policy the US does worse than anywhere else is healthcare.

Although the introduction of the Affordable Care Act has shifted some private health insurance from voluntary to compulsory, the nation still massively relies on a system designed to profit from people\u2019s ill heath: If the graph does not display click here This brings us to the recent reports of private health insurance companies lobbying the Albanese government for premium increases of between 5% and 6% next year.

In the time since, during which we have experienced the greatest health crisis in a century, nothing has really changed the answer. Not only does it remain untrue that private health insurance takes stress off the public system, it also remains a fib to call it private \u2013 it\u2019s a public system merely carried out in an inefficient manner to deliver a product most people don\u2019t want and haven\u2019t ever wanted. In the late 1990s, after 15 or so years of Medicare, fewer than a third of Australians held private health insurance.

These rebates are quite pricey \u2013 the government this year will spend about $7.5bn on them. It did bugger all \u2013 you literally could not pay people to buy it. Howard returned to the stick and in 2000 effectively forced people to join by 31 years of age with \u201clifetime health cover\u201d \u2013 a program that was accompanied by TV ads showing everyone standing under umbrellas because apparently more people taking out private health insurance made us all better off. In reality it was just the health insurers who were better off when people decided they should join because they might one day want it when they were older: If the graph does not display click here Since then, we have had more sticks and carrots \u2013 changes to the surcharges and rebates, and then in 2019 even a discount for people aged 18-29. The result is still fewer than half the population covered by private health.

In 2018 the Morrison government introduced changes that increased the \u201cmaximum voluntary excess levels for products providing individuals an exemption from the Medicare levy surcharge\u201d. Whereas in 1999, 95% of people had private health insurance with no exclusions, now 65% of policies have exclusions in which various items will not be covered. So we have had 25 years of carrots and sticks, all designed to make private health insurance more attractive, and we\u2019ve ended up with fewer people having such insurance and more people not being covered for everything and likely having to pay when they access it. And all the while the premiums have risen roughly 60% more than wages have. At some point a health minister might ponder that if people prefer the public health system, then maybe government should just fund it better and stop pretending subsidised private health delivers much other than a dud product that most people don\u2019t want and hate even when they have it.

They have got several of their most difficult away fixtures out of the way \u2013 against Manchester City, Tottenham, Newcastle, Aston Villa and Chelsea. Mikel Arteta is unbeaten at Stamford Bridge in six visits as the Arsenal manager and a draw there can rarely be described as a bad result. It was put to Merino that the context made it feel more disappointing.</p> <p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Merino said. \u201cYou have to look at it all \u2013 not only the result. But at the same time look at where the team is coming from, how the team is playing and I think it was a day to be very proud of the guys.

      "bodyText": "Mikel Merino insists Arsenal will thrive on the pressure of their bid to win the Premier League and has cited the late push in Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Chelsea as evidence of their character. Arsenal conceded Pedro Neto\u2019s equaliser in the 70th minute and having been in poor form since the middle of October, it may have been the trigger for them to go under. They had taken one point from three league games and lost at Inter in the Champions League last Wednesday. Arsenal stabilised and created a clutch of openings in the closing stages, especially when the substitute Leandro Trossard touched just wide from a William Saliba cross, with Kai Havertz well placed behind him. The offside flag went up against Saliba; it was tight and would surely have been reviewed by the video assistant referee. Arsenal trail the leaders, Liverpool, by nine points. They have got several of their most difficult away fixtures out of the way \u2013 against Manchester City, Tottenham, Newcastle, Aston Villa and Chelsea. Mikel Arteta is unbeaten at Stamford Bridge in six visits as the Arsenal manager and a draw there can rarely be described as a bad result. It was put to Merino that the context made it feel more disappointing. \u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Merino said. \u201cYou have to look at it all \u2013 not only the result. But at the same time look at where the team is coming from, how the team is playing and I think it was a day to be very proud of the guys. We did an amazing job after a difficult couple of weeks with a lot of injuries. \u201cThe mentality and the character that these guys are showing is just unbelievable. You can see it, just after conceding a goal away from home, against a team who is normally dominant, and you are the ones who are dictating the tempo and attacking and creating the chances. This is a big sign of what this team is about. \u201cIf you want to be in a big club, if you want to achieve big things, you have to love the pressure.

      "bodyText": "A historic bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales will set out hardline safeguards, including lengthy prison sentences for coercion and powers for judges to cross-examine patients. The Labour MP Kim Leadbeater said she believed she had put forward \u201cthe best possible legislation\u201d but warned wavering MPs that parliament may not get a chance to vote again on the issue for another decade. She pledged it would contain the \u201cstrictest protections and safeguards of any legislation anywhere in the world\u201d amid growing concerns from some MPs over the potential for mission creep and coercion. On the day of the bill\u2019s publication, Keir Starmer said he would be studying the safeguards in the bill closely but said he wanted the issue to be a genuine free vote. Speaking to reporters in Baku, where he is attending the Cop29 climate summit, the prime minister, who has previously been a vocal champion of the change, declined to make a specific commitment on the way he would vote. Asked on Tuesday to guarantee that the prime minister would vote when the bill comes before the Commons, his official spokesperson refused to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a free vote and I mean that. It will be for every MP to decide for themselves how they want to vote. I\u2019m not going to be putting any pressure whatsoever on Labour MPs. They will be making their own mind up, as I will be,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously a lot will depend on the detail and we need to get the balance right but I\u2019ve always argued there will need to be proper safeguards in place.\u201d The bill is expected to run to 40 pages \u2013 believed to be one of the longest ever private members\u2019 bills \u2013 and Leadbeater will stress to colleagues over the coming days that the bill has been the subject of exhaustive consultation. But critics in parliament have raised the alarm about the process of the bill, which has limited time for debate, and many have significant concerns about the potential for undue pressure and the risk of the scope of the bill widening under legal challenges. Setting out the detail for the first time on Monday, Leadbeater\u2019s bill will say: Patients must be over 18, have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. They must express a \u201cclear, settled and informed\u201d wish in two separate witnessed declarations. Two independent doctors must be satisfied that the person is eligible. The application must be approved by a high court judge who would hear from at least one of the doctors and may question the patient or anyone else involved. Medicine must be self-administered with doctors banned from assisting. Coercion of a patient would be a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Some critics of the bill, however, have said there are still questions over the safeguards \u2013 and have said there must be provisions against \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d if patients do not get the preferred answer from their first choice of medic. They are also expecting to ask questions as to whether a six-month prognosis includes those refusing treatment and whether doctors will have an assumption of mental capacity. An even more hardline approach would require a patient to be cross-examined in court by an advocate who would put the case before a judge for refusing the procedure. Leadbeater said the vote on 29 November would be only the first step and would allow the bill to receive further scrutiny at later stages. In comments responding to criticism over the lack of scrutiny of the bill, Leadbeater said it had been a \u201cthorough and robust process\u201d involving medical and legal experts, the palliative care and hospice sectors, and disability rights activists and faith leaders, as well as those with personal experience of watching a loved one die in difficult circumstances. She said MPs still had three weeks to look at the bill before debate and added: \u201cI hope MPs will agree with me that we can offer the safest choice to those who want it at the end of their lives, while at the same time working to make our already excellent palliative care provision even better and protecting the rights of people with disabilities, mental illness and other challenges to have all the support and care they need throughout their lives,\u201d she said. The pro-assisted dying side in parliament has an organised system, with designated MPs running the numbers for each of the parliamentary intakes. Those who have seen the most recent tallies say there are a number of members they expect to make final decisions within days of seeing the bill. \u201cFor some it is a principle about not saying yes until they have seen the legislation,\u201d one supportive MP said. MPs with concerns about the process and potential widening of the scope of the legislation are being invited this week to meet Dr Sally Talbot, one of the architects of assisted dying in Western Australia and a member of the panel undertaking review of the law. Those against the bill have been hosting events with a number of disabled parliamentarians who oppose the changes, including the peer Tanni Grey-Thompson and Pam Duncan-Glancy, a Scottish Labour MSP, as well as academics and lawyers who have concerns about the process. There are believed to be at least 100 Labour MPs who remain undecided and both sides say the numbers are a real unknown, with a significant number declining to attend any of the parliamentary events run from either side. Some said the arguments in private and in parliament were becoming more bitter \u2013 with a deep resentment from many of the MPs who are opposed to the change at being lumped together with religious objectors who also campaign against abortion. \u201cWe do not want this to turn into a culture war,\u201d said one Labour MP who is opposed to the change. While there are high-profile cabinet ministers, including the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, opposed to the law change, MPs have been told the majority of the cabinet intend to back the bill, although they have been warned from becoming too involved in the debate on a free vote. There are some influential names who remain undecided however, including the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the home secretary, Yvette Cooper. Sarah Wootton of Dignity in Dying, which campaigns for a change in the law, said the bill was \u201cthe strongest proposal parliament has ever considered on improving choice and protections for dying people\u201d. It was \u201ca practical, UK model for law change that will end the cruel and dangerous status quo, while introducing new safety measures,\u201d she added. \u201cThree-quarters of the public agree that this is the right law for the UK, no matter where they live or who they vote for. Many have experienced the devastating effects of banning this option: witnessing prolonged, traumatic deaths despite the best care, or terminally ill relatives taking matters into their own hands at home or abroad.\u201d Gordon Macdonald, of Care Not Killing, which opposes the legislation, said the bill was being \u201crushed with indecent haste and ignores the deep-seated problems in the UK\u2019s broken and patchy palliative care system and the crisis in social care\u201d.",

It\u2019s full of politicians, for a start, and they\u2019re talking. It\u2019s fascinating how unbearable almost every single one is, no matter where you sit on the political spectrum. The first instalment of the two-part documentary, Immigration: How British Politics Failed, fields Tony Blair, Nigel Farage, Suella Braverman, David Cameron and Michael Howard \u2026 It\u2019s like there\u2019s no safe place to rest your eyes, ears or brain, as they bloviate or simply recreate \u2013 alongside archive news footage and tabloid headlines \u2013 the lowlights of the past few decades, over the question of how many people, for what reason and with what motivation we should take in from other countries.</p> <p>We begin in 1997, when New Labour swept to power, many of us were still up for Portillo, and things could only get better. Remember that? I know. Insert as many pauses for hollow laughter hereafter as you require. The new government is determined that the economy should grow, and so in order to address the skills shortage hindering the isle\u2019s path to success, it \u201copens the door to the whole world\u201d according to Farage. \u201cThe idea that we had some sort of open door policy is absolute nonsense,\u201d says Blair.

It\u2019s full of politicians, for a start, and they\u2019re talking. It\u2019s fascinating how unbearable almost every single one is, no matter where you sit on the political spectrum. The first instalment of the two-part documentary, Immigration: How British Politics Failed, fields Tony Blair, Nigel Farage, Suella Braverman, David Cameron and Michael Howard \u2026 It\u2019s like there\u2019s no safe place to rest your eyes, ears or brain, as they bloviate or simply recreate \u2013 alongside archive news footage and tabloid headlines \u2013 the lowlights of the past few decades, over the question of how many people, for what reason and with what motivation we should take in from other countries. We begin in 1997, when New Labour swept to power, many of us were still up for Portillo, and things could only get better. Remember that? I know. Insert as many pauses for hollow laughter hereafter as you require. The new government is determined that the economy should grow, and so in order to address the skills shortage hindering the isle\u2019s path to success, it \u201copens the door to the whole world\u201d according to Farage. \u201cThe idea that we had some sort of open door policy is absolute nonsense,\u201d says Blair. And we\u2019re off to the depressing races. Soon entering the picture is Lord Andrew Green, the founder and chair of MigrationWatch, which he set up in 2001 to monitor Labour\u2019s immigration policies and research their effects.

The series drafts in some of the journalists and editors of newspapers covering this increasingly defining plank of Labour policy as the 2005 general election approaches. Labour wins a third term with a tellingly reduced majority. Cameron becomes Tory leader, while Gordon Brown leads Labour. Almost everyone interviewed now remains entrenched in their former positions.

      "body": "<p>Ministers are to intervene in the management of Tower Hamlets after inspectors raised the alarm about the leadership of the east London authority\u2019s controversial mayor, Lutfur Rahman.</p> <p>Sources have told the Guardian the government has decided to appoint an envoy to monitor management decisions at the council, which has been dogged by a series of controversies about public spending and senior-level appointments.</p> <p>The decision, which will be announced on Tuesday morning, is a blow for Rahman, who was re-elected as mayor in 2022 after serving a five-year ban from high office for corrupt practices. The announcement will follow the publication of what is expected to be a highly critical report into the financial and personnel management of the council, which was commissioned by the previous government.</p> <p>The envoy and their assistant will keep a close watch on the decisions made by Rahman and his team, before reporting back to the department. Officials are understood to have referred to this in communication as a \u201csupport package\u201d to help the authority make improvements.</p> <p>Tower Hamlets and the government declined to comment.</p> <p>The Conservative government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68372130\">appointed inspectors</a> earlier this year to scrutinise the management of the east London borough, after the Local Government Association flagged numerous concerns with how it was being run.</p> <p>At the time, Rahman said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision but pledged to \u201ccooperate fully with the process\u201d.</p> <p>The LGA said in a <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/our-support/council-assurance-and-peer-support/peer-challenges-we-offer/corporate-peer-115#43-governance-and-culture\">report</a>: \u201cThere is a lack of trust between the mayor\u2019s office and senior officers, with examples of inappropriate questioning and pressure to feed things into the mayor\u2019s office for \u2018sign off\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It also warned: \u201cThere is a large number of agency and interim staff, with vacancies in key positions that need high-quality permanent appointments.\u201d</p> <p>The government also asked the inspectors to look at \u201cthe use of resources for elections and the maintenance of the independence of the returning officer, and the arrangements to bring services such as Tower Hamlets Homes and leisure services in house\u201d.</p> <p>Officials warned at the time there was a danger of \u201creplicating\u201d the circumstances that led to Rahman being banned from office for five years.</p> <p>Months after Rahman was re-elected in 2014, the then communities secretary, Eric Pickles, took over the administration of the council after his government department found evidence of a \u201ccrony culture\u201d under Rahman.</p> <p>Pickles told the Commons at the time that Rahman had dispensed public money like a \u201cmedieval monarch\u201d and oversaw an administration that was \u201cat best dysfunctional, at worst riddled with cronyism and corruption\u201d. He said grants were distributed without rationale, clear objectives, monitoring or transparency.</p> <p>Rahman was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32428648\">removed from office</a> in 2015 and banned for five years from standing for mayor after an election commissioner found him guilty of election fraud. He was also found in a civil finding personally guilty of corrupt and illegal practices.</p> <p>The mayor and his supporters were found to have used religious intimidation through local imams and vote-rigging, as well as falsely branding his Labour rival a racist to gain power.</p> <p>In 2020, he returned to local politics through Aspire, a new party that included some of his old political allies. In 2022, he stood as a candidate in the mayoral election in Tower Hamlets and won in the second round with 54.9%. A year later he re-appointed Steve Halsey, one of his most senior officials from his last time in office, as the authority\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>Aspire recently lost its majority after <a href=\"https://www.thnews.co.uk/aspire-party-loses-majority-on-tower-hamlets-council-following-resignations/\">several councillors resigned</a> from the party.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ministers are to intervene in the management of Tower Hamlets after inspectors raised the alarm about the leadership of the east London authority\u2019s controversial mayor, Lutfur Rahman. Sources have told the Guardian the government has decided to appoint an envoy to monitor management decisions at the council, which has been dogged by a series of controversies about public spending and senior-level appointments. The decision, which will be announced on Tuesday morning, is a blow for Rahman, who was re-elected as mayor in 2022 after serving a five-year ban from high office for corrupt practices. The announcement will follow the publication of what is expected to be a highly critical report into the financial and personnel management of the council, which was commissioned by the previous government. The envoy and their assistant will keep a close watch on the decisions made by Rahman and his team, before reporting back to the department. Officials are understood to have referred to this in communication as a \u201csupport package\u201d to help the authority make improvements. Tower Hamlets and the government declined to comment. The Conservative government appointed inspectors earlier this year to scrutinise the management of the east London borough, after the Local Government Association flagged numerous concerns with how it was being run. At the time, Rahman said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision but pledged to \u201ccooperate fully with the process\u201d. The LGA said in a report: \u201cThere is a lack of trust between the mayor\u2019s office and senior officers, with examples of inappropriate questioning and pressure to feed things into the mayor\u2019s office for \u2018sign off\u2019.\u201d It also warned: \u201cThere is a large number of agency and interim staff, with vacancies in key positions that need high-quality permanent appointments.\u201d The government also asked the inspectors to look at \u201cthe use of resources for elections and the maintenance of the independence of the returning officer, and the arrangements to bring services such as Tower Hamlets Homes and leisure services in house\u201d. Officials warned at the time there was a danger of \u201creplicating\u201d the circumstances that led to Rahman being banned from office for five years. Months after Rahman was re-elected in 2014, the then communities secretary, Eric Pickles, took over the administration of the council after his government department found evidence of a \u201ccrony culture\u201d under Rahman. Pickles told the Commons at the time that Rahman had dispensed public money like a \u201cmedieval monarch\u201d and oversaw an administration that was \u201cat best dysfunctional, at worst riddled with cronyism and corruption\u201d. He said grants were distributed without rationale, clear objectives, monitoring or transparency. Rahman was removed from office in 2015 and banned for five years from standing for mayor after an election commissioner found him guilty of election fraud. He was also found in a civil finding personally guilty of corrupt and illegal practices. The mayor and his supporters were found to have used religious intimidation through local imams and vote-rigging, as well as falsely branding his Labour rival a racist to gain power. In 2020, he returned to local politics through Aspire, a new party that included some of his old political allies. In 2022, he stood as a candidate in the mayoral election in Tower Hamlets and won in the second round with 54.9%. A year later he re-appointed Steve Halsey, one of his most senior officials from his last time in office, as the authority\u2019s chief executive. Aspire recently lost its majority after several councillors resigned from the party.",

Coote has made a massive fool of himself in a way that\u2019s actually difficult to comprehend. In the third decade of the 21st century, a man in his late 30s was willing to go on camera and say ugly and most likely&nbsp;defamatory things about one of the biggest names in football and the club he worked for, which also happens to be one of the biggest institutions in the game. To say it was naive for Coote to imagine these remarks would never become public would be unfair to those who believe in the tooth fairy. It\u2019s not just naive, it\u2019s dumb, and it might even be arrogant too (a quality Coote is on record as deploring). A second video, in which Coote apparently instructs his unknown audience not to share the video \u2013 \u201cjust to be clear this video can\u2019t go anywhere \u2026 seriously\u201d \u2013 is the sort of thing that has me making the chef\u2019s kiss gesture even as I write.</p> <p>Coote by all accounts has done a half-decent job over his six seasons as part of the select group of English referees. He\u2019s refereed one international fixture: Armenia v Estonia in the 2020 Nations League.</p> <p>He took charge of the Carabao Cup final two seasons ago, his most senior appointment and an occasion that passed off smoothly. Indeed it was not his refereeing but his turns as VAR that appear to have riled Klopp when he was Liverpool manager: a failure to intervene over the Jordan Pickford challenge that ruptured Virgil van Dijk\u2019s ACL being the most prominent cause of complaint. Any suggestion that Coote was biased or out of his depth was generally lacking from the discourse before now. No longer.</p>    <p>And that\u2019s the bigger problem with what Coote did. He let himself down, he let the game down, but he\u2019s also chucked a whole scuttle\u2019s worth of coal on to the flames of conspiracy. In the present day, fantasising about how the powers-that-be are biased against your team is a popular way of filling the hours between matches. Not just fans either, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/21/var-is-a-luton-fan-nottingham-forest-hit-out-at-penalty-decisions-after-defeat\">as Nottingham Forest proved with their public rant against Stuart Attwell</a> which eventually resulted in a \u00a3750,000 fine being handed down by the FA. Everyone\u2019s at it, and often without anything more than a hunch to go on.</p> <p>Now, thanks to Coote, those fears can be underwritten. If someone suggests it\u2019s fantastical to think that a referee would allow personal animus to influence their work as a professional, you need only point to this two minutes of idiocy by way of rebuttal. This is living, breathing proof of what referees <em>actually</em> think, you might say if you were already the sort of person who is infuriated by them. Why would I give them the benefit of the doubt again?</p> <p>We live in an age where trust is in short supply, with more and more of us suspicious of the motivations of others. Football already had its own problems on that front and often rightly so. But these problems are about to get a lot worse. That an industry which takes itself so seriously should have its reputation for integrity severely undermined by a video of a grown man trying to seemingly impress strangers in a sparsely decorated bedsit would be funny if it weren\u2019t so harmful.</p>",

A second video, in which Coote apparently instructs his unknown audience not to share the video \u2013 \u201cjust to be clear this video can\u2019t go anywhere \u2026 seriously\u201d \u2013 is the sort of thing that has me making the chef\u2019s kiss gesture even as I write. Coote by all accounts has done a half-decent job over his six seasons as part of the select group of English referees. He\u2019s refereed one international fixture: Armenia v Estonia in the 2020 Nations League. He took charge of the Carabao Cup final two seasons ago, his most senior appointment and an occasion that passed off smoothly. Indeed it was not his refereeing but his turns as VAR that appear to have riled Klopp when he was Liverpool manager: a failure to intervene over the Jordan Pickford challenge that ruptured Virgil van Dijk\u2019s ACL being the most prominent cause of complaint. Any suggestion that Coote was biased or out of his depth was generally lacking from the discourse before now. No longer. And that\u2019s the bigger problem with what Coote did. He let himself down, he let the game down, but he\u2019s also chucked a whole scuttle\u2019s worth of coal on to the flames of conspiracy. In the present day, fantasising about how the powers-that-be are biased against your team is a popular way of filling the hours between matches. Not just fans either, as Nottingham Forest proved with their public rant against Stuart Attwell which eventually resulted in a \u00a3750,000 fine being handed down by the FA. Everyone\u2019s at it, and often without anything more than a hunch to go on. Now, thanks to Coote, those fears can be underwritten. If someone suggests it\u2019s fantastical to think that a referee would allow personal animus to influence their work as a professional, you need only point to this two minutes of idiocy by way of rebuttal. This is living, breathing proof of what referees actually think, you might say if you were already the sort of person who is infuriated by them. Why would I give them the benefit of the doubt again? We live in an age where trust is in short supply, with more and more of us suspicious of the motivations of others. Football already had its own problems on that front and often rightly so. But these problems are about to get a lot worse. That an industry which takes itself so seriously should have its reputation for integrity severely undermined by a video of a grown man trying to seemingly impress strangers in a sparsely decorated bedsit would be funny if it weren\u2019t so harmful.",

It is very important to understand why this is recognised as a genocide.</p> <p>\u201cIn the same way as the international community has failed to protect the victims of genocide in the case of the Jewish people in Europe and then Bosnians in former Yugoslavia and the Tutsi in Rwanda, in the same way we are failing the Palestinians.\u201d</p> <p>She accepted that determining a genocide is complex due to the need to prove intent, but she claimed Israel\u2019s intent was the destruction of Palestinian life.</p> <p>Protesters from the Campaign Against Antisemitism gathered outside the LSE on Monday where Albanese took part in \u201ca conversation about international law and Palestine\u201d hosted by the student union\u2019s Grimshaw Club for international relations.</p> <p>Posts on social media showed dozens of protesters, armed with \u201cBan Fran\u201d banners, gathered outside the university building in central London, with the message \u201cMs Albanese is not welcome at British universities\u201d.</p> <p>Further protests were planned outside Soas University of London where Albanese was speaking later on Monday. A protest outside Queen Mary University of London where Albanese is due to speak on Tuesday was cancelled, however.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said: \u201cDue to threats in local residents\u2019 groups to engage in \u2018Amsterdam-style\u2019 violence against our planned protest tomorrow, it will not be proceeding.</p> <p>\u201cThe safety of our team and supporters is an overriding concern for us. We are pursuing legal action against identifiable individuals who made threats.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/10/amsterdam-police-charge-four-after-attack-on-israeli-football-fans\">Dozens of people were arrested</a> after violent attacks took place around a football match between Amsterdam\u2019s Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv last week.</p> <p>A Soas University of London spokesperson said: \u201cFreedom of expression and academic freedom are fundamental to our existence. The increasing tendency of some political groups to demand that speakers they disagree with should be prevented from speaking is an approach we reject.

      "bodyText": "Campaigners against antisemitism have held protests outside universities in London against a visit by the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories. Francesca Albanese, an international lawyer specialising in human rights and the Middle East, was taking part in an event at the London School of Economics and Political Science on Monday. She recently published a report in which she alleged that Israel was not just committing war crimes or crimes against humanity in Gaza but a \u201cgenocide\u201d, and suggested the UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, described her in a tweet as unfit for office, adding: \u201cThe United Nations should not tolerate antisemitism from a UN-affiliated official hired to promote human rights.\u201d Albanese said she was right to insist on the term \u201cgenocide\u201d, adding: \u201cPalestinians had experienced war crimes all their lives, but this was different. It is very important to understand why this is recognised as a genocide. \u201cIn the same way as the international community has failed to protect the victims of genocide in the case of the Jewish people in Europe and then Bosnians in former Yugoslavia and the Tutsi in Rwanda, in the same way we are failing the Palestinians.\u201d She accepted that determining a genocide is complex due to the need to prove intent, but she claimed Israel\u2019s intent was the destruction of Palestinian life. Protesters from the Campaign Against Antisemitism gathered outside the LSE on Monday where Albanese took part in \u201ca conversation about international law and Palestine\u201d hosted by the student union\u2019s Grimshaw Club for international relations. Posts on social media showed dozens of protesters, armed with \u201cBan Fran\u201d banners, gathered outside the university building in central London, with the message \u201cMs Albanese is not welcome at British universities\u201d. Further protests were planned outside Soas University of London where Albanese was speaking later on Monday. A protest outside Queen Mary University of London where Albanese is due to speak on Tuesday was cancelled, however. A spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said: \u201cDue to threats in local residents\u2019 groups to engage in \u2018Amsterdam-style\u2019 violence against our planned protest tomorrow, it will not be proceeding. \u201cThe safety of our team and supporters is an overriding concern for us. We are pursuing legal action against identifiable individuals who made threats.\u201d Dozens of people were arrested after violent attacks took place around a football match between Amsterdam\u2019s Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv last week. A Soas University of London spokesperson said: \u201cFreedom of expression and academic freedom are fundamental to our existence. The increasing tendency of some political groups to demand that speakers they disagree with should be prevented from speaking is an approach we reject. We would only act to limit speech that breaks the laws, or advocates hate or violence.\u201d An LSE spokesperson said: \u201cLSE is committed to providing an inclusive culture of equity, diversity and respect between individuals. Antisemitism and any other form of discrimination are completely unacceptable. \u201cFree speech and freedom of expression underpins everything we do at LSE. Students, staff and visitors are strongly encouraged to discuss and debate the most pressing issues around the world, but this must be in a mutually considerate manner.\u201d The Union of Jewish Students did not respond to requests for comment but previously told the Jewish Chronicle that Albanese\u2019s presence at London universities underscores the \u201cincreasingly belligerent environment\u201d on British campuses. \u201cWe urge universities to consider the impact of hosting Ms Albanese and the message it sends to Jewish students and allies who are deeply affected by these statements.

Stifling the progress of developing nations seems not only unfair but also shortsighted. What\u2019s needed isn\u2019t \u201cfree trade\u201d but fair trade. Perhaps that\u2019s not a phrase that Mr Trump favours, but it should be. African countries must be empowered to develop on terms that suit their needs, enabling them to earn the foreign exchange essential for a green transition. Otherwise, the rich world risks undermining African growth. This would be a loss not only for Africa but for the world. Wealthy countries didn\u2019t grow using the policies they now push on poorer nations. Almost all relied on tariffs and subsidies to build their industries \u2013 even Britain, despite claims of virtually no state intervention. As global competition intensifies for green tech, AI and robotics, trade policies should be crafted more fairly than they are today.",

Do it in another day.\u201d</p> <p>While the idea of ego depletion has been around for decades, it has garnered criticism, with some studies failing to replicate results.

      "bodyText": "If a hard day in the office leaves you crabby and uncooperative, you may have an excuse: scientists say exercising self-restraint can exhaust parts of the brain related to decision-making and impulse control, leaving you less able to manage your behaviour towards others. The researchers say their results tie into the theory of \u201cego depletion\u201d \u2013 a controversial idea in psychology that willpower is a limited resource that gets used up by effort. The results, they add, suggest it might be best to take a break after a day of mental exertion before engaging in other tasks. \u201cIf you want to have a discussion with your partner and feel that you are mentally exhausted, don\u2019t,\u201d said Erica Ordali, first author of the study from the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, in Italy. \u201cTake your time. Do it in another day.\u201d While the idea of ego depletion has been around for decades, it has garnered criticism, with some studies failing to replicate results. Ordali, however, noted an important factor may be that the tasks used in these studies to sap self-control often only last 10 minutes. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Ordali and her colleagues reported how they explored the impact of a longer duration, by asking 44 participants to undertake various computer-based activities for 45 minutes, including watching emotive video clips. While half the participants were asked to use self-control during the activities, for example not showing their emotions in response to the videos, the other group did not have to exert self-control. Each participant was also fitted with an electroencephalogram (EEG) headset, allowing the researchers to measure their brain activity. Among other results, the team found participants in the self-control group showed increases in delta brain wave activity in the areas of the prefrontal cortex related to decision-making and impulse control, compared with their brain activity at the start of the activities. No such change was seen for the other group. Crucially, said Ordali, delta waves are typically seen during sleep rather than wake \u2013 suggesting parts of the brain had \u201cdozed off\u201d in participants who had exerted self-control. The team then asked both groups to take part in a variety of games, including one known as \u201chawks and doves\u201d, where individuals had to decide whether to cooperate to share resources, or behave in a hostile manner to secure them. The results reveal 86% of participants who were not asked to exert self-control at the start of the study behaved like doves, engaging in peaceful cooperation. In contrast, the figure was just 41% among participants initially given self-control tasks, suggesting they tended to behave like hawks. The team found no differences when it came to games that examined participants\u2019 general social preferences, such as how altruistic they were. The team then split another 403 participants into two groups and repeated the study, but without recording participants\u2019 brain activity. Again, participants who were asked to show self-control subsequently behaved more aggressively. Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the study, urged caution noting most of the behavioural results did not show significant effects, while the connection between brain and behaviour was not strong. \u201cThese are interesting results and are consistent with a commonsense view of fatigue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut given all the past controversy and the weakness of this data, I would want to see if they were replicated independently before calling the press about it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting too dark here,\u201d Jimmy Anderson says quietly as we return to a time when he was a solitary boy in Burnley, \u201cbut I remember sitting in my room thinking: \u2018I wish I wasn\u2019t me. I wish I was someone else.\u2019 That\u2019s not a great place to be at 14. I didn\u2019t fit in at school or have a group of mates. The biggest thing for me then was the feeling of being lonely.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have close friends. We didn\u2019t play cricket at school. I was seen as a bit of an odd person who liked cricket. Why would you like cricket when you can play football and these other amazing sports? I did play them, but obviously not to the same level as cricket. I just felt like an outcast.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson is 42 now but still carries the lean and hungry look of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/09/jimmy-anderson-best-wickets-england\">the greatest English Test bowler</a> there has ever been. But he was hurt again in April when Brendon&nbsp;McCullum and Ben Stokes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/10/jimmy-anderson-end-test-cricket-career-england-brendon-mccullum\">ended his Test career</a>. In his <a href=\"https://www.bonnierbooks.co.uk/books/blink-publishing/finding-the-edge/\">revealing and often moving book</a> about cricket and life, which he wrote with Felix White, Anderson describes the encounter in jolting terms: \u201cAs I walk towards them, it hits me cold. This isn\u2019t a team appraisal, is it? I feel like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, ushered into a room under the impression that I\u2019m going&nbsp;to get made, only to be shot. You fuckers.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/10/world-test-championship-cricket-wide-open-england-on-outside\">World Test Championship is wide open but England remain on outside</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew Strauss had tried the same cull in a 45-second phone call in 2022. Anderson refused to surrender and came back fitter and more determined. He writes: \u201cI guess you\u2019d rather be stabbed in the front than the back. This time, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s both kinder and harsher, more sympathetic and more ruthless and, worst of all, nauseatingly final.\u201d</p> <p>On a grey November morning in Soho I can feel the lingering sadness. Beyond his family and friends, Anderson loves cricket more than anything else. It means so much because it saved him when&nbsp;he was that reclusive teenager. He was just little James from Burnley then, the cricket geek&nbsp;who knew what it was like to&nbsp;be pinned down while a half\u2011eaten Cornish pasty was ground into his face. He also knew what it felt like when the blood spurted from his nose after a meaty head-butt.</p> <p>\u201cIt did affect me,\u201d Anderson says, \u201cbut I feel lucky I had the cricket club. I made friends down there and, without that, I\u2019d have really struggled.<strong> </strong>So it\u2019s not scarred me going forward. If anything, it made me want to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson played 188 Tests for England and took 704 wickets, more than any other pace bowler in history and behind only two master spinners in Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan. He not only succeeded in statistical terms because, over 21 years, Anderson turned bowling into both a sublime art and a gritty feat of resilience.</p> <p>He pauses when I ask what would have happened to him without cricket. \u201cIt\u2019s a great question,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea. I did sixth form and thought of going to uni if I didn\u2019t get a contract. I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was going to do if cricket didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s frightening because I\u2019m sure there\u2019re many people in that same position and they don\u2019t have that something I loved with a passion. I feel so fortunate I had cricket.\u201d</p> <p>His wife, Daniella, was furious when England discarded him as a player. Is she still angry now that Anderson is back in the fold as the Test bowling coach? \u201cI think so, yes. She\u2019s been my biggest supporter from when we first met. I had injuries and she was the one who motivated me to get going again. She just felt it wasn\u2019t the right way to have done things. She felt I should go on my own terms. But I think it\u2019s easing now.\u201d</p> <p>Did Anderson feel similar anger? \u201cI don\u2019t think I was angry. I was just shocked. But, to be honest, I would have carried on for as long as my body let me. Maybe I needed that nudge to say now\u2019s a good time to finish.\u201d</p> <p>Soon afterwards, Anderson played a county game for Lancashire in which he skittled Nottinghamshire with imperious bowling and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/02/jimmy-anderson-seven-wickets-lancashire-county-championship-cricket\">figures of seven for 35</a>. \u201cI wasn\u2019t out to prove a point,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking that this could potentially be my last-ever game for Lancashire so I wanted to make sure I bowled well. It was only afterwards when Ben texted me that I twigged.\u201d</p> <p>A familiar shy, rueful smile creases up his face as Anderson recalls the exact wording of that wry text from Stokes: \u201cDid you really have to do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, mate,\u201d Anderson replied.</p> <p>The mutual respect and affection between Anderson, Stokes and McCullum remains. But was there a moment, amid the pain, when Anderson was tempted to reject their coaching offer? \u201cNo. If it had been completely cut out of my life I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have coped very well. The fact that they wanted me to stay in the group helped me. I\u2019m still having the dressing-room environment, still seeing my mates every day, still having an impact on Test matches, but obviously in a very different way.\u201d</p>    <p>Anderson leans forward and his face softens. \u201cI find it quite exciting that I\u2019m getting to learn a different job and finding out more about myself and whether I\u2019m any good at it. So it\u2019s been pretty interesting and, as a coach, I can now see that the decision actually benefited the team because there\u2019ve been more opportunities for bowlers to come in and do well. That\u2019s exactly what they were trying to do with the Ashes happening in a year\u2019s time. They want to make sure they\u2019ve got enough players with the experience to cope.\u201d</p> <p>England and Anderson head to New Zealand in a couple of weeks and then, next summer, they face India at home before the almighty challenge of trying to win the Ashes in Australia. Does Anderson think there\u2019s enough time to remodel England\u2019s bowling attack into an efficient and remorseless unit by then? \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be. I think we\u2019ve got enough experience with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/03/chris-woakes-interview-england-test-cricket-pakistan\">Chris Woakes</a>, Mark Wood, Jofra Archer potentially, and then the guys that are coming in. Gus Atkinson has done really well, and so has Brydon Carse and Matthew Potts. They\u2019re getting experience all the time and if they\u2019ve got 12 Tests under their belts that\u2019s great. It doesn\u2019t have to be 50 Tests. We\u2019ve got a nice mix with different types of bowlers for different conditions. If everyone\u2019s fit it\u2019s going to be difficult to narrow [selection] down.\u201d</p> <p>Archer could be a crucial bowler next year but his career has been blighted by injury. \u201cI\u2019ve not been involved with white-ball cricket,\u201d Anderson says but \u201cit seems like he\u2019s doing well. They\u2019re being careful and, if we can keep him fit, the Ashes is a definite opportunity. The only worry is whether the injuries have scared him away from Test cricket and he thinks: \u2018Can my body cope?\u2019 But if Jofra works hard enough, and he\u2019s managed well, he would be huge for us in the Ashes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/09/jimmy-anderson-best-wickets-england\">Jimmy Anderson: his six best wickets for England, from Ponting to Sharma</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Atkinson took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/10/that-was-a-debut-to-dream-of-admits-gus-atkinson-as-he-puts-england-in-charge\">12 wickets on his Test debut</a> against West Indies at Lord\u2019s in July, in a match which marked Anderson\u2019s final commemorative game for England. The 26-year-old, according to Anderson, \u201chas got it all. Pace, skill and he picks up things really quickly. I\u2019ve worked with him a little bit and he\u2019ll say: \u2018Right, I want to learn an in-swinger\u2019 and within 12 balls he\u2019ll have it. That\u2019s a great trait. He\u2019s got amazing ability and a great temperament.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson was with England on their recent tour of Pakistan where they won the first Test with admirable intent before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/26/england-pakistan-third-test-cricket-day-three-report\">folding disappointingly in the next two matches</a>. McCullum has had a transformative impact on English cricket over the last two years, as his positive and simple messaging to enjoy the game above all else liberated the players. But will it be difficult for the coach to retain the freshness of his approach as England face a daunting year?</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very good at reading the room,\u201d Anderson says of McCullum. \u201cIf he feels we\u2019re a little tense, then he\u2019ll relax the group. If we need a little bit more energy, then he\u2019ll find it. But it\u2019s been an interesting period where we have maybe gone away from that ultra-aggressive style led by Ben Stokes. He was getting criticism for being over the top in attacking so maybe he\u2019s gone slightly away from that and he\u2019s trying to find that balance of being entertaining and aggressive while still winning.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds as if Anderson, a Test-match traditionalist, is advocating a return to Bazball in its purest and most attacking form? \u201cI think so, yes. It can be difficult in Pakistan to play in that positive, aggressive way. But the last time we went to Pakistan [in 2022] we scored 500 in a day, so there\u2019s definitely scope for us to try and get back there.\u201d</p> <p>Stokes, who is such a galvanising and upbeat captain, seemed unusually frustrated in Pakistan. \u201cHaving missed a few games through injury he was really keen to get back but it\u2019s tough in those conditions. I don\u2019t think he was overly frustrated \u2013 it was just that we had chances in the last Test and didn\u2019t take them. But I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be looking forward to New Zealand and he will be there earlier to see family. If he was frustrated in Pakistan, hopefully he\u2019ll be more relaxed over there.\u201d</p>    <p>Anderson will keep bowling in the nets in New Zealand as his decision to <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/15806/13250600/james-anderson-hopeful-of-ipl-selection-after-england-record-test-wicket-takers-surprise-registration-for-auction\">make himself available for the IPL</a> sees his name being entered in the upcoming auction. \u201cI bowled a bit in Pakistan and then in the indoor school at Old Trafford to keep ticking over. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll bowl more in New Zealand because I feel great. Over the last eight years, if I didn\u2019t bowl for three months it didn\u2019t matter. My muscle memory just takes over and it\u2019s all there. The important thing, as I\u2019ve got older, is taking care of the fitness side and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve really looked after. If I do play some T20s, hopefully four overs won\u2019t feel too much after 20 years of Test cricket.\u201d</p> <p>He is also hoping to play other forms of franchise cricket and Anderson grins helplessly at the prospect of his return to limited-overs action starting in the IPL. \u201cThe feedback on social media has been amazing. I didn\u2019t expect it to kick up this much of a fuss. But I really want to experience it because everyone says it\u2019s an amazing tournament.\u201d</p> <p>As cricket envelops him again in its comforting embrace, Anderson looks suddenly rejuvenated. The hurt fades a little more as he anticipates a future which includes coaching in Test cricket while playing again in a completely fresh T20 environment. \u201cI\u2019m definitely excited but it is taking a bit of adjusting,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out which direction I want to go while getting the right balance in my life as I think about all that\u2019s happened and what might happen next.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jimmy Anderson\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/jimmy-anderson-finding-the-edge-9781785123511/\">Finding the Edge</a> is published by Bonnier Books</em></p>",

Is she still angry now that Anderson is back in the fold as the Test bowling coach? \u201cI think so, yes. She\u2019s been my biggest supporter from when we first met. I had injuries and she was the one who motivated me to get going again. She just felt it wasn\u2019t the right way to have done things. She felt I should go on my own terms. But I think it\u2019s easing now.\u201d Did Anderson feel similar anger? \u201cI don\u2019t think I was angry. I was just shocked. But, to be honest, I would have carried on for as long as my body let me. Maybe I needed that nudge to say now\u2019s a good time to finish.\u201d Soon afterwards, Anderson played a county game for Lancashire in which he skittled Nottinghamshire with imperious bowling and figures of seven for 35. \u201cI wasn\u2019t out to prove a point,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking that this could potentially be my last-ever game for Lancashire so I wanted to make sure I bowled well. It was only afterwards when Ben texted me that I twigged.\u201d A familiar shy, rueful smile creases up his face as Anderson recalls the exact wording of that wry text from Stokes: \u201cDid you really have to do that?\u201d \u201cSorry, mate,\u201d Anderson replied. The mutual respect and affection between Anderson, Stokes and McCullum remains. But was there a moment, amid the pain, when Anderson was tempted to reject their coaching offer? \u201cNo. If it had been completely cut out of my life I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have coped very well. The fact that they wanted me to stay in the group helped me. I\u2019m still having the dressing-room environment, still seeing my mates every day, still having an impact on Test matches, but obviously in a very different way.\u201d Anderson leans forward and his face softens. \u201cI find it quite exciting that I\u2019m getting to learn a different job and finding out more about myself and whether I\u2019m any good at it. So it\u2019s been pretty interesting and, as a coach, I can now see that the decision actually benefited the team because there\u2019ve been more opportunities for bowlers to come in and do well. That\u2019s exactly what they were trying to do with the Ashes happening in a year\u2019s time. They want to make sure they\u2019ve got enough players with the experience to cope.\u201d England and Anderson head to New Zealand in a couple of weeks and then, next summer, they face India at home before the almighty challenge of trying to win the Ashes in Australia. Does Anderson think there\u2019s enough time to remodel England\u2019s bowling attack into an efficient and remorseless unit by then? \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be. I think we\u2019ve got enough experience with Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Jofra Archer potentially, and then the guys that are coming in. Gus Atkinson has done really well, and so has Brydon Carse and Matthew Potts. They\u2019re getting experience all the time and if they\u2019ve got 12 Tests under their belts that\u2019s great. It doesn\u2019t have to be 50 Tests. We\u2019ve got a nice mix with different types of bowlers for different conditions. If everyone\u2019s fit it\u2019s going to be difficult to narrow [selection] down.\u201d Archer could be a crucial bowler next year but his career has been blighted by injury. \u201cI\u2019ve not been involved with white-ball cricket,\u201d Anderson says but \u201cit seems like he\u2019s doing well. They\u2019re being careful and, if we can keep him fit, the Ashes is a definite opportunity. The only worry is whether the injuries have scared him away from Test cricket and he thinks: \u2018Can my body cope?\u2019 But if Jofra works hard enough, and he\u2019s managed well, he would be huge for us in the Ashes.\u201d Atkinson took 12 wickets on his Test debut against West Indies at Lord\u2019s in July, in a match which marked Anderson\u2019s final commemorative game for England. The 26-year-old, according to Anderson, \u201chas got it all. Pace, skill and he picks up things really quickly. I\u2019ve worked with him a little bit and he\u2019ll say: \u2018Right, I want to learn an in-swinger\u2019 and within 12 balls he\u2019ll have it. That\u2019s a great trait. He\u2019s got amazing ability and a great temperament.\u201d Anderson was with England on their recent tour of Pakistan where they won the first Test with admirable intent before folding disappointingly in the next two matches. McCullum has had a transformative impact on English cricket over the last two years, as his positive and simple messaging to enjoy the game above all else liberated the players. But will it be difficult for the coach to retain the freshness of his approach as England face a daunting year? \u201cHe\u2019s very good at reading the room,\u201d Anderson says of McCullum. \u201cIf he feels we\u2019re a little tense, then he\u2019ll relax the group. If we need a little bit more energy, then he\u2019ll find it. But it\u2019s been an interesting period where we have maybe gone away from that ultra-aggressive style led by Ben Stokes. He was getting criticism for being over the top in attacking so maybe he\u2019s gone slightly away from that and he\u2019s trying to find that balance of being entertaining and aggressive while still winning.\u201d It sounds as if Anderson, a Test-match traditionalist, is advocating a return to Bazball in its purest and most attacking form? \u201cI think so, yes. It can be difficult in Pakistan to play in that positive, aggressive way. But the last time we went to Pakistan [in 2022] we scored 500 in a day, so there\u2019s definitely scope for us to try and get back there.\u201d Stokes, who is such a galvanising and upbeat captain, seemed unusually frustrated in Pakistan. \u201cHaving missed a few games through injury he was really keen to get back but it\u2019s tough in those conditions. I don\u2019t think he was overly frustrated \u2013 it was just that we had chances in the last Test and didn\u2019t take them. But I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be looking forward to New Zealand and he will be there earlier to see family. If he was frustrated in Pakistan, hopefully he\u2019ll be more relaxed over there.\u201d Anderson will keep bowling in the nets in New Zealand as his decision to make himself available for the IPL sees his name being entered in the upcoming auction. \u201cI bowled a bit in Pakistan and then in the indoor school at Old Trafford to keep ticking over. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll bowl more in New Zealand because I feel great. Over the last eight years, if I didn\u2019t bowl for three months it didn\u2019t matter. My muscle memory just takes over and it\u2019s all there. The important thing, as I\u2019ve got older, is taking care of the fitness side and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve really looked after. If I do play some T20s, hopefully four overs won\u2019t feel too much after 20 years of Test cricket.\u201d He is also hoping to play other forms of franchise cricket and Anderson grins helplessly at the prospect of his return to limited-overs action starting in the IPL. \u201cThe feedback on social media has been amazing. I didn\u2019t expect it to kick up this much of a fuss. But I really want to experience it because everyone says it\u2019s an amazing tournament.\u201d As cricket envelops him again in its comforting embrace, Anderson looks suddenly rejuvenated. The hurt fades a little more as he anticipates a future which includes coaching in Test cricket while playing again in a completely fresh T20 environment. \u201cI\u2019m definitely excited but it is taking a bit of adjusting,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out which direction I want to go while getting the right balance in my life as I think about all that\u2019s happened and what might happen next.\u201d Jimmy Anderson\u2019s Finding the Edge is published by Bonnier Books",

      "bodyText": "The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court will face an external investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, the court\u2019s governing body has said. In a statement, the president of the body that oversees the ICC said the inquiry would examine the allegations against Karim Khan, which related to his alleged conduct towards a woman who worked for him. Since the allegations emerged last month, there has been intense behind-the-scenes negotiations among the court\u2019s member states about the shape and scope of the investigation, as the court has scrambled to formulate a response to the allegations. P\u00e4ivi Kaukoranta, the president of the governing body, the assembly of state parties (ASP), said an external investigation was being \u201cpursued in order to ensure a fully independent, impartial and fair process\u201d. She said the ASP was still finalising the \u201cpractical modalities of the investigation\u201d and the \u201cinvolved parties have been informed\u201d that the court\u2019s internal watchdog had been relieved from investigating the matter. She did not announce who would carry out the investigation. The external inquiry will examine the allegations against the prosecutor, which the Guardian reported last month include claims of unwanted sexual touching and \u201cabuse\u201d over an extended period, as well as coercive behaviour and abuse of authority. Lawyers for Khan, 54, have said he \u201cdenies the whole of the allegations\u201d. On Monday he said: \u201cI welcome the opportunity to engage in this process.\u201d The alleged victim, a lawyer in her 30s who worked for Khan, has declined to comment. Multiple sources said ICC staffers were informed last week that the woman would be willing to assist an independent investigation. The announcement comes amid growing disquiet within the prosecutor\u2019s office, which has about 450 staff, concerning Khan\u2019s handling of the situation and attempts to suggest the allegations may be part of a smear campaign against him. Multiple ICC sources said some of Khan\u2019s most senior staff had in recent weeks openly pushed for an external inquiry and advised him to take a leave of absence until it had concluded. Responding to the ASP\u2019s announcement, Khan said he would remain in his role but his two deputy prosecutors would handle any issues relating to the allegations. \u201cAt my request, a coordination group chaired by the deputy prosecutors, acting independently and not reporting to me, has already taken responsibility for addressing all relevant issues connected to this issue internally within the office,\u201d he said. He told the Guardian: \u201cI will be continuing all other functions as prosecutor, in line with my mandate.\u201d The external inquiry will replace efforts by the court\u2019s internal watchdog, which Khan had asked to investigate the allegations \u2013 a move some of his staff have opposed due to concerns about its independence. Multiple senior ICC sources said the delay in establishing an external inquiry has exposed the court to attacks by those seeking to exploit the allegations to discredit the judicial body and undermine its investigation into the situation in Palestine. A panel of ICC judges is considering applications by Khan for arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Although many among Khan\u2019s staff are alarmed by pro-Israeli interests seizing on the sexual misconduct allegations, there are concerns among senior ranks of his staff about his public response to the situation. Addressing the allegations last month, Khan said \u201cthis is a moment in which myself and the ICC are subject to a wide range of attacks and threats\u201d. His lawyers later said the claims may have been released \u201cto undermine his high-profile ongoing work at a delicate time\u201d. Five ICC sources familiar with the situation said that while Israel or its allies might be attempting to take advantages of the allegations, many within Khan\u2019s top team did not believe they had been invented by external actors hostile to the court. Pro-Israeli interests \u201cmay have exploited the story but they didn\u2019t create the story\u201d, one official said. When the claims were first reported internally in early May, Khan\u2019s closest advisers are understood to have discussed whether the allegations could be part of an elaborate plot by Israeli intelligence agencies. At the time, the prosecutor was on high alert and sensitive to external threats but officials close to Khan concluded it was highly unlikely the allegations were part of an espionage operation. Sources within the prosecutor\u2019s office said no evidence or intelligence had since emerged of any involvement of an intelligence agency, such as Israel\u2019s the Mossad. Two sources said that if there had been genuine concerns that the alleged victim was part of a plot, she would have been removed from her position and her access to deliberations in the Palestine case would have been revoked, but this did not happen. \u201cFor a second I had my doubts, but if you look at the timeline and the details of how this came about it has nothing to do with any kind of plot,\u201d one ICC official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the [prosecutor\u2019s] office seriously believes in that.\u201d",

Azerbaijan hopes the progress on article 6 will clear the way for more substantive talks, for the rest of the scheduled fortnight, on a goal of making $1tn a year in climate finance available to poorer countries by 2035. However, many civil society groups remain concerned about article 6. Erika Lennon, an attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over and over again how carbon markets are not doing what they claim to be doing, as well as market projects that violate people\u2019s rights. If they don\u2019t have strong rules in place to prevent all of the abuses, it can totally undermine the integrity of the Paris agreement.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "During heated oral arguments on Monday morning, the Wisconsin supreme court appeared poised to find an 1849 law banning most abortions cannot be enforced. The legal status of abortion in Wisconsin has been contested since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and ended the right to abortion nationwide, triggering bans across the country \u2013 including in Wisconsin, where a 175-year-old ban immediately went into effect. Democrats in Wisconsin have seized on abortion as a campaign issue, with Justice Janet Protasiewicz expressing her support for abortion rights and winning a seat on the court in spring 2023. Protasiewicz\u2019s election to the court helped flip the ideological balance on the bench, which is now controlled by a narrow liberal majority. It is highly unlikely the liberal-controlled court will uphold the ban. The 1849 statute, which was nullified by Roe v Wade and then reanimated when the landmark decision was overturned, declares that ending \u201cthe life of an unborn child\u201d is a felony, except when required to save the life of the mother. In July 2023, a Dane county judge ruled that the 1849 ban applies only to feticide and not \u201cconsensual\u201d abortion, citing a previous ruling that interpreted the statute as an anti-feticide law, and in September, providers including Planned Parenthood resumed offering abortion care. The Sheboygan county district attorney Joel Urmanski appealed the ruling, which is now before the Wisconsin supreme court. \u201cThe position of the circuit court below \u2026 is ultimately indefensible,\u201d said Matthew Thome, an attorney representing Urmanski, during his opening argument. Thome argued that the 1849 law should be interpreted to \u201cprohibit consensual abortions from conception until birth, subject to an exception when it is necessary to save the life of the mother\u201d. Justice Jill Karofsky interrogated Urmanski\u2019s interpretation of the law, asking if it would provide exceptions for rape, incest, the health of the mother, or fetal abnormalities. \u201cJust to be clear, a 12-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by her father and as a result, became pregnant, under your interpretation \u2026 she would be forced to carry her pregnancy to term?\u201d asked Karofsky. She noted that the \u201cpenalty for aborting after a sexual assault would be more severe than the penalty for the sexual assault\u201d. In response to a question about the medical consequences of a ban, Thome responded that he was unsure, given that he is \u201cnot a doctor\u201d. \u201cI fear that what you are asking this court to do is to sign the death warrants of women and children and pregnant people in this state, because under your interpretation, they could all be denied life saving medical care, while the medical professionals who are charged with taking care of them are forced to sit idly by,\u201d said Karofsky. The court weighed the question of whether laws that were passed regulating abortion while Roe was in effect \u201cimpliedly repealed\u201d the 1849 ban and rendered it unenforceable. \u201cAll of those statues\u201d passed after 1973 and before it was overturned, \u201cjust go to the dust pile?\u201d asked Karofsky. Justice Brian Hagedorn, a conservative-leaning judge, argued, of the 1849 ban, that \u201cthe law is still there\u201d, adding that \u201cthe judiciary doesn\u2019t get to edit laws, the judiciary doesn\u2019t get to rewrite them, we didn\u2019t delete it, we prevented its enforcement\u201d. The assistant attorney general Hannah Jurss disagreed, arguing that \u201cthere is nothing in the text of these statutes that says in the event that Roe is overturned we somehow go back to the old law and throw out all of the new ones,\u201d drawing a distinction between Wisconsin\u2019s more than a century old law and \u201ctrigger\u201d laws passed in certain states that were specifically designed to go into effect after Roe v Wade was overturned. A separate case, which the Wisconsin supreme court has also agreed to hear, would decide whether the right to abortion is protected under the state\u2019s constitution \u2013 possibly opening the door to challenge other laws regulating abortion in the state.",

      "body": "<p>California voters have rejected a ballot measure to prohibit forced prison labor, in a major disappointment to advocates of criminal justice reform and many of the 90,000 people incarcerated in state prisons.</p> <p>Proposition 6 would have amended the state\u2019s constitution to ban involuntary servitude for people in prison. The proposition would instead have allowed people in prison to chose their jobs, with a related proposal that would have created voluntary work programs within the prison system.</p> <p>California already prohibits slavery, but the state constitution has an exception allowing prisons to force people to work as a punishment for crime.</p> <p>The state <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/california-voter-guide-2024/propositions/prop-6-involuntary-servitude/\">employs nearly 40,000 people</a> in prison who do a variety of essential work, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/12/after-an-incarcerated-firefighter-was-nearly-killed-on-the-frontlines-california-delivered-him-to-ice\">fighting wildfires</a>, janitorial work, construction and cleaning. Most earn wages of less than $0.75 (\u00a30.58) an hour, and many say they depend on the funds to buy vital commissary supplies, including food. More than <a href=\"https://aclucalaction.org/bill/aca-8/\">65%</a> of people imprisoned in California reported being forced to work, <a href=\"https://aclucalaction.org/bill/aca-8/\">according to the ACLU</a>, and the state profits from the extremely cheap labor.</p> <p>As of Monday, while votes were still being counted, 53.8% of voters had rejected the measure, while 46.2% backed it. It had no formal opposition.</p> <p>Prop 6 was part of a package of 14 reparations proposals introduced by lawmakers.</p> <p>Passage of the package has been mixed. Gavin Newsom signed a law in September to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/27/california-slavery-apology-reparation\">issue a formal apology</a> for the state\u2019s legacy of racism against Black Americans. But state lawmakers blocked a bill that would have created an agency to administer reparations programs, and the California governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/gavin-newsom-vetoes-california-reparations-bill\">vetoed a measure</a> that would have helped Black families reclaim property taken unjustly by the government through eminent domain.</p> <p>The California assembly member Lori Wilson, who spearheaded Proposition 6, told the Guardian last month that the measure \u201cwas inspired by the ongoing need to correct a constitutional injustice\u201d. She added: \u201c[The clause has been] a remnant of our nation\u2019s dark history with slavery.\u201d</p> <p>Multiple states \u2013 including Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama and Vermont \u2013 have voted to rid their constitutions of forced labor exemptions in recent years, and this week they were joined by Nevada, which passed its own measure. Still, in some states the impact of the change appears to be limited. In Colorado, the first state to get rid of an exception for slavery from its constitution in 2018, incarcerated people alleged in a 2022 lawsuit filed against the corrections department that they were still being forced to work.</p> <p>Proposition 6\u2019s ballot language did not explicitly include the word \u201cslavery\u201d like measures elsewhere because the California constitution was amended in the 1970s to remove an exemption for slavery.

      "bodyText": "California voters have rejected a ballot measure to prohibit forced prison labor, in a major disappointment to advocates of criminal justice reform and many of the 90,000 people incarcerated in state prisons. Proposition 6 would have amended the state\u2019s constitution to ban involuntary servitude for people in prison. The proposition would instead have allowed people in prison to chose their jobs, with a related proposal that would have created voluntary work programs within the prison system. California already prohibits slavery, but the state constitution has an exception allowing prisons to force people to work as a punishment for crime. The state employs nearly 40,000 people in prison who do a variety of essential work, including fighting wildfires, janitorial work, construction and cleaning. Most earn wages of less than $0.75 (\u00a30.58) an hour, and many say they depend on the funds to buy vital commissary supplies, including food. More than 65% of people imprisoned in California reported being forced to work, according to the ACLU, and the state profits from the extremely cheap labor. As of Monday, while votes were still being counted, 53.8% of voters had rejected the measure, while 46.2% backed it. It had no formal opposition. Prop 6 was part of a package of 14 reparations proposals introduced by lawmakers. Passage of the package has been mixed. Gavin Newsom signed a law in September to issue a formal apology for the state\u2019s legacy of racism against Black Americans. But state lawmakers blocked a bill that would have created an agency to administer reparations programs, and the California governor vetoed a measure that would have helped Black families reclaim property taken unjustly by the government through eminent domain. The California assembly member Lori Wilson, who spearheaded Proposition 6, told the Guardian last month that the measure \u201cwas inspired by the ongoing need to correct a constitutional injustice\u201d. She added: \u201c[The clause has been] a remnant of our nation\u2019s dark history with slavery.\u201d Multiple states \u2013 including Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama and Vermont \u2013 have voted to rid their constitutions of forced labor exemptions in recent years, and this week they were joined by Nevada, which passed its own measure. Still, in some states the impact of the change appears to be limited. In Colorado, the first state to get rid of an exception for slavery from its constitution in 2018, incarcerated people alleged in a 2022 lawsuit filed against the corrections department that they were still being forced to work. Proposition 6\u2019s ballot language did not explicitly include the word \u201cslavery\u201d like measures elsewhere because the California constitution was amended in the 1970s to remove an exemption for slavery. But the exception for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime remained on the books. The 13th amendment of the US constitution also bans slavery and involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime. Despite its defeat, supporters said the proposition had been important. The Abolish Slavery National Network co-founder Jamilia Land, who advocated for Prop 6, said the measure and similar ones in other states are about \u201cdismantling the remnants of slavery\u201d from the books. \u201cWhile the voters of California did not pass Proposition 6 this time, we have made significant progress,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe are proud of the movement we have built, and we will not rest until we see this issue resolved once and for all.\u201d Dorsey Nunn, a longtime advocate for incarcerated Californians, who was supporting Prop 6, noted in a statement on Monday that activists had made significant progress this year on the issue after struggling in 2022 to get a similar measure on the ballot. \u201cWe know Californians, including victims, want a system that centers rehabilitation, accountability, and a path to safer communities. It is clear we have more work to do to educate Californians about involuntary servitude. The race for justice is not to the swift, but those who endure.\u201d Proposition 6 saw the second-least campaign spending among the 10 statewide initiatives on the ballot this year, about $1.9m, according to the California secretary of state\u2019s office. Dante Jones, a 41-year-old incarcerated in San Quentin prison, told the Guardian last month that he wished people in prison could vote and that Prop 6 would have allowed incarcerated people to earn better wages to help them survive behind bars. \u201cWe\u2019ve got legalized plantations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say they want us to be citizens, they want to rehabilitate us, but then they don\u2019t do anything that allows that to happen. Technically, by the constitution, we\u2019re slaves and they can whip our backs.\u201d",

She also formally endorsed Harris and made an appearance at her rally in a packed stadium in her home town of Houston, Texas, where fans were hoping that she would perform, though she did not. \u201cI\u2019m not here as a celebrity,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 one of the top streamed artists of all time \u2013 said at the rally. \u201cI\u2019m not here as a politician. I\u2019m here as a mother \u2013 a mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in.\u201d Classes like the one Yale is offering on Beyonc\u00e9 often draw significant student interest. The Taylor Swift and her World class at Harvard enrolled 300 students when it was first offered earlier this year. Brook\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9 class will be offered by multiple departments, including those of African American studies, women\u2019s gender and sexuality studies and American studies and music.",

His 2013 series The Strangest Fruit depicts the bodies of Latino men who have been lynched, minus the ropes used to haul them up for murder. The series is impactful for how the bodies seem to levitate almost beautifully, as well as for the strangely peaceful and curious expressions on the men\u2019s faces. The Strangest Fruit is a witness of sorts to the hundreds of executions perpetrated against those immigrating from Mexico over the years, but it also encompasses other forms of inhumanity perpetrated against this group, including a for-profit prison industry and mass deportations.</p> <p>Valdez has been described as a prodigy, as from a young age he followed his artistic vocation and has created furiously ever since. He recalled first picking up a paintbrush at age 10, when he was taken under the wing of muralist Alex Rubio, then 19 years old. According to Valdez, as he and Rubio painted murals around immigrant neighborhoods in San Antonio, he began to grasp the kind of power that art could have on a community, realizing that this was what he wanted to dedicate his life to. \u201cI begin to see and understand the reality of the world for what it is and how it really functions,\u201d he told me. \u201cAs the murals took life, I witnessed communities embrace these images in their own way.

The image shows a frozen instant from Los Angeles\u2019s infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/13/los-angeles-latino-subculture-zoot-suits-tastemakers-earthshakers\">1943 zoot suit riots</a>, in which US servicemen rampaged against Mexican American youth wearing zoot suits \u2013 supposedly because the garments were considered to be unpatriotic during wartime for their waste of rationed materials.</p>    <p>The painting, which measures a good 4x7ft, is a work of carefully scripted chaos, the imagery at once grotesque and gory, yet choreographed like a ballet and full of rich chartreuse greens, bloody maroons and navy blues.

      "body": "<p>Look on the bright side. Kemi Badenoch lasted two and a half hours in the witness stand at the Post Office inquiry without losing it. She didn\u2019t get into an argument with Jason Beer, the counsel for the crown, though that could be because his questions were not unduly threatening. After all, we were there to hear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/11/kemi-badenoch-disappointed-it-took-itv-drama-to-speed-up-post-office-payouts-horizon-it-scandal\">Kemi\u2019s version of events</a>. Other versions of the truth may be available. Nor did she square up to any of those in the public gallery who laughed when Beer thanked her for answering \u201csome\u201d of his questions.</p> <p>Not that Kemi nailed it. Like many narcissists, she is a curious mixture of the thick- and thin-skinned. She likes to present herself as a no-nonsense, tough woman. Someone who isn\u2019t afraid to go toe-to-toe with her opponents. Who can tell it like it is. But beneath the surface there\u2019s a vulnerability that she despises. It\u2019s why she lashes out so readily. The person she dislikes the most is herself.</p> <p>There\u2019s a brittleness to all her interactions that her admirers mistake for strength, and the inquiry showed her at her worst. Kemi likes to be the one in charge. The person doing the questioning. Making the decisions. She can\u2019t bear the passivity of the witness box.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/11/kemi-badenoch-disappointed-it-took-itv-drama-to-speed-up-post-office-payouts-horizon-it-scandal\">Badenoch: it\u2019s \u2018disappointing\u2019 it took ITV drama to speed up Post Office payouts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what we got was a very closed down KemiKaze. Guarded in all her replies. Never giving away more than was strictly necessary. I can\u2019t remember a single occasion when she expressed any emotion about what the post office operatives had been through. Where other witnesses have begun their evidence with a personal statement of regret for all that has happened, Kemi said nothing. Because she feels nothing. She is incapable of that level of empathy for other people. That\u2019s just the way she\u2019s made.</p> <p>Beer began by discussing her ministerial responsibilities. It had taken her a while to get to grips with Horizon scandal, she said, because she had been too busy with her role of equalities minister in the first half of 2023. That will have come as a bit of a shock to her colleagues. But maybe she had done a lot of the equalities stuff while working from home.</p> <p>Then we got to the matter of compensation and redress. By the late summer of 2023 she had been reminded by Kevin Hollinrake, then a junior minister in the Department for Business and Trade, that the government had been slow to pay financial compensation to the post office operatives. So she had written to Jeremy Hunt, the then chancellor, to suggest the government offer \u00a3100,000 to every victim. Regardless of the extent of their claim. The Treasury blocked this, saying it didn\u2019t represent good value for the taxpayer.</p> <p>Badenoch didn\u2019t even blame Jezza for this. Rather she pointed the finger at the government machine. The civil service. Time and again, Kemi was keen to find fault in the Blob. It was always looking for petty regulation rather than the bigger picture that only she could see. As if there were no benefits to proper oversight. If Kemi got her way the civil service would almost be regulation-free.</p> <p>Though perhaps Kemi doth protest too much. Because when she got knocked back by the Treasury, there is no record of her having given the post office operatives much thought again. Though she would have liked us to believe they were always in her mind. She got as far as contemplating using a ministerial direction to liberate the cash, but as there was no cash to liberate, that idea crashed and burned.</p> <p>Thereafter we got a wall of silence from Kemi and her department. That\u2019s the government machine for you. Dozens of civil servants with nothing better to do than send endless memos and letters on Kemi\u2019s behalf and yet the evidence trail had gone mysteriously cold. Surely someone as combative as Kemi wouldn\u2019t have taken one \u201cno\u201d from the Treasury as the definitive word? At least the Kemi that Kemi was trying to present to the inquiry wouldn\u2019t. But Kemi had had time to go through all the departmental records faithfully preserved by the Blob and wasn\u2019t able to find one that showed she had pressed the Treasury again for money.</p> <p>Here\u2019s where it got interesting. Because in January 2024, shortly after the ITV programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/13/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office-why-it-took-a-tv-series-to-bring-the-post-office-scandal-to-light\">Mr Bates vs the Post Office</a>, which proved to be a wake-up call not just to the country but to the government as well, was aired, Kemi chose to fire Henry Staunton, the chair of the Post Office. Now the coincidences began to pile up. Staunton\u2019s sacking was leaked to the media just before Kemi was due to have what might have been a tricky interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Now she could look like a hard arse.</p> <p>Kemi shook her head. She had no idea how the leak could have happened. It was all terrible. No wonder she was so furious.

      "bodyText": "Look on the bright side. Kemi Badenoch lasted two and a half hours in the witness stand at the Post Office inquiry without losing it. She didn\u2019t get into an argument with Jason Beer, the counsel for the crown, though that could be because his questions were not unduly threatening. After all, we were there to hear Kemi\u2019s version of events. Other versions of the truth may be available. Nor did she square up to any of those in the public gallery who laughed when Beer thanked her for answering \u201csome\u201d of his questions. Not that Kemi nailed it. Like many narcissists, she is a curious mixture of the thick- and thin-skinned. She likes to present herself as a no-nonsense, tough woman. Someone who isn\u2019t afraid to go toe-to-toe with her opponents. Who can tell it like it is. But beneath the surface there\u2019s a vulnerability that she despises. It\u2019s why she lashes out so readily. The person she dislikes the most is herself. There\u2019s a brittleness to all her interactions that her admirers mistake for strength, and the inquiry showed her at her worst. Kemi likes to be the one in charge. The person doing the questioning. Making the decisions. She can\u2019t bear the passivity of the witness box. So what we got was a very closed down KemiKaze. Guarded in all her replies. Never giving away more than was strictly necessary. I can\u2019t remember a single occasion when she expressed any emotion about what the post office operatives had been through. Where other witnesses have begun their evidence with a personal statement of regret for all that has happened, Kemi said nothing. Because she feels nothing. She is incapable of that level of empathy for other people. That\u2019s just the way she\u2019s made. Beer began by discussing her ministerial responsibilities. It had taken her a while to get to grips with Horizon scandal, she said, because she had been too busy with her role of equalities minister in the first half of 2023. That will have come as a bit of a shock to her colleagues. But maybe she had done a lot of the equalities stuff while working from home. Then we got to the matter of compensation and redress. By the late summer of 2023 she had been reminded by Kevin Hollinrake, then a junior minister in the Department for Business and Trade, that the government had been slow to pay financial compensation to the post office operatives. So she had written to Jeremy Hunt, the then chancellor, to suggest the government offer \u00a3100,000 to every victim. Regardless of the extent of their claim. The Treasury blocked this, saying it didn\u2019t represent good value for the taxpayer. Badenoch didn\u2019t even blame Jezza for this. Rather she pointed the finger at the government machine. The civil service. Time and again, Kemi was keen to find fault in the Blob. It was always looking for petty regulation rather than the bigger picture that only she could see. As if there were no benefits to proper oversight. If Kemi got her way the civil service would almost be regulation-free. Though perhaps Kemi doth protest too much. Because when she got knocked back by the Treasury, there is no record of her having given the post office operatives much thought again. Though she would have liked us to believe they were always in her mind. She got as far as contemplating using a ministerial direction to liberate the cash, but as there was no cash to liberate, that idea crashed and burned. Thereafter we got a wall of silence from Kemi and her department. That\u2019s the government machine for you. Dozens of civil servants with nothing better to do than send endless memos and letters on Kemi\u2019s behalf and yet the evidence trail had gone mysteriously cold. Surely someone as combative as Kemi wouldn\u2019t have taken one \u201cno\u201d from the Treasury as the definitive word? At least the Kemi that Kemi was trying to present to the inquiry wouldn\u2019t. But Kemi had had time to go through all the departmental records faithfully preserved by the Blob and wasn\u2019t able to find one that showed she had pressed the Treasury again for money. Here\u2019s where it got interesting. Because in January 2024, shortly after the ITV programme Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which proved to be a wake-up call not just to the country but to the government as well, was aired, Kemi chose to fire Henry Staunton, the chair of the Post Office. Now the coincidences began to pile up. Staunton\u2019s sacking was leaked to the media just before Kemi was due to have what might have been a tricky interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Now she could look like a hard arse. Kemi shook her head. She had no idea how the leak could have happened. It was all terrible. No wonder she was so furious. Normally Kemi is the first person to leak something. She is renowned for it in Westminster. But no, someone had beaten her to it to leak something so obviously beneficial. Kemi was beside herself. But she didn\u2019t regret sacking him. He was guilty of bullying behaviour and wasn\u2019t very good at his job. Physician heal thyself. If Kemi was looking for someone to sack for being a bit crap, she could have started with herself. Had Staunton been around to defend himself, he might have reminded the inquiry that he had alleged he had been instructed to delay compensation payments because the government didn\u2019t want to have to budget for them so close to a general election. Kemi has always denied saying this. Though you can\u2019t rule out someone else in her team having said it. Nor can you ignore the results. Because in the 17 months up to July this year that Badenoch was business secretary, no money was allocated or paid to the post office operatives. The delays kept on coming. But Kemi maintained her attack on the machine. Everything was their fault. The previous Conservative government was entirely blameless. Especially her. In her own mind she was the saviour of the post office operatives. Though judging by the laughs from the back of the room, they don\u2019t see it in quite the same way.

The men arrived at the Albanian port of Sh\u00ebngjin aboard a military vessel on Friday after being rescued in international waters while trying to make their way to Europe. The Italian government had argued that all should be returned to their \u201csafe\u201d home countries of Egypt and Bangladesh. One man who had originally formed part of the group was already taken to Italy after he was deemed vulnerable. Monday\u2019s ruling marked the second time that Italian judges have ordered the return of people from the hub in Albania to Italy, further raising questions about the EU\u2019s plans to establish migration processing and detention centres outside the bloc. Italy\u2019s government, led by Giorgia Meloni\u2019s far-right Brothers of Italy, angrily condemned the judges\u2019 decision on Monday, blaming \u201cpoliticised magistrates\u201d who \u201cwould like to abolish Italy\u2019s borders\u201d. \u201cAnother political sentence, not against the government, but against Italians and their security,\u201d said the deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini. Under the deal, men from countries deemed \u201csafe\u201d and intercepted in international waters while attempting to cross from Africa to Europe are supposed to be held in Albania while their asylum claims are processed. The scheme, which excludes women, children and vulnerable individuals, could process up to 3,000 men a month. However, since the hubs were opened on 11 October only 24 people have arrived in Albania in total and, after Monday\u2019s ruling, all will have been transferred to Italy on the order of judges who have ruled they cannot be sent back to their countries of origin. Aid workers and opposition parties attacked the Italy-Albania deal, hailed by far-right leaders and others in Europe as a potential blueprint for the future of migration, as a \u201ccomplete failure\u201d and \u201cfinancial disaster\u201d on Monday. \u201cThis is the story of a failure, of the inability or lack of willingness to manage the phenomenon,\u201d said Laura Boldrini, an MP for the Democratic party and a former spokesperson for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees for southern Europe. \u201cI hope that Giorgia Meloni at least feels great embarrassment for these people who are being bounced around like ping-pong balls for a game that is purely propagandistic. Far from being a model for Europe, this is a boomerang. The migrant facilities in Albania serve no purpose other than to humiliate migrants used as puppets.\u201d The judges\u2019 rulings that the 24 men should be transferred to Italy in effect support a previous ruling of the European Union\u2019s court of justice (ECJ) which the Italian government was accused of disregarding. Only people coming from a list of 18 nations Italy classified as \u201csafe\u201d can be sent to Albania. Egypt and Bangladesh are among them, but the ECJ ruled that a country outside the bloc could not be declared safe unless its entire territory was deemed safe. The bill for the initiative, which NGOs have labelled \u201cinhumane, absurd and a costly system that breaches international human rights obligations\u201d, is estimated at about \u20ac1bn (\u00a3830m) over five years. The Albania deal row has exacerbated the already tense relations between the government and the judiciary, with the justice minister, Carlo Nordio, attacking the magistrates. \u201cThe definition of a safe country cannot be [left] up to the judiciary,\u201d he said.",

Further, it is opening the floodgates for a global carbon market that will have devastating impacts on communities in the global south, on Indigenous peoples, and on small peasant farmers first and foremost.

Real time data indicate that they continued to rise in 2024. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) has increased from around 278 ppm in 1750 to 420 ppm in 2023, an increase of 51%. This traps heat and causes temperatures to rise.</p> <p><strong>Ocean heat content</strong> in 2023 was the highest on record and preliminary data show 2024 has continued at comparable levels. Ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. From 2005 to 2023, the ocean absorbed on average approximately 3.1 million terawatt-hours (TWh) of heat each year. This is more than 18 times the world\u2019s energy consumption in 2023.</p> <p><strong>Sea level rise </strong>is accelerating because of thermal expansion of warmer waters and melting glaciers and ice sheets. From 2014-2023, global mean sea level rose at a rate of 4.77 mm per year, more than double the rate between 1993 and 2002. The El Ni\u00f1o effect meant it grew even more rapidly in 2023. Preliminary 2024 data shows that, with the decline of El Ni\u00f1o, it has fallen back to levels consistent with the rising trend from 2014 to 2022.</p> <p><strong>Glacier loss </strong>is worsening. In 2023, glaciers lost a record 1.2-meter water equivalent of ice \u2013 about five times the amount of water in the Dead Sea. It was the largest loss since measurements began in 1953 and was due to extreme melting in North America and Europe. In Switzerland, glaciers lost about 10% of their remaining volume in 2021/2022 and 2022/2023.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67320e878f083e13c04fdea2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-11T14:05:44.627Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ben Spencer, science editor at the Sunday Times, is also at the press conference.

The researchers say it shows that there is \u201cplenty of potential funding out there in the hands of the fossil fuel companies that helped create\u201d the climate crisis.</p> <p>The central task of Cop29 is to agree on delivering at least $1tn a year to developing nations so they can cut emissions, build protection against extreme weather for their citizens and recover from disasters. </p>    <p>The researchers examined the earnings of 93 of big fossil fuel companies in 2022 comparing their expected profits to their actual profits after Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine spiked oil prices. They found $490bn in unearned superprofits, above and beyond usual high profits. It is also a minimum estimate, as big oil and gas producers in Russia, Iran and Venezuela keep their earnings secret.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge governments around the world to use their power to use such superprofits for the benefit of those most affected by climate change at Cop29 in Baku,\u201d said Prof Florian Egli, at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, who led the research. UN secretary general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/20/un-secretary-general-tax-fossil-fuel-companies-climate-crisis\">Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has called for windfall tax</a>. </p> <p>US companies, such as ExxonMobil, gained $143bn, while $103bn went to companies headquartered in the UK, France and Canada, such as BP and TotalEnergies, the researchers found. Some countries did introduce windfall taxes but these covered only a fraction of the superprofits and were not used for climate action.</p> <p>Colossal profits are nothing new in the oil and gas industry. It has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/revealed-oil-sectors-staggering-profits-last-50-years\">$1tn a year in pure profit every year for the last 50 years</a>, with the recent energy price crisis only boosting profits higher. </p> <p>Furthermore, big oil is also the recipient of huge subsidies from governments - almost literally pouring petrol on the climate crisis fire. Another <a href=\"https://data.one.org/data-dives/climate-financing-hypocrisy/\">report released at Cop29</a> by justice campaign group One found rich countries spent $2.7tn on domestic fossil fuel subsidies between 2010 and 2022, six times more than they committed for international climate finance.</p> <p>\u201cThis data shows the true scale of climate hypocrisy: instead of fulfilling their promises to support climate-vulnerable countries, wealthy countries are propping up a trillion-dollar industry with trillions in subsidies.

Azerbaijan, using COP29 as a fa\u00e7ade, is ramping up control under a false \u201cgreen\u201d agenda, tightening its grip on power, and escalating regional tensions.</p> <p>For over 20 years, Azerbaijan\u2019s regime led by Aliyev have kept people oppressed, fostering poverty, fear, and silence. This authoritarian trend isn\u2019t isolated\u2013across the region, people like Ivanishvili, Putin, Erdogan, theocratic regime in Iran are deepening control, stifling dissent, oppressing their own people and using war and ethnic cleansing against Armenians, Ukrainians, Kurds and other ethnic minorities to justify brutal policies. Those who speak out\u2013journalists, activists, scholars\u2013are often met with imprisonment and violence.

That is particularly true for the funding needed by vulnerable communities to build protection against climate impacts, such as flood defences, so-called adaptation.</p> <p>The world\u2019s developing nations need about $1bn a day just to cope with the extreme weather impacts of today, with only 1.3C of global heating, according to a <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2024\">UN Environment Programme (Unep) report</a> published on Thursday. What they are actually receiving is less than a tenth of that, about $75m a day.</p> <p>What\u2019s worse is that while adaptation funding is increasing \u2013 from $22bn in 2021 to $28bn in 2022 \u2013 the deadly impacts of the climate crisis are increasing far faster, said Henry Neufeldt, lead author of the Unep report.</p> <p>UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres put it in typically stark terms: \u201cClimate calamity is the new reality and we\u2019re not keeping up. The climate crisis is here. We can\u2019t postpone protection. We must adapt \u2013 now.\u201d</p> <p>He noted that while adaptation funding is falling far short of what is required, \u201cthe purveyors of all this destruction \u2013 particularly the fossil fuel industry \u2013 reap massive profits and subsidies\u201d.</p>    <p>At Cop26 in 2021, the Glasgow Climate Pact set a goal of doubling adaptation finance to at least $38bn by 2025. That may be achieved, but will remain far below the $230bn \u2013 $415bn range estimated by the UN as necessary.</p> <p>\u201cThe gap is extremely large \u2013 we need a step change,\u201d said Paul Watkiss, another author of the Unep report.</p> <p>There are three strands of climate finance: money for cutting emissions, also called mitigation, money for adaptation, and money for disaster recovery, also called loss and damage.</p> <p>Watkiss said all are interrelated: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mitigate and you don\u2019t adapt, you get really high loss and damage. So we\u2019re starting to see these very large scale events [like the recent floods in Spain] coming through. The tragedy is terrible, but hopefully it starts to provide an impetus to say, if you don\u2019t adapt, that will lead to much higher costs overall. It\u2019s much more efficient and effective to finance adaptation than it is to do nothing.\u201d</p> <p>The negotiators at Cop29 have been told what is at stake.

Thankfully, the Reuters news agency has provided a glossary of terms. Here are some you will see peppered throughout our coverage in the coming fortnight. </p> <p><strong>UNFCCC</strong>: This acronym stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is the name of both the 1992 treaty committing nearly 200 countries to fighting global warming and the secretariat set up to implement that treaty.</p> <p><strong>COP</strong>: This acronym stands for Conference of Parties, and describes the annual summit of countries that have signed the UNFCCC treaty. This year\u2019s COP29 meeting in Baku marks the 29th such gathering since the UNFCCC took effect in 1994.</p> <p><strong>NCQG</strong>: This relatively new acronym will be focal at COP29. It stands for the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, an annual target for funding developing country climate efforts.</p> <p><strong>NDC</strong>: Most often, these NDCs or Nationally Determined Contributions are referred to simply as \u201ccountry pledges\u201d and describe national action plans for reducing its emissions and adapting to climate impacts. The next round of NDCs are due in February, though some countries plan to submit new plans in Baku.<br><br><strong>GLOBAL WARMING</strong>: The term describes the gradual increase in the global average temperature.</p> <p><strong>CLIMATE CHANGE</strong>: While this term is often used interchangeably with \u201cglobal warming,\u201d it means something different. Climate change describes global warming as well as its consequences, such as extreme weather events. (At the Guardian, we will often use the terms <strong>CLIMATE BREAKDOWN</strong> or <strong>CLIMATE CRISIS</strong> to better convey the gravity of the situation.)</p> <p><strong>GREENHOUSE GASES</strong>: These gases, sometimes referred to simply as GHGs, are able to trap solar heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming. The most powerful GHGs are methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are also referred to as \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d because both molecules contain carbon. The world\u2019s excess carbon emissions come mostly from the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial activities.</p> <p><strong>PARIS AGREEMENT</strong>: Under this 2015 treaty from the COP21 talks in Paris, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) above the pre-industrial average, with a goal of holding it to 1.5C (2.7F). The Paris pact also calls for national emissions-cutting pledges to be updated every five years</p> <p><strong>NET ZERO</strong>: This term does not mean releasing zero emissions, but rather releasing no more than the amount being recaptured by CO2 abatement technologies, tree planting, or other means. Reaching \u201cnet zero\u201d would mean atmospheric GHG concentrations stop increasing.</p> <p><strong>LOSS AND DAMAGE</strong>: Governments last year pledged $800 million toward a new \u2018loss and damage\u2019 fund to help poorer nations being hit by climate-fueled disasters. The fund, which now has a director and a host nation, will now be deciding how the funds should be dispersed and calling for more contributions at COP29.</p> <p><strong>CARBON OFFSET</strong>: Also known as a \u201ccarbon credit,\u201d these instruments allow a country or company to compensate for some of their carbon emissions by investing in projects to bring emissions down elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>ARTICLE 6</strong>: This term refers to a provision in the Paris Agreement on carbon offsets, and is used as shorthand for UNFCCC efforts to regulate international trading in carbon credits. Governments are hoping to resolve rules for trading carbon offsets at COP29 to allow for these markets to become operational.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6731a24e8f08a0d8bfbd3b98\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-11T06:28:26.406Z\">6.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some pictures of how things are looking in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, which has been set up in full summit mode.</p>       </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6730f52e8f08a0d8bfbd3784\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ajit-niranjan\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-11T06:24:05.893Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>WHAT IS COP29 IN AZERBAIJAN AND DOES IT MATTER?</strong></p> <p>The 29th United Nations climate conference has begun, with diplomats descending on Baku, Azerbaijan, to thrash out arguments over planet-heating pollutants and the money needed to deal with them.</p> <p>Like the 28 \u201cconferences of the parties\u201d that came before, Cop29 is not expected to stop the climate from changing - but delegates say that\u2019s no reason to dismiss it as hot air. Cops are the key diplomatic arenas in which poor countries that have done little to heat the planet can put pressure on rich countries that hooked the world on fossil fuels. In turn, rich countries with the resources to transition quickly can encourage poor countries to clean up faster and sooner.</p> <p><strong>WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME OF COP29?</strong></p> <p>This year\u2019s meeting will revolve around efforts to stump up the funds needed to cut pollution and adapt to more violent weather. Rich countries missed a goal to get poor countries $100 billion a year in climate finance from 2020, a target set in a previous Cop that experts deemed weak and patchy. Poor countries are now pushing for $1tr a year by 2030 - including cash to fix the destruction caused by extreme weather - but rich countries are reluctant to go higher unless the pool of contributors grows larger.</p> <p>If diplomats reach a good deal on money this month, it could build trust and spark greater ambition when countries submit sorely-needed action plans to cut pollution at Cop30 in Brazil next year.</p> <p><strong>WILL COP29 SUCCEED?</strong></p> <p>More than 32,000 participants have registered for the conference but observers are not expecting them to deliver transformational change. Several prominent world leaders are skipping the summit and sending deputies instead - including the EU\u2019s Ursula von der Leyen, the US\u2019s Joe Biden, China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz. The US just elected Donald Trump as president, who took the country out of the Paris climate agreement when he last sat in the White House. Papua New Guinea has pulled its ministers out of this year\u2019s Cop altogether in protest at the failure of rich countries to live up to their promises.</p> <p>And beneath the high-level geopolitics, observers have also questioned whether the host is up to the task of shepherding overworked diplomats to find common ground. Azerbaijan, a middle-income country in central Asia that is rich in oil but poor in water, is well-poised to bridge the divide between the different interest groups. But a secret recording last week appeared to show the Cop29 CEO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-ceo-filmed-agreeing-to-facilitate-fossil-fuel-deals-at-climate-summit\">agreeing to facilitate fossil fuel deals</a>.</p> <p>The hope is that the conference can really bring countries together, and continue to push progress on reducing the world\u2019s CO2 emissions.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6730f5558f08a0d8bfbd3788\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-11T06:24:05.893Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning, this is Damien Gayle, your online guide to Cop29 \u2026</p> <p>The 29th Conference of the Parties is beginning in Baku, Azerbaijan, this morning and, as we do every year, the Guardian environment desk will be blogging every cough and spit by the thousands of delegates, campaigners, lobbyists and others who have travelled to visit the climate talks.</p> <p>Our team of reporters has already travelled to Baku, and I will be anchoring coverage from London, weaving together their contributions while scanning social media and wires news feeds to achieve as close to total coverage as is possible for one man and a blog.</p> <p>If you have any comments or suggestions on things we could be covering, or news to share, please don\u2019t hesitate to drop me a line via email.

Cop29 has got off to a bit of a rocky start, with severe delays for the opening plenary, but the hosts will claim that getting the draft decision on article 6 approved is an early win. Environmental campaigners will feel otherwise. The key events today were: Diplomats greenlit key rules that govern the trade of carbon credits, breaking a years-long deadlock over contentious carbon markets The year 2024 is on track to be the warmest year on record after an extended streak of exceptionally high monthly global mean temperatures, the World Meteorological Organisation said US climate envoy John Podesta said the climate fight will not stop under new president Donald Trump. Windfall \u2018superprofits\u2019 from oil companies totalled half a trillion dollars in a single year A hyperrealistic \u201cdead beached whale\u201d drew attention in Baku UN climate chief Simon Stiell told the conference: \u201cWhat inspires me is human ingenuity and determination. Our ability to get knocked down and to get up again over and over again, until we accomplish our goals.\u201d A press conference by the presidency that had been scheduled to take place after the opening plenary has been pushed back to tomorrow morning, so that\u2019s likely to be the last we\u2019ll hear from Babayev and the hosts today. However, critical reaction to the article 6 will continue \u2013 Erika Lennon, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, has said: Today, states allowed this rogue move from the supervisory body to prevail in the quest to start Cop29 with a \u2018win\u2019. But this is hardly a win for people or the planet. Approving these carbon market rules without discussion or debate, sets a dangerous precedent for the entire negotiation process. This is very concerning from a procedural standpoint: it bypasses states\u2019 ability to even discuss, much less revise the standards before they go into effect. States\u2019 oversight is all the more critical as the supervisory body\u2019s efforts to get this done has resulted in risky rules that will lead to human rights violations and environmental harm. While states won\u2019t be able to undo this move, they can still partially correct the wrong by giving strong guidance to the supervisory body that ensures further rules are adopted in line with science, human rights, and international law.\u201c Lise Masson of Friends of the Earth has responded to the article 6 news with disappointment, a reaction likely to be shared by many climate campaigners: \u201cThe gavelling through of carbon markets on the first day of Cop29 is unacceptable and undermines the credibility of the whole process. Further, it is opening the floodgates for a global carbon market that will have devastating impacts on communities in the global south, on Indigenous peoples, and on small peasant farmers first and foremost. Carbon markets are not climate finance, and we cannot accept these neocolonial schemes to be propped up as a success of Cop29 in lieu of paying the climate debt owed to the global south.\u201d Diplomats have greenlit key rules that govern the trade of \u201ccarbon credits\u201d at the end of the first day of Cop29 in Azerbaijan, breaking a yearslong deadlock over contentious carbon markets. The draft decision on article 6 (which can be read here) goes through with no objection to a round of applause. This will concern some delegates, and one speaker immediately expresses concern that the way the decision was rushed through at the start of the conference does not reflect the collaborative way these things should be worked on, and urges the conference not to continue this trend. This is a reference to Cop28, where the UAE similarly pushed through a first day decision despite the worries of some countries. In London, climate activists marked the first day of the Cop29 climate summit in Azerbaijan with a protest outside the headquarters of the oil and gas company BP. Protestors held a banner reading: \u201cBP, stop fuelling genocide and climate breakdown.\u201d They called on the company to halt its oil and gas extraction, its \u201chijacking\u201d of the conference of the parties process and its \u2018profiteering from genocide\u2019. A statement to press circulated by Fossil Free London, which organised the protest, said BP has a long-term corporate relationship with the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (Socar) and that the two companies recently agreed to explore new fields to drill. The Cop29 president, Mukhtar Babayev, spent 26 years working for SOCAR. The demonstration was responding to an international campaign coordinated by Energy Embargo for Palestine, Filistin \u0130\u00e7in 1000 Gen\u00e7 and the Palestinian-led Global Energy Embargo for Palestine. About 30% of Israel\u2019s oil is sourced from Azerbaijan, reaching the middle east via Turkey through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which is majority owned by BP. Socar is the second largest shareholder in the pipeline. Joanna Warrington, a campaigner with Fossil Free London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the very same fossil fuel giants that profit from the suffering of billions as our climate tips closer to collapse, which are fuelling and enabling Israel\u2019s horrific colonial genocide. This is all playing out right in front of our world leaders, who sit clapping in the audience instead of standing up to protect human rights and life. \u201cClimate crisis and genocide are being made and supported here in London. Our global political processes are being polluted by corporations like BP that continue to tear up our society so that the resultant blood flow can carry massive profits to them.\u201d Food and drink is always a crucial element at the annual climate summits, and as journalists and negotiators begin the long journey of finding their way around the texts and issues, they also put time into finding their way around the massive site, and discovering what they\u2019re going to be eating for the next two weeks. Sadly for a climate conference, it looks as if the vegan option is currently the most expensive one. And an Americano with soy milk is a handsome \u00a37.50. The UK\u2019s net zero secretary is heading for Cop which is, he says, the \u201conce a year chance to put countries on the spot\u201d. \u201cAt this summit you\u2019ll have a British government representing which believes in doing its bit at home and abroad,\u201d he says in this wee video. Of course, he has a fair point; in a number of countries around they just don\u2019t have that luxury. Cop29 president Mukhtar Babayev finally appears on stage to apologise for the delay and says he hopes to conclude today\u2019s meeting by 11pm tonight local time (7pm GMT). Most of his statement is formulaic, announcing when various subsidiary bodies will report back on their progress through the conference. Babayev says he will do everything he can to conclude negotiations in the second half of the conference. The crucial matter of article 6.4 is agenda item 15b, but Babayev is moving fast. To read more about that thorny issue, my colleague Patrick Greenfield has explained more here: Cop-watchers hoping for an early breakthrough on carbon markets are instead waiting for a much-delayed plenary session to resume. This morning\u2019s opening session, which was paused due to fights over the summit agenda, has been inching back in one-hour and half-hour increments as the new scheduled times approach. Pauses to proceedings aren\u2019t a new phenomenon at climate summits - the talks are complex and procedural issues are often a source of frustration for weary negotiators - but delays are more common at the end of the conference, when they enter their final frantic phase, rather than on the first day. Mohamed Adow of the thinktank Power Shift Africa has been tweeting about the reasons behind the delays to the opening, which he attributes to wrangling over what the global stocktake covers: Anyone clicking on to www.cop29.com is in for a surprise. The site has been acquired by Global Witness and now leads with the faces of five big oil bosses and the headline \u201cFossil fuel companies are destroying the planet for profit. They broke it, they should pay for it.\u201d The CEOs are Mike Wirth at Chevron, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 at TotalEnergies, Murray Auchinloss at BP, Darren Woods at ExxonMobil and Wael Sawan at Shell. The site is promoting Global Witness\u2019s \u201cPayback Time\u201d campaign, which is supported by actor Rosario Dawson, film director Adam McKay, activists Vanessa Nakate and Luisa Neubauer and more. The oil and gas industry made $4tn in pre-tax profits in 2022, notes Global Witness. That is 10 times the annual cost of climate damages in developing countries, estimated at about $400bn a year. The UN\u2019s Loss and Damage Fund, aimed at helping poorer nations hit by climate disasters, contains less than 0.2% of this $400bn figure. Mary Robinson, formerly UN climate envoy and President of Ireland, said: \u201cPeople need money to rebuild and adapt to our increasingly extreme climate. But right now the oil and gas companies fuelling climate collapse are getting away scot-free \u2013 making immense profits from products they have known for decades would harm the planet. It\u2019s high time we made them pay up.\u201d Luana, an Indigenous climate activist whose community was hit by the recent devastating floods in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, said: \u201cEveryone is afraid of the rain now, and all four seasons can happen on the same day. It\u2019s the big companies who are largely responsible, so they should pay more, right?\u201d Global Witness said it acquired thecop29.comsite from an Indian couple who used the domain for their family business. They were offered a significant sum by Azerbaijan\u2019s COP29 team for the site, Global Witness said, but the owners were worried about climate breakdown and decided to let Global Witness have it instead. At Cop29 on Monday evening, US climate envoy John Podesta said the climate fight will not stop under President Trump. \u201cAlthough under Donald Trump\u2019s leadership the U.S. federal government placed climate-related actions on the back burner, efforts to prevent climate change remain a commitment in the U.S. and will confidently continue,\u201d he said. Trump has pledged to deregulate the energy sector and pull the nation from the Paris Climate Agreement. Yet \u201cthis is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet,\u201d Podesta said. Under President Biden, the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest downpayment on the green transition seen in US history. \u201cThe fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country,\u201d said Podesta. The UN climate conference in Baku represents a \u201ccritical opportunity to cement our progress.\u201d Among the United States\u2019 top goals for the climate talks will be securing mitigation plans for greenhouse gases other than CO2, such as methane. On Tuesday, the nation will co-host a summit on the issue with China and Cop29 host Azerbaijan. Other major priorities, Podesta said, will be reaching an agreement on the use of carbon trading and increasing ambition on clean energy deployment, Another crucial component of the climate talks, Podesta said, will be ensuring small economies have access to climate finance from rich nations \u2014 \u201cvery important work\u201d. \u201cCOP29 is a crucial opportunity to solidify our progress and keep 1.5 degrees alive, accelerate progress in reducing all greenhouse gases, and perhaps most importantly, strengthen global cooperation in adaptation and climate finance. We are here to work, and we are committed to achieving a successful outcome at COP29.\u201d The Cop29 presidency is hoping to score an early win by ending a years-long blockage over rules to govern carbon markets. In theory carbon markets let rich countries or more often corporations buy \u201ccarbon credits\u201d from poor countries; the company or country buys them via an organisation which promises to pay communities to do things like planting trees and building wind turbines, and that buys the country/corporation more time to cut their own pollution. It\u2019s an idea that could speed up the energy transition by bringing cash to where it\u2019s needed - but has been held back by the dodgy and harmful projects that have plagued the system since the start. Civil society groups fear the final rules to bring the market to life may be gavelled through in Baku without a proper debate, after a supervisory body adopted standards last month in a process that critics say overstepped its mandate. They are also keen to stress that the money from carbon markets should not replace the vast sums of climate finance that poor countries say they are owed by richer ones - a point also made by a Drake-themed sticker spotted on a water bottle at the conference. The year 2024 is on track to be the warmest year on record after an extended streak of exceptionally high monthly global mean temperatures, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has announced. The January \u2013 September 2024 global mean surface air temperature was 1.54 \u00b0C (with a margin of uncertainty of \u00b10.13\u00b0C) above the pre-industrial average, boosted by a warming El Ni\u00f1o event, according to an analysis of six international datasets used by WMO. Greenhouse Gases reached record observed levels in 2023. Real time data indicate that they continued to rise in 2024. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased from around 278 ppm in 1750 to 420 ppm in 2023, an increase of 51%. This traps heat and causes temperatures to rise. Ocean heat content in 2023 was the highest on record and preliminary data show 2024 has continued at comparable levels. Ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. From 2005 to 2023, the ocean absorbed on average approximately 3.1 million terawatt-hours (TWh) of heat each year. This is more than 18 times the world\u2019s energy consumption in 2023. Sea level rise is accelerating because of thermal expansion of warmer waters and melting glaciers and ice sheets. From 2014-2023, global mean sea level rose at a rate of 4.77 mm per year, more than double the rate between 1993 and 2002. The El Ni\u00f1o effect meant it grew even more rapidly in 2023. Preliminary 2024 data shows that, with the decline of El Ni\u00f1o, it has fallen back to levels consistent with the rising trend from 2014 to 2022. Glacier loss is worsening. In 2023, glaciers lost a record 1.2-meter water equivalent of ice \u2013 about five times the amount of water in the Dead Sea. It was the largest loss since measurements began in 1953 and was due to extreme melting in North America and Europe. In Switzerland, glaciers lost about 10% of their remaining volume in 2021/2022 and 2022/2023. Ben Spencer, science editor at the Sunday Times, is also at the press conference. John Podesta has stated that climate change \u201cis a matter of life and death\u201d, and warns that when Trump says he will dismantle the fight against global warming \u201cwe should believe him\u201d. #cop29 On X Lauren Boland notes that John Podesta, senior advisor on climate to US President Joe Biden, says the US election outcome was \u201cbitterly disappointing\u201d for climate. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the next administration will try to make a U-turn and reverse progress\u201d \u201cIs there an opening for China to now take the lead?\u201d Justin Rowlatt from the BBC asks the US\u2019s John Podesta. \u201cAs the world\u2019s largest emitter they have an obligation to \u2026 come forward with a 1.5 aligned NDC,\u201d says Podesta. That\u2019s a nationally determined contribution and indicates how countries will reduce their emissions. \u201cThey have an important role to play.\u201d There will be a joint summit on methane tomorrow as well. John Podesta, senior adviser to US president Joe Biden on climate policy, is now heading a press conference. One journalist asks if the US has been diminished at the summit. Podesta says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working very hard with countries \u2026 We\u2019ll continue to encourage people work diligently.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re making progress on finally finishing article 6 and we\u2019re working on important articles to build on the Dubai Consensus, particularly on tripling renewables and building more battery capacity.\u201d The first of our new series This is Climate Breakdown has just launched. When heavy rain came to her neighbourhood in Nova Scotia in 2023, Tera Sisco\u2019s youngest son was staying with her ex-husband, and got caught up in the terrible flash floods that followed. We\u2019ve been working with the Climate Disaster Project and the International Red Cross to collect testimonies from people hit by the affects of the crisis. Over the next two weeks we\u2019ll share more stories from Brazil, Burkina Faso, France, South Africa, China, and more. The windfall \u201csuperprofits\u201d from oil and gas companies totalled half a trillions dollars in a single year, analysis has revealed. The researchers say it shows that there is \u201cplenty of potential funding out there in the hands of the fossil fuel companies that helped create\u201d the climate crisis. The central task of Cop29 is to agree on delivering at least $1tn a year to developing nations so they can cut emissions, build protection against extreme weather for their citizens and recover from disasters. The researchers examined the earnings of 93 of big fossil fuel companies in 2022 comparing their expected profits to their actual profits after Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine spiked oil prices. They found $490bn in unearned superprofits, above and beyond usual high profits. It is also a minimum estimate, as big oil and gas producers in Russia, Iran and Venezuela keep their earnings secret. \u201cWe urge governments around the world to use their power to use such superprofits for the benefit of those most affected by climate change at Cop29 in Baku,\u201d said Prof Florian Egli, at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, who led the research. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has called for windfall tax. US companies, such as ExxonMobil, gained $143bn, while $103bn went to companies headquartered in the UK, France and Canada, such as BP and TotalEnergies, the researchers found. Some countries did introduce windfall taxes but these covered only a fraction of the superprofits and were not used for climate action. Colossal profits are nothing new in the oil and gas industry. It has made $1tn a year in pure profit every year for the last 50 years, with the recent energy price crisis only boosting profits higher. Furthermore, big oil is also the recipient of huge subsidies from governments - almost literally pouring petrol on the climate crisis fire. Another report released at Cop29 by justice campaign group One found rich countries spent $2.7tn on domestic fossil fuel subsidies between 2010 and 2022, six times more than they committed for international climate finance. \u201cThis data shows the true scale of climate hypocrisy: instead of fulfilling their promises to support climate-vulnerable countries, wealthy countries are propping up a trillion-dollar industry with trillions in subsidies. World leaders at Cop29 have a clear choice: redirect resources for everyone\u2019s benefit,\u201d said Joseph Kraus at One. The world\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer, the US, spent five times more on fossil fuel subsidies than climate finance over the period, while the UK both spent nine times more. Cop29 hosts Azerbaijan spent 1800 times more, while the host of last year\u2019s Cop28, the United Arab Emirates, spent over 150 times more. The world\u2019s second biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabia spent 1200 times more. The G20 agreed in 2009 to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, which largely benefit the well-off. Little progress has been made since. The Cop opening plenary still hasn\u2019t resumed, says Carbon Brief\u2019s Simon Evans. Interesting piece of analysis in Politico about the role that one of Britain\u2019s own companies BP plays in Azerbaijan. BP is Azerbaijan\u2019s biggest foreign investor. There\u2019s even a joke popular in the region that the Azerbaijani government sees two U.K. power bases in Baku: the British Embassy and BP\u2019s office. That three-way relationship means the U.K. oil and gas multinational\u2019s influence \u2014 and the British government\u2019s ties to it \u2014 will loom large over the U.K.\u2019s participation in the key United Nations-organized climate summit in Baku this week\u2026. BP did more than any company to help Azerbaijan build up its oil and gas wealth after the fall of the Soviet Union, creating a lasting bond between London and Baku. There are reports on social media of a hyper realistic model of a dead whale being shown in Baku. According to Zahra Badalbayli, the model is by the Belgian art collective Captain Boomer. Cop29 is taking place in the shadow of the re-election of Donald Trump in the United States. His win was \u201chorrible\u201d news for the climate movement, said Allie Rosenbluth, co-manager of the climate NGO Oil Change International, at a press conference about the election result in Baku on Monday. During his first term, Trump rolled back dozens of environmental regulations. He also pulled the US from the Paris Climate Agreement \u2014 something he has pledged to do again. Jacob Johns, an Indigenous organizer with the US group A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, at the presser called the former president a \u201cfascist dictator.\u201d \u201cAs a Native American we are just devastated to see a second Trump presidency,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s impending role could place a major damper on US climate action plans and commitments to fund climate finance. But not all is lost, said Dean Bhekumuzi Bhebhe, senior just transitions and campaigns advisor with campaign group Power Shift Africa, said at the event. Other rich countries should be willing to fill the gap left by the US, he said: \u201cThey should be willing to pay more than their fair share of climate finance.\u201d There appear to be a few issues causing problems already at the conference. According to Carbon Brief\u2019s Dr Simon Evans the \u201copening plenary has been paused for consultations on the draft agenda, which includes a few disputed items\u201d. Among those disputed items are the EU\u2019s CBAM \u2013 that\u2019s the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a kind of carbon tariff, which has been under discussion for a long long time. According to Evans the attempt to get it onto the agenda last year failed. Apparently negotiators were up late last night trying to sort out this and other issues. According to Evans\u2019 latest update, the opening plenary will now resume at 1600 Baku time. Hallo, this is Bibi van der Zee, taking over from my colleague Damien Gayle. You can email us on Cop29@theguardian.com with thoughts, photos, and suggestions for what we should be reporting. Follow along for updates from Baku, on day one of this vitally important climate summit. Australia is hoping to secure hosting rights (in partnership with Pacific nations) for Cop31 in 2026, with an announcement on whether it has been successful possible \u2013 though not guaranteed \u2013 over the next fortnight. But the competition with Turkey for hosting rights has not been enough to get the Labor prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to Cop29, writes Adam Morton, Guardian Australia\u2019s climate and environment editor. Albanese has not attended a Cop since becoming national leader in 2022. Instead, Australia will be led by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, who will arrive for the second week and lead negotiations on the new collective quantified goal for climate finance (NCQG) along with the Egyptian environment minister, Yasmine Fouad. The assistant climate minister, Josh Wilson, is attending the first week, including representing Albanese at leaders\u2019 events. Bowen spoke with the Guardian shortly before the US election on what a second Donald Trump presidency could mean, the importance of a deal on finance in Baku and how the Australian government justifies approving new and expanded fossil fuel export developments while saying it is committed to limiting global heating to 1.5C. He acknowledged work on the NCQG would largely determine whether Cop29 was a success or failure. \u201cI probably should manage expectations, but\u2026 this is the finance Cop\u2026Getting an NCQG right is the key element.\u201d You can read the full interview at the link below. Notwithstanding fears of a lack of civic space for protests and activism at Cop29 in Baku, some people have staged a small demonstration at the summit. Azerbaijan has come under fire for its poor human rights record at home, its war against ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and its supplying oil to Israel through a pipeline transiting Turkey. Azerbaijan\u2019s state oil company potentially sealed deals worth $8bn since the spotlight turned on the country as the next host of the UN\u2019s Cop climate talks, an analysis claims. Global Witness said the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (Socar) had signed 25 deals with foreign firms in the year it is hosting talks aimed at slashing fossil fuel emissions to try to avert the worst consequences of climate breakdown. The environment NGO said the dealmaking was worth close to three times as much as the contracts signed with foreign firms in the previous 12 months. Patrick Galey, senior fossil fuels investigator at Global Witness, said: The climate crisis gets worse each year, and it seems as if each year we have another fossil fuel company using climate talks to secure pursue ever more oil and gas deals. Cop29, which vulnerable nations are depending on to secure a path for a future they can survive, risks being co-opted by Azerbaijan\u2019s state oil company. SOCAR\u2019s aims \u2013 to produce vast quantities of oil and gas for decades \u2013 is directly opposed to the stated aim of UN climate talks. This conflict of interest is undermining progress towards the one thing we know will prevent climate breakdown: a rapid and fair phase-out of fossil fuels. Big polluters should have no place in this discussion. We must kick them out of these talks before it\u2019s too late. In April, president Ilyan Aliyev \u2013 himself a former senior SOCAR executive \u2013 said hosting climate talks would not prevent Azerbaijan from exploiting oil and gas reserves he described as \u201ca gift from the gods\u201d. To meet increased EU demand for Azeri gas since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, SOCAR plans to produce the 2nd-highest percentage of new oil and gas of any state fossil fuel company, according to the Global Witness analysis. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, has also written for the Guardian this morning, her op-ed a foil to that of Cop president Mukhtar Babayev\u2019s on our comment pages. In her article, Thunberg dismisses Cop29 as just another at an \u201cauthoritarian petrostate with no respect for human rights\u201d, adding: Cop meetings have proven to be greenwashing conferences that legitimise countries\u2019 failures to ensure a livable world and future and have also allowed authoritarian regimes like Azerbaijan and the two previous hosts \u2013 the United Arab Emirates and Egypt \u2013 to continue violating human rights. Thunberg goes on: Azerbaijan\u2019s entire economy is built on fossil fuels, with the state-owned oil company Socar\u2019s oil and gas exports accounting for close to 90% of the country\u2019s exports. Despite what it might claim, Azerbaijan has no ambition to take climate action. It is planning to expand fossil fuel production, which is completely incompatible with the 1.5C limit and the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change. Many attenders of this year\u2019s Cop are scared to criticise the Azerbaijan government. Human Rights Watch recently published a statement explaining how it couldn\u2019t be certain that attenders\u2019 rights to peacefully protest would be guaranteed. In addition, Azerbaijan land and sea borders will remain closed during Cop29, making it only possible to travel in and out of the country by air, which causes pollution and which many Azerbaijan citizens can\u2019t afford. The reason given for closing borders at all Cops since the start of the Covid pandemic is to maintain \u201cnational security\u201d, but I\u2019ve heard many Azerbaijanis describe the situation as being \u201ckept in a prison\u201d. Thunberg herself is in Tbilisi, the capital of neighbouring Georgia, where \u2013 as we reported earlier \u2013 she has called for a demonstration this evening. You can read more of her op-ed by clicking the link below. A huge \u201cclimate debt\u201d is owed by the global north to the global south, according to campaigners at Cop29, writes Damian Carrington, environment editor. \u201cWe are asking for the down payment of a very large debt \u2013 a down payment of $5tn [a year],\u201d said Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network, global alliance of more than 1900 civil society organisations in over 130 countries. The argument is simple: rich nations prospered by burning fossil fuels and now need to fund poorer nations to avoid the same path, and cope with the severe heatwaves, floods and storms fuelled by global heating and already here. NGOs play a crucial role at climate summits, ensuring the voices of those most affected by the climate crisis are heard, and their participation is formally recognised by the UN. The groups are particularly important as many developing countries have small and overstretched delegations. \u201cWe know the debt is much larger, but $5tn is what we come here to demand,\u201d Essop said, wearing a bright lanyard stating \u201cGlobal North, pay up!! $5tn!\u201d. \u201cGovernments out there are absolutely capable of finding the money that does wrong in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThey found the money for military spending. They found the money for the genocide in Gaza. They find the money to subsidise and support the fossil fuel industry. To come here and say that they do not have money is absolutely untruthful and unacceptable.\u201d Delivering a finance deal for developing countries is the central task of Cop29. There is widespread agreement that trillions are needed and available, but who pays what and how is far strongly contested. Essop warned that failing to deliver a good finance deal will severely damage trust among the negotiating nations and therefore impact all other climate issues at Cop29, from carbon cutting plans to a fair transition for workers: \u201cDeveloping countries will just put their foot down and say, if we\u2019re not going to settle on finance, we\u2019re not settling on anything else.\u201d Mukhtar Babayev, the president of Cop29, has used a Guardian op-ed to call on the private sector to stump up cash for the developing world to invest in a low-carbon economy, writes Fiona Harvey, environment editor, who is in Baku. Babayev, the environment minister of Azerbaijan, the host of this year\u2019s climate conference, wrote in Monday\u2019s Guardian: The onus cannot fall entirely on government purses. Unleashing private finance for developing countries\u2019 transition has long been an ambition of climate talks. Without the private sector, there is no climate solution. The world needs more funds and it needs them faster. History shows we can mobilise the resources required; it\u2019s now a matter of political will. At Cop29, countries will try to forge a new global framework for providing the funds that developing nations need to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of worsening extreme weather. Poor countries want climate finance to ramp up from about $100bn a year today to at least $1tn every year by 2035. At the Cop29 venue itself, the ground quite literally feels unsteady, with the carpeted platform floors sinking slightly underfoot with each step, writes Dharna Noor, the Guardian US\u2019s fossil fuels and climate reporter. The conference is taking place in an enormous, labyrinth-like temporary structure constructed at Baku Olympic Stadium \u2013 a misleading name for a venue that has never hosted an Olympic event. Though it is chilly outside in Baku, it is uncomfortably warm inside the venue\u2019s blinding fluorescent lights. Unlike in some editions of the summit, food at Cop29 is abundant, with coffee, Domino\u2019s Pizza, and Turkish sesame-topped bagels known as simit served from stands made of unfinished composite wood. Despite its unsettling appearance, the venue is \u201cone of the best I\u2019ve seen at Cop,\u201d said Collin Rees, a program manager at the nonprofit Oil Change International, who has attended 10 previous Cop meetings. \u201cThere\u2019s actually food available, it\u2019s well-laid out, and there\u2019s actually enough space to work,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is not always the case.\u201d Sultan Al Jaber, the president of Cop28, has some warm words for his own achievements as he hands over to Cop29 president Mukhtar Babayev, writes Damian Carrington, environment editor. \u201cBy delivering the historic, comprehensive, balanced and groundbreaking UAE Consensus, we accomplished what many thought was impossible,\u201d said Al Jaber, who is also CEO of the United Arab Emirate\u2019s national oil company Adnoc. He\u2019s largely referring to the pledge to \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels, which was historic given the astonishing fact that none of the previous 27 climate summits mentioned fossil fuels, the overwhelming driver of the climate crisis. It was however a serious disappointment to the many nations who wanted a \u201cphase out\u201d of fossil fuels. Al Jaber also mentioned that the voluntary industry initiative, the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, now has companies representing 44% of global production committing to zero methane emissions by 2030. \u201cHistory will judge us by our actions, not by our words,\u201d he told delegates in Baku. The UAE\u2019s own national pledges are rated as \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d by Climate Action Tracker. Whether there is any sign that the \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels is being put into action may come with the release of the 2024Global Carbon Budgeton Wednesday. Do you find yourself in need of an easily digestible briefing on Cop29? Damian Carrington, environment editor, has spoken to the Guardian\u2019s Today In Focus podcast team about the main objective of this year\u2019s climate summit: getting richer nations to agree to inject climate finance into developing countries. \u201cEveryone\u2019s focus is on $1tn [\u00a3774bn],\u201d Damian tells podcast presenter Helen Pidd. \u201cWhich sounds like a crazy big number. Personally, actually, I think it\u2019s a bargain.\u201d Click below to listen to the full podcast. UN climate chief Simon Stiell gave a moving speech at the Cop29 opening plenary on Monday, writes Dharna Noor, fossil fuels and climate reporter for Guardian US, who is reporting from Baku. \u201cIn tough times, up against difficult tasks, I don\u2019t go in for hopes and dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat inspires me is human ingenuity and determination. Our ability to get knocked down and to get up again over and over again, until we accomplish our goals.\u201d Stiell hails from the Grenada island of Carriacou, which was pummelled by Hurricane Beryl in July. He showed a photograph of himself standing with an elderly neighbour, Florence, whose home was flattened by the storm. \u201cAt 85, Florence has become one of the millions of victims of runaway climate change this year alone,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people like Florence in every country on Earth. Knocked down, and getting back up again.\u201d UN negotiations can feel \u201cfar away\u201d from the environmental disasters harming people like Florence, said Stiell. Yet the climate crisis \u201cis affecting every single individual in the world in one way or another,\u201d pushing up energy bills, furthering global instability, and taking lives, he said. Among the top priorities at Cop29, he noted, will be setting a new global finance goal, finalising the rules for carbon markets, and making commitments to mitigate planet-warning pollution. \u201cNow is the time to show that global cooperation is not down for the count. It\u2019s rising to this moment,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let\u2019s rise here together.\u201d Greta Thunberg, the climate activist, has called a protest tonight in Tbilisi, Georgia, where she has been for some time. It is the closest that the Swede is able to get to Baku, since Azerbaijan has closed its land borders, posing an insurmountable barrier to those who wish to attend the climate talks but do not wish to fly there, due to the carbon impact of aviation. In any case, Thunberg \u2013 in common with many climate activists \u2013 has said she would not attend the conference in Baku, due to the repressive political climate. The protest in Tbilisi will take place at 7pm, in Liberty Square, she wrote on Instagram. She added: Join us as we rally against the wave of authoritarianism and exploitation sweeping through the Caucasus. Azerbaijan, using COP29 as a fa\u00e7ade, is ramping up control under a false \u201cgreen\u201d agenda, tightening its grip on power, and escalating regional tensions. For over 20 years, Azerbaijan\u2019s regime led by Aliyev have kept people oppressed, fostering poverty, fear, and silence. This authoritarian trend isn\u2019t isolated\u2013across the region, people like Ivanishvili, Putin, Erdogan, theocratic regime in Iran are deepening control, stifling dissent, oppressing their own people and using war and ethnic cleansing against Armenians, Ukrainians, Kurds and other ethnic minorities to justify brutal policies. Those who speak out\u2013journalists, activists, scholars\u2013are often met with imprisonment and violence. Under this system, climate action is reduced to corporate profit schemes, leaving people\u2019s needs ignored and communities devastated. The collective West\u2019s role in this authoritarian drift is undeniable, as it continues to legitimise and finance oppressive regimes for the sake of energy and profit. By turning a blind eye to oppression in exchange for resources, Western powers are complicit in the repression and suffering faced by the people of the Caucasus. The Caucasus Feminist Anti-War movement demand a future free from the chokehold of authoritarianism, war, and capitalist greed. We stand for real freedom, equality, justice, and a region where people, not profits, come first. Like most international diplomatic jamborees, Cops take place in fairly lavish surroundings, and Cop29 is no different. Here are a few views of the sights delegates and visitors are enjoying in the Baku conference centre. The opening ceremony of Cop29 has begun. Mukhtar Babayev, the summit president-elect, has called it a \u201cmoment of truth for the Paris agreement\u201d. Here are the first of his remarks, filed by Reuters: Colleagues, we are on a road to ruin. But these are not future problems. Climate change is already here. Whether you see them or not, people are suffering in the shadows. They are dying in the dark and they need more than compassion, more than prayers and paperwork. They are crying out for leadership and action. Cop29 is the unmissable moment to chart a new path forward for everyone. We need much more from all of you. Cop29 is a moment of truth for the Paris Agreement. It will test our commitment to the multilateral climate system. We must now demonstrate that we are prepared to meet the goals we have set ourselves. Finance is at the top of the agenda here at Cop29 but the maths is brutal, with a chasm between what is being supplied and what is needed. That is particularly true for the funding needed by vulnerable communities to build protection against climate impacts, such as flood defences, so-called adaptation. The world\u2019s developing nations need about $1bn a day just to cope with the extreme weather impacts of today, with only 1.3C of global heating, according to a UN Environment Programme (Unep) report published on Thursday. What they are actually receiving is less than a tenth of that, about $75m a day. What\u2019s worse is that while adaptation funding is increasing \u2013 from $22bn in 2021 to $28bn in 2022 \u2013 the deadly impacts of the climate crisis are increasing far faster, said Henry Neufeldt, lead author of the Unep report. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres put it in typically stark terms: \u201cClimate calamity is the new reality and we\u2019re not keeping up. The climate crisis is here. We can\u2019t postpone protection. We must adapt \u2013 now.\u201d He noted that while adaptation funding is falling far short of what is required, \u201cthe purveyors of all this destruction \u2013 particularly the fossil fuel industry \u2013 reap massive profits and subsidies\u201d. At Cop26 in 2021, the Glasgow Climate Pact set a goal of doubling adaptation finance to at least $38bn by 2025. That may be achieved, but will remain far below the $230bn \u2013 $415bn range estimated by the UN as necessary. \u201cThe gap is extremely large \u2013 we need a step change,\u201d said Paul Watkiss, another author of the Unep report. There are three strands of climate finance: money for cutting emissions, also called mitigation, money for adaptation, and money for disaster recovery, also called loss and damage. Watkiss said all are interrelated: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mitigate and you don\u2019t adapt, you get really high loss and damage. So we\u2019re starting to see these very large scale events [like the recent floods in Spain] coming through. The tragedy is terrible, but hopefully it starts to provide an impetus to say, if you don\u2019t adapt, that will lead to much higher costs overall. It\u2019s much more efficient and effective to finance adaptation than it is to do nothing.\u201d The negotiators at Cop29 have been told what is at stake. Now the hard work of delivering a meaningful finance deal begins. As well as hard coverage of the talks, throughout the day our correspondents will be filing lines on some of the experiences that offer some sense of the vibe in Baku. Here is the first, from Damian Carrington: Azerbaijan Airlines had been given the Cop29 script, with passengers from London to Baku warmly greeted and promised as \u201cinspirational meeting of minds\u201d. We\u2019ll see. The Cop29 branding is an appealing shade of teal and has some intriguing logos. One shows a factory with a chimney emitting a leaf, while another has a plant which is flowering an electric plug. The industry that underpins the entire Aezrbaijan economy \u2013 oil and gas \u2013 is understandably absent. Every great arena of international diplomacy comes complete with its own dictionary of jargon, and Cop \u2013 being about a particularly complicated and somewhat scientific problem \u2013 are in no way an exception. Thankfully, the Reuters news agency has provided a glossary of terms. Here are some you will see peppered throughout our coverage in the coming fortnight. UNFCCC: This acronym stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is the name of both the 1992 treaty committing nearly 200 countries to fighting global warming and the secretariat set up to implement that treaty. COP: This acronym stands for Conference of Parties, and describes the annual summit of countries that have signed the UNFCCC treaty. This year\u2019s COP29 meeting in Baku marks the 29th such gathering since the UNFCCC took effect in 1994. NCQG: This relatively new acronym will be focal at COP29. It stands for the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, an annual target for funding developing country climate efforts. NDC: Most often, these NDCs or Nationally Determined Contributions are referred to simply as \u201ccountry pledges\u201d and describe national action plans for reducing its emissions and adapting to climate impacts. The next round of NDCs are due in February, though some countries plan to submit new plans in Baku. GLOBAL WARMING: The term describes the gradual increase in the global average temperature. CLIMATE CHANGE: While this term is often used interchangeably with \u201cglobal warming,\u201d it means something different. Climate change describes global warming as well as its consequences, such as extreme weather events. (At the Guardian, we will often use the terms CLIMATE BREAKDOWN or CLIMATE CRISIS to better convey the gravity of the situation.) GREENHOUSE GASES: These gases, sometimes referred to simply as GHGs, are able to trap solar heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming. The most powerful GHGs are methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are also referred to as \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d because both molecules contain carbon. The world\u2019s excess carbon emissions come mostly from the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial activities. PARIS AGREEMENT: Under this 2015 treaty from the COP21 talks in Paris, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) above the pre-industrial average, with a goal of holding it to 1.5C (2.7F). The Paris pact also calls for national emissions-cutting pledges to be updated every five years NET ZERO: This term does not mean releasing zero emissions, but rather releasing no more than the amount being recaptured by CO2 abatement technologies, tree planting, or other means. Reaching \u201cnet zero\u201d would mean atmospheric GHG concentrations stop increasing. LOSS AND DAMAGE: Governments last year pledged $800 million toward a new \u2018loss and damage\u2019 fund to help poorer nations being hit by climate-fueled disasters. The fund, which now has a director and a host nation, will now be deciding how the funds should be dispersed and calling for more contributions at COP29. CARBON OFFSET: Also known as a \u201ccarbon credit,\u201d these instruments allow a country or company to compensate for some of their carbon emissions by investing in projects to bring emissions down elsewhere. ARTICLE 6: This term refers to a provision in the Paris Agreement on carbon offsets, and is used as shorthand for UNFCCC efforts to regulate international trading in carbon credits. Governments are hoping to resolve rules for trading carbon offsets at COP29 to allow for these markets to become operational. Here are some pictures of how things are looking in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, which has been set up in full summit mode. WHAT IS COP29 IN AZERBAIJAN AND DOES IT MATTER? The 29th United Nations climate conference has begun, with diplomats descending on Baku, Azerbaijan, to thrash out arguments over planet-heating pollutants and the money needed to deal with them. Like the 28 \u201cconferences of the parties\u201d that came before, Cop29 is not expected to stop the climate from changing - but delegates say that\u2019s no reason to dismiss it as hot air. Cops are the key diplomatic arenas in which poor countries that have done little to heat the planet can put pressure on rich countries that hooked the world on fossil fuels. In turn, rich countries with the resources to transition quickly can encourage poor countries to clean up faster and sooner. WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME OF COP29? This year\u2019s meeting will revolve around efforts to stump up the funds needed to cut pollution and adapt to more violent weather. Rich countries missed a goal to get poor countries $100 billion a year in climate finance from 2020, a target set in a previous Cop that experts deemed weak and patchy. Poor countries are now pushing for $1tr a year by 2030 - including cash to fix the destruction caused by extreme weather - but rich countries are reluctant to go higher unless the pool of contributors grows larger. If diplomats reach a good deal on money this month, it could build trust and spark greater ambition when countries submit sorely-needed action plans to cut pollution at Cop30 in Brazil next year. WILL COP29 SUCCEED? More than 32,000 participants have registered for the conference but observers are not expecting them to deliver transformational change. Several prominent world leaders are skipping the summit and sending deputies instead - including the EU\u2019s Ursula von der Leyen, the US\u2019s Joe Biden, China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz. The US just elected Donald Trump as president, who took the country out of the Paris climate agreement when he last sat in the White House. Papua New Guinea has pulled its ministers out of this year\u2019s Cop altogether in protest at the failure of rich countries to live up to their promises. And beneath the high-level geopolitics, observers have also questioned whether the host is up to the task of shepherding overworked diplomats to find common ground. Azerbaijan, a middle-income country in central Asia that is rich in oil but poor in water, is well-poised to bridge the divide between the different interest groups. But a secret recording last week appeared to show the Cop29 CEO agreeing to facilitate fossil fuel deals. The hope is that the conference can really bring countries together, and continue to push progress on reducing the world\u2019s CO2 emissions. Good morning, this is Damien Gayle, your online guide to Cop29 \u2026 The 29th Conference of the Parties is beginning in Baku, Azerbaijan, this morning and, as we do every year, the Guardian environment desk will be blogging every cough and spit by the thousands of delegates, campaigners, lobbyists and others who have travelled to visit the climate talks. Our team of reporters has already travelled to Baku, and I will be anchoring coverage from London, weaving together their contributions while scanning social media and wires news feeds to achieve as close to total coverage as is possible for one man and a blog. If you have any comments or suggestions on things we could be covering, or news to share, please don\u2019t hesitate to drop me a line via email. My address is damien.gayle@theguardian.com.",

      "body": "<p>Diego Mart\u00ednez and his players made a pact not to look at the table but this time, as they headed along the cramped passageway, down the stairs, out the little red door and on to the big yellow bus, carrying Telepizzas and turning on phones, they could be forgiven for taking a sneaky peek. They had just beaten Rayo Vallecano 3-1 and, for the first time since August, were not in the relegation zone. It was three minutes after midnight on Friday when they pulled out of Fofo the Clown Street and turned left towards the hotel, another long flight home awaiting the following morning. They were probably still wondering how it had happened, how any of it had, but UD Las Palmas travelled in hope again.</p> \n<p>When the bus departed, one player wasn\u2019t on board. Manu Fuster\u2019s mother has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/spain-valencia-floods-la-liga\">feeding flood victims at her restaurant</a> in Quart de Poblet; now his brother was waiting for him in the car outside, ready to take him home. With a lovely flick of his right foot, he had scored the third, having only been on the pitch two minutes. \u201cIt was very special for everything that\u2019s happened, because it\u2019s my first in <em>primera</em>, because it helped us win,\u201d he said before setting off straight for Valencia. \u201cIf you\u2019d said we\u2019d be in this position this a month back, we\u2019d have put our heads in our hands. No one bet a <em>duro</em>, five pesetas, on us but things have changed completely.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/11/auxerre-ligue-1-bolton-sam-allardyce-marseille-roberto-de-zerbi\">Auxerre take a leaf out of Allardyce\u2019s playbook to turn up heat on De Zerbi</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A month ago to the night, Las Palmas had sacked coach Luis Carri\u00f3n; the next day, they replaced him with Mart\u00ednez. They were bottom, the only team without a win in nine weeks, and had only three points, even if one of those <em>was</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/30/oli-mcburnie-scott-mckenna-kylian-mbappe-real-madrid-las-palmas-football\">against Real Madrid</a>. It was worse than that too, the collapse running way back into last season. On 10 February, Las Palmas had beaten Valencia 2-0. With two thirds of the 2023-24 season gone, and only two La Liga teams having more of the ball than them, the recently-promoted side were just three points off a European place and playing some of the best football in Spain. They didn\u2019t win again.</p> \n<p>Safe so early they almost ended up not being safe at all, sleepwalking their way towards <em>segunda</em> and finally clinching survival with a 0-0 draw at C\u00e1diz on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/20/cadiz-relegation-la-liga-spain-football\">the penultimate weekend</a>, Las Palmas went 14 games without a win under Xavi Garc\u00eda Pimienta. And then they went another nine this season, slipping to the bottom under Carrion. So Mart\u00ednez took over and 23 matches, eight months and no wins turned into four matches and three wins in one month. Plus another in the Copa del Rey, 7-0 against Onti\u00f1ena. A goal down inside 14 minutes, they beat Valencia at Mestalla \u2013 a \u201cliberation\u201d, the new coach called it \u2013 defeated Girona, lost away at Atl\u00e9tico, and now won at Rayo, the relegation zone left behind at last.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found the switch, you see it in these games we have won,\u201d goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen said. \u201cNo one thought we were alive; everyone gave us up for dead,\u201d Fuster added. \u201cDiego gathered us into a circle and told us the energy in here was going to do it for us, because we had the ability.\u201d In the four games since Mart\u00ednez has been in charge, <em>no one</em> in La Liga has more points. The coach, wrote La Provincia, is \u201cthe <em>puto amo</em>\u201d, \u201cUD\u2019s Napoleon,\u201d the man who \u201cchanged the model and their fate\u201d, the team going \u201cfrom a <em>flan</em> to a hammer \u2026 leaving behind its ghosts and its agony, now able to fight for survival that no longer looks like a utopia.\u201d</p> \n<p>Las Palmas had needed this. Mart\u00ednez had not immediately been sure that he did, but the club insisted, listened, took their time. They finally announced his arrival at the start of the October international break which allowed him to build, and it has been good for him too.</p> \n<p>When he was little, growing up in Vigo, Mart\u00ednez\u2019s aunt ran a press kiosk. He spent hours there surrounded by football stickers, all those Don Balon magazines to himself. He was obsessive \u2013 quizzes with his staff fill travel hours \u2013 and drawn to the details. He became a ballboy at Celta, who he joined at nine. Although he never made it beyond the third division as a player and claims he was never likely to either, lacking the ability to go with the analytical mind, he went to study sports science at Granada University. Mart\u00ednez got his first coaching job in <em>tercera</em> at 25 and, signed by Monchi, who had seen something in him, joined Sevilla, where he worked as C-team, B-team and youth-team coach as well as assistant to Unai Emery, before setting off alone.</p> \n<p>Charismatic and energetic, demanding, every detail mattering, fond of taking lessons from other sports and lines from other sportspeople, Mart\u00ednez was a revelation at Granada. Arriving aged 37, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/28/big-winners-this-seasons-first-clasico-weekend-granada-la-liga\">he took them up to the first division</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37585462/how-tiny-spanish-club-went-promotion-europa-league-just-one-season\">and straight into Europe</a>. They went all the way to the quarter-finals where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/apr/07/roberto-soldado-granada-manchester-united-europa-league\">they met Manchester United</a> and he was going all the way to the top, it seemed. <em>The</em> coach of a new generation, a legacy was left at <em>Los Carmenes</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/la-liga-granada-roberto-moreno-diego-martinez\">that others simply could not follow</a>, the club relegated twice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/article/2024/may/13/granada-lose-hope-fans-la-liga-place-footballing-death-real-madrid\">in two first-division seasons since his depature</a>. It was a given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/article/2024/may/13/granada-lose-hope-fans-la-liga-place-footballing-death-real-madrid\">that he would be at Sevilla soon</a> \u2013 a rumour he thought harmed him \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/29/diego-martinez-i-saw-english-football-and-i-had-to-experience-it\">but instead he took a sabbatical in England</a>, itself an indication of his ambition. And yet when he returned it was for just under a year at Espanyol, which felt a little underwhelming. Then there was a short spell at Olympiacos. When he arrived at Las Palmas, he hadn\u2019t coached for a year; the team he was taking on were the worst in Spain, closing in on the worst run ever.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoaches are not Nadal or Federer\u201d, he said, they have \u201cno magic wand\u201d and if he was here, he said, that was because \u201cthings are not good.\u201d \u201cEveryone sees us as candidates for relegation,\u201d he admitted. Candidates? Most saw them as a certainty, the situation desperate. There was, though, something there: a challenge, identifiable changes that could be made. Small ones, perhaps, but a lot of them. Above all, he was convinced there was the most important ingredient: talent. The rest could be taught, demanded. Under Garc\u00eda Pimienta and Carrion, they had begun a spiral downwards, falling apart at the smallest thing.</p> \n<p>\u201cPlayers are not washing machines that you can plug in anywhere and they work just the same,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cThere are moments. We need work, optimism and an ability to manage frustration because it\u2019s going to be a hard path, but from the worst moments you can take lovely ones.\u201d And so they began, one day and one detail at a time. On an island where life is good, sometimes too good, that\u2019s not always easy; with a team built to have the ball, to <em>play</em>, it\u2019s not so easy either. But here they are: more direct, more defensive, more resilient, more competitive, concentrated. After Friday\u2019s win, there was something telling in how the coach insisted: \u201cThe players and all the staff deserve this. I know what I am talking about because I see them work every day at Barranco Seco; the people who are there will understand me.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe sessions are long, different, there\u2019s another methodology,\u201d defender \u00c1lex Mu\u00f1oz explained. \u201cWe\u2019re adding tactical concepts that maybe we weren\u2019t looking after before. That\u2019s what we need right now: those demands, that intensity.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"db9e7ea7-c88a-4ec9-ab63-c35a81af8122\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Rayo Vallecano 1-3 Las Palmas, Real Madrid 4-0 Osasuna, Villarreal 3-0 Alav\u00e9s, Leganes 1-0 Sevilla, Real Betis 2-2 Celta Vigo, Mallorca 0-1 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Getafe 0-1 Girona, Valladolid 1-1 Athletic Club, Real Sociedad 1-0 Barcelona</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Wins too, and a little luck. \u201cBig doses of luck,\u201d as one local paper admitted: flowers, as they put it in Spain, and the flowers were welcome too. \u201cSport is capricious, sometimes you need an emotional spike to change everything, a click, three points which make the team feel strong and, suddenly, everything changes,\u201d Mart\u00ednez had said when he took over. Against Valencia, Las Palmas got it. Then came Girona. And now Rayo. They had been different games \u2013 \u201cif you go up the Sierra Nevada, you don\u2019t go in swimming trunks, you go in ski gear; if you go to Las Canteras [beach], you do\u201d Mart\u00ednez said afterwards. It wasn\u2019t always easy to explain; this win certainly wasn\u2019t, Rayo midfielder Gerard Gumbau shrugging and saying \u201cthat\u2019s football.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gumbau\u2019s team had taken 34 shots and only scored one \u2013 and that was a last-minute Scott McKenna own goal with the game already lost. Las Palmas had three on target, and won 3-1. One came from a corner \u2013 for the first time since April. The end result though, was the same, nine points from 12 lifting Las Palmas from the relegation zone, changing everything. Besides, Mart\u00ednez insisted: \u201cthe harder we work, the luckier we get.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cNine points from 12 with three away games is very positive,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cI\u2019d love there to be a simple explanation but it\u2019s not one thing you say to them; it\u2019s their ability to believe. It\u2019s all those one percents, the little things. We listened a lot, we were honest with them, we believed in them. We\u2019re a team with ability that maybe now makes the most of other facets, that believes there are other ways of scoring goals and isn\u2019t self-destructive when it goes against us. We have improved physically and tactically. There were things we did not do well; we\u2019re better balanced now. The effort they have made is titanic; we have pushed them to the limit this month. There is still a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot to do but I\u2019m proud of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The feeling is mutual. Outside, the bus was waiting, so too a car. \u201cDiego was the first madman to believe in us,\u201d Fuster said as Las Palmas\u2019s players left Vallecas with another victory, the table they weren\u2019t supposed to look at telling a tale of revival, a little hope let in at last.</p> \n<p><em>Comments on this piece will open later</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

      "bodyText": "Diego Mart\u00ednez and his players made a pact not to look at the table but this time, as they headed along the cramped passageway, down the stairs, out the little red door and on to the big yellow bus, carrying Telepizzas and turning on phones, they could be forgiven for taking a sneaky peek. They had just beaten Rayo Vallecano 3-1 and, for the first time since August, were not in the relegation zone. It was three minutes after midnight on Friday when they pulled out of Fofo the Clown Street and turned left towards the hotel, another long flight home awaiting the following morning. They were probably still wondering how it had happened, how any of it had, but UD Las Palmas travelled in hope again. When the bus departed, one player wasn\u2019t on board. Manu Fuster\u2019s mother has been feeding flood victims at her restaurant in Quart de Poblet; now his brother was waiting for him in the car outside, ready to take him home. With a lovely flick of his right foot, he had scored the third, having only been on the pitch two minutes. \u201cIt was very special for everything that\u2019s happened, because it\u2019s my first in primera, because it helped us win,\u201d he said before setting off straight for Valencia. \u201cIf you\u2019d said we\u2019d be in this position this a month back, we\u2019d have put our heads in our hands. No one bet a duro, five pesetas, on us but things have changed completely.\u201d A month ago to the night, Las Palmas had sacked coach Luis Carri\u00f3n; the next day, they replaced him with Mart\u00ednez. They were bottom, the only team without a win in nine weeks, and had only three points, even if one of those was against Real Madrid. It was worse than that too, the collapse running way back into last season. On 10 February, Las Palmas had beaten Valencia 2-0. With two thirds of the 2023-24 season gone, and only two La Liga teams having more of the ball than them, the recently-promoted side were just three points off a European place and playing some of the best football in Spain. They didn\u2019t win again. Safe so early they almost ended up not being safe at all, sleepwalking their way towards segunda and finally clinching survival with a 0-0 draw at C\u00e1diz on the penultimate weekend, Las Palmas went 14 games without a win under Xavi Garc\u00eda Pimienta. And then they went another nine this season, slipping to the bottom under Carrion. So Mart\u00ednez took over and 23 matches, eight months and no wins turned into four matches and three wins in one month. Plus another in the Copa del Rey, 7-0 against Onti\u00f1ena. A goal down inside 14 minutes, they beat Valencia at Mestalla \u2013 a \u201cliberation\u201d, the new coach called it \u2013 defeated Girona, lost away at Atl\u00e9tico, and now won at Rayo, the relegation zone left behind at last. \u201cWe\u2019ve found the switch, you see it in these games we have won,\u201d goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen said. \u201cNo one thought we were alive; everyone gave us up for dead,\u201d Fuster added. \u201cDiego gathered us into a circle and told us the energy in here was going to do it for us, because we had the ability.\u201d In the four games since Mart\u00ednez has been in charge, no one in La Liga has more points. The coach, wrote La Provincia, is \u201cthe puto amo\u201d, \u201cUD\u2019s Napoleon,\u201d the man who \u201cchanged the model and their fate\u201d, the team going \u201cfrom a flan to a hammer \u2026 leaving behind its ghosts and its agony, now able to fight for survival that no longer looks like a utopia.\u201d Las Palmas had needed this. Mart\u00ednez had not immediately been sure that he did, but the club insisted, listened, took their time. They finally announced his arrival at the start of the October international break which allowed him to build, and it has been good for him too. When he was little, growing up in Vigo, Mart\u00ednez\u2019s aunt ran a press kiosk. He spent hours there surrounded by football stickers, all those Don Balon magazines to himself. He was obsessive \u2013 quizzes with his staff fill travel hours \u2013 and drawn to the details. He became a ballboy at Celta, who he joined at nine. Although he never made it beyond the third division as a player and claims he was never likely to either, lacking the ability to go with the analytical mind, he went to study sports science at Granada University. Mart\u00ednez got his first coaching job in tercera at 25 and, signed by Monchi, who had seen something in him, joined Sevilla, where he worked as C-team, B-team and youth-team coach as well as assistant to Unai Emery, before setting off alone. Charismatic and energetic, demanding, every detail mattering, fond of taking lessons from other sports and lines from other sportspeople, Mart\u00ednez was a revelation at Granada. Arriving aged 37, he took them up to the first division and straight into Europe. They went all the way to the quarter-finals where they met Manchester United and he was going all the way to the top, it seemed. The coach of a new generation, a legacy was left at Los Carmenes that others simply could not follow, the club relegated twice in two first-division seasons since his depature. It was a given that he would be at Sevilla soon \u2013 a rumour he thought harmed him \u2013 but instead he took a sabbatical in England, itself an indication of his ambition. And yet when he returned it was for just under a year at Espanyol, which felt a little underwhelming. Then there was a short spell at Olympiacos. When he arrived at Las Palmas, he hadn\u2019t coached for a year; the team he was taking on were the worst in Spain, closing in on the worst run ever. \u201cCoaches are not Nadal or Federer\u201d, he said, they have \u201cno magic wand\u201d and if he was here, he said, that was because \u201cthings are not good.\u201d \u201cEveryone sees us as candidates for relegation,\u201d he admitted. Candidates? Most saw them as a certainty, the situation desperate. There was, though, something there: a challenge, identifiable changes that could be made. Small ones, perhaps, but a lot of them. Above all, he was convinced there was the most important ingredient: talent. The rest could be taught, demanded. Under Garc\u00eda Pimienta and Carrion, they had begun a spiral downwards, falling apart at the smallest thing. \u201cPlayers are not washing machines that you can plug in anywhere and they work just the same,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cThere are moments. We need work, optimism and an ability to manage frustration because it\u2019s going to be a hard path, but from the worst moments you can take lovely ones.\u201d And so they began, one day and one detail at a time. On an island where life is good, sometimes too good, that\u2019s not always easy; with a team built to have the ball, to play, it\u2019s not so easy either. But here they are: more direct, more defensive, more resilient, more competitive, concentrated. After Friday\u2019s win, there was something telling in how the coach insisted: \u201cThe players and all the staff deserve this. I know what I am talking about because I see them work every day at Barranco Seco; the people who are there will understand me.\u201d \u201cThe sessions are long, different, there\u2019s another methodology,\u201d defender \u00c1lex Mu\u00f1oz explained. \u201cWe\u2019re adding tactical concepts that maybe we weren\u2019t looking after before. That\u2019s what we need right now: those demands, that intensity.\u201d Wins too, and a little luck. \u201cBig doses of luck,\u201d as one local paper admitted: flowers, as they put it in Spain, and the flowers were welcome too. \u201cSport is capricious, sometimes you need an emotional spike to change everything, a click, three points which make the team feel strong and, suddenly, everything changes,\u201d Mart\u00ednez had said when he took over. Against Valencia, Las Palmas got it. Then came Girona. And now Rayo. They had been different games \u2013 \u201cif you go up the Sierra Nevada, you don\u2019t go in swimming trunks, you go in ski gear; if you go to Las Canteras [beach], you do\u201d Mart\u00ednez said afterwards. It wasn\u2019t always easy to explain; this win certainly wasn\u2019t, Rayo midfielder Gerard Gumbau shrugging and saying \u201cthat\u2019s football.\u201d Gumbau\u2019s team had taken 34 shots and only scored one \u2013 and that was a last-minute Scott McKenna own goal with the game already lost. Las Palmas had three on target, and won 3-1. One came from a corner \u2013 for the first time since April. The end result though, was the same, nine points from 12 lifting Las Palmas from the relegation zone, changing everything. Besides, Mart\u00ednez insisted: \u201cthe harder we work, the luckier we get.\u201d \u201cNine points from 12 with three away games is very positive,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cI\u2019d love there to be a simple explanation but it\u2019s not one thing you say to them; it\u2019s their ability to believe. It\u2019s all those one percents, the little things. We listened a lot, we were honest with them, we believed in them. We\u2019re a team with ability that maybe now makes the most of other facets, that believes there are other ways of scoring goals and isn\u2019t self-destructive when it goes against us. We have improved physically and tactically. There were things we did not do well; we\u2019re better balanced now. The effort they have made is titanic; we have pushed them to the limit this month. There is still a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot to do but I\u2019m proud of them.\u201d The feeling is mutual. Outside, the bus was waiting, so too a car. \u201cDiego was the first madman to believe in us,\u201d Fuster said as Las Palmas\u2019s players left Vallecas with another victory, the table they weren\u2019t supposed to look at telling a tale of revival, a little hope let in at last.

Last week\u2019s re-election of Trump to the White House, which will see him inaugurated for a second term in January, has cast a shadow on the UN talks after the Republican defeated Kamala Harris. Harris had been expected to continue the climate policies of Joe Biden, who passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest down payment on the green transition seen in US history. Experts say Trump\u2019s second term could be even more destructive, as he will be aided by an amenably conservative judiciary and armed with detailed policy blueprints such as the Project 2025 document published by the rightwing Heritage Foundation. Trump\u2019s incoming administration is already reportedly drawing up executive orders to erase climate policies and open up protected land for ramped-up oil and gas production. \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world,\u201d the president-elect said on Wednesday.

There is a cautious, risk-averse culture within the civil service, which is systemic and baked-in. This is a rational \u2013 and probably inevitable \u2013 response to the vast array of statutory and public law demands that regulate the process by which government makes decisions, and reflects the ever-present risk of government decisions being judicially reviewed, undermined and unwound by the courts. The natural reaction to that is to do lots of preparatory work to make sure that all the bases are covered to limit the risk of something going wrong further down the line. There is also an understandable focus on providing value for money when spending taxpayer money (which obviously involves trade-offs). This emphasis on caution slows down decision-making. It\u2019s not that civil servants are slow-going or lazy or don\u2019t care \u2013 the risk-averse culture is a natural reaction to the legal demands placed on government. They are required to spend a lot of time considering the various impacts, seeking and assessing various representations, taking into account and weighing all relevant information, making sure all possible alternative options have been thought about, making sure that the entire process is evidenced and so on. As I say, this has become a baked-in, systemic feature of the system. If we want our government to make decisions faster, we need to reduce some of the public law burden \u2013 and if we choose not to do so, we must accept that this has consequences for the speed and efficiency of government. Every time we create more public law to hold government to account, it is slower to deliver for people. This is a real issue across government, and needs to be confronted. So whilst it is easy to imagine that government could have clicked its fingers to get compensation out the door, that fails to recognise the systemic and cultural complexity of decision-making in government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><em>Q: Are you saying, if we want government to make decisions faster, we have to reduce the public law burden?</em></p> \n  <p><strong>Badenoch</strong> says she is saying that, every time you create law and demand accountability, you slow things down.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are you saying the rule of law stands in the way of the delivery of services by government?</em></p> \n  <p><strong>Badenoch</strong> says she is not saying that.

We already make interim payments of \u00a3163k to almost all postmasters whose convictions are overturned, and we undertake only limited scrutiny of GLO [Group Litigation Order] claims for certain heads of loss under \u00a310k and HSS ones under \u00a38k. We are only looking to extend these measures substantially in relation to the GLO, which has started to receive claims [...] Some of the options we are considering would actually save more on the costs of lawyers or other advisors than they would cost in extra compensation. Others do have additional costs \u2014 but in my view these would be well worthwhile in light of the non-financial benefits of accelerating the schemes. In particular, I would like us to be able to offer a \u00a3100k fixed payment to every claimant who applies to the GLO scheme. I recognise that announcing this would create significant pressure to offer the same for HSS [Horizon Shortfall Scheme] claimants, which we should consider separately, but I believe this is the right route forward for the GLO scheme.

Keir Starmer is in Paris this morning for talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The prime minister is visiting to attend the French Armistice Day service, but the real interest will lie in what the leaders of Europe\u2019s two biggest military powers have to say as they discuss the implications of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election.</p> \n  <p>Here is <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong>\u2019s overnight preview story.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/10/starmer-join-macron-armistice-day-paris-show-european-solidarity\">Starmer to join Macron on Armistice Day in Paris to show European solidarity</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p><strong>John Healey</strong>, the defence secretary, has been doing a media round this morning. Quite what Trump will do about Ukraine \u2013 in fact, about anything \u2013 remains uncertain, but in the US it is being reported that Trump has spoken to Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and urged him not to escalate the Russian offensive in Ukraine. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/trump-putin-ukraine-war\">her story</a> <strong>Maya Yang</strong> reports:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Vladimir Putin on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/10/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine/\">reported</a> on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p> \n   <p>The US president-elect advised the Russian president not to escalate the war in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> and reminded him of \u201cWashington\u2019s sizeable military presence in Europe\u201d, the Post reported.</p> \n   <p>It added that Trump expressed interest in follow-up conversations on \u201cthe resolution of Ukraine\u2019s war soon\u201d.</p> \n   <p>During the election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war \u201cwithin a day\u201d, but did not explain how he would do so.</p> \n   <p>According to one former US official who was familiar with the call and spoke to the Washington Post, Trump likely does not want to begin his second presidential term with an escalation in the Ukraine war, \u201cgiving him incentive to want to keep the war from worsening\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In an interview on the Today programme, <strong>Healey</strong> welcomed this report. Asked if Ukraine was losing the war, he replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Ukraine is certainly under pressure. Russia is certainly escalating, and President Trump has reportedly told Putin and warned him against further escalation. If he\u2019s done that, he\u2019s right to do so.</p> \n   <p>Russia is escalating with massing North Korean troops on their territory. It\u2019s escalating with more than 2,000 one-way attack kamikaze drones aimed at Kyiv and the rest of the Ukrainian cities in the last month alone. And one person is responsible for that escalation, and that\u2019s Putin.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I will post more from Healey\u2019s interviews shortly.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>Morning:</em> Keir Starmer is meeting Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in Paris.</p> \n  <p><em>10am:</em> Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, gives evidence to the Post Office Horizon inquiry.

      "bodyText": "Kemi Badenoch has told an inquiry it is \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d that it took the ITV drama about the Post Office scandal to get the government to accelerate compensation payments for wrongfully prosecuted branch owner-operators. Giving evidence to the Post Office Horizon inquiry in her capacity as a former business secretary, Badenoch, the new Conservative party leader, said that when she was in government she was frustrated by how slowly compensation payments were being paid. She tried to secure Treasury approval for a plan that would speed up some payments, but this was blocked by Jeremy Hunt, the then chancellor, because of the extra cost and concern that, by discarding normal safeguards, public money would be put at risk. (See 1.05pm.) The hearing was revealing for what it showed about Badenoch\u2019s approach to bureaucracy and civil service procedure. She argued that officials were too risk averse, and that there was \u201cfar too much going round and round in circles\u201d. (See 1.12pm.) She also said in politics it was being seen to do the right thing was as important as doing the right thing. (See 1.04pm.) Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has said that pay arrangements for NHS trust chief executives will be changed so they are linked to performance. There will be \u201cno more rewards for failure\u201d, he said. (See 5.24pm.) Keir Starmer has joined Emmanuel Macron in Paris for the French Armistice Day service, in a pointed show of European solidarity days after Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, with Ukraine and defence on the agenda for private talks between the two leaders. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has announced that pay arrangements for NHS trust chief executives will be changed so they are linked to performance. Commenting on the announcement, which is due to be confirmed in a speech later this week, Streeting said: I\u2019m prepared to pay for the best and I will defend financial incentives to attract and keep talented people in the NHS. It\u2019s a big organisation that should be competing with global businesses for the best talent. But there will be no more rewards for failure. We have got to get a grip on runaway spending and make sure every penny going to the NHS benefits patient \u2013 changes will not be popular but it\u2019s a case of reform or die. The change will affect VSMs (very senior managers), like trust chief executives. Explaining how pay will be linked to performance, the Department of Health and Social Care said in a news release: In his review of the NHS, Lord Ara Darzi found the only criteria by which chief executive pay was set is the turnover of the organisation. Neither the timeliness of access, quality of care or effective running of the organisation factored into pay. NHS integrated care systems had built up deficits totalling \u00a32bn in just the first four months of this financial year, leaving the incoming government with a financial blackhole which had to be dealt with at the budget. A new pay framework for VSMs will therefore be published before April 2025. This will clamp down on poor performance, while rewarding senior leaders who are successfully turning their services around. Hospital waiting lists would be lower if the government had given the health service permission to expand the number of hospital beds in the middle of the Covid pandemic, Amanda Pritchard, the NHS chief executive, has suggested. As PA Media reports, in July 2020 the NHS sought 10,000 \u201cnon-temporary\u201d hospital beds to deal with recovery from the first wave of the crisis and the future surges in case numbers. But the request was refused by the Treasury, headed at the time by Rishi Sunak, and by Downing Street, where Boris Johnson was PM. Giving evidence to the Covid inquiry Pritchard said that the decision was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and that the nation \u201ccould be in a different position\u201d when it comes to the backlog of pre-planned hospital care. According to the latest data from NHS England, an estimated 7.64 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of August, relating to 6.42 million patients. Questioning Pritchard, counsel to the inquiry Jacqueline Carey KC, said: In July of 2020, NHS England sought 10,000 non-temporary beds to deal with recovery and the potential future surges \u2026 the funding for those beds was not approved by Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury. And Pritchard replied: We had done some modelling work over that summer to looking at from a best estimate, what it would take to be able to run with a sort of constant number of patients in the service who were Covid positive, create the necessary headroom then to respond to normal winter pressures, but crucially also to have the space to do the, not just urgent, but also non-urgent, non-Covid work, so that we would be able to do that recovery work that we\u2019d begun to start in the summer. Carey said: I think the prime minister\u2019s private office was involved in the decision to refuse and said, effectively, they wanted more use to be made of Nightingales [emergency temporary hospitals], the independent sector, to go back to discharging patients if necessary, using flu vaccinations to hopefully deal with any flu upsurge there would be, and that there would be capacity looked at in the spending review \u2026 What were the consequences of that 10,000 bed requests being refused, from your perspective? And Pritchard replied: It was, as you say, very disappointing, because what it meant in practice is that where we could now be in, I think, a very different position on elective recovery. If we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients if we had had that additional headroom, as well as being more resilient going into the second wave and into winter more generally. So subsequent to the pandemic, there have been some steps taken to increase core bed capacity, but clearly we could have done with that capacity at the time, and I think we\u2019d be in a quite different position now. James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, has criticised the government for not saying when it will get defence spending up to 2.5% of GDP. In a Commons urgent question, Cartlidge said Labour has committed to outlining a pathway to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence, but said ministers have been \u201cunable\u201d to say whether they would deliver on the target in the current parliament. (See 10.15am.) He went on: 2.5% is not an end in itself, the key reason in April [why] we set out a fully funded, multi-year pathway to 2.5% was to enable the MoD to procure at pace and at scale the munitions we need to urgently replenish our stocks to war-fighting levels. With the whole world wanting to buy more munitions, we cannot afford to delay any further. Healey said the last government\u2019s proposal to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP was not a plan, but just a \u201cpolitical ploy\u201d. He said: It was announced four weeks before they then called the general election. It was unfunded, it was a con on the armed forces and on the British people who gave their answer emphatically by sweeping away Tory MPs in many of the proudest military communities and constituencies across the country. During the UQ Healey also repeated the point he made in his interviews this morning about how, if Donald Trump has urged Russia to avoid escalation in Ukraine, that is a positive development. (See 8.59am.) Healey said that was a \u201cvery good first step\u201d. The Kremlin has since claimed that the call between Trump and Vladimir Putin, as reported in the Washington Post, never took place. Michelle O\u2019Neill, the Sinn F\u00e9in first minister of Northern Ireland, has said it has been \u201cdifficult to hear\u201d fellow republicans criticise her participation in the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at Belfast City Hall. As PA Media reports, O\u2019Neill\u2019s comments came after a banner with the word \u201cTraitors\u201d on it was erected at her constituency office in Cookstown, Co Tyrone, at the weekend. O\u2019Neill broke new ground for her party by attending the event commemorating fallen members of the UK armed forces at the Cenotaph in Belfast, where she laid a laurel wreath. However, she has faced criticism from some people in the republican and nationalist community. As PA reports, more than 100 relatives of IRA members and civilians killed by the security forces and loyalists during the Troubles signed a public statement, published in the Irish News, expressing \u201cdevastation\u201d at her decision to attend. Asked about the statement from republicans criticising her, O\u2019Neill told a press conference this morning: Of course, it is difficult to hear that, particularly from people who I know all of my life, but I also absolutely accept that they\u2019re entitled to feel how they feel, particularly if they\u2019ve lost a loved one. So I accept and understand exactly where people are coming from. However, I can\u2019t be distracted from the role that I play. I want to drive our society forward. I want to build a shared future. I want to take as many people with us on that journey as we possibly can, but I\u2019ve committed to being a first minister for all, and I will live up to that at every turn. Asked if it was difficult to be called a traitor, O\u2019Neill said: Look, people are entitled to express their view, and I can accept where they\u2019re coming from, but I also have a role to play, and I\u2019m determined to keep driving us forward. And here is an extract from the statement signed by republicans. It is beyond belief that any so-called Tyrone republican would wish to lay a wreath in honour of these forces who caused mayhem and murder on hamlets, hills, villages, and towns - the killing grounds of Tyrone where the cries for truth and justice about collusion, state murder, and counterinsurgency haunt the entire county and hundreds of families. Have you all totally lost the run of yourselves or is it really power at any cost? Because when you get to the pinnacle of wherever it is you want to be you\u2019ll have compromised so much, you\u2019ll be no different from the staters and Blueshirts that executed republicans and hounded those who held dear to the words and sacrifices of Tone, Connolly, Pearse, Sands, and Hurson. Sir Wyn Williams, the inquiry chair, asks about a sentence in Badenoch\u2019s second witness statement. In the statement Badenoch says: The Post Office, on the other hand, is caught in this awkward halfway house, where it is given only enough to exist in a state of permanent starvation. Q: If the Post Office is going to continue to exist in a state like this, can it continue to exist at all? Badenoch says it can carry on like this, but she says that that would not be best for the Post Office. She says there are things going wrong on both sides. She says she does not think the Post Office spent money wisely on Horizon. That would jsutify the Treasury withholding money. But if the Post Office is always reliant on the Treasury, which also has to fund things like health and schools, it will always lose out, she says. Q: Is the Post Office worth saving? Yes, says Badenoch. The challenge is to work out how to fund it, she says. But she goes on: Should we have a Post Office? Yes, I think it is a cultural institution that\u2019s absolutely essential for us to keep and I support it wholeheartedly. And that\u2019s the end of her evidence. At the inquiry Kemi Badenoch is being questioned now by counsel representing some of the victims of the scandal. Asked who will fix the machinery of government, if it is broken as Badenoch claims it is, Badenoch says that she is in a \u201cminority\u201d in thinking this. She says she has been making this argument for a long time, but the government does not agree. The fact that she is leader of the opposition, not in government, suggests she is not winning the argument, she says. Beer asks Badenoch about this passage in her second witness statement. Second, there is an explanation for why things are slow in government. There is a cautious, risk-averse culture within the civil service, which is systemic and baked-in. This is a rational \u2013 and probably inevitable \u2013 response to the vast array of statutory and public law demands that regulate the process by which government makes decisions, and reflects the ever-present risk of government decisions being judicially reviewed, undermined and unwound by the courts. The natural reaction to that is to do lots of preparatory work to make sure that all the bases are covered to limit the risk of something going wrong further down the line. There is also an understandable focus on providing value for money when spending taxpayer money (which obviously involves trade-offs). This emphasis on caution slows down decision-making. It\u2019s not that civil servants are slow-going or lazy or don\u2019t care \u2013 the risk-averse culture is a natural reaction to the legal demands placed on government. They are required to spend a lot of time considering the various impacts, seeking and assessing various representations, taking into account and weighing all relevant information, making sure all possible alternative options have been thought about, making sure that the entire process is evidenced and so on. As I say, this has become a baked-in, systemic feature of the system. If we want our government to make decisions faster, we need to reduce some of the public law burden \u2013 and if we choose not to do so, we must accept that this has consequences for the speed and efficiency of government. Every time we create more public law to hold government to account, it is slower to deliver for people. This is a real issue across government, and needs to be confronted. So whilst it is easy to imagine that government could have clicked its fingers to get compensation out the door, that fails to recognise the systemic and cultural complexity of decision-making in government. Q: Are you saying, if we want government to make decisions faster, we have to reduce the public law burden? Badenoch says she is saying that, every time you create law and demand accountability, you slow things down. Q: Are you saying the rule of law stands in the way of the delivery of services by government? Badenoch says she is not saying that. She goes on: The burden of regulation is not the rule of law. You can the rule of law without an excessive burden of regulation, but if you keep adding more and more rules that will slow things down. It doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t want the rule of law, but the rule of law has a purpose, and that is to create a fair system which everybody has treated equally, and where everyone can receive justice. If you keep creating more regulations and people aren\u2019t getting justice, then something has gone wrong, and we should be able to look at that without assuming that this is a criticism of the entire system of the rule of law. It means that we should be able to look at how we can reform public law. The law is not above criticism. We should be able to say \u2018Actually, this isn\u2019t working, what can we do to improve it\u2019, rather than what is happening now where people say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the rule of law. We can\u2019t touch it. Let\u2019s not do anything.\u2019 Badenoch says reforming the Post Office would be a huge challenge. She says people do not want to work there because of the scrutiny they know they will face because it is a public organisation. The French government has now issued its readout of what Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron discussed when they met this morning in Paris. It is quite a bit longer than the UK version (see 1.28pm), but not necessarily more revealing. Here is Mark Sweney\u2019s story from Kemi Badenoch\u2019s evidence to the inquiry this morning. Q: Were you aware that Staunton was a strong supporter of the sub-postmaster executive directors when you decided to sack him? Badenoch said she did not know that when she took the decision. But he said that to her in their call, she says. Beer reads out the passage from Badenoch\u2019s first witness statement where she explains the factors that led to the decision to sack Henry Staunton. Badenoch said: On 24 January 2024, I received a written submission dated 23 January 2024 prepared by UKGI and Departmental officials, in which I was advised of specific concerns in relation to Mr Staunton\u2019s conduct and his suitability for office. The specific concerns identified in the submission were: (1) That he had repeatedly attempted to shut down a whistleblowing investigation into his conduct. (2) That he had engaged in aggressive, intimidating and disrespectful behaviour to other board members and members of the POL executive team. (3) That he showed continued poor understanding of the public sector aspect of POL\u2019s work and poor judgement. (4) That he had disregarded proper governance processes as POL\u2019s Chair, most recently by announcing the appointment of a new Senior Independent Director for POL without following formal consultation with the Board, following Board processes or seeking shareholder approval as required. (5) That he had failed to provide constructive support to POL\u2019s CEO. Asked why she sacked him, Badenoch refers to her earlier point about being seen to do the right thing. She says she did not want to give Staunton the chance to resign because she wanted a clear story about what happened. Beer shows Badenoch the submission she received recommending Staunton should be sacked. Badenoch says this is a good example of what she meant when she said earlier concerns were raised by officials in a \u201cvanilla\u201d form. (See 2.30pm.) She says officials had in the past raised concerns about Staunton with her. But they had not given her the full details. Badenoch says, in the civil service, officials often give ministers a \u201cvanilla version\u201d of complaints about people. She says she prefers the \u201cunvarnished\u201d version. Badenoch says, when she spoke to Henry Staunton, she had a more sympathetic view of him than she does now (in the light of the way he publicly attacked the way he was dismissed). Here is the full version of the transcript. Beer is now reading out extracts from the transcript. The full document is here, now on the Post Office inquiry\u2019s website. This is how it starts. Beer turns to the converation where Badenoch told Staunton he was being sacked, in January this year. He says Badenoch did not have a transcript of this when she did her witness statement. But the inquiry has now obtained a recording. Badenoch says she did not know the call was being recorded. She does not know how common it is for a call like this to be recorded. It was probably recorded so they could have an accurate transcript. The inquiry has resumed. Jason Beer KC asks Kemi Badenoch about Henry Staunton. (See 12.18pm.) Q: When you became business secretary, was anything said to you about problems with Staunton? No, says Badenoch. Q: When you became business secretary, there was a recommendation that you meet Staunton. But you did not. Why not? Badenoch says she does not know. She was travelling a lot at the time, because she was still doing international trade. She says maybe a meeting was organised but fell through. But Staunton did not ask for a meeting, she says. At 3.30pm there will be an urgent question in the Commons on defence spending, and the target of getting it up to 2.5% of GDP. After that, at about 4.15pm, Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, is making a statement about performance in the rail industry. Downing Street has released its readout of Keir Starmer\u2019s talks with Emmanuel Macron this morning. It says they discussed how to put Ukraine \u201cin the strongest possible position\u201d going into the winter. The prime minister thanked the president for the personal invitation, noting he was the first UK leader to attend in 80 years. The leaders started by discussing the situation in Ukraine, including how best to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position going into the winter. Turning to the Middle East, both underscored their deep concern at the situation in Gaza and Lebanon. They also reiterated the need for stability in the West Bank. Reflecting on the situation in the Channel, the prime minister set out his mission to disrupt and deter smuggling gangs across Europe, and the leaders strongly agreed on the importance of bearing down on illegal migration at every stage of a migrant\u2019s journey. Presumably, \u201cwinter\u201d in this context refers not just to the cold weather, but to the arrival of Donald Trump as US president. The hearing has now adjourned for lunch. Here is an extract from the letter Kemi Badenoch sent to Jeremy Hunt in August 2023 saying compensation payments to victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal should be accelerated. Kevin Hollinrake [the Post Office minister] and I are both determined that postmasters affected by the Post Office Horizon scandal should get proper compensation \u2014 and that they should get it as rapidly as possible [...] Kevin and l have therefore been looking at the ways in which we could radically speed up the processes. We already make interim payments of \u00a3163k to almost all postmasters whose convictions are overturned, and we undertake only limited scrutiny of GLO [Group Litigation Order] claims for certain heads of loss under \u00a310k and HSS ones under \u00a38k. We are only looking to extend these measures substantially in relation to the GLO, which has started to receive claims [...] Some of the options we are considering would actually save more on the costs of lawyers or other advisors than they would cost in extra compensation. Others do have additional costs \u2014 but in my view these would be well worthwhile in light of the non-financial benefits of accelerating the schemes. In particular, I would like us to be able to offer a \u00a3100k fixed payment to every claimant who applies to the GLO scheme. I recognise that announcing this would create significant pressure to offer the same for HSS [Horizon Shortfall Scheme] claimants, which we should consider separately, but I believe this is the right route forward for the GLO scheme. Such radical action would offer great advantages in terms of the speed of the process. This is from Badenoch\u2019s second witness statement. Beer is now asking about Badenoch\u2019s revelation in her witness statement that she was willing to issue a ministerial direction to go ahead with rapid compensation payments opposed by the Treasury. A ministerial direction is something required when a minister wants to order civil servants to do something that they do not believe can be justified on value for money grounds, or for some other reason. Badenoch said she saw this as a way of getting results. We need to change the way that we do things in government. There is far too much going round and round in circles and avoiding taking serious, real decisions because everybody is worried about getting into trouble later. This is something which I tend not to worry about. Maybe I should do but I do trust my judgment. In the end, Badenoch did not issue a ministerial direction. Beer shows the inquiry the reply Badenoch got from Hunt. Hunt turned down her request. Beer is now asking Badenoch about a letter she sent to Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, in August last year saying compensation payments should be speeded up. Badenoch wanted to be able to offer \u00a3100,000 to every person claiming through the GLO scheme. Badenoch said she wanted to speed things up. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not one of life\u2019s natural bureaucrats.\u201d Explaining what she was doing, she said: I had my own personal objective of making sure that we did right by the postmasters and we showed that we were delivering on the scheme as promised after the court case, and that we were just being seen to do the right thing. Being seen to do the right thing, in my view, is just as important as doing the right thing. When Beer put it to Badenoch that doing the right thing was more important than being seen to do the right thing, Badenoch claimed that was not the case in politics.She said: Both of them are important \u2013 doing the right thing when no one knows that you\u2019re doing it often creates different problems elsewhere. So, as a politician, it is not enough to do the right thing. It\u2019s also important to be seen to be doing the right thing. Asked to explain what she meant when she said bureaucracy was holding up Post Office compensation payments (see 12.48pm), Badenoch said: I am more interested in making sure that we get things done, rather than every single box is ticked. I feel that there is often too much bureaucracy in the way of getting things done, because people are worried about process. They are worried about if things go wrong, then being on the hook for that. And so they carry out lots of checks and balances, well beyond what I think is required in order to deliver the right outcome. I remember asking a question like, \u2018Why can\u2019t we just give them the money?\u2019 \u2026 And then I\u2019d be told, well, there could be judicial review, and the Treasury has these value for money requirements, and if we don\u2019t meet them, then we might end up having to go to court \u2026 I would be told that, there\u2019s still an inquiry going on, and if you make a decision like this without going through all the checks and balances, or without waiting for the inquiry to complete to conclude, then you might have a problem later. But I thought that it was better to err on the side of ensuring that people got their compensation quickly, rather than making sure that we didn\u2019t get into any trouble for not doing it in the perfect way. Beer is now asking about Badenoch\u2019s second witness statement (which is now on the inquiry\u2019s website, here). He quotes paragraph 39 where Badenoch says: Right from my first briefing, I was concerned with the pace at which the compensation was being delivered. Kevin Hollinrake also told me that we should be going faster, and he needed some help from his secretary of state to accelerate things. We had briefings on the issue with officials, and it was quite clear to me that we were allowing bureaucracy to get in the way of redress too much of the time. Kevin [Hollinrake, the Post Office minister] and I wanted to get the money out there, and we were always given a reason why we couldn\u2019t. For example, officials suggested we should wait until the end of inquiry so that we knew precisely what to do. I was adamant that we could not wait that long and that we had to get the money out. I was particularly concerned that postmasters would die waiting for compensation, and I remember saying in one meeting that I don\u2019t want any of that happening on my watch, and that we needed to get the redress out to people before it is too late. I wanted to know what we could do to get the payments out the door, and said we needed to do whatever we could to make it happen. Beer asks who was allowing bureaucracy to get in the way of redress. Badenoch says it was \u201cthe government machine\u201d. In the hearing Jason Beer KC is asking Kemi Badenoch about a diagram she was shown in a briefing on the Post Office she was given when she became business secretary. Badenoch says this does not tell the whole story. Beer is particularly interested in the line saying it is the job of the UK Goverment Investments (UKGI) representative on the Post Office board to \u201cchallenge\u201d Post Office decisions. Kemi Badenoch has submitted two witness statements to the inquiry. The first is here. In it, she very strongly defends the decision to sack Henry Staunton as Post Office chair. She says she received a recommendation saying he should go backed by Kevin Hollinrake, the Post Office minister, and her permanent secretary. She says the decision to sack him was leaked to the media on Saturday 27 January. This was before Staunton had been told, and she says she was \u201cvery angry\u201d about this. She says: On Saturday 27 January 2024, I was informed that the media had become aware of the decision to remove Mr Staunton. Pausing there, it is right to record that I was and am very angry at the fact that my decision leaked to the media. Leaks of this type debilitate government, and lead to inaccurate reporting making it more difficult to get the truth out. And clearly this was not the right way for Mr Staunton to learn of my decision; I wanted to spare him any public embarrassment. (As Mr Staunton described it in our subsequent call, the leak was \u201cappalling\u201d.) Upon being informed of the leak, I called Mr Staunton as soon as possible and he answered. We had a brief conversation. When the news of Staunton\u2019s sacking was leaked, Badenoch was scheduled to be interviewed on the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the following day. Badenoch says, when she became business secretary, she had no knowledge of what the problems were with Horizon beyond what a \u201clay MP\u201d would know. Q: So, the various legal developments, all the things you were briefed on when you became business secretary in February 2023, they were news to you? In terms of the detail, yes, says Badenoch. She says until then she had been focused on her other ministerial duties and her work as a constituency MP. Kemi Badenoch is giving evidence now. Jason Beer KC starts by asking Badenoch to confirm her witness statements are accurate, and to confirm details of her CV. Kemi Badenoch is now about to give evidence to the Post Office inquiry. She will be asked about decisions she took in her capacity as business secretary from February 2023 until the general election. This meant Badenoch was in post earlier this year when the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, ignited national anger over the scandal and turned it into a much bigger story than it had ever been before. By then some journalists had covering the story for more than a decade, and the facts were already well documented. But until then it had not been at the top of the political agenda, partly because key developments in the story coincided with big events during Brexit, the 2019 election and the Covid pandemic. Badenoch\u2019s most prominent intervention was to sack Henry Staunton, the Post Office chair earlier this year, soon after the ITV programme was aired. He claimed that she told him he had to go because \u201csomeone\u2019s got to take the rap for this [the Horizon scandal]\u201d and that her department wanted to delay compensation payments. But she said his claims were \u201ccompletely false\u201d and that he was sacked in relation to misconduct allegations. Staunton later said Badenoch was smearing him. Here are some more pictures from the Armistice Day events in Paris attended by Keir Starmer this morning. Sir Wyn Williams, the inquiry chair, ended the session with a question for Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary. He said he had evidence from some witnesses saying the Post Office \u201ccannot be rescued\u201d. Q: So why do you think it should be rescued. Reynolds said he thought the public \u201cstill want a Post Office\u201d. He went on: They still want the service it provides. When I go into the post offices in my local community, they\u2019re actually always pretty busy. As I say, the regret is that I don\u2019t think postmasters are earning appropriate remuneration from that level of business taking place. When it comes to new initiatives like banking hubs, I think the Post Office has been, and in every case actually has been, the natural partner picked to run that in a local community. So there was \u201cfundamentally\u201d a need for something like the Post Office, he said. He went on: I think the big public policy questions \u2013 like the future of cash in our society, and the closure of high street banking in many communities \u2013 the Post Office is part of the answer to those other wider public policy concerns. And I do foresee, potentially in future, services that aren\u2019t currently delivered by the Post Office, or the Post Office being a potential vehicle for delivering them. But I think the future is definitely one that has, to be frank, a significantly smaller centre, and is based much more around power, authority and governance being provided to postmasters on the frontline \u2013 really, a central organisation serving those people. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been the relationship leading into this scandal in particular. Reynolds said, when post office had to close, there was \u201cgenuine regret\u201d. So I feel both the public demand and the policy rationale is still there, and that underpins these conversations and work that we\u2019re doing on what the future might look like. Reynolds also told the inquiry that going ahead he would like to see \u201cvery significant\u201d changes to the Post Office\u2019s business model. He said: I think the scale of this scandal cannot be separated out from the business model and the governance structure of the Post Office. So we need, from the work that I lead as secretary of state and what this inquiry is seeking to do, to not just respond to the obvious injustice and the need for redress to follow that, but to understand why, as an institution, the Post Office has gone so wrong and what needs to change in future. For instance, I believe that is everything from the internal governance structure of the Post Office, right down to the level of remuneration that postmasters receive. I think despite the scale of this scandal, the Post Office is still an incredibly important institution in national life. I think it still has an incredible role to play in communities. I look at the business model of the Post Office, and I think even accounting for the changes in the core services that are provided \u2026 there\u2019s still a whole range of services that are really important. But I don\u2019t think postmasters make sufficient remuneration from what the public want from the Post Office, and I think that\u2019s going to require some very significant changes to the overall business model of the Post Office. This is what Reynolds told the Post Office inquiry when he was asked if he would agree with Sir Alan Bates\u2019 call for next March to be set as a deadline for the payment of compensation to post office operators due redress payments under the GLO (general litigation order) scheme. This scheme, for the 555 people who were part of the legal action led by Bates, is one of four Post Office redress schemes operating. Asked about the March deadline, Reynolds said: I\u2019ve thought about this a great deal and obviously anything put forward by Sir Alan in particular is something I\u2019ll consider to a significant degree. The position I\u2019m in is I\u2019m trying to make sure people get redress for a horrendous scandal \u2026 at a minimum, I don\u2019t want to do anything that makes that injustice even worse. And the worry about a deadline \u2013 can you imagine a situation where, for whatever reason, a claim has not come in? I think it will be unconscionable to say that that is not going to be considered. But Reynolds also said that, if he thought setting a March deadline was \u201cthe only way to speed [claims] up\u201d, it is something he would consider. Reynolds tells the inquiry that his \u201cpersonal aspiration\u201d is to publish a green paper on the future of the Post Office in the first half of next year. Julian Blake, counsel for the inquiry, has now finished his questions to Jonathan Reynolds. As he was winding up, he asked Reynolds what his plans were for the future of the Post Office. Reynolds said governance of the Post Office would have to change. But he said that first the organisation had to resolve issues like funding. He said it would need to pay for a replacement to the Horizon system. The Post Office needed to be \u201csustainable\u201d, he said. But, beyond that, he said, he did not think anything should be \u201coff the table\u201d. He said mutualisation was one idea that has been discussed. This would have \u201csome particular advantages in terms of dealing with the specific breakdown of trust between different parts of the organisation\u201d. David Connett wrote this option up for the Observer last month. Here are some of the main points from Jonathan Reynolds\u2019s evidence to the Post Office inquiry so far this morning. Reynolds said he accepted as business secretary he was responsible for ensuring the compensation scheme operated properly. He said in the past there had been \u201cinsufficient accountability\u201d. He said that since the general election there has been a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in the pace at which compensation is being paid. The journalist Nick Wallis (who wrote a superb book, The Great Post Office Scandal) is live tweeting from the inquiry, and he quotes Reynolds as saying: Since the general election there has been a significant increase in the pace at which compensation has been paid. The overall quantum of compensation is up in the last four months by roughly a third and the number of claims to which there has been an initial... offer being made in response to that claim has roughly doubled in the last four months [to] what it has been in the four months preceding the general election. Today the i has splashed on a report claiming Home Office insiders do not think the government\u2019s plan to smash the people smuggling gangs organising small boat crossings will work. In her story Lizzie Dearden says: Home Office officials do not believe Labour\u2019s plan to \u201csmash the gangs\u201d will work as a way of bringing down illegal migration to the UK, i can reveal. They say that civil servants in the department have been \u201cunderwhelmed\u201d by the approach that was being outlined again this week by Sir Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. The insiders say \u201cnobody\u201d understands how the much-vaunted Border Security Command \u2013 that the Government says will take the lead on combating people smugglers running small boats \u2013 will operate. Asked about the report in an interview with LBC, John Healey, the defence secretary, insisted Labour\u2019s policies would make a difference. Asked how they were different from what went before, he said: It\u2019s different because it is a force dedicated to smashing the gangs and reinforcing the borders. It\u2019s different because it will have powers that have not been there before, powers that are more akin to anti-terror powers, because these are organised criminal international gangs. And then the work with other countries at an international level that the prime minister is leading, is also a part of getting on top of this problem. It won\u2019t happen overnight. We\u2019re in the middle of the worst year ever, for the level of small boat crossings. But I\u2019m confident that we will get on top of it, given time and given the determination the government\u2019s got. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has started giving evidence to the Post Office Horizon inquiry. There is a live feed here. Reynolds\u2019 written witness statement is here. In it, Reynolds pays tribute to two Conservative former ministers for their work on the compensation schemes. I would also like to mention that Paul Scully, as former Postal Minister, made a significant attempt to move the dial, and that the now shadow secretary of state, Kevin Hollinrake moved it on much further. I have every confidence that our new postal minister, Gareth Thomas, will continue to build on these foundations to deliver justice for postmasters as quickly as possible. When I was the shadow secretary of state, I worked very closely with Kevin Hollinrake, who was the postal minister leading the work on behalf of the department \u2013 and we are able to have frank discussions in parliament with each other. This allowed us to ensure parliament could move quickly on this and enact the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 before the general election last year, which has significantly moved the dial in terms of providing redress. I am pleased to say that I played a significant role in ensuring the passing of the act through the house. I would very much like this good faith working relationship to continue \u2013 the Horizon scandal is widely recognised as an issue upon which MPs should work together on a cross-party basis, delivering justice for the subpostmasters. And this is what John Healey, the defence secretary, said about Labour\u2019s plans for defence spending. Healey said the government would set out a \u201cpathway\u201d to raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP after the defence review concludes in the spring of next year. Asked to defend why it was taking so long, he told LBC: It\u2019s a question of how much you spend but how you spend it and how well you spend it. If I said today look, we\u2019ll spend 2.5% on defence, your next and immediate question would be well, how will you spend it? That\u2019s the purpose of the defence review that we\u2019ve already launched \u2013 that Keir Starmer launched within a fortnight of Labour coming [into government]. He refused to commit the government reaching the 2.5% target before the next election. Asked on the Today programme if the target would be hit this parliament, he repeatedly sidestepped the question, just saying the pathway to 2.5% would be set out next year. He said Ben Wallace, the former Tory defence secretary, was wrong to claim the government is not really raising defence spending because it is just re-allocating Ukraine spending from Treasury reserve spending to the defence budget. When this was put to him, Healey told Today: Ben Wallace is factually incorrect. The \u00a32.9bn extra next year comes on top of the \u00a33bn this year for Ukraine, and those figures are set out in black and white in the budget documents, and anyone can go and check them, including Ben Wallace if he wants to do that for himself. In his interviews this morning John Healey, the defence secretary, was generally talking down the risk that Donald Trump\u2019s re-election poses to Ukraine rather than talking it up. But perhaps his most accurate answer came when he we will just have to \u201cwait and see\u201d what happens. Here is a summary of the main lines from his interviews on this topic. Healey said he did not expect the US to turn away from Nato under Trump. He told Sky News: I don\u2019t expect the US to turn away from Nato. They recognise the importance of the alliance. They recognise the importance of avoiding further conflict in Europe. Healey said US support for Nato \u201cgoes back decades, and that has remained, including through the previous President Trump administration\u201d. He also said Trump had \u201crightly\u201d pushed for European nations to spend more on defence. Healey said he expected the US under Trump to stand by Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes to prevail\u201d. Asked if Trump\u2019s win made Ukraine less safe, he told Sky News: No, I don\u2019t. The US alongside the UK have been two of the leading countries that have been standing by Ukraine, supporting Ukraine, our determination to do so is just as strong. As far as President Trump goes, he recognises that countries get security through strength, just as alliances like Nato do, and I expect the US to remain alongside allies like the UK, standing with Ukraine for as long as it takes to prevail over Putin\u2019s invasion. But Healey also said the world would have to \u201cwait and see\u201d what Trump would do over Ukraine. He told BBC Breakfast: We\u2019ll have to wait and see what President Trump really proposes \u2026 but if the reports of his call with [Vladimir] Putin last week are right then President Trump is exactly right to warn Putin against escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Healey said Keir Starmer and President Macron would be discussing this morning what \u201cmore\u201d they can do to support Ukraine. Healey said it was for Ukraine to decide when it starts talking to Russia about peace. He said: It\u2019s Ukraine that gets to call when the talking starts. Our job is to support Ukraine, stand by them when they fight, stand by them if they decide to talk. This could be ended today if Putin withdrew following his illegal invasion \u2026 that\u2019s the way this conflict could be ended, and the importance for us for Europe and for the United States is that Putin in the long run does not prevail, because if he does prevail, he will not stop at Ukraine, and the cost to us all will be much greater in the future. On Saturday the Guardian ran a story saying that officials in Kyiv are complaining in private about the UK\u2019s refusal to supply them with more Storm Shadow missiles and saying the relationship with London has \u201cgot worse\u201d since Labour took office. On the Today programme John Healey, the defence secretary, claimed the report was \u201csimply not correct\u201d. Asked if the relationship had got worse, Healey replied: That is simply not correct. We\u2019ve stepped up with more military support. We\u2019ve speeded up deliveries. We\u2019re now spending more on military aid for Ukraine than ever before as a UK government. I spoke at length to the defence minister in Ukraine yesterday. He certainly doesn\u2019t see the UK support weakening, and he said the Ukrainians are confident in Britain\u2019s continuing and steadfast support for their country. Keir Starmer has met Michel Barnier, the French prime minister, in Paris this morning. They know each other well, from when Starmer was shadow Brexit secretary and Barnier was the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, and Barner says he was \u201ctres heureux\u201d to meet his old interlocutor. And here\u2019s a translation (mostly from Google, but with my version of \u201cvient de loin, a connu les \u00e9preuves\u201d, because Google\u2019s wasn\u2019t very good.) Very happy to see you again, @Keir_Starmer, in Paris this morning. Franco-British friendship has come a long way, through thick and thin. It will be invaluable in facing the challenges that lie ahead. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, @10DowningStreet, for being with the French people on this November 11. (The tone of Barnier\u2019s message may upset some Brexiters. They still regard him as the devil incarnate, and seeing him being so friendly about Starmer may revive their suspicions about the PM\u2019s Europhilia.) Good morning. Keir Starmer is in Paris this morning for talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The prime minister is visiting to attend the French Armistice Day service, but the real interest will lie in what the leaders of Europe\u2019s two biggest military powers have to say as they discuss the implications of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. Here is Jessica Elgot\u2019s overnight preview story. John Healey, the defence secretary, has been doing a media round this morning. Quite what Trump will do about Ukraine \u2013 in fact, about anything \u2013 remains uncertain, but in the US it is being reported that Trump has spoken to Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and urged him not to escalate the Russian offensive in Ukraine. In her story Maya Yang reports: Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Vladimir Putin on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The US president-elect advised the Russian president not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of \u201cWashington\u2019s sizeable military presence in Europe\u201d, the Post reported. It added that Trump expressed interest in follow-up conversations on \u201cthe resolution of Ukraine\u2019s war soon\u201d. During the election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war \u201cwithin a day\u201d, but did not explain how he would do so. According to one former US official who was familiar with the call and spoke to the Washington Post, Trump likely does not want to begin his second presidential term with an escalation in the Ukraine war, \u201cgiving him incentive to want to keep the war from worsening\u201d. In an interview on the Today programme, Healey welcomed this report. Asked if Ukraine was losing the war, he replied: Ukraine is certainly under pressure. Russia is certainly escalating, and President Trump has reportedly told Putin and warned him against further escalation. If he\u2019s done that, he\u2019s right to do so. Russia is escalating with massing North Korean troops on their territory. It\u2019s escalating with more than 2,000 one-way attack kamikaze drones aimed at Kyiv and the rest of the Ukrainian cities in the last month alone. And one person is responsible for that escalation, and that\u2019s Putin. I will post more from Healey\u2019s interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Keir Starmer is meeting Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in Paris. 10am: Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, gives evidence to the Post Office Horizon inquiry. He will be followed by Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, giving evidence in her capacity as Reynolds\u2019 predecessor as business secretary. Her evidence may continue into the afternoon. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. Afternoon: Starmer is expected to speak to journalists while flying from Paris to Baku, where he is attending the Cop29 summit.

And crisis why, exactly?</strong> There can be many reasons but at this stage of your life you might start to wonder where it all went, to have feelings of nostalgia and regret, to question some of the choices you\u2019ve made, perhaps even to wonder about your very purpose and identity. Certainly you will be pondering mortality.</p> <p><strong>Bummer. </strong>Which is why it often leads to anxiety, depression and inner turmoil.</p> <p><strong>And what do you do about it?</strong> Well, talking to someone about it would probably be a good idea.

      "bodyText": "Name: The midlife crisis. Age: So it generally happens between the ages of 40 and 60. Not quite yet for me then. And crisis why, exactly? There can be many reasons but at this stage of your life you might start to wonder where it all went, to have feelings of nostalgia and regret, to question some of the choices you\u2019ve made, perhaps even to wonder about your very purpose and identity. Certainly you will be pondering mortality. Bummer. Which is why it often leads to anxiety, depression and inner turmoil. And what do you do about it? Well, talking to someone about it would probably be a good idea. But traditionally you get some work done \u2026 Knuckle down and hope it goes away? No! Cosmetic work, like a butt lift or a nice new set of teeth. And then you buy a big motorbike, or an expensive sports car, and go travelling and clubbing, learn to breakdance and have an inappropriate affair. Cool, looking forward to it. Well, hold it right there \u2013 it might not happen. Because I\u2019ve made all the right choices, and will be totally content with my lot? No, because you can\u2019t afford it. Can\u2019t afford a midlife crisis? Exactly that. In a US survey of 1,000 millennials by Thriving Center of Psychology, 81% said they couldn\u2019t afford to have a midlife crisis.

      "body": "<p>A Church of England bishop has added her voice to growing calls for the archbishop of Canterbury to resign over his failure to pursue a sadistic abuser of children when allegations were brought to his attention.</p> <p>Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, said Justin Welby\u2019s position was untenable and he should quit. A line needed to be drawn, she added.</p> <p>\u201cI think that it\u2019s very hard for the church, as the national, established church, to continue to have a moral voice in any way, shape or form in our nation, when we cannot get our own house in order with regard to something as critically important [as abuse],\u201d Hartley told the BBC.</p> <p>Andrew Morse, who was beaten by John Smyth as a teenager, also called on Welby to resign, saying it would send a powerful personal and public message that the church would no longer cover up abuse.</p> <p>\u201cHis resignation would be a positive step in a very bleak situation that has existed ever since Smyth started beating me and my friends more than 40 years ago,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Welby and his advisers at Lambeth Palace, the archbishop\u2019s headquarters, had prioritised the reputation of the church over and above the plight of Smyth\u2019s victims and their \u201cinactivity that was tantamount to a cover-up\u201d had allowed Smyth to continue to abuse with impunity, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a day that I haven\u2019t felt the reverberations [of the abuse],\u201d Morse added. \u201cI still lie awake at night trying to process what happened. I have only survived because of love, support and professional help.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d hope Welby would see this as an opportunity to draw a line, to say enough is enough. I feel his conscience must be telling him this.\u201d</p> <p>Members of the Church of England\u2019s ruling body, the General Synod, have launched a petition calling on Welby to quit, \u201cgiven his role in allowing abuse to continue\u201d. By 5pm on Monday the petition had 5,000 signatures.</p> <p>Robert Thompson, who set up the petition, said the church\u2019s handling of the Smyth abuse case was of concern to people \u201cright across the theological spectrum\u201d of the C of E.</p> <p>Thompson, a campaigner for LGBT equality within the church, had joined forces with conservative clergy to call for Welby\u2019s resignation.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a buildup of multiple, serial reports on cases of abuse and how the church has dealt with them. There is real disgust that we have had report after report, apology after apology, and nothing has changed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Welby, it\u2019s about the culture in the church. But Welby has lost the confidence of a significant number of clergy in the C of E. The bishop of Newcastle represents the views of other bishops who don\u2019t want to speak out. I don\u2019t think Welby can survive this.\u201d </p> <p>The archbishop had \u201clost the confidence of clergy\u201d, Giles Fraser, a London vicar, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThis needs to be our watershed moment in the church, where we look at the culture of deference, the way in which many of our senior leadership rally to defend each other.\u201d</p> <p>Welby said last week he had considered resigning over his \u201cshameful\u201d decision not to act remorselessly to deal with reports of abuse by Smyth, a powerful and charismatic barrister who died in 2018, when he was informed of them in 2013.</p> <p>Lambeth Palace said in a statement on Monday that Welby had \u201capologised profoundly both for his own failures and omissions, and for the wickedness, concealment and abuse by the church more widely\u201d but \u201cdoes not intend to resign\u201d.</p> <p>Pressure on Welby has been intensifying since the publication last week of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/church-of-england-covered-up-attacks-serial-abuser-john-smyth-review\">damning report on the church\u2019s cover-up of Smyth\u2019s abuse in the UK</a> in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and later in Zimbabwe and South Africa. About 130 boys are believed to have been victims.</p> <p>The report by Keith<strong> </strong>Makin described the abuse as \u201cprolific, brutal and horrific\u201d. The C of E \u201cknew at the highest level about the abuse\u201d but its response was \u201cwholly ineffective and amounted to a cover-up\u201d.</p> <p>Welby and other senior figures in the C of E were told of allegations that Smyth had abused dozens of boys who attended evangelical Christian holiday camps run by the Iwerne Trust, beating them viciously in his garden shed. Many of the boys were pupils at Winchester college, one of the UK\u2019s top public schools.</p> <p>Welby had volunteered at the holiday camps in the late 1970s but has said he was unaware of the allegations at the time. The Makin report said Welby was informed of the abuse allegations in 2013 but failed to take action, and that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d he would have been unaware of rumours surrounding Smyth when he was volunteering at the camps.</p> <p>\u201c[Welby] may not have known of the extreme seriousness of the abuse but it is most probable that he would have had at least a level of knowledge that John Smyth was of some concern,\u201d it said.</p> <p>After Channel 4 News exposed Smyth\u2019s abuse in 2017, Welby told the programme he had \u201cno idea that there was anything as horrific as this going on \u2026 I had no suspicions at all\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/11/justin-welby-personal-link-john-smyth-church-abuse-scandal-resignation-calls\">Justin Welby\u2019s personal link to child abuser adds fuel to resignation calls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Calls for Welby to resign are being partly driven by clergy who are frequent critics of the archbishop over his leadership of the C of E, though they may gather wider momentum over the coming days.</p> <p>Welby is expected to announce his retirement in the coming weeks or months. Bishops in the C of E are required to stand down at the age of 70. Welby will hit that milestone in January 2026 but bishops generally give long notice of impending retirement as the appointment process is notoriously slow.</p> <p>Lambeth Palace said: \u201cThe archbishop reiterates his horror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse, as reflected in his public apology. He has apologised profoundly both for his own failures and omissions, and for the wickedness, concealment and abuse by the church more widely.</p> <p>\u201cAs he has said, he had no awareness or suspicion of the allegations before he was told in 2013 \u2013 and therefore having reflected, he does not intend to resign.\u201d</p>",

Robert Thompson, who set up the petition, said the church\u2019s handling of the Smyth abuse case was of concern to people \u201cright across the theological spectrum\u201d of the C of E. Thompson, a campaigner for LGBT equality within the church, had joined forces with conservative clergy to call for Welby\u2019s resignation. \u201cThis is a buildup of multiple, serial reports on cases of abuse and how the church has dealt with them. There is real disgust that we have had report after report, apology after apology, and nothing has changed. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Welby, it\u2019s about the culture in the church. But Welby has lost the confidence of a significant number of clergy in the C of E. The bishop of Newcastle represents the views of other bishops who don\u2019t want to speak out. I don\u2019t think Welby can survive this.\u201d The archbishop had \u201clost the confidence of clergy\u201d, Giles Fraser, a London vicar, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThis needs to be our watershed moment in the church, where we look at the culture of deference, the way in which many of our senior leadership rally to defend each other.\u201d Welby said last week he had considered resigning over his \u201cshameful\u201d decision not to act remorselessly to deal with reports of abuse by Smyth, a powerful and charismatic barrister who died in 2018, when he was informed of them in 2013. Lambeth Palace said in a statement on Monday that Welby had \u201capologised profoundly both for his own failures and omissions, and for the wickedness, concealment and abuse by the church more widely\u201d but \u201cdoes not intend to resign\u201d. Pressure on Welby has been intensifying since the publication last week of a damning report on the church\u2019s cover-up of Smyth\u2019s abuse in the UK in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and later in Zimbabwe and South Africa. About 130 boys are believed to have been victims. The report by Keith Makin described the abuse as \u201cprolific, brutal and horrific\u201d. The C of E \u201cknew at the highest level about the abuse\u201d but its response was \u201cwholly ineffective and amounted to a cover-up\u201d. Welby and other senior figures in the C of E were told of allegations that Smyth had abused dozens of boys who attended evangelical Christian holiday camps run by the Iwerne Trust, beating them viciously in his garden shed. Many of the boys were pupils at Winchester college, one of the UK\u2019s top public schools. Welby had volunteered at the holiday camps in the late 1970s but has said he was unaware of the allegations at the time. The Makin report said Welby was informed of the abuse allegations in 2013 but failed to take action, and that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d he would have been unaware of rumours surrounding Smyth when he was volunteering at the camps. \u201c[Welby] may not have known of the extreme seriousness of the abuse but it is most probable that he would have had at least a level of knowledge that John Smyth was of some concern,\u201d it said. After Channel 4 News exposed Smyth\u2019s abuse in 2017, Welby told the programme he had \u201cno idea that there was anything as horrific as this going on \u2026 I had no suspicions at all\u201d. Calls for Welby to resign are being partly driven by clergy who are frequent critics of the archbishop over his leadership of the C of E, though they may gather wider momentum over the coming days. Welby is expected to announce his retirement in the coming weeks or months. Bishops in the C of E are required to stand down at the age of 70. Welby will hit that milestone in January 2026 but bishops generally give long notice of impending retirement as the appointment process is notoriously slow. Lambeth Palace said: \u201cThe archbishop reiterates his horror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse, as reflected in his public apology. He has apologised profoundly both for his own failures and omissions, and for the wickedness, concealment and abuse by the church more widely. \u201cAs he has said, he had no awareness or suspicion of the allegations before he was told in 2013 \u2013 and therefore having reflected, he does not intend to resign.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The owners of British Steel are to keep the blast furnaces at its Scunthorpe site running past Christmas amid talks over government support for a switch to less polluting technology. The government is thought to be considering aid for British Steel at the same level or even higher than the \u00a3500m pledged to Tata Steel, which closed its two blast furnaces in Port Talbot in September. However, no decisions on the shape of a package have been made. In the summer, unions said they were concerned about reports that British Steel was considering closing the two blast furnaces in Scunthorpe before Christmas. However, it is understood the government and unions are increasingly confident that the company and its owner, Jingye Group, will not go ahead with that option, after progress in talks. Steel companies around the world are struggling with a glut of production that has depressed prices. At the same time, the UK\u2019s two big steelmakers \u2013 the Indian-owned Tata Steel and the Chinese-owned British Steel \u2013 are struggling to come up with the cash needed to switch production from polluting blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnace technology. British Steel last year announced its plans to build an electric arc furnace at Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, and another at a site in Teesside. However, it has held out for government support, which has been delayed to the frustration of workers. Last week, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, met Li Huiming, the chief executive of Jingye Group, to discuss the future of the Scunthorpe plant and its 2,500 workers, the Financial Times first reported. It is understood the government is seeking assurances that jobs will be protected at Scunthorpe if an aid package is agreed, as well as seeking to make sure it will be financially sustainable. The aid is likely to come from \u00a32.5bn set aside by the government to help steelmakers decarbonise. However, it is thought that British Steel will only be eligible for a relatively small proportion of that figure, and much less than the \u00a32bn left over after the aid for Tata. One source of uncertainty over the future of the Scunthorpe blast furnaces has been orders of coking coal used to strip oxygen from iron ore. British Steel closed its coke ovens last year, and has since been reliant on imports via its port at Immingham. The steelmaker has been contending with a problem in one of its blast furnaces that led to the temperature dropping. It subsequently ordered less coking coal as a cost-saving measure while dealing with the problem. The company is understood to have suggested in talks that it may not increase orders of the coal again, but it is thought that threat has now receded. Another UK-based steel business, Liberty Steel, has announced it will pursue a restructuring of the debts of its Speciality Steel UK (SSUK) business to try to ease the burden of repayments. However, the company, which is controlled by the metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta, said no employees would be affected by the restructuring. Jeff Kabel, Liberty\u2019s Steel group chief transformation officer, said on Monday that the company had the backing of customers for the plan. He said it was the \u201cbest route forward for all stakeholders\u201d, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re confident in winning the support of our creditors for the essential actions required to complete SSUK\u2019s recovery.\u201d Liberty said SSUK was still struggling to cope with payments on borrowing from Greensill Capital, a lender that went bust after lending \u00a3400m. Financing arrangements between the Gupta Family Group Alliance and Greensill have been subject to an investigation by the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office since 2021. It is thought that Liberty will seek an adjournment to separate proceedings by creditors pending the outcome of the restructuring plan. A British Steel spokesperson said: \u201cAs part of our commitment to securing a sustainable future for British Steel in Scunthorpe, we recently purchased raw materials that will see our operations continue to run into the new year and are working to restore production levels from our blast furnaces. \u201cAt the same time, we remain in active discussions with government, working together to ensure British Steel continues to play a vital role in meeting the UK\u2019s infrastructure needs.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis government will simply not allow the end of steel making in the UK.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/11/can-you-solve-it-the-knotty-problem-of-paddington-in-peru\">Earlier today</a> I set you a puzzle about a \u2018khipu\u2019, the Incan method of recording numbers with knots on string that features in Paddington in Peru. Here it is again with the answer.</p> <p>Incans used khipus to record dates, taxes and measurements, among other things. Knowledge of how khipus represented numbers was lost after the Spanish conquest, until a high school maths teacher in Brooklyn worked it out in 1912. Today\u2019s puzzle asked you you to repeat his decipherment.</p> <h2><strong>Old rope</strong></h2> <p>The image below is a section of a khipu laid out flat. The horizontal line is the cord on which all other strings are tied. Each vertical string is a three-digit number. Each set of four strings below the line is grouped together by a fifth string above the line. The \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018o\u2019 symbols represent two different types of knot.</p>    <p>Below is another set of four strings attached to the same horizontal cord. As in the previous diagram, the four strings under the cord are linked by a single one above, which I have left blank and marked with a \u2018?\u2019. What knots should go on this string?</p>    <p>To solve this problem, you need to look at the first image, work out the pattern, and then apply it to the second image.</p> <h2><strong>Solution</strong></h2> <p>The khipu number system was a base ten, positional system much like Arabic numerals. If you count the knots you are half way there.</p>    <p>After some staring at this image, you might notice the very simple pattern at work. Knots represent decimal digits. Each string has three positions, and represents a three-digit number. The \u2018o\u2019-knots encode the units digits, and the \u2018x\u2019-knots encode the tens and the hundreds digits. So the strings marked (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) are 134, 366, 250, 055 and 805. The number on the top string, which groups the four bottom strings together, is equal to the sum of the four bottom strings (134 + 366 +250 + 055 = 805.) We can confirm this with the set on the right. The bottom strings again add up to the top one: 085 + 319 + 169 + 039 = 612.</p> <p>Now to the \u2018?\u2019. The four bottom strings on the second image contain the numbers 089, 258, 273 and 038. These numbers add up to 658, so the top string must encode 658.</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s puzzle. I\u2019ll be back in two weeks.</p> <p><em>Today\u2019s puzzle is extracted from my book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3YEvgIl\">The Language Lover\u2019s Puzzle Book</a> (2020), and originally appeared in the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad.</em></p>    <p><em>My latest book is Think Twice: Solve the Puzzles That (Almost) Everyone Gets Wrong, a collection of counter-intuitive conundrums that make you think about thinking \u2013 while enjoying the pleasure of being misled.

      "bodyText": "Earlier today I set you a puzzle about a \u2018khipu\u2019, the Incan method of recording numbers with knots on string that features in Paddington in Peru. Here it is again with the answer. Incans used khipus to record dates, taxes and measurements, among other things. Knowledge of how khipus represented numbers was lost after the Spanish conquest, until a high school maths teacher in Brooklyn worked it out in 1912. Today\u2019s puzzle asked you you to repeat his decipherment. Old rope The image below is a section of a khipu laid out flat. The horizontal line is the cord on which all other strings are tied. Each vertical string is a three-digit number. Each set of four strings below the line is grouped together by a fifth string above the line. The \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018o\u2019 symbols represent two different types of knot. Below is another set of four strings attached to the same horizontal cord. As in the previous diagram, the four strings under the cord are linked by a single one above, which I have left blank and marked with a \u2018?\u2019. What knots should go on this string? To solve this problem, you need to look at the first image, work out the pattern, and then apply it to the second image. Solution The khipu number system was a base ten, positional system much like Arabic numerals. If you count the knots you are half way there. After some staring at this image, you might notice the very simple pattern at work. Knots represent decimal digits. Each string has three positions, and represents a three-digit number. The \u2018o\u2019-knots encode the units digits, and the \u2018x\u2019-knots encode the tens and the hundreds digits. So the strings marked (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) are 134, 366, 250, 055 and 805. The number on the top string, which groups the four bottom strings together, is equal to the sum of the four bottom strings (134 + 366 +250 + 055 = 805.) We can confirm this with the set on the right. The bottom strings again add up to the top one: 085 + 319 + 169 + 039 = 612. Now to the \u2018?\u2019. The four bottom strings on the second image contain the numbers 089, 258, 273 and 038. These numbers add up to 658, so the top string must encode 658. I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s puzzle. I\u2019ll be back in two weeks. Today\u2019s puzzle is extracted from my book The Language Lover\u2019s Puzzle Book (2020), and originally appeared in the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad. My latest book is Think Twice: Solve the Puzzles That (Almost) Everyone Gets Wrong, a collection of counter-intuitive conundrums that make you think about thinking \u2013 while enjoying the pleasure of being misled. The questions are not \u2018trick\u2019 questions; instead, they reveal our biases and flawed reasoning. Think Twice: Solve the Simple Puzzles (Almost) Everyone Gets Wrong.

      "bodyText": "Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the pager and walkie-talkie explosion attacks inside Lebanon and Syria. Omer Dostri, spokesperson for Netanyahu\u2019s office, confirmed Israeli responsibility on Monday. The pager attack killed 39 people and injured more than 3,400 others. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu claimed responsibility during a cabinet meeting, telling ministers senior defence officials and political figures were opposed, but that he went ahead with the operation intended to target Hezbollah operatives. Taiwan said it had closed its probe into the explosions, saying no Taiwanese citizens or companies were involved despite the pagers carrying the name of Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo. Speaking at the joint Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit in Riyadh, Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, said that his country was suffering an \u201cunprecedented\u201d crisis that threatens its existence. Speaking before leaders, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom renewed \u201cits condemnation and categorical rejection of the genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people, which has claimed the lives of 150,000 martyrs, wounded and missing, most of whom are women and children.\u201d Iran\u2019s first vice president Mohammad Reza Aref told the summit that the \u201cworld is waiting\u201d for Donald Trump\u2019s incoming US government to stop Israel\u2019s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah, as it condemned a wave of Israeli assassinations as \u201corganised terrorism\u201d. Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed 3,243 people and injured 14,134 since 7 October 2023, the Lebanese health ministry said, adding that 54 Lebanese people had been killed and 56 others injured on Sunday alone. Israel\u2019s newly appointed foreign minister Gideon Saar said that \u201ccertain progress\u201d had been made on ceasefire talks in Lebanon. However, a spokesperson for Hezbollah said they were yet to be directly engaged in talks. Syria\u2019s main Homs-Damascus highway was temporarily cut off after an Israeli strike targeted an aid gathering centre for displaced Lebanese south of the city of Homs, according to Syria\u2019s state news agency. Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s legal team has filed a request to delay the prime minister\u2019s testimony at his corruption trial, saying recent developments in the war have prevented him preparing for the hearing. Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued forced evacuation orders for residents of many towns/villages in southern Lebanon, saying people there must move north of the Awali river. The amount of aid reaching Gaza has dropped to the lowest level since December, official Israeli figures show, despite the US having issued a 30-day ultimatum last month threatening sanctions if there was no increase in humanitarian supplies reaching the territory. Jason Burke is the International security correspondent of the Guardian The amount of aid reaching Gaza has dropped to the lowest level since December, official Israeli figures show, despite the US having issued a 30-day ultimatum last month threatening sanctions if there was no increase in humanitarian supplies reaching the territory. The ultimatum was delivered on 13 October, so will expire on Tuesday or Wednesday. It is unclear what measures Israel\u2019s apparent failure to fulfil US demands will trigger, but they may include a temporary halt to the supply of some munitions or other military assistance. In an apparent last-minute concession on Monday, Israeli authorities announced an extension of the designated \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d, adding inland areas which could partially relieve intense overcrowding and allow some displaced people to move away from the coast as winter approaches. However, Israel appears to have ignored most of the demands made in a letter sent jointly by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, and Lloyd Austin, the defence secretary, on 13 October. Aid officials in Gaza describe the situation in much of the territory, where more than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced and more than two-thirds of buildings have been destroyed or damaged in 13 months of war, as \u201capocalyptic\u201d. You can read the full story here: Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed 3,243 people and injured 14,134 since 7 October 2023, the Lebanese health ministry has said, adding that 54 Lebanese people had been killed and 56 others injured on Sunday alone. Hezbollah, the Iranian backed Lebanese militant group, began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 7 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. The Israeli military unleashed its assault on Lebanon in October, claiming its aim was to return tens of thousands of people evacuated from homes in northern Israel due to the cross-border hostilities. Iran\u2019s first vice president, Mohammad Reza Aref, has been speaking at the joint Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit in Saudi Arabia. He said \u201cthe world is waiting\u201d for Donald Trump\u2019s incoming US government to \u201cimmediately\u201d end Israel\u2019s wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Aref told the summit: The American government is the main supporter of the actions of the Zionist regime (Israel), and the world is waiting for the promise of the new government of this country to immediately stop the war against the innocent people of Gaza and Lebanon. He also condemned Israel\u2019s recent assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders as \u201corganised terrorism\u201d (In September, Israel assassinated long-time Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, a high-ranking Iranian official, in Beirut. Israel\u2019s military said last month it had killed former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who is seen as the architect of the 7 October attack in Israel, in Gaza. Aref said: The operations that are conceptualised with the deceptive phrasing of \u2018targeted killing\u2019, and during which Palestinian elites and leaders of other countries in the region are killed one by one or en masse, are nothing but lawlessness and organised terrorism. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s newly reinforced position now Trump has won the US presidency could lead to further intensification of Israel\u2019s wars \u2013 although the incoming US president has said he wants to swiftly end both conflicts. Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee has issued forced evacuation orders for residents of southern Lebanon, saying people there must move north of the Awali river, which meets the coast about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Israel. The order was aimed at the towns of Sheheen, al-Jebbayn, Tayr Harfa, Abu Shash, Beit Shama, Majdal Zoun, al-Mansouri, Zebqin, Rashidieh, Barghliyeh, Qasmiyeh, al-Bayyaada, Naqoura, Bint Jbeil, Ainata, Kounine, Aitaroun, Taybeh, Rab Thalathin, Markaba, and Bani Hayyan. In a post on X, Adraee wrote: For your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately and move to the north of the Awali river. For your safety, you must evacuate without delay. Anyone who is near Hezbollah elements, facilities or weapons is putting his life in danger. You are prohibited from heading south. Any movement south could be dangerous to your life. We will inform you of the appropriate time to return to your homes as soon as the conditions are suitable for this. Israel\u2019s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, will meet with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Monday in Washington at 5pm ET (2200 GMT), the State Department said. The US government said in a letter on 13 October that Israel had 30 days to take specific steps to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The letter was sent to Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defence minister, and Dermer, and came to light after being posted on social media by Barak Ravid, an Israeli journalist who works for Axios, after apparently being leaked. Since that letter, Blinken has urged Israel to substantially increase humanitarian aid. Earlier this month, he was said to have spoken to Dermer and discussed a diplomatic solution to Israel\u2019s assault on Lebanon as well as ending its war on Gaza. Humanitarian groups have made repeated calls for increased deliveries of food and medicine to Gaza amid accusations that the Israeli military is blocking food aid deliveries. Israel has been accused of putting into practice a blueprint known as the \u201cgenerals\u2019 plan\u201d, a \u201csurrender or starve\u201d campaign aimed at depopulating northern Gaza. Israel denies it is carrying out the plan. We have some more of what the Lebanese caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, said at the Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh earlier (see post at 13.40 for more details). He said Israel\u2019s war has caused \u201cunprecedented losses\u201d with more than 3,000 having been killed, including 775 women and children. He said the war also had caused $8.5bn in losses, including $3.4bn caused by the destruction or damage of about 100,000 housing units in different parts of the country. \u201cNo state can take the burden of this huge destruction,\u201d Mikati said, adding that Beirut is about to set up a fund that will be funded by friendly states for the reconstruction process. He said, according to the Associated Press, that the fund will be under international supervision and subject to international auditing. William Christou reports from Beirut for the Guardian Israel\u2019s newly appointed foreign minister Gideon Saar said on Monday that \u201ccertain progress\u201d had been made on ceasefire talks in Lebanon, where Israel has been engaged in fighting Hezbollah for over 13 months, however a spokesperson for Hezbollah said they were yet to be directly engaged in talks. \u201cWe will be ready to be there if we know, first of all, that Hezbollah is not on our border, is north of the Litani River, and that Hezbollah will not be able to arm with new weapons systems,\u201d Saar said. He added that diplomatic efforts were taking place through US mediation, but that the lack of enforcement mechanism in any future deal remained a stumbling block. Israel\u2019s stated objective in its ground invasion of south Lebanon was to bring back residents of north Israel, of which tens of thousands were displaced after Hezbollah began firing rockets \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Hamas on 8 October 2023. Israel has said that Hezbollah would need to retreat back of the Litani river, about 18 miles from its northern border, to ensure the security of north Israel. Diplomatic efforts were not only confined to American channels, as Israel\u2019s army radio reported that Israel\u2019s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, visited Russia last week to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon. Saar said that Russia could play a role in a ceasefire agreement by helping ensure that arms do not flow to Hezbollah via Syria, where Russian troops are present. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati, also met with a number of Arab leaders, including Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and the Crown Prince of Kuwait, at the Arab-Islamic Summit in Riyadh on Monday. Despite the reported progress on a ceasefire deal, Hezbollah has said that it had not seen any actual proposal come across its desk, nor does it expect to any time soon. Mohammad Afif, the head of Hezbollah\u2019s media office, said at a press conference on Monday: \u201cThere is great movement between Washington and Moscow and Tehran and a number of capitals. I believe that we are still in the phase of testing the waters and presenting initial ideas and proactive discussions, but so far there is nothing actual yet.\u201d Any ceasefire in Lebanon would have to be approved by Hezbollah, and presumably its patron, Iran. Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, Naim Qassem, has said that the group is ready for a ceasefire with Israel and that it has backed away from its previous demand that a ceasefire in Gaza come before it stops fighting. Israeli minister of strategic affairs Ron Dermer will meet US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Monday in Washington, Reuters reports the US state department has announced. Israel\u2019s military reports that a barrage of about 90 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into northern Israel between 3.40pm and 4.03pm local time (1.40pm-2.03pm GMT). The Times of Israel is reporting that three people were wounded, with the Magen David Adom emergency services saying one man was taken to hospital. Three people were reported wounded by an earlier barrage on Monday. A left-wing MK who supported South Africa\u2019s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza has been expelled from the Knesset for six months. The Jerusalem Post reports that Ofer Kasif, who represents the joint Hadash-Ta\u2019al list, was \u201cexpelled for accusing the IDF of committing war crimes, as well as his signing of South Africa\u2019s genocide petition to the International Court of Justice.\u201d Far-right interior security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has said the punishment is not sufficient, and that Kasif should be \u201cpermanently removed from the Israeli Knesset and deported to Syria.\u201d A senior member of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government has posted to social media to declare that next year will be a year for Israel to take full sovereign control of the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. In the message, posted in Hebrew, Bezalel Smotrich said \u201c2025 \u2013 the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.\u201d Judea and Samaria is a term used by Israeli nationalists to refer to the occupied West Bank. Smotrich has previously said he aims to establish sovereignty over the occupied territory and thwart the creation of a Palestinian state. He has also threatened to collapse Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government if a ceasefire is agreed with Hezbollah on Israel\u2019s northern front. He has remained in Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet. Israel\u2019s military has stated that as of 3pm local time (1pm GMT) \u201capproximately 75 projectiles\u201d had been fired today towards Israel from Lebanon. It stated that it held Hezbollah responsible. Israeli forces detained at least 20 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank from last night into the morning, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society said. According to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, the detentions were carried out in Hebron, Ramallah, al-Bireh, Qalqilya, Nablus and Jerusalem. It is estimated that at least 11,600 Palestinians have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since last October. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the West Bank. They have described alleged abusive and humiliating treatment, including holding blindfolded and handcuffed detainees in cramped cages as well as beatings, intimidation and harassment. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, has warned that his country was suffering an \u201cunprecedented\u201d crisis that threatens its existence, as Israel\u2019s assault on Lebanon continues. He told the joint Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit in Riyadh: Lebanon is going through an unprecedented historical and existential crisis that threatens its present and future. Mikati also demanded that countries stop \u201cinterfering in its internal affairs by supporting this or that group, but rather support Lebanon as a state and entity\u201d. Hezbollah, the Iranian backed Lebanese militant group, began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 7 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. The Israeli military unleashed its assault on Lebanon in October, claiming its aim was to return tens of thousands of people evacuated from homes in northern Israel due to the cross-border hostilities. Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed over 3,100 people since October 2023, the Lebanese health ministry, with more than 1.2 million people displaced across Lebanon. Government services for the huge numbers of displaced people \u2013 and those injured by Israeli bombardments - have been inadequate as the caretaker government struggles to fill the demand. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, has met with Jordanian King Abdullah II on the sidelines of the joint Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Abbas discussed Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, ways to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and how to preserve the legal and historical status of Islamic and Christian holy sites, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reported. Abbas also discussed the importance of preserving the presence of the UN relief and works agency (Unrwa) in the region and to increase the amount of aid being allowed into Gaza. The Israeli military has been accused of blocking food aid deliveries. Last month, the Knesset \u2013 the Israeli parlimanet - banned Unrwa from conducting \u201cany activity\u201d or providing any service inside Israel, including the areas of annexed East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. A second vote declared Unrwa a terror group, effectively banning any direct interaction between the agency and the Israeli state. Unrwa head Philippe Lazzarini called the Israeli decision \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said it was \u201cnothing less than collective punishment\u201d for Palestinians. The bills \u201cwill only deepen the suffering Palestinians, especially in Gaza, where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell\u201d. An Unrwa spokesperson said the law would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d and have a serious impact on the humanitarian operation in Gaza and in the occupied West Bank. Jordan\u2019s foreign ministry said the vote was \u201cpart of the systematic targeting\u201d of Unrwa and a \u201ccontinuation of Israel\u2019s frantic efforts to assassinate the UN agency politically, in addition to its aggressive war on the Palestinian people\u201d. Abbas arrived in Riyadh yesterday evening to take part in the Arab-Islamic summit, which will focus on addressing Israel\u2019s wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The number of people injured by rocket fire into northern Israel from Lebanon today has increased to three, according to reports in Israeli media. The Magen David Adom emergency services said a woman was \u201cmoderately wounded by shrapnel\u201d and a man and a baby were \u201clightly wounded\u201d. Speaking in Riyadh at a conference today of Arab and Muslim leaders to address conflict in Gaza and Lebanon, Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinian people, and said the Israel\u2019s actions deliberately \u201cviolate Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d He said: Israel\u2019s continued aggression towards the Palestinian people hinders peace efforts. We emphasise our opposition to the genocide Israel is committing against the Palestinian people, and the deliberate military actions which violate Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. Israel\u2019s military has posted to its official Telegram channel to claim that during operations in Rafah in the Gaza Strip it located \u201cweapons storage facility containing observation equipment, drones, enemy manufacturing supplies, explosive devices, and dozens of mortar shells.\u201d In the update, it claims IDF soldiers \u201celiminated many terrorists.\u201d It also claims that the weapons storage was found \u201cnear a mosque and a hospital.\u201d The claims have not been independently verified. Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with about 2.2 million people crammed into a narrow strip of territory that is 40km (25 miles) long. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Lebanon. Arab and Muslim leaders are meeting at a summit in Riyadh to discuss the conflict in Gaza and Lebanon. King Abdullah II of Jordan\u2019s social media has published some of his words. The king said: How can we justify \u2026 the global failure to stop the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon? Immediate action is needed to end the aggression and the killing, destruction and escalation it is causing in the region. We do not want words, we want serious positions and tangible efforts to end the tragedy, save our people in Gaza, and provide the aid they need. I call on our brothers and friends to participate in launching a humanitarian bridge to deliver emergency aid to Gaza. It is approaching 2pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City. Here are the latest headlines \u2026 Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the pager and walkie-talkie explosion attacks inside Lebanon and Syria. Omer Dostri, spokesperson for Netanyahu\u2019s office, confirmed Israeli responsibility on Monday. The pager attack killed 39 people and wounded more than 3,400. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu claimed responsibility during a cabinet meeting, telling ministers senior defence officials and political figures were opposed, but that he went ahead with the operation intended to target Hezbollah operatives. Taiwan said it had closed its probe into the explosions, saying no Taiwanese citizens or companies were involved despite the pagers carrying the name of Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo A senior Hezbollah figure has said Israel \u201cwill never win\u201d its war against the group, and said it retains resources for a long war. Hezbollah\u2019s media relations official Muhammad Afif boasted that after \u201c45 days of bloody fighting \u2026 the enemy is still unable to occupy a single Lebanese village\u201d Israel\u2019s military has announced an expansion of what it calls \u201cthe humanitarian area\u201d in the Gaza Strip, which it has had under siege for over a year. Over 40,000 people have been reported killed by Israel\u2019s military action during that period. Nearly 70% of the people killed in the war have been women and children, according to a UN analysis of verified deaths Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom emergency service says it is treating injuries after rockets were fired at Karmiel in northern Israel Syria\u2019s main Homs-Damascus highway was temporarily cut off after an Israeli strike targeted an aid gathering centre for displaced Lebanese south of the city of Homs, according to Syria\u2019s state news agency Lebanon\u2019s government has signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Committee of the Red Cross to equip four mobile medical clinics to help provide for the needs of the 1.2 million people estimated displaced from their homes by Israel\u2019s campaign of airstrikes Netanyahu\u2019s legal team has filed a request to delay the prime minister\u2019s testimony at his corruption trial, saying recent developments in the war have prevented him preparing for the hearing Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli forces have demolished a mosque near Jaba\u2019 to the east of Jerusalem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It said more than 20 people had been arrested by Israeli security forces overnight Hind Khoudary, reporting for Al Jazeera from Deir el-Balah in Gaza, says that Israeli tanks are at the edge of Nuseirat refugee camp in Central Gaza. She reports: At midnight we heard continuous loud explosions and then we noticed that Israeli tanks started to proceed to the edge of Nuseirat. Dozens of Palestinians have been injured and many families are trapped inside the houses close to where the Israeli tanks are. There are injured people that were shot with Israeli live ammunition, but no one is able to reach that area because of the Israeli tanks. There is also Israeli shelling [and] quadcopters hovering in the sky and hitting Palestinian civilians and homes. Al Jazeera has been banned from operating inside Israel or the Israeli-occupied West Bank by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. Lebanon\u2019s government has signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Committee of the Red Cross to equip four mobile medical clinics to help provide for the needs of people displaced from their homes by Israel\u2019s campaign of airstrikes. Lebanon\u2019s National News AAgnecy reports the clinics will be equipped with a general practitioner, a paediatrician and a gynaecologist. About 1.2 million people are believed to have been forced from their homes inside Lebanon as a result of Israel\u2019s military action. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Israel and Gaza. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli forces have demolished a mosque near Jaba\u2019 to the east of Jerusalem. A witness told Wafa that the troops also bulldozed an abandoned house and several sheep pens. Syria\u2019s main Homs-Damascus highway was temporarily cut off after an Israeli strike targeted an aid gathering centre for displaced Lebanese south of the city of Homs, Reuters reports, citing the Syrian state news agency Sana. Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom emergency service says it is treating a 40-year-old woman for shrapnel wounds in Karmiel in northern Israel. Israel\u2019s military, on its official Telegram channel, reports that \u201capproximately 50 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory\u201d during the latest barrage. The IDF says \u201cSome of the projectiles were intercepted and some fell.\u201d Palestinian news sources are reporting a new Israeli airstrike on Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip. More details soon \u2026 Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the pager and walkie-talkie explosion attacks inside Lebanon and Syria. Omer Dostri, spokesperson for Netanyahu\u2019s office, confirmed Israeli responsibility on Monday, Reuters reports. On 17 September thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded, killing dozens and injuring thousands of people. In total, the pager attack, and a second on the following day that detonated walkie-talkies, killed 39 people and wounded more than 3,400. Among the victims rushed to hospital many had eye injuries, missing fingers or abdominal wounds, indicating their proximity to the devices at the time of detonation. Israeli media has reported that Netanyahu claimed responsibility for the attack during a cabinet meeting, telling ministers that senior defence officials and political figures were opposed to the detonation of the pagers, but that he went ahead with the operation that was intended to target Hezbollah operatives. The Times of Israel\u2019s military correspondent Emanuel Fabian reports that \u201cmedics are responding to reports of rocket impacts\u201d in Karmiel in northern Israel. More details soon \u2026 A senior Hezbollah figure has said Israel \u201cwill never win\u201d its war against the group, and said it retains resources for a long war. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency, reporting a lengthy speech from Hezbollah\u2019s media relations official Muhammad Afif quotes him addressing Hezbollah fighters, saying: The actual facts on the ground are in your hands, and will have the final say in politics and decision-making. And in light of your fighting and steadfastness, the fate of your homeland will be determined, and perhaps the fate of the entire Middle East. After forty-five days of bloody fighting, five military divisions, two brigades, and sixty-five thousand soldiers, the enemy is still unable to occupy a single Lebanese village. He continued: We have three decisive elements on the field: the will of [those] who are determined to die defending their homeland and their people. We have enough time before their [Israeli] tanks sink in the Lebanese mud with the onset of winter. We have the land that we know and that knows us, which gives us freedom of manoeuvre and movement. We can either live on it as honourable people or die for it as martyrs. You [Israel] will never win your war with air superiority, nor with destruction and killing of civilians, women and children. As long as you are unable to advance on the ground and gain actual control, you will never achieve your political goals, and the people of the north will never return to the north. Afif also appeared to attempt to distance Hezbollah from its frequent portrayal as a manifestation of Iranian foreign policy against Israel, saying: The emergence of Hezbollah in 1982 as a resistance movement is originally a natural reaction to the [Israeli] occupation \u2026 Our movement emerged on Lebanese land occupied by the Israeli enemy. Our leadership is Lebanese, and our resistance fighters are Lebanese from father to grandfather. We are not a faction for anyone, and we do not follow anyone\u2019s orders, nor do we receive instructions from anyone. He said \u201cWe reaffirm once again that the resistance, especially on the front lines, have enough weapons, equipment and supplies for a long war for which we are prepared on all levels.\u201d Syria\u2019s state news agency is reporting an Israeli strike in the countryside near Homs. More details soon \u2026 Israeli media reports that Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s legal team has filed a request to delay the prime minister\u2019s testimony at his corruption trial. The Times of Israel says that the request cites recent major developments in the war, saying this has prevented Netanyahu from preparing his evidence. The legal team, requesting a postponement for two-and-a-half months said \u201cthis small delay will enable the defence to properly prepare for his testimony and won\u2019t harm the public interest.\u201d There are also, it reports, ongoing concerns about security around his appearance in court. The prime minister\u2019s home was recently targeted by a Hezbollah drone attack. Israel\u2019s military reports that warning sirens are again sounding in the Upper Galilee region of northern Israel. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli security forces have arrested at least 20 people in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since last night. It notes that Israel has detained more than 11,600 people from the occupied West Bank since 7 October 2023. Israel\u2019s military has announced an expansion of what it calls \u201cthe humanitarian area\u201d in the Gaza Strip, which it has had under seige for over a year. Over 40,000 people have been reported killed in the territory by Israel\u2019s military action during that period. Nearly 70% of the people killed in the war have been women and children, according to a UN analysis of verified deaths that highlights the heavy civilian toll of the conflict. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reports five people have been injured, including a child, by Israeli fire during a raid on the Jalazone refugee camp north of Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Taiwan on Monday said it had closed its probe into pagers that exploded in Lebanon in September, saying no Taiwanese citizens or companies were involved. Security sources have previously said the pagers carried the name of Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, a company which has asserted that it did not make them. Taiwan\u2019s government has also said the pagers were not made in Taiwan. \u201cThere is no evidence indicating that any domestic manufacturers or individuals were accomplices in the relevant explosions, violating the counter-terrorism financing act, or engaging in other illegal activities,\u201d Reuters reports the prosecutors said in a statement. \u201cNo concrete evidence of criminal activity has been discovered in this case, nor have any specific individuals been implicated in any criminal activity, following a comprehensive investigation.\u201d The series of explosions, which killed dozens of people and injured thousands more in both Lebanon and Syria, have been widely ascribed to an Israeli intelligence operation against Hezbollah, although Israel has not formally claimed responsibility. Israel\u2019s Channel 13 has this image of firefighters attending a small blaze caused by falling debris in Western Galilee after Israel\u2019s military intercepted a projectile. This block orginally mistakenly ascribed the photo to being taken at a separate earlier incident, east of Jerusalem Israel\u2019s military reports that warning sirens have sounded in Avivim, northern Israel. Avivim is a moshav adjacent to the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon, and it has been repeatedly targeted by rocket fire from inside Lebanon. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been forced to flee their homes in the north of the country due to the near constant rocket barrages by Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli forces, and Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government has set their ability to peacefully return to their homes as one of its war aims. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reports Israeli planes carried out airstrikes again overnight on locations in the south of the country. There are, as yet, no reports of any casualties. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from the Kerem Shalom crossing between Gaza and Israel. Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering a displaced family in the central Gaza Strip, killing at least three people, including the parents of twins, reports Associated Press. The strike late Sunday in the Nuseirat refugee camp wounded the two children, aged 10, who were being treated for serious injuries at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. The details of the casualties were listed in hospital records and an Associated Press reporter saw two of the bodies. Reuters has a quick snap that Yemen\u2019s Houthis, via a spokesperson, have claimed responsibility for firing missiles which they say were aimed at an Israeli military base near Tel Aviv. Israel\u2019s military reports on its official Telegram channel that overnight it \u201csuccessfully intercepted four UAVs that approached Israel from the east.\u201d When IDF statements say generically \u201cfrom the east\u201d they usually mean from the direction of Iraq. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports more arrests overnight made by Israeli security forces in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It reports a young man was arrested in Shuafat refugee camp, in East Jerusalem, after forces raided his home. In addition, during an Israeli raid on the Jalazone refugee camp, north of Ramalla, one man was injured by fire from Israeli security forces, and two people were detained. The claims have not been independently verified. Hani Mahmoud, reporting for Al Jazeera from Deir el-Balah in Gaza, writes for the network that a journalist and his wife were killed in overnight Israeli attacks on their tents in Gaza. He writes: They had set the tents up seeking protection from the unpredictable Israeli bombs after their home in the Nuseirat refugee camp was destroyed a few months ago. This particular area of the northern Nuseirat refugee camp is very close to the edge of the Netzarim Junction. The Israeli army has a very strong and visible presence there. That area has been relentlessly attacked, and people there are exposed to daily terror, from the heavy machineguns, the quadcopters and the drones that are hovering at a very low level. Al Jazeera has been banned from operating inside Israel by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. Outgoing US president Joe Biden is due to meet with Israel\u2019s president Isaac Herzog on Tuesday, according to a report from Reuters. The meeting comes as a deadline set by the US for improved delivery of humanitarian aid to the beseiged northern part of the Gaza Strip comes closer to expiry. Israeli firefighters were battling blazes Monday west of Jerusalem, with the army saying the fires were sparked by debris from an intercepted missile fired from Yemen, AFP reports. Firefighters were working to douse the blazes, conducting scans around Beit Shemesh to rule out more fires and \u201cdamage from interceptor/missile shrapnel\u201d, the Jerusalem region fire service said. In a statement on its official Telegram channel, the IDF said: Following the sirens that sounded in the Shfelat Yehuda, Yehuda, and Lakhish areas of central Israel, the IAF intercepted one projectile that approached Israel from the direction of Yemen. The projectile did not cross into Israeli territory. Sirens were sounded in accordance with protocol. Asked directly about the incident by AFP, the Israeli military said the interception of a projectile from Yemen caused fires in the Bet Shemesh area resulting from debris from that interception.

Thousands of extra police will be on duty for the game taking place against a backdrop of high tension caused by the conflict in Gaza. The Elys\u00e9e said the president\u2019s presence on Thursday aimed to \u201cshow his entire and full support for the French team as he does every match\u201d but also \u201csend a message of fraternity and solidarity after the intolerable acts of antisemitism that followed the match in Amsterdam\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Cats\u2019 stock may have fallen some way since being worshipped in ancient Egypt, but the domesticated kind still live pretty rarefied lives. Cat kit is big business, despite reassuringly few cats being trusted with credit cards of their own.</p> <p>But what do you actually need to keep your pet feline safe and happy? I live with three of the furry little simpletons, Hamilton, Brando and Ripley, so have hopefully gleaned some insights. I\u2019ve outlined some must-buys below, along with a few things I think can be safely avoided.</p> <p>One caveat: cats\u2019 taste in products is as diverse as people\u2019s and no matter how much you research, you will end up with some duds \u2013 especially when it comes to toys. But at the very least, you can guarantee they\u2019ll love the box in which they came.</p> <h2><strong>The best kit to get for your cat</strong></h2>    <h2><strong>A sturdy </strong><strong>crate</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Catit Cabrio transport box, \u00a3</strong><strong>40.</strong><strong>89</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/cats/cat_carriers_travel/plastic_cat_crates/large_crates/710027\"><sub>zooplus.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a337.49</strong><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catit-Cabrio-Carrier-Blue-Grey/dp/B07H8MYGB1/\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>I can\u2019t emphasise enough the importance of the word \u201csturdy\u201d and how buying anything less is a false economy. I made that mistake with my first cat, Humphries, who was what you\u2019d charitably describe as \u201chench\u201d but more accurately as \u201ca chubalub\u201d.</p> <p>On a routine trip to the vet, he burst from his cheapo carrier and ran down an alley. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t gifted with natural intelligence and arrived back through the cat flap just as I was about to call the vet to cancel the appointment.</p> <p>Cats usually hate carriers, so you want something secure but easy to carry. I upgraded to the Catit Cabrio, which opens from the top and the front so that even the most reluctant cat will get in eventually. It\u2019s also easy to clean and has built-in food trays you can fill from the outside.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Quality food</strong></h2>    <p><strong>KatKin, 14-day trial from about \u00a3</strong><strong>19</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.katkin.com/forms/fresh-new-user\"><sub>katkin.com</sub></a></p> <p>High-quality cat food can really perk up their demeanour, alertness and energy levels \u2013 especially in older moggies.</p> <p>The market is packed with choices for discerning cat parents, from <a href=\"https://untamed.com/\">Untamed</a> to <a href=\"https://marro.com/\">Marro</a>. But the one I\u2019ve tried and stuck with is <a href=\"https://www.katkin.com/\">KatKin</a>. The company uses only what it calls \u201chuman-quality meats\u201d (thankfully with the hyphen to avoid ambiguity) balanced by a certified vet nutritionist and portioned for your cat\u2019s dietary needs.</p> <p>I bought it specifically for Hamilton, who is elderly and has thyroid issues. The extra energy he now has is truly astonishing \u2013 and, to me, that\u2019s worth the added expense. Be warned, though, you need a huge amount of freezer space because it\u2019s made fresh and then frozen to maintain the nutrients. You defrost them as you go, with each portion lasting for up to five days in the fridge, so long as it\u2019s unopened.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>A microchip cat flap</strong></h2>    <p><strong>SureFlap cat flap, \u00a370</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4613345\"><sub>argos.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a369.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sure-Petcare-Microchip-Compatible-One-Button/dp/B003EGIM3O\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>Not all cats are let outside, and much online discourse argues that nor should they be, in line with American guidance on the matter.

Ideally, look for one that reads your pet\u2019s microchip to prevent furry intruders. </p> <p>Sure Petcare products are easy to use and install \u2013 although you\u2019ll need a glazier if you\u2019re installing the SureFlap cat flap in glass. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B071PDLN8L\">Connect version</a> records your cat\u2019s comings and goings in an app. Such data can be useful for tracking behavioural changes (sometimes a sign of medical problems), but you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sure-Petcare-iHBWT-SureFlap-Hub/dp/B072JFR3KH\">buy the adorable cat-eared hub too</a>, so it\u2019s a bit of an expense. You can get <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8702355\">cheaper models that respond to a magnetic key on your pet\u2019s collar</a>, but it\u2019s not without its risks, given that collars can slip off.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Entertaining toys</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Yeowww</strong><strong> banana cat toy, \u00a38<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.hugglepets.co.uk/product/yeowww-banana-with-catnip/\"><sub>hugglepets.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a35.85</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yeowww-Banana-Singles-Cat-Toy/dp/B000AUJFHE\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub></p>    <p><strong>3-in-1 cat dangler toy, \u00a32.49</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/cats/cat_toys/indoor/dangler/1298589\"><sub>zooplus.co.uk</sub></a><br><br></p> <p>More than anything else in this list, toy quality is subjective. Nonetheless, kickers and teasers have gone down well with most cats I\u2019ve met.</p> <p>Kickers \u2013 so named because the cats grab on to them and kick away \u2013 can energise even lazy cats, especially if they\u2019re packed with catnip. Anything Yeowww-branded is a winner, and this banana-shaped toy is so popular you can have replacements sent on a subscription.</p> <p>As for teasers, my superb cat sitter swears by this dangler that comes with three different heads and is affordable at just over \u00a32.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Good litter management</strong></h2>    <p><strong>LitterLocker, \u00a329.99</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/LitterLocker-Fashion-10400-Litter-Disposal/dp/B07G89MQVF\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>Let\u2019s not sugarcoat it: there\u2019s no way to make scooping litter trays fun. But you can minimise the unpleasantness of the worst chore of cat ownership, especially if your tray is far from the main bin.</p> <p>LitterLocker is essentially a small bin that lives next to the litter tray, but its cunning design makes maintenance easy and limits those truly heinous odours that leave you questioning how they came from such a tiny gut.</p> <p>Scoop the poop, drop it in the top segment and pull out the tray to ensure the waste drops into a neatly contained bag that can be tied up and disposed of when full.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Comprehensive pet insurance</strong></h2> <p>Take it from someone who has maxed out three annual insurance premiums over the years: cats can be expensive. Ripley recently needed a three-night stay in hospital, which cost more than \u00a32,000.</p> <p>It pays to have pet insurance. Yes, you\u2019ll still pay an excess, but it can make serious decisions about your cat\u2019s health significantly less stressful. <a href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/insurance/cut-pet-insurance-costs/\">Moneysavingexpert.com</a> is a good place to start researching the best insurance for your pets.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t want to do this, at the very least, put the money you would spend on pet insurance into an account for unexpected vet bills to insulate yourself from the worst shocks.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Moving water </strong><strong>for hydration</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Petkit cat water fountain, \u00a354.99</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/products/petkit-eversweet-solo-2-smart-water-fountain-white-10262750.html\"><sub>currys.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a355.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/PETKIT-Fountain-Wireless-Reminder-Drinking/dp/B0B3XN9972/\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a><br><br>Like most living things, cats need water.

      "bodyText": "Cats\u2019 stock may have fallen some way since being worshipped in ancient Egypt, but the domesticated kind still live pretty rarefied lives. Cat kit is big business, despite reassuringly few cats being trusted with credit cards of their own. But what do you actually need to keep your pet feline safe and happy? I live with three of the furry little simpletons, Hamilton, Brando and Ripley, so have hopefully gleaned some insights. I\u2019ve outlined some must-buys below, along with a few things I think can be safely avoided. One caveat: cats\u2019 taste in products is as diverse as people\u2019s and no matter how much you research, you will end up with some duds \u2013 especially when it comes to toys. But at the very least, you can guarantee they\u2019ll love the box in which they came. The best kit to get for your cat A sturdy crate Catit Cabrio transport box, \u00a340.89 zooplus.co.uk \u00a337.49 amazon.co.uk I can\u2019t emphasise enough the importance of the word \u201csturdy\u201d and how buying anything less is a false economy. I made that mistake with my first cat, Humphries, who was what you\u2019d charitably describe as \u201chench\u201d but more accurately as \u201ca chubalub\u201d. On a routine trip to the vet, he burst from his cheapo carrier and ran down an alley. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t gifted with natural intelligence and arrived back through the cat flap just as I was about to call the vet to cancel the appointment. Cats usually hate carriers, so you want something secure but easy to carry. I upgraded to the Catit Cabrio, which opens from the top and the front so that even the most reluctant cat will get in eventually. It\u2019s also easy to clean and has built-in food trays you can fill from the outside. *** Quality food KatKin, 14-day trial from about \u00a319 katkin.com High-quality cat food can really perk up their demeanour, alertness and energy levels \u2013 especially in older moggies. The market is packed with choices for discerning cat parents, from Untamed to Marro. But the one I\u2019ve tried and stuck with is KatKin. The company uses only what it calls \u201chuman-quality meats\u201d (thankfully with the hyphen to avoid ambiguity) balanced by a certified vet nutritionist and portioned for your cat\u2019s dietary needs. I bought it specifically for Hamilton, who is elderly and has thyroid issues. The extra energy he now has is truly astonishing \u2013 and, to me, that\u2019s worth the added expense. Be warned, though, you need a huge amount of freezer space because it\u2019s made fresh and then frozen to maintain the nutrients. You defrost them as you go, with each portion lasting for up to five days in the fridge, so long as it\u2019s unopened. *** A microchip cat flap SureFlap cat flap, \u00a370 argos.co.uk \u00a369.99 amazon.co.uk Not all cats are let outside, and much online discourse argues that nor should they be, in line with American guidance on the matter. However, the UK charity Cats Protection is of the view that, if possible, cats should be allowed outdoor time for \u201cmental stimulation, exercise\u201d and stress reduction. Unless you want to be constantly opening and closing the door for an indecisive animal, a cat flap is a must. Ideally, look for one that reads your pet\u2019s microchip to prevent furry intruders. Sure Petcare products are easy to use and install \u2013 although you\u2019ll need a glazier if you\u2019re installing the SureFlap cat flap in glass. The Connect version records your cat\u2019s comings and goings in an app. Such data can be useful for tracking behavioural changes (sometimes a sign of medical problems), but you\u2019ll need to buy the adorable cat-eared hub too, so it\u2019s a bit of an expense. You can get cheaper models that respond to a magnetic key on your pet\u2019s collar, but it\u2019s not without its risks, given that collars can slip off. *** Entertaining toys Yeowww banana cat toy, \u00a38 hugglepets.co.uk \u00a35.85 amazon.co.uk 3-in-1 cat dangler toy, \u00a32.49 zooplus.co.uk More than anything else in this list, toy quality is subjective. Nonetheless, kickers and teasers have gone down well with most cats I\u2019ve met. Kickers \u2013 so named because the cats grab on to them and kick away \u2013 can energise even lazy cats, especially if they\u2019re packed with catnip. Anything Yeowww-branded is a winner, and this banana-shaped toy is so popular you can have replacements sent on a subscription. As for teasers, my superb cat sitter swears by this dangler that comes with three different heads and is affordable at just over \u00a32. *** Good litter management LitterLocker, \u00a329.99 amazon.co.uk Let\u2019s not sugarcoat it: there\u2019s no way to make scooping litter trays fun. But you can minimise the unpleasantness of the worst chore of cat ownership, especially if your tray is far from the main bin. LitterLocker is essentially a small bin that lives next to the litter tray, but its cunning design makes maintenance easy and limits those truly heinous odours that leave you questioning how they came from such a tiny gut. Scoop the poop, drop it in the top segment and pull out the tray to ensure the waste drops into a neatly contained bag that can be tied up and disposed of when full. *** Comprehensive pet insurance Take it from someone who has maxed out three annual insurance premiums over the years: cats can be expensive. Ripley recently needed a three-night stay in hospital, which cost more than \u00a32,000. It pays to have pet insurance. Yes, you\u2019ll still pay an excess, but it can make serious decisions about your cat\u2019s health significantly less stressful. Moneysavingexpert.com is a good place to start researching the best insurance for your pets. If you don\u2019t want to do this, at the very least, put the money you would spend on pet insurance into an account for unexpected vet bills to insulate yourself from the worst shocks. *** Moving water for hydration Petkit cat water fountain, \u00a354.99 currys.co.uk \u00a355.99 amazon.co.uk Like most living things, cats need water. But many are known to neglect the tried-and-tested bowl of tap in favour of delicious-looking fetid puddles \u2013 far from ideal. Pet drinking fountains can up the appeal of tap water, though, plus they don\u2019t need to be refilled as frequently as bowls. The Petkit water fountain runs quietly enough for scaredy-cats and needs only to be topped up every eight to 10 days. It also has an app to track drinking habits, so you can watch for any behaviour changes. *** Quality pet bowls Ceefu elevated bowls, \u00a316.99 amazon.co.uk SureFeed microchip feeder, \u00a398 argos.co.uk \u00a3115 petsathome.com In case it doesn\u2019t go without saying, you want a bowl from which your cat likes to eat. That means wide and shallow, so the sides don\u2019t interfere with their whiskers, and raised for comfort. Metal and ceramic bowls are typically best because they\u2019re easy to clean, whereas plastic is thought to harbour bacteria that\u2019s been linked to feline acne. The elevated cat bowls from Ceefu tick the boxes and are dishwasher-safe. But a feeding system that locks to a certain microchip, like that from SureFeed (or the app-connected version), may better suit households with multiple cats to stop any greedy guts or bullies from stealing dinner. *** Lint rollers PetLovers extra-sticky lint roller, \u00a36.99 amazon.co.uk A sure-fire way to spot a cat person is the fur all over their clothes, but lint rollers can help make it less obvious. \u201cExtra sticky\u201d here is key, and the PetLovers lint roller does the job brilliantly. *** Holiday supervision Unlike dogs, cats will quite happily carry on their daily routine of sleeping and eating without human supervision for short periods. But if you\u2019re away for several days, you\u2019ll want a cat sitter for mental stimulation and general comfort. Cat in a Flat connects cat owners with sitters in their area. The idea of giving a stranger your house keys is undoubtedly scary, but the site makes it easy to browse reviews and pushes for a meet-up before the first unsupervised visit. The company\u2019s guarantee, which includes vet fee cover and lost key replacement, offers peace of mind. The local sitter I\u2019ve found through the site is always reliable (and has provided hundreds of photos and videos of playtime). *** Something to scratch (other than your sofa) Pets at Home Coco Haven cat tower, \u00a370 petsathome.com Trixie scratching board, \u00a37.95 amazon.co.uk \u00a39.79 tesco.com Ikea Uts\u00e5dd scratching mat, \u00a34 ikea.com Cats love few things more than scratching, and your soft furnishings are going to be tested at some point. But you can at least try to distract your cats with something that feels satisfying to destroy. I\u2019ll be honest: my cats have never shown the slightest interest in dedicated scratching posts, though I\u2019ve had some success using cat towers with a scratching area like the one above. For a cheaper option, the Trixie scratching board enriched with catnip gets good reviews from my cat-owning friends, and Ikea has just launched a rather neat wraparound scratcher that can be attached to table legs. *** Don\u2019t bother with \u2026 Robot litter trays They\u2019re expensive and have moving parts that a) may scare timid tabbies and b) could be prone to breaking.

The tractor used to pull the starting stalls off the track failed, and the gate was still in the middle of the home straight as the runners began to turn for home with their riders starting to stoke them up for the final run to the line.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/nov/08/one-horse-race-captain-teague-report-preview-tips\">It\u2019s a one-horse race at Exeter as only runner trots home alone to take prize</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is a tribute to the smart reactions and professionalism of all concerned \u2013 including the starter, who ran down the course with a warning flag to alert the jockeys on their way back around \u2013 that all nine managed to pull up before reaching the stalls.</p> \n<p>There was also a decent measure of good fortune involved. As Harry Davies, who turned in fifth aboard Intricacy, <a href=\"https://www.racingpost.com/news/britain/calls-made-for-changes-to-the-stop-race-protocol-in-wake-of-dangerous-stalls-incident-at-chelmsford-a4DU41b3ecNB/\">told the Racing Post</a>, \u201cthey were all good horses with good mouths who responded quickly to us. Younger or more inexperienced horses tend to run with their blood up and can\u2019t always be pulled up so quickly, so we were lucky in many ways.\u201d</p> \n<p>Alistair Rawlinson, who turned for home in second place, agreed. \u201cIt could have been a disaster,\u201d he told Racing TV. \u201cI was filling my lad up and I saw the starter, who had ran from the stalls, because there\u2019s been a problem, into the middle of the track. I saw the flag, looked up and the stalls were still there and let out a yell.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe did miraculously well to stop because there were some keen horses in there and we didn\u2019t go overly fast, so to stop that quick, the lads deserve a pat on the back.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1790c874-8e5c-4625-9857-ce1394d2dad3\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield</b> 11.35 Moon Over The Sea 12.05 Turner Girl 12.35 Al Shababi 1.05 Jet Black 1.37 Lady Dreamer 2.07 Meribella 2.40 Iken 3.15 Drifts Away 3.50 Phoenix Moon</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Bangor-On-Dee</b> 12.25 Heroique De Maulde 12.55 Shecouldbeanything 1.25 Celebre D\u2019Allen (nb) 1.55 Adaay Forever 2.25 Junker D\u2019Allier 3.00 Oh My Johnny 3.35 Lemoncello 4.05 Minella Rescue&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Ayr</b> 12.45 Kandor 1.15 Evaluation 1.45 Balranald 2.15 No Regrets 2.50 Fourofakind 3.25 Castle Carrock&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Southwell</b> 4.30 I Can Imagine 5.00 Aquacell 5.30 Grey Salvo 6.00 Primo Lara (nap) 6.30 Rose Light 7.00 Stroxx 7.30 Arc Zoosve 8.00 My Boy Jack 8.30 Irish Dancer</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So, a potential catastrophe was \u2013 narrowly \u2013 averted. But amid the relief, there were immediate questions as to how and why it had proved impossible to stop the race sooner. \u201cWe should have had more of a warning,\u201d jockey Marco Ghiani said. \u201cIn my opinion there should be a flag man in each corner of the track. If we were halfway down the back straight, we would have known and stopped more safely.\u201d</p> \n<p>The British Horseracing Authority is, as you would expect, inquiring into the circumstances surrounding Saturday\u2019s incident, but it seems that there was simply no time to get an official with a flag to the back stretch or far turn before the runners arrived. Thankfully, the starter had the presence of mind \u2013 and fleetness of foot \u2013 to get himself just far enough down the course to attract the riders\u2019 attention in time.</p> \n<p>But more generally, it also seems fair to wonder why the procedure for stopping a race still depends so heavily on people waving flags in the first place. In France, as the trainer Daniel Kubler pointed out, \u201cthey have sirens and flashing lights\u201d to alert riders that a race needs to be stopped. Had such a system been in place at Chelmsford \u2013 which is, in many respects, one of the most up-to-date tracks in the country \u2013 the field would probably have pulled up before halfway.</p> \n<p>There would, no doubt, be a significant cost attached to updating the systems \u2013 or, for that matter, to taking up Ghiani\u2019s suggestion of a flag official at each corner \u2013 while the precise issue encountered on Saturday is, admittedly, vanishingly rare. In a majority of Britain\u2019s 6,300 annual races on the Flat, after all, the field does not even return to its starting point.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a48b69d0-20fd-485d-ba67-bc343080a6a5\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sedgefield </b>12.05 Suitably Surprised 12.40 Malinka 1.15 Natural Ability 1.50 Winds Of Winter 2.25 Zwicky 3.00 Clean Getaway (nb)</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Market Rasen </b>12.20 Typhoon Flyer 12.55 Rula Bula 1.30 Kelce 2.05 Eyed 2.40 Bread And Butter 3.15 No Worries</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Taunton </b>12.30 Jet Of Dreams 1.05 American Land 1.40 Tuxedo Junction 2.15 Tout Sur Moi 2.50 School For Scandal (nap) 3.25 Linda Moon</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Chelmsford </b>5.00 Mrs Dowley 5.30 Needlepoint 6.00 Extrication 6.30 Cassandraalexandra 7.00 Kessaar Power 7.30 Fantasy Master 8.00 My Turn Now 8.30 Global Resolve</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But an urgent need to stop a race as swiftly as possible, perhaps for a reason that was impossible to foresee, is inevitable from time to time. Older readers, meanwhile, may recall that a failure of the flag system was a factor, at least, in the void Grand National in 1993, which was British racing\u2019s most devastating financial and PR disaster of recent decades.</p> \n<p>Thirty-one years later, it was still thanks in large part to an alert official with a flag that another potential calamity was narrowly avoided.

      "bodyText": "Racing came perilously close to a calamity on Saturday evening, and had events unfolded differently after nine runners set off for the most valuable race of the night at Chelmsford, this column might well have opened with the words \u201cRacing is still in shock \u2026\u201d instead. The start of the Essex track\u2019s 8.30 race was entirely unremarkable, but what happened next was, in the words of a racecourse spokesperson, \u201cunprecedented\u201d. The tractor used to pull the starting stalls off the track failed, and the gate was still in the middle of the home straight as the runners began to turn for home with their riders starting to stoke them up for the final run to the line. It is a tribute to the smart reactions and professionalism of all concerned \u2013 including the starter, who ran down the course with a warning flag to alert the jockeys on their way back around \u2013 that all nine managed to pull up before reaching the stalls. There was also a decent measure of good fortune involved. As Harry Davies, who turned in fifth aboard Intricacy, told the Racing Post, \u201cthey were all good horses with good mouths who responded quickly to us. Younger or more inexperienced horses tend to run with their blood up and can\u2019t always be pulled up so quickly, so we were lucky in many ways.\u201d Alistair Rawlinson, who turned for home in second place, agreed. \u201cIt could have been a disaster,\u201d he told Racing TV. \u201cI was filling my lad up and I saw the starter, who had ran from the stalls, because there\u2019s been a problem, into the middle of the track. I saw the flag, looked up and the stalls were still there and let out a yell. \u201cWe did miraculously well to stop because there were some keen horses in there and we didn\u2019t go overly fast, so to stop that quick, the lads deserve a pat on the back.\u201d So, a potential catastrophe was \u2013 narrowly \u2013 averted. But amid the relief, there were immediate questions as to how and why it had proved impossible to stop the race sooner. \u201cWe should have had more of a warning,\u201d jockey Marco Ghiani said. \u201cIn my opinion there should be a flag man in each corner of the track. If we were halfway down the back straight, we would have known and stopped more safely.\u201d The British Horseracing Authority is, as you would expect, inquiring into the circumstances surrounding Saturday\u2019s incident, but it seems that there was simply no time to get an official with a flag to the back stretch or far turn before the runners arrived. Thankfully, the starter had the presence of mind \u2013 and fleetness of foot \u2013 to get himself just far enough down the course to attract the riders\u2019 attention in time. But more generally, it also seems fair to wonder why the procedure for stopping a race still depends so heavily on people waving flags in the first place. In France, as the trainer Daniel Kubler pointed out, \u201cthey have sirens and flashing lights\u201d to alert riders that a race needs to be stopped. Had such a system been in place at Chelmsford \u2013 which is, in many respects, one of the most up-to-date tracks in the country \u2013 the field would probably have pulled up before halfway. There would, no doubt, be a significant cost attached to updating the systems \u2013 or, for that matter, to taking up Ghiani\u2019s suggestion of a flag official at each corner \u2013 while the precise issue encountered on Saturday is, admittedly, vanishingly rare. In a majority of Britain\u2019s 6,300 annual races on the Flat, after all, the field does not even return to its starting point. But an urgent need to stop a race as swiftly as possible, perhaps for a reason that was impossible to foresee, is inevitable from time to time. Older readers, meanwhile, may recall that a failure of the flag system was a factor, at least, in the void Grand National in 1993, which was British racing\u2019s most devastating financial and PR disaster of recent decades. Thirty-one years later, it was still thanks in large part to an alert official with a flag that another potential calamity was narrowly avoided. Next time around, we may not be so fortunate, and the high drama at Chelmsford on Saturday should surely be the moment when the sport finally brings its systems for stopping a race into the 21st century.",

      "bodyText": "Italian police have dismantled a Europe-wide forgery network suspected of producing sophisticated replicas of works by some of the world\u2019s most famous artists, including Banksy, Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Gustav Klimt. Thirty-eight people had been placed under investigation in Italy, Spain, France and Belgium on suspicion of conspiracy to handle stolen goods, forgery and illegal sale of artworks, Italy\u2019s art police and Pisa\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office said in a joint statement on Monday. The investigation began last year when Italy\u2019s art police seized 200 counterfeit pieces from the collection of a businessman in the Tuscan city of Pisa that included a copy of a drawing by the Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani. That discovery led investigators to uncover six forgery workshops, including two in Tuscany, one in Venice and three elsewhere in Europe. The suspects mostly produced copies of works by Warhol and Banksy before making agreements with various Italian auction houses. They even organised two Banksy exhibitions with a published catalogue in prestigious locations in Mestre, near Venice, and Cortona in Tuscany. In total, more than 2,100 fake works with a potential market value of about \u20ac200m (\u00a3165m) have been seized. \u201cThe activity carried out made it possible to shed light on a transnational system of forgers interconnected with compliant auction houses,\u201d said Teresa Angela Camelio, Pisa\u2019s chief prosecutor. Camelio said experts from the Banksy archive who had assisted with the investigation considered Monday\u2019s operation to be \u201cthe biggest act of protection of Banksy\u2019s work\u201d. Pest Control Office, the official body that represents the artist, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On its website, it says forgery is common and urges people who want to buy any Banksy pieces to watch out for \u201cexpensive fakes\u201d. Camelio said that if police had not uncovered the network, the artworks could have been sold at prices \u201cclose to the artists\u2019 original works\u201d, an eventuality that would \u201ccertainly have significantly changed the auction market\u201d. Other allegedly forged artists included giants of 19th- and 20th-century art such as Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Henry Moore, Joan Mir\u00f3, Giorgio de Chirico, Marc Chagall, Francis Bacon, Paul Klee and Piet Mondrian. Works by the Italian modernist Modigliani are especially vulnerable to counterfeits. In a separate case, a drawing attributed to the artist, which was about to be sold for \u20ac300,000, was seized by Venice authorities earlier this year after the city\u2019s cultural protection unit revealed it to be a fake. In 2017, police closed down a Modigliani exhibition in Genoa after an expert concluded at least 20 of the 21 paintings on display were fake. In 1984, three marble heads fished out of a canal in Livorno were hailed as long lost masterpieces by the artist, before it was discovered they were sculpted by three students as a prank.",

      "body": "<p>For 10 interminable seconds on Saturday night TV, the lights went out. Thankfully, it was deliberate. The Couple\u2019s Choice routine performed on Strictly Come Dancing by blind comedian Chris McCausland included a \u201cblackout moment\u201d, where he danced in the dark to immerse viewers in his sightless world. It was a powerful and poignant interlude which was hailed by the judges as \u201cabsolutely spectacular\u201d.</p> <p>This spine-tingling piece of television was reminiscent of the silent dance performed by actor Rose Ayling-Ellis, the show\u2019s first deaf participant, in 2021. That routine would be voted Bafta\u2019s Must-See Moment \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/15/strictly-come-dancing-all-time-top-20-moments\">as well as garnering a spot in our own hall of hoofing fame</a> \u2013 and Ayling-Ellis went on to lift the glitterball trophy.</p> <p>Well, we\u2019re calling it now. This year\u2019s grand final might be more than a month away but McCausland will do the same, dancing to victory on a wave of positivity.

There was even speculation that the current series might not go ahead at all. When it launched as planned in September, the field had a noticeable gender skew, with nine male celebrities but only six females \u2013 an indication that producers had found it harder than usual to cast women.</p> <p>Suddenly, all eyes were on the ballroom, alert for any sign of trouble. And then came the \u201chandgate\u201d incident between opera singer Wynne Evans and his dance partner Katya Jones, where she brushed his hand away as he put it around her waist, before snubbing his attempted high-five.

McCausland told me that blindness \u201cdoesn\u2019t so much heighten your other senses as make you pay more attention to them\u201d. He relies on hearing, touch and muscle memory to learn routines. Buswell has demonstrated patience and imagination when it comes to multisensory teaching techniques. She wore a blindfold in rehearsals to better appreciate what her partner faces.

He told Craig Revel Horwood: \u201cI\u2019ll drive you home tonight!\u201d He went hilariously off-script in the first live show, telling fellow contestant Dr Punam Krishan: \u201cNone of us can believe we\u2019ve got in the same room as a GP.\u201d</p> <p>The Liverpudlian comic is currently odds-on favourite to win with bookies.

McCausland has been proudly flying the flag, showing what\u2019s possible, defying stereotypes and changing conversations around disability. The Royal National Institute of Blind People has welcomed this, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant to see greater representation of people with disabilities on reality shows.

Love Island\u2019s Tasha Ghouri is the standout, although she falls into the category of \u201ctoo good\u201d, always a cardinal Strictly sin. Ghouri might be the contest\u2019s top scorer by far \u2013 averaging three points per dance more than anyone else \u2013 but she\u2019s unlikely to secure enough public votes. Miranda actor Sarah Hadland would also be a worthy winner in any other year.</p> <p>McCausland looks poised to beat both to the title. Like popular 2020 champion Bill Bailey, he\u2019s a middle-aged funnyman with innate musicality, impish humour and the underdog factor all wrapped up in one grin-inducing package. Just as Bailey\u2019s victory was a tonic during Covid lockdown, McCausland\u2019s win would come as welcome relief amid autumn\u2019s grim news cycle.</p> <p>Two-time finalist Buswell is also overdue a win. Having finished runner-up with previous partners Joe Sugg and Bobby Brazier, she would be a deserving pro champion. When she and McCausland lift the glitterball trophy on 14 December, as they surely will, it will provide a dose of sheer joy. The euphoria could help Strictly Come Dancing transcend the bullying allegations and restore its feelgood factor in its landmark 20th year. Not bad for \u201ca fella who sits on a stool for a living\u201d.</p>",

And honestly, in Trump\u2019s victory speech, he couldn\u2019t seem to believe it either.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver played a clip from Trump\u2019s characteristically rambling victory speech, in which he boasted: \u201cWe overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we\u2019ve achieved the most incredible political thing \u2026 Look what happened. Is this crazy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it is crazy,\u201d Oliver answered. \u201cIt\u2019s really fucking crazy. He\u2019s basically one sentence away from saying, \u2018I mean, you guys saw what I did, right? And you still voted for this. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI know being a shambling verbal mess is part of Trump\u2019s brand,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it is still incredible to see an incoming president ad-lib a victory speech with the same energy as the best man who didn\u2019t realize he had to give a toast.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/04/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-trump-greed\">John Oliver on Trump\u2019s businesses: \u2018Always operating at maximum greed\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oliver then looked into the blame game entertained by those disappointed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>\u2019s loss. \u201cPeople are pointing the finger in all directions, from Latino voters to young men to Joe Rogan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can basically play your own \u2018wheel of blame\u2019 and generally make sure it lands on whoever you were mad at in the first place. And I\u2019ll be honest, I get the appeal. It is fun to blame people.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt has been a rough week,\u201d said John Oliver on Sunday evening, days after the majority of American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term as president, \u201cwhich is, to put it mildly, not what I was personally hoping would happen. And honestly, in Trump\u2019s victory speech, he couldn\u2019t seem to believe it either.\u201d Oliver played a clip from Trump\u2019s characteristically rambling victory speech, in which he boasted: \u201cWe overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we\u2019ve achieved the most incredible political thing \u2026 Look what happened. Is this crazy?\u201d \u201cYeah, it is crazy,\u201d Oliver answered. \u201cIt\u2019s really fucking crazy. He\u2019s basically one sentence away from saying, \u2018I mean, you guys saw what I did, right? And you still voted for this. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019 \u201cI know being a shambling verbal mess is part of Trump\u2019s brand,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it is still incredible to see an incoming president ad-lib a victory speech with the same energy as the best man who didn\u2019t realize he had to give a toast.\u201d Oliver then looked into the blame game entertained by those disappointed by Kamala Harris\u2019s loss. \u201cPeople are pointing the finger in all directions, from Latino voters to young men to Joe Rogan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can basically play your own \u2018wheel of blame\u2019 and generally make sure it lands on whoever you were mad at in the first place. And I\u2019ll be honest, I get the appeal. It is fun to blame people. Trump was literally just elected president again on a platform of doing exactly that.\u201d Oliver jokingly blamed the election on Katy Perry, citing her performance at Harris\u2019s final rally on the eve of election day, where she covered Whitney Houston\u2019s 1986 classic The Greatest Love of All. \u201cWhy would you try to cover Whitney Houston?!\u201d he exclaimed, referring to the rendition as a \u201cdrunk bachelorette karaoke night performance\u201d.

They just can\u2019t help themselves, from the oligarch son-in-law of Kazakhstan\u2019s then president, who so obligingly paid \u00a33m over the asking price for the Duke of York\u2019s former marital home at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/how-the-kazakh-elite-put-its-wealth-into-uk-property\">Sunninghill Park</a>, to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who so famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/sarah-ferguson-will-ex-wife-continue-remain-steadfast-prince-andrew\">lent the duke\u2019s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson \u00a315,000</a> to help clear her debts. Even after King Charles stopped paying his security bills, Andrew is believed to have found what the royal journalist Robert Hardman\u2019s biography of the king delicately calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14030397/Charles-Andrews-cash-King-Harry-Meghan-revelations-book-Mail.html\">other sources of income</a>\u201d related to his contacts in international trade \u2013 a phrase that makes you long for the good old days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/11/monarchy.michaelellison#:~:text=The%20duchess%2C%20who%20went%20to,'t%20give%20up'.%22\">Fergie gamely doing WeightWatchers ads</a> to pay off her overdraft or Princess Anne\u2019s son-in-law <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/celebrity/article-11427007/Im-Celebrity-2022-Mike-Tindall-recalls-hilarious-moment-exposed-boxers-Princess-Anne.html\">going on I\u2019m A Celebrity</a> to discuss her reaction to his novelty boxer shorts.</p> <p>And now \u2013 what are the odds? \u2013 the duke has struck lucky just when he needed it most. A mystery benefactor will foot the bill for him <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/royal-family/article/prince-andrew-raises-enough-to-stay-royal-lodge-zlrl23flw\">to stay on at Royal Lodge</a>, the 30-bedroom pile in Windsor Great Park from which his older brother had been none too subtly trying to winkle him out, and which was the last remaining perk of what is no longer the forcibly retired Andrew\u2019s job.</p> <p>And no, don\u2019t be so impertinent: of course the duke will not be naming this public-spirited individual who has spared him the indignity of having to move into Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s old gaff <a href=\"https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/gallery/frogmore-cottage-prince-harry-meghan-markle-home\">Frogmore Cottage</a> (a measly five bedrooms plus yoga studio). Instead Michael Stevens, the keeper of the privy purse, has reportedly reviewed the arrangement and deemed it to be acceptable, which is the kind of total opacity around large donations to powerful public figures that I think we can all agree has worked out so magnificently in the past. And not just for Andrew, though the time he spent as a \u201ctrade envoy\u201d jetting around the world talking to rich people has long been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12663378\">the talk of the Foreign Office</a>, and his ability to maintain a royal-adjacent lifestyle on no discernible income (now that his brother has reportedly cut off his annual allowance) beyond a navy pension must be the envy of many a veteran.</p> <p>Back in the days when the king himself was just plain old Prince Charles, fundraising hard for his much-admired network of charities, a bit of old-fashioned discretion must also have seemed more appealing than the kind of undignified public fuss caused by Sunday newspaper reports about the prime minister of Qatar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/25/prince-charles-is-said-to-have-been-given-3m-in-qatari-cash\">handing him \u00a32.6m in cash</a> \u2013 some of it stuffed into Fortnum &amp; Mason carrier bags, as one does. (Though Clarence House stressed the money had been immediately passed on to one of the prince\u2019s charities, that didn\u2019t entirely answer the question for those whose concern was primarily about his impartiality when representing Britain on the world stage, not his bank balance.) At the time those reports surfaced, in 2022, the Metropolitan police had already been forced to launch an inquiry into separate claims that a former chief executive of the Prince\u2019s Foundation had allegedly offered to help secure honours and citizenship for a wealthy Saudi donor \u2013 though fortunately for all concerned, those inquiries ended with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/21/met-police-no-further-action-cash-for-honours-claims-king-charity-princes-foundation\">no action being taken</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2023/08/22/michael-fawcett-king-charles-right-hand-man-will-not-return/\">quiet severing of royal ties</a> with the faithful retainer concerned.</p> <p>Some might think the Duke of York a rather less attractive investment proposition these days, what with being first publicly tainted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/prince-andrew-a-timeline\">his association with Epstein</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/prince-andrew-to-step-back-from-public-duties-for-foreseeable-future\">stripped of his royal duties</a> after a ham-fisted attempt to explain it all to journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/emily-maitlis-prince-andrew-was-unleashed-he-wanted-to-tell-me-everything\">Emily Maitlis</a>. Bankrolling him at this stage in what\u2019s left of his career seems the very opposite of the sportswashing phenomenon that has seen China hosting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/sport-politics-and-covid-collide-at-the-beijing-winter-olympics\">reputation-laundering Winter Olympics</a><strong> </strong>or even the greenwashing of which the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/greta-thunberg-cop29-authoritarian-human-rights-azerbaijan-greenwashing\">oil-rich Azerbaijani regime</a> is accused now that it is hosting the Cop29 climate summit \u2013 arguably the last thing you\u2019re securing by keeping the Prince Andrew show on the road is a halo by association. Which raises the much more interesting question: what, exactly, are you getting instead?</p> <p>Perhaps we\u2019re all simply underestimating the personal charms of the monarch\u2019s younger brother, some of whose wealthy friends seem to have remained touchingly loyal even after he had to pay an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/his-final-disgrace-papers-prince-andrew-case-settlement\">estimated \u00a312m out-of-court settlement</a> in the civil case brought against him by Epstein trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre, with whom he has always denied having a sexual relationship. (Come to think of it, has it ever been entirely clear where that money was coming from?) But in a world awash with dirty cash and decidedly murky geopolitical interests, not to mention billionaires looking for back-door ways into the British establishment \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say parliament might like to make some urgent inquiries, and make them more strategically than usual.</p> <p>The mistake MPs have made in the past is to follow public money, demanding to know what taxpayers are being forced to spend on the royals\u2019 upkeep in a cost of living crisis, rather than following the strategic interest and asking who exactly is now bankrolling them instead. Maybe princes still believe in fairy godmothers waving a wand and magicking all their cares away. But the rest of us, sadly, are a bit too old for fairytales.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Back in the days when the king himself was just plain old Prince Charles, fundraising hard for his much-admired network of charities, a bit of old-fashioned discretion must also have seemed more appealing than the kind of undignified public fuss caused by Sunday newspaper reports about the prime minister of Qatar handing him \u00a32.6m in cash \u2013 some of it stuffed into Fortnum &amp; Mason carrier bags, as one does. (Though Clarence House stressed the money had been immediately passed on to one of the prince\u2019s charities, that didn\u2019t entirely answer the question for those whose concern was primarily about his impartiality when representing Britain on the world stage, not his bank balance.) At the time those reports surfaced, in 2022, the Metropolitan police had already been forced to launch an inquiry into separate claims that a former chief executive of the Prince\u2019s Foundation had allegedly offered to help secure honours and citizenship for a wealthy Saudi donor \u2013 though fortunately for all concerned, those inquiries ended with no action being taken and a quiet severing of royal ties with the faithful retainer concerned. Some might think the Duke of York a rather less attractive investment proposition these days, what with being first publicly tainted by his association with Epstein and then stripped of his royal duties after a ham-fisted attempt to explain it all to journalist Emily Maitlis. Bankrolling him at this stage in what\u2019s left of his career seems the very opposite of the sportswashing phenomenon that has seen China hosting a reputation-laundering Winter Olympics or even the greenwashing of which the oil-rich Azerbaijani regime is accused now that it is hosting the Cop29 climate summit \u2013 arguably the last thing you\u2019re securing by keeping the Prince Andrew show on the road is a halo by association. Which raises the much more interesting question: what, exactly, are you getting instead? Perhaps we\u2019re all simply underestimating the personal charms of the monarch\u2019s younger brother, some of whose wealthy friends seem to have remained touchingly loyal even after he had to pay an estimated \u00a312m out-of-court settlement in the civil case brought against him by Epstein trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre, with whom he has always denied having a sexual relationship. (Come to think of it, has it ever been entirely clear where that money was coming from?) But in a world awash with dirty cash and decidedly murky geopolitical interests, not to mention billionaires looking for back-door ways into the British establishment \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say parliament might like to make some urgent inquiries, and make them more strategically than usual. The mistake MPs have made in the past is to follow public money, demanding to know what taxpayers are being forced to spend on the royals\u2019 upkeep in a cost of living crisis, rather than following the strategic interest and asking who exactly is now bankrolling them instead. Maybe princes still believe in fairy godmothers waving a wand and magicking all their cares away. But the rest of us, sadly, are a bit too old for fairytales.

      "body": "<p>For almost two decades, Phil Elverum\u2019s life centred around performing and recording music. First as the Microphones and then as Mount Eerie, he had accumulated a catalogue of songs through which he made sense of his world, written with a diaristic honesty that won him a loyal following. But in July 2016, after the death of his wife, the cartoonist and musician Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e, a distraught Elverum began \u201crejecting my life\u2019s work\u201d and focused on single parenthood with their daughter, Agathe.</p> <p>From his home in Anacortes, Washington, Elverum reflects on those darkest days. \u201cGenevi\u00e8ve and I had both been artists, obsessed with our creative lives,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was our focus, our devotion, our identity. But when she died, I asked myself: why had drawing at a table 16 hours a day or making all these dinky little LPs been so important to us? I questioned the existential value of art and music and poetry. These had been my tools to understand life. But when Genevi\u00e8ve died, they felt useless to me.\u201d</p> <p>In the months that followed, Elverum wrote and recorded a pair of albums, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/mar/06/confessional-songs-songwriting-magnetic-fields-mount-eerie\">A Crow Looked at Me</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/15/mount-eerie-now-only-review\">Now Only</a>, that helped make some sense of this incalculable loss, that reconnected him with art, music and poetry. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/08/mount-eerie-with-julie-doiron-lost-wisdom-pt-2-review\">Lost Wisdom Pt 2</a> reckoned with his short-lived marriage to actor Michelle Williams. Now, he returns with Night Palace, one of his finest albums \u2013 a sprawling, diverse, ambitious and perhaps surprisingly political record he says marks \u201ca reset in my life\u201d. Restlessly shifting between buzzing, melodic indie-rock, ambient passages, intimate folk-rock and inchoate blasts of black metal to deliver what he describes as a \u201cmultitudinous\u201d sound, it finds Elverum \u201clooking outward \u2026 I didn\u2019t want \u2018Phil Elverum\u2019 to be a character in this record at all\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/7MrfHt0BhMpSDUocMjW0r9?si=11eXplnsR42LQ33uIO0d0Q\">  <iframe height=\"352\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7MrfHt0BhMpSDUocMjW0r9?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>  <p>Previously, he says, \u201call the songs I\u2019ve written have been about what it\u2019s like to be a human in the here and now, reckoning with this life\u201d. This album examines his home in Washington \u201cfrom poetic, metaphorical, almost spiritual perspectives\u201d, and confronts the violence done to Indigenous Americans. At one point he sings: \u201cThis America, the old idea, I want it to die \u2026 Let this old world shatter and reform.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cModern life is pretty alienated from our past, our history, the brutality that undergirds this system we\u2019re all benefiting from,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable truth to admit: massive genocide happened here.

But Elverum had no time to bask in Mount Eerie\u2019s critical acclaim; he left Olympia in the wake of its release, deciding he would \u201cmove to Norway forever, despite never even having visited Norway. An on-again, off-again relationship was torturing me, and something had to change.\u201d That Scandinavian winter, he put the Microphones to rest. \u201cI needed to keep moving forward,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get stagnant.\u201d</p> <p>His new vehicle, also called Mount Eerie, was experimental by design, its albums pursuing his every whim and concept \u2013 be that duetting with Julie Doiron from his beloved Eric\u2019s Trip (Lost Wisdom), or embracing synthesisers (Clear Moon) or Auto-Tune (Pre-Human), or reimagining black metal (the thrillingly maximalist Wind\u2019s Poem). He married Castr\u00e9e in 2004, and in 2015 Agathe was born. Shortly afterwards, however, Castr\u00e9e was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer; she died the following year.</p>    <p>In the immediate aftermath of this loss, Elverum felt aimless and bereft. \u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to write songs any more. I\u2019m not a musician. I\u2019m a parent, and that\u2019s it.\u2019 But it wasn\u2019t long before songs started coming to me, out of habit, with no thought of my releasing them. Even as I was recording them, I told myself, \u2018This is just for me.\u2019\u201d The songs addressed the loss of Castr\u00e9e with characteristic, unforgiving honesty; on Real Death, he sang that death was \u201cnot for singing about \u2026 when real death enters the room, all poetry is dumb\u201d. His family urged him to release these songs, but he remained hesitant. \u201cI felt exposed in a way I hadn\u2019t before, and that these songs were provocative, that maybe I would hurt people.\u201d</p> <p>Hurt who? \u201cStrangers. I was using blunt language and just, you know, <em>saying the thing</em>. I never said stuff like, \u2018She passed away.\u2019 I said, \u2018She died.\u2019 For me, it was appropriate and respectful to not skirt around or use euphemisms. But I was afraid of hurting people by being blunt in this realm where people prefer the opposite of bluntness. I had a nightmare where I sang these songs and some stranger stormed the stage and punched me in the face. But in fact, the opposite happened. Nobody punched me.\u201d</p> <p>Elverum\u2019s two albums responding to Castr\u00e9e\u2019s death \u2013 2017\u2019s A Crow Looked at Me and 2018\u2019s Now Only \u2013 were starkly powerful and incredibly moving; they were greeted with deserved acclaim. Furthermore, they reaffirmed Elverum\u2019s faith in his work. \u201cI had felt like art didn\u2019t help me,\u201d he says, \u201cbut once that first, reactive period of grief passed, having this creative pursuit to navigate meaninglessness <em>totally</em> helped. It healed me, nourished me.\u201d On his next album \u2013 2019\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/08/mount-eerie-with-julie-doiron-lost-wisdom-pt-2-review\">Lost Wisdom Pt 2</a>, another collaboration with Doiron \u2013 he \u201cdeliberately tried writing more poetically\u201d.

And now I know that it can\u2019t. It\u2019s still a little embarrassing in hindsight, just because of how painfully it ended, and how abruptly. The trauma from that lasted a weirdly long time. It seems like [losing Castr\u00e9e] should be a bigger trauma, but it didn\u2019t require as much therapy.\u201d</p> <p>He has since started a new relationship. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking recently with my partner,\u201d he says, \u201cabout the role of the past in one\u2019s present, and about moving forward.

After this unexpected final Microphones release, he \u201cfelt, conclusively, \u2018the line is drawn \u2013 I\u2019m freed from my past.

      "bodyText": "For almost two decades, Phil Elverum\u2019s life centred around performing and recording music. First as the Microphones and then as Mount Eerie, he had accumulated a catalogue of songs through which he made sense of his world, written with a diaristic honesty that won him a loyal following. But in July 2016, after the death of his wife, the cartoonist and musician Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e, a distraught Elverum began \u201crejecting my life\u2019s work\u201d and focused on single parenthood with their daughter, Agathe. From his home in Anacortes, Washington, Elverum reflects on those darkest days. \u201cGenevi\u00e8ve and I had both been artists, obsessed with our creative lives,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was our focus, our devotion, our identity. But when she died, I asked myself: why had drawing at a table 16 hours a day or making all these dinky little LPs been so important to us? I questioned the existential value of art and music and poetry. These had been my tools to understand life. But when Genevi\u00e8ve died, they felt useless to me.\u201d In the months that followed, Elverum wrote and recorded a pair of albums, A Crow Looked at Me and Now Only, that helped make some sense of this incalculable loss, that reconnected him with art, music and poetry. Lost Wisdom Pt 2 reckoned with his short-lived marriage to actor Michelle Williams. Now, he returns with Night Palace, one of his finest albums \u2013 a sprawling, diverse, ambitious and perhaps surprisingly political record he says marks \u201ca reset in my life\u201d. Restlessly shifting between buzzing, melodic indie-rock, ambient passages, intimate folk-rock and inchoate blasts of black metal to deliver what he describes as a \u201cmultitudinous\u201d sound, it finds Elverum \u201clooking outward \u2026 I didn\u2019t want \u2018Phil Elverum\u2019 to be a character in this record at all\u201d. Previously, he says, \u201call the songs I\u2019ve written have been about what it\u2019s like to be a human in the here and now, reckoning with this life\u201d. This album examines his home in Washington \u201cfrom poetic, metaphorical, almost spiritual perspectives\u201d, and confronts the violence done to Indigenous Americans. At one point he sings: \u201cThis America, the old idea, I want it to die \u2026 Let this old world shatter and reform.\u201d \u201cModern life is pretty alienated from our past, our history, the brutality that undergirds this system we\u2019re all benefiting from,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable truth to admit: massive genocide happened here. But there are so many delusions here. If I\u2019m to sing, to have a thing to say in this world, my ideal is that it diminishes delusions, it doesn\u2019t enable them.\u201d As a teenager, Elverum had a singular focus on music. He fell under the spell of Canadian group Eric\u2019s Trip, whose revelatory lo-fi jumble of indie-rock and acoustic experiments was, he says, \u201ca world of its own\u201d. Elverum wanted in to that world, and set up an old eight-track tape recorder in the back room of Anacortes record store The Business, whose owner was Bret Lunsford of indie legends Beat Happening. Late into the night, he composed his first cassette releases as the Microphones, \u201clayering feedback and loops, just seeing what sound could do\u201d. Elverum left Anacortes for Evergreen State College in Olympia in 1997 \u2013 where riot grrrl had been forged at the turn of the 90s \u2013 but got his true education at Dub Narcotic Studio as apprentice to Calvin Johnson, leader of Beat Happening and founder of K Records, and immersed himself in the art of production. Meanwhile, the Microphones were gathering low-key heat thanks to 2000\u2019s chaotic, lovelorn It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water and 2001\u2019s staggering, ambitious breakthrough The Glow Pt 2. He had developed a songwriting voice influenced by the \u201cunderground soap-opera\u201d storytelling of Eric\u2019s Trip; the \u201cgrounded, small-scale autobiography\u201d of independent comics creators Chester Brown, Julie Doucet and Joe Matt; and the radical honesty of Sebadoh\u2019s Lou Barlow. \u201cIt was about displaying your embarrassing fallibilities,\u201d he emphasises. \u201cAn expression of punk idealism: \u2018I\u2019m no phoney \u2013 this is the real me.\u2019\u201d The Glow Pt 2 was released on 11 September 2001, and Elverum promoted it with an inauspicious solo tour, \u201cthis weird, isolated odyssey across the southern states.

In an Australian-led study using seal-shaped decoys, underside lighting disrupted the ability of great whites to see silhouettes against the sunlight above, reducing the rates at which the sharks followed and attacked the artificial prey. The brighter the lights, the more effective the deterrent was. The study\u2019s lead author, Dr Laura Ryan of Macquarie University in Sydney, said white sharks seemed to rely on the visual cues of a dark object silhouetted against a lighter background. \u201cIf you flip that to a light object on a dark background, then it doesn\u2019t seem to be something they recognise as prey,\u201d she said. Ryan\u2019s previous research on great whites suggests that attacks on humans may be a case of mistaken identity. The animal has a far lower visual acuity \u2013 the ability to see shapes and details \u2013 than humans. Her work has suggested that juvenile great white sharks, from below, are unlikely to be able to clearly tell seals apart from swimmers or people paddling surfboards. Other research has shown that sharks are colour-blind or at best have only limited colour perception abilities. The new study, conducted in Mossel Bay, South Africa, involved towing decoys behind a boat for dozens of hours. The researchers initially found success by covering the underside of the decoy entirely in lights. \u201cBut if you\u2019re actually going to come up with something to protect people, [entirely] covering a surfboard \u2026 is just not practical because it\u2019s a huge amount of lighting, which needs a huge amount of battery power,\u201d Ryan said. The researchers experimented with more sparse lighting options, finding that horizontal stripes of LED lights had a similar deterrent effect. \u201cWhen you do horizontal stripes, the silhouette [appears] wider than it is long, so it\u2019s less like a seal,\u201d Ryan said. Longitudinal strips of light, however, were not effective, nor were strobe lights, which gave the sharks momentary glimpses of the decoy silhouette. \u201cInterestingly, just that small glimpse of the entire silhouette was enough for the white sharks to start biting the decoys,\u201d Ryan said. The scientists towed the seal decoy to encourage the white sharks to breach \u2013 one form of hunting involving rapid acceleration to the surface to catch prey.

      "body": "<p>\u2018People often don\u2019t get it,\u201d says Ritchie Neville. \u201cThey think being in a famous band is a dream. But I\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019m out with friends and, when I start talking, jaws drop to the floor. They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my god, is that really what it was like?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Neville was a member of mega boyband 5ive. Formed in 1997, the five-piece were famous for singles such as Got the Feelin\u2019, When the Lights Go Out and Slam Dunk (Da Funk). And Neville is one of many former boybanders taking part in a new documentary series about the era when ab flashes, knee slides and vocal harmonies ruled.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d spend a fortune on Gucci, Prada and Armani clothes \u2013 then give them away to the cleaners</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boybands Forever, made by Louis Theroux\u2019s production company Mindhouse<strong>,</strong> is a three-parter about the golden era of the manufactured group, taking us from Take That through to East 17, Boyzone, 911, Damage, Westlife and 5ive, all the way to Blue. Using archive footage of auditions, TV appearances and screaming fans, as well as interviews with everyone from Robbie Williams and Brian McFadden to Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh, it\u2019s both a total nostalgia-fest, full of juicy titbits from the era (did you know 5ive turned down Baby One More Time?) and a shocking indictment of the impact of fame on young stars.</p> <p>\u201cWhat surprised me,\u201d says Nancy Strang, the director of the documentary and Theroux\u2019s wife, \u201cwas just how hard they worked. It\u2019s the era before social media, when you had to be everywhere. You had to physically go places to be seen, or you had to physically go to an interview. It was 24/7 and relentless.\u201d</p>    <p>This was certainly true for Neville. He was just 17 when he was picked by Spice Girls creator Chris Herbert<strong> </strong>to be in 5ive, via auditions advertised in The Stage (Russell Brand also showed up). Styled as New Kids on the Block-lite, and signed to BMG<strong>, </strong>they were positioned as pop\u2019s bad boys, with a reputation for being unruly.</p> <p>\u201cThe amount of times,\u201d says Neville, \u201cI\u2019ve sat down with a journalist and they\u2019ve asked, \u2018Tell us the most messed-up drinking story you had.\u2019\u201d And there were a few. There was the time at Rock in Rio in Brazil where they \u201cgot absolutely smashed with Liam Gallagher\u201d. Another time, he says, \u201cwe got Westlife absolutely mashed, to the point that we were in a hotel room and they were, like, running and diving at the wall. We were supposed to be the bad boys but we were like, \u2018Oh no, what are they are doing?\u2019 Don\u2019t believe the good guy exterior!\u201d</p> <p>But while the band did get to do \u201csome fantastic things\u201d which Neville is grateful for, life in the group wasn\u2019t as fun as often made out. Famous within months of forming, they found this almost-instant fan reaction overwhelming. Footage in the documentary shows fans grabbing at the bandmates as they run from hotel to car. Neville remembers the first time fans gathered around the tour bus: \u201cIt was insane. There were 100-plus people surrounding the bus, banging on the thing. And there is no off switch.\u201d</p> <p>Some fans took things even further. He remembers one time, when he was 17 or 18, when a woman who looked like she was in her late 30s asked him for a picture. \u201cWhile we were doing the picture, she just grabbed me down there like it was perfectly normal. I was like, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019\u201d It became one of numerous occasions he was groped, he says, sometimes while performing. \u201cThe thing is, a lot of guys would be like, \u2018What I wouldn\u2019t give for that!\u2019 But it\u2019s not always pleasant, if you don\u2019t ask for it. It\u2019s like, \u2018Why are you doing that? Please don\u2019t do it again.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>It wasn\u2019t just fans, says Neville, who took advantage. He believes the band were exploited by those profiting from their success. Their schedule was relentless. They had just \u201ctwo days off in two years\u201d while starting out. And he says they were paid just \u00a3100 each a week to begin with, even after hit singles like<strong> </strong>Everybody Get Up<strong> </strong>had been released.</p> <p>Neville\u2019s lowest moment came while the band were touring Australia and New Zealand. He contracted chickenpox and was seriously unwell. Advised by a doctor to go home and rest at his parents for two weeks, he says he was then told by a label representative: \u201cDoctors over-exaggerate, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the end,\u201d he says, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t give me my passport to fly home.\u201d Fellow band member Scott Robinson decided to help out. \u201cScott had to go in and nick my passport and just hand it to me and bundle me in a taxi at four in the morning. At the time, I didn\u2019t think that much of it. Now, that\u2019s an encroachment of power, isn\u2019t it really? It\u2019s almost imprisonment.\u201d</p> <p>Lee Brennan, a member of earlier group 911, sees his time in the boyband bubble slightly differently. Formed in Glasgow in 1995, the trio \u2013 known for the body-pumping dance moves developed by members Jimmy Constable and Simon \u201cSpike\u201d Dawbarn during their time as dancers on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/the-hitman-and-her\">The Hitman and Her</a> \u2013 released singles including A Night to Remember. It was, says Brennan, a tough workload \u2013 \u201ca whirlwind of planes, hotels, gigs, press conferences\u201d \u2013 that meant he didn\u2019t have time to stop and enjoy the good times. \u201cWe were so tired and we didn\u2019t have a minute to think.\u201d He doesn\u2019t feel like it was the label exploiting him and bandmates, though. They were all just driven to become successful.</p>    <p>And they were \u2013 selling 10m singles worldwide. In the band\u2019s heyday, Brennan\u2019s lifestyle was one of first-class travel and shopping sprees. \u201cI didn\u2019t even check with my bank,\u201d says Brennan. \u201cI had a gold card. I\u2019d go to Bond Street and spend a fortune on Gucci, Prada and Armani. I\u2019d wear them a couple of times, then I\u2019d be like, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t be seen out in that again.\u2019 So I used to put them in black bin liners, or give them away to the cleaners.\u201d</p> <p>But being hounded by fans every day became hard to handle. Brennan remembers arriving at the BBC to do interviews and getting swarmed by fans in their thousands. \u201cIf anyone got a chance to rip a necklace off you, or a hat, it would be gone.\u201d Naturally shy, he didn\u2019t like getting recognised, especially when he got negative comments. \u201cIt was a weird thing to get my head around. It really messed with the way I saw myself.\u201d</p> <p>By 1999, he\u2019d had enough. \u201cI said to my management team, \u2018I\u2019m losing the plot. I\u2019m losing all recognition of who I am.\u2019 There was nothing done about that.\u201d He thinks the band could have benefited from more support. \u201cWe should have had more care, mental health-wise. Counsellors who could have been on the road and asked, \u2018How are you feeling? Are you missing things? Is it affecting you? Is the schedule too much? Are you sleeping?\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>Director Strang doesn\u2019t want the documentary to place blame on anyone in particular for what the boybands went through in the 1990s and 2000s. She stresses that many of the managers were as young as the performers themselves \u2013 and that the documentary is a celebration of their creativity as much as an expos\u00e9 of that era. Plus the media were just as exploitative. \u201cYou see women on TV asking inappropriate questions of teenage boys,\u201d Strang says of the archive footage. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe it\u2019s only 30 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>911 broke up in 2000 and 5ive broke up in 2001, but both have re-formed in recent years, with Neville and Brennan now enjoying doing things on their own terms. They hope their appearances in the documentary will push the industry forward when it comes to mental health care, or even just time off. \u201cThat level of fame, it can do so many good things for you, but can be really negative,\u201d says Brennan. They both support the Liam\u2019s Law petition, a plea to safeguard young stars\u2019 mental health that was started after former One Direction member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/nov/07/liam-payne-argentina-investigation\">Liam Payne fell to his death in Buenos Aires last month</a>, with multiple drugs in his system.</p> <p>\u201cI could not support that more,\u201d says Neville. \u201cYou have an affinity with people in bands. When One Direction took off, you couldn\u2019t help looking at them in the press and thinking, \u2018How are they doing?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He wants young people to have somebody independent they could call. \u201cSomeone they know who isn\u2019t going to go back to the label, to other people maybe in the band. They have no vested interest in your success. They\u2019re only there for your wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>Brennan agrees: \u201cI think the law change should have been done years ago. I hope this series will make things snowball, and people take notice. Record labels make a lot of money. It won\u2019t cost them that much to get somebody on the road to look after their product.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0jzf7zq/boybands-forever-boybands-forever\">Boybands Forever begins on BBC Two</a> on 16 November<br></p></li> </ul>",

Advised by a doctor to go home and rest at his parents for two weeks, he says he was then told by a label representative: \u201cDoctors over-exaggerate, don\u2019t they?\u201d \u201cIn the end,\u201d he says, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t give me my passport to fly home.\u201d Fellow band member Scott Robinson decided to help out. \u201cScott had to go in and nick my passport and just hand it to me and bundle me in a taxi at four in the morning. At the time, I didn\u2019t think that much of it. Now, that\u2019s an encroachment of power, isn\u2019t it really? It\u2019s almost imprisonment.\u201d Lee Brennan, a member of earlier group 911, sees his time in the boyband bubble slightly differently. Formed in Glasgow in 1995, the trio \u2013 known for the body-pumping dance moves developed by members Jimmy Constable and Simon \u201cSpike\u201d Dawbarn during their time as dancers on The Hitman and Her \u2013 released singles including A Night to Remember. It was, says Brennan, a tough workload \u2013 \u201ca whirlwind of planes, hotels, gigs, press conferences\u201d \u2013 that meant he didn\u2019t have time to stop and enjoy the good times. \u201cWe were so tired and we didn\u2019t have a minute to think.\u201d He doesn\u2019t feel like it was the label exploiting him and bandmates, though. They were all just driven to become successful. And they were \u2013 selling 10m singles worldwide. In the band\u2019s heyday, Brennan\u2019s lifestyle was one of first-class travel and shopping sprees. \u201cI didn\u2019t even check with my bank,\u201d says Brennan. \u201cI had a gold card. I\u2019d go to Bond Street and spend a fortune on Gucci, Prada and Armani. I\u2019d wear them a couple of times, then I\u2019d be like, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t be seen out in that again.\u2019 So I used to put them in black bin liners, or give them away to the cleaners.\u201d But being hounded by fans every day became hard to handle. Brennan remembers arriving at the BBC to do interviews and getting swarmed by fans in their thousands. \u201cIf anyone got a chance to rip a necklace off you, or a hat, it would be gone.\u201d Naturally shy, he didn\u2019t like getting recognised, especially when he got negative comments. \u201cIt was a weird thing to get my head around. It really messed with the way I saw myself.\u201d By 1999, he\u2019d had enough. \u201cI said to my management team, \u2018I\u2019m losing the plot. I\u2019m losing all recognition of who I am.\u2019 There was nothing done about that.\u201d He thinks the band could have benefited from more support. \u201cWe should have had more care, mental health-wise. Counsellors who could have been on the road and asked, \u2018How are you feeling? Are you missing things? Is it affecting you? Is the schedule too much? Are you sleeping?\u2019\u201d Director Strang doesn\u2019t want the documentary to place blame on anyone in particular for what the boybands went through in the 1990s and 2000s. She stresses that many of the managers were as young as the performers themselves \u2013 and that the documentary is a celebration of their creativity as much as an expos\u00e9 of that era. Plus the media were just as exploitative. \u201cYou see women on TV asking inappropriate questions of teenage boys,\u201d Strang says of the archive footage. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe it\u2019s only 30 years ago.\u201d 911 broke up in 2000 and 5ive broke up in 2001, but both have re-formed in recent years, with Neville and Brennan now enjoying doing things on their own terms. They hope their appearances in the documentary will push the industry forward when it comes to mental health care, or even just time off. \u201cThat level of fame, it can do so many good things for you, but can be really negative,\u201d says Brennan. They both support the Liam\u2019s Law petition, a plea to safeguard young stars\u2019 mental health that was started after former One Direction member Liam Payne fell to his death in Buenos Aires last month, with multiple drugs in his system. \u201cI could not support that more,\u201d says Neville. \u201cYou have an affinity with people in bands. When One Direction took off, you couldn\u2019t help looking at them in the press and thinking, \u2018How are they doing?\u2019\u201d He wants young people to have somebody independent they could call. \u201cSomeone they know who isn\u2019t going to go back to the label, to other people maybe in the band. They have no vested interest in your success. They\u2019re only there for your wellbeing.\u201d Brennan agrees: \u201cI think the law change should have been done years ago. I hope this series will make things snowball, and people take notice. Record labels make a lot of money. It won\u2019t cost them that much to get somebody on the road to look after their product.\u201d Boybands Forever begins on BBC Two on 16 November",

      "body": "<p>Stare at one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/article/2024/may/13/magdalene-odundo-review-houghton-hall-norfolk\">Magdalene Odundo</a>\u2019s vessels for long enough and you start to wonder if you might just have seen it breathe, its rounded belly imperceptibly expanding. The ceramic artist has often talked about the \u201cbody-ness\u201d, as she puts it, of her pots, but standing close to one is to be struck by how alive they feel. Her current London show at Thomas Dane Gallery, comprising six vessels, is Odundo\u2019s first solo exhibition in the capital for 20 years. It\u2019s a continuation of her show earlier this year at Houghton Hall, the stately home in Norfolk. Odundo has found new recognition in recent years \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/15/magdalene-odundo-the-journey-of-things-review-hepworth-wakefield\">a significant 2019 Hepworth Wakefield exhibition</a>, and she showed at this year\u2019s Venice Biennale. Her work set a new record price for a living ceramicist when one of her vessels sold for \u00a3200,000 in 2020, the same year she was made a dame.</p> <p>If Odundo\u2019s professional life is at a high, her personal life has been difficult in recent months, after a period of ill health, and recovery from surgery. It has been tough, she says, but adds with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m still standing \u2013 just about.\u201d Her mobility has been affected, and she thinks it will be another few months before she can get back to her clay. How is she coping? \u201cNot very well,\u201d she says with a smile \u2013 we\u2019re talking over Zoom, Odundo at home in Farnham, Surrey. Although she says she\u2019s tired, she laughs often.</p>    <p>Odundo\u2019s work is physical, lifting and manipulating the clay. \u201cIt is the contact with the material, the dialogue you have while you\u2019re making \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult to replace,\u201d she says. \u201cI can indulge in thinking, I can sketch, sit out and enjoy the shapes in the sky and the forms of trees and things like that. But until I transfer that energy into my material, I just feel lost.\u201d Still, she adds, one doctor said that her desperation to get back to work will probably help her recovery. Maybe it will change her work, I say. \u201cYou mean start trampling on it and making \u2018art\u2019?\u201d She laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be interesting. I have tried it before, it didn\u2019t work with me.\u201d Of course not \u2013 Odundo\u2019s work is too exquisite for such silliness.</p> <p>At Houghton Hall, where she was both the first Black artist and the first woman to have an exhibition, her vessels held their own in an English stately home, surrounded by ancestral images of powerful white men. One piece came out of Odundo\u2019s residency at Wedgwood \u2013 a towering sculpture featuring imagery of enslaved people, as well as contemporary protests in Kenya, inspired by the link between founder <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Josiah-Wedgwood\">Josiah Wedgwood</a> and anti-slavery campaigner <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Olaudah-Equiano\">Olaudah Equiano</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do semi-political or a kind of civic, social piece of work,\u201d says Odundo.</p> <p>At her London show, her vessels look both organic and otherworldly. Never have I wanted to touch an exhibition piece more. Does the feel of the pieces change according to where they are? \u201cI think to a certain extent, the spirit \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cI want to say dynamics, or the essence, and the body language \u2013 my work is very bodily orientated \u2013 changes a bit.\u201d In museums, \u201cyou\u2019re coming across other associations and so there\u2019s a comparative nature to settings like that.\u201d In a solo show, \u201cthe work has to have meaning, has to transmit, translate and narrate on its own. It\u2019s like a dancer being left on stage to do their solo, and they\u2019re pirouetting.\u201d</p> <p>Odundo, 74, has been revered for many years \u2013 she has influenced many younger artists, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/oct/21/theaster-gates-interview-whitechapel-gallery-white-cube\">Theaster Gates</a>, and fashion designers such as Loewe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/feb/18/jw-anderson-show-highlights-designers-love-of-craft-at-london-fashion-week\">Jonathan Anderson</a> \u2013 but she is now getting more mainstream recognition. How does that feel? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say, because I\u2019ve always worked very quietly and sort of singly.\u201d She has never shared a studio, she points out. Showing in the mid-1980s gave her the confidence, she says, to focus on the work, and not who might want to buy it. \u201cOf course, I wanted the work to be bought, I wanted great collectors and great museums to have it. But I think if I had concentrated on that, I would be making perhaps what <a href=\"https://www.oxfordceramics.com/historic-draft/Michael-cardew/\">Michael Cardew</a> [the eminent potter, who was one of Odundo\u2019s teachers] used to call things other people want and not what you have trained for. I\u2019ve taken the fact that I\u2019ve been able to live off my work for all these years as an endorsement of my convictions, and a testament of staying true to who you are.\u201d</p>    <p>Odundo was born in Kenya, but spent part of her childhood in Delhi, where her father was a journalist. Later, back in Kenya, still then under British rule, \u201cthe schools were very oriented to apartheid and for most Africans, there wasn\u2019t an opportunity to be in well-endowed schools. We were taught needlework because it was thought that we\u2019d end up being housemaids. So it was a very unequal education.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Odundo was 10, her mother, father, andyounger sister, one of several siblings, had all died. \u201cSo it was a devastating time.\u201d Looking back, she says, it almost feels more devastating now. \u201cAs kids, we just had to survive. I think the most difficult bit was that we were separated because we couldn\u2019t be kept together.\u201d Odundo was sent to live with relatives in Mombasa. At secondary school, taught by nuns, one teacher realised Odundo had a talent for drawing, \u201cso she made me sit in the biology room on weekends to draw charts for her.\u201d The nun would sometimes take her to galleries in Nairobi. \u201cI think it was to keep me out of trouble,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI was near being expelled several times. She must have understood me.\u201d</p> <p>In Kenya, Odundo\u2019s art career started in design for advertising, which she didn\u2019t love: \u201cYou had to sell soap to poor people who couldn\u2019t afford soap.\u201d Moving to the UK in 1971, for a foundation course at the Cambridge School of Art, Odundo discovered ceramics and found herself so engaged that she would lose all sense of time. \u201cThey used to have to chuck me out of the studio.\u201d She went on to study at what is now the University for the Creative Arts (later she would be a professor there for many years), studied traditional techniques in Nigeria and Kenya, and did a master\u2019s at the Royal College of Art.</p>    <p>As a child, in her colonial education, she had been taught that art originating from her continent was \u201cprimitive\u201d. Things hadn\u2019t changed that much in the 1980s and 90s. Did she get the impression that people in the art world were trying to marginalise her work? \u201cThey tried, but I think it\u2019s been impossible for them,\u201d she says. Much of her inspiration has come from her wide-ranging travels and influences, her childhood not just in Kenya but in India too. \u201cMy parents, even though [time with them] was short, they instilled in us an expansiveness in our thinking and a spirituality that lends itself to a perception that we are part and parcel of humanity.\u201d</p> <p>She has often talked about the importance of the interiors of her pots, and how it is just as vital to her as the burnished lustre of their exteriors. \u201cWho we are is defined by what is inside. It\u2019s that spirit that is of interest to me.\u201d She enjoys the fact that her art connects her to millennia of humans who have made clay vessels, and beautiful ones too. \u201cA cooking pot is there not just to contain nourishment. People have always made beautiful pots to enhance that humanity. People want to eat and cook from beautiful vessels, because all these activities \u2013 cooking, prayer, meditation \u2013 are associated with the inner part of ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Odundo says she has a general idea of what a vessel will look like, once finished, because she will have sketched it, but foremost in mind is an idea of what \u201cmovement\u201d she is aiming for, an inspiration regularly taken from life. \u201cIt might be somebody I saw in the supermarket holding a basket in a certain way. Or a kid riding their scooter, a leg flying this or that way, and it\u2019s that space that they create that I might want to shape.\u201d Then it\u2019s a relationship with the clay, \u201cand what I\u2019m feeling at that particular time\u201d that shapes the piece. She likens it to poetry, \u201cwhere you can work it and rework it.\u201d But ultimately, she says, \u201cit\u2019s that search of simplicity of form that dictates what I make.\u201d</p> <p>Does she know when it\u2019s finished? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always had to compromise, and maybe that\u2019s what allows me to continue making \u2013 because I know I haven\u2019t finished that last piece.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/\">Magdalene Odundo is at Thomas Dane Gallery, London SW1, until 14 December</a></p>",

People want to eat and cook from beautiful vessels, because all these activities \u2013 cooking, prayer, meditation \u2013 are associated with the inner part of ourselves.\u201d Odundo says she has a general idea of what a vessel will look like, once finished, because she will have sketched it, but foremost in mind is an idea of what \u201cmovement\u201d she is aiming for, an inspiration regularly taken from life. \u201cIt might be somebody I saw in the supermarket holding a basket in a certain way. Or a kid riding their scooter, a leg flying this or that way, and it\u2019s that space that they create that I might want to shape.\u201d Then it\u2019s a relationship with the clay, \u201cand what I\u2019m feeling at that particular time\u201d that shapes the piece. She likens it to poetry, \u201cwhere you can work it and rework it.\u201d But ultimately, she says, \u201cit\u2019s that search of simplicity of form that dictates what I make.\u201d Does she know when it\u2019s finished? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always had to compromise, and maybe that\u2019s what allows me to continue making \u2013 because I know I haven\u2019t finished that last piece.\u201d \u2022 Magdalene Odundo is at Thomas Dane Gallery, London SW1, until 14 December",

      "body": "<p>The danger is always of overreacting. We\u2019ve seen Manchester City have a blip at this stage of the season before. But still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/brighton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">defeat to Brighton on Saturday</a> means that, for the first time in his career as a manager, Pep Guardiola has lost four successive games. It would be extremely premature to suggest the empire is crumbling but, equally, for the first time in a long time there is a sense that City\u2019s aura may be beginning to wane.</p> <p>But first, some context. One defeat was in the Carabao Cup and another was in the Champions League, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_UEFA_Champions_League#League_phase\">where City sit 10th in the table</a>; even if they do miss out on the top eight who go through to the last 16 automatically \u2013 they have Feyenoord (home), Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain (away) and Club Brugge (home) next \u2013 they will surely at the very least be in the play-offs. But two of the recent defeats were in the Premier League, away at Bournemouth and then Brighton, and as a result City <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table\">sit five points behind Liverpool</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/11/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not unusual for City to have a slight wobble at this stage of the season. Guardiola likes his teams to peak in March and April, when the critical games come around in Europe, which is why the characteristic pattern of City\u2019s title successes is of them putting the burners on in the spring and either overhauling a challenger or pulling away from the pack. That means that occasionally they are not quite at their best in the autumn, and there\u2019s perhaps also a sense now of Guardiola working out how best to deploy his resources, developing his tweaks and innovations for the season.</p> <p>It was at just this point of last season that they had a rough patch, a run of six Premier League games in which their only victory was an unconvincing 2-1 win at Luton. After the last match of that run, a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace, City had 34 points from 17 games. This season, they have 23 points from 11 games. Which is to say that the likelihood is that at the halfway mark of the Premier League season, 19 games, it\u2019s entirely probable they will have roughly the 40 points they had last year. Perhaps Arne Slot\u2019s Liverpool, who went five points clear with Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win over Aston Villa, are more formidable rivals than Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal were \u2013 City\u2019s visit to Anfield on 1 December should give a clearer indication \u2013 but in terms of their own numbers, there is no reason for City to panic.</p> <p>Nor have the performances been terrible. City were the better side in the first half against Sporting and Brighton and could easily have been a couple of goals up at the break in each. On another day their late surges against Bournemouth and Tottenham would have brought equalisers. But the point is that suddenly they look vulnerable.</p> <p>Guardiola has been around long enough that the flaws in his sides have become familiar. He favours a high line that means if the press goes awry his teams can often be undone by simple balls in behind the defensive line. That\u2019s why he spends so much time focusing on control and on not giving the ball away in situations that could lead to a counter. And the press at the moment, perhaps largely because of the absence of Rodri, is not functioning perfectly. Injuries should never be an excuse \u2013 the very best sides don\u2019t dwell on absences but find a way to deal with them \u2013 but it is perhaps an explanation. Injuries more generally have clearly played a part. Kevin De Bruyne is just returning, R\u00faben Dias and John Stones are missing at the back, and the absence of Jack Grealish, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku and Oscar Bobb has reduced their creativity.</p> <p>When things go wrong for Guardiola sides, they have a tendency to concede goals in sudden bursts \u2013 as though the way players have to subjugate themselves to the demands of the system means there is nobody with the personality to step up and seize a game when that system is threatened. Against Sporting, two goals were conceded in three minutes; against Brighton it was two in five. Rodri, like Vincent Kompany before him, was perhaps leader enough to prevent that glitching of the mechanisms; in that aspect as well, he is missed.</p> <p>But this side are also struggling in unfamiliar ways. Kyle Walker, whose pace has been such an asset over his career, suddenly looks, if not slow, then at least not what he was. It may be a fitness issue but, equally, it may just be that, at 34, age is beginning to sap him. And then there is the more general issue of fatigue, which Guardiola has begun to talk openly about. Almost all elite players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/the-overstuffed-football-calendar-is-reducing-quality-but-increasing-drama\">are playing too much</a>, but perhaps they feel it more when they have already achieved so much. Maintaining the hunger is one of the great challenges for successful managers. And who knows what impact <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-manchester-citys-hearing-and-charges\">the Premier League charges against City</a> have had?</p> <p>It was a run of two wins in seven games at this stage five years ago that gave the first clue City would cede the league title to Liverpool, but that is the only time Guardiola hasn\u2019t found a way to come back. He may do so again but dragging City back from here may be his greatest challenge.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/sign-up-for-soccer-with-jonathan-wilson-his-free-weekly-newsletter-on-european-soccer\">Subscribe for free here.</a> </strong>Have a question for Jonathan?

      "bodyText": "The danger is always of overreacting. We\u2019ve seen Manchester City have a blip at this stage of the season before. But still, defeat to Brighton on Saturday means that, for the first time in his career as a manager, Pep Guardiola has lost four successive games. It would be extremely premature to suggest the empire is crumbling but, equally, for the first time in a long time there is a sense that City\u2019s aura may be beginning to wane. But first, some context. One defeat was in the Carabao Cup and another was in the Champions League, where City sit 10th in the table; even if they do miss out on the top eight who go through to the last 16 automatically \u2013 they have Feyenoord (home), Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain (away) and Club Brugge (home) next \u2013 they will surely at the very least be in the play-offs. But two of the recent defeats were in the Premier League, away at Bournemouth and then Brighton, and as a result City sit five points behind Liverpool. It\u2019s not unusual for City to have a slight wobble at this stage of the season. Guardiola likes his teams to peak in March and April, when the critical games come around in Europe, which is why the characteristic pattern of City\u2019s title successes is of them putting the burners on in the spring and either overhauling a challenger or pulling away from the pack. That means that occasionally they are not quite at their best in the autumn, and there\u2019s perhaps also a sense now of Guardiola working out how best to deploy his resources, developing his tweaks and innovations for the season. It was at just this point of last season that they had a rough patch, a run of six Premier League games in which their only victory was an unconvincing 2-1 win at Luton. After the last match of that run, a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace, City had 34 points from 17 games. This season, they have 23 points from 11 games. Which is to say that the likelihood is that at the halfway mark of the Premier League season, 19 games, it\u2019s entirely probable they will have roughly the 40 points they had last year. Perhaps Arne Slot\u2019s Liverpool, who went five points clear with Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win over Aston Villa, are more formidable rivals than Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal were \u2013 City\u2019s visit to Anfield on 1 December should give a clearer indication \u2013 but in terms of their own numbers, there is no reason for City to panic. Nor have the performances been terrible. City were the better side in the first half against Sporting and Brighton and could easily have been a couple of goals up at the break in each. On another day their late surges against Bournemouth and Tottenham would have brought equalisers. But the point is that suddenly they look vulnerable. Guardiola has been around long enough that the flaws in his sides have become familiar. He favours a high line that means if the press goes awry his teams can often be undone by simple balls in behind the defensive line. That\u2019s why he spends so much time focusing on control and on not giving the ball away in situations that could lead to a counter. And the press at the moment, perhaps largely because of the absence of Rodri, is not functioning perfectly. Injuries should never be an excuse \u2013 the very best sides don\u2019t dwell on absences but find a way to deal with them \u2013 but it is perhaps an explanation. Injuries more generally have clearly played a part. Kevin De Bruyne is just returning, R\u00faben Dias and John Stones are missing at the back, and the absence of Jack Grealish, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku and Oscar Bobb has reduced their creativity. When things go wrong for Guardiola sides, they have a tendency to concede goals in sudden bursts \u2013 as though the way players have to subjugate themselves to the demands of the system means there is nobody with the personality to step up and seize a game when that system is threatened. Against Sporting, two goals were conceded in three minutes; against Brighton it was two in five. Rodri, like Vincent Kompany before him, was perhaps leader enough to prevent that glitching of the mechanisms; in that aspect as well, he is missed. But this side are also struggling in unfamiliar ways. Kyle Walker, whose pace has been such an asset over his career, suddenly looks, if not slow, then at least not what he was. It may be a fitness issue but, equally, it may just be that, at 34, age is beginning to sap him. And then there is the more general issue of fatigue, which Guardiola has begun to talk openly about. Almost all elite players are playing too much, but perhaps they feel it more when they have already achieved so much. Maintaining the hunger is one of the great challenges for successful managers. And who knows what impact the Premier League charges against City have had? It was a run of two wins in seven games at this stage five years ago that gave the first clue City would cede the league title to Liverpool, but that is the only time Guardiola hasn\u2019t found a way to come back. He may do so again but dragging City back from here may be his greatest challenge.

      "body": "<p>Nearly three years ago, I started working on an idea for a book. It started out with the pretty mild proposition: we\u2019re in a class war, but it\u2019s a weird one, because one side is curiously coy. The capital class used to strut its stuff. It used to build libraries and great estates; it used to tell you it thought it was superior, and why. Now that it is billionaires on one side and everyone else on the other, they are like ghosts. They might tell you what they think, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/23/ted-talk-smugness-presenters-embarrassing\">Ted Talks,</a> at Davos, but it can\u2019t be real: according to them, all they care about is fixing climate change, solving inequality and bringing about world peace. Mysteriously, none of those things ever come about.</p> <p>I dragged my feet a little bit, and while I did so, the billionaires got louder, and maybe truer to their authentic selves. Vladimir Putin, estimated to be worth billions, invaded Ukraine. Elon Musk bought Twitter. Sam Bankman-Fried got outed as not-a-billionaire \u2013 the billions turned out to either belong to someone else, be fictional, be priced in crypto, or all three \u2013 and a lot of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/21/sam-bankman-fried-nauru-bunker-ftx\">fantasies for the future</a> came tumbling out in the same legal proceedings: a plan, stated in a memo, to purchase the sovereign nation of Nauru in order to construct a \u201cbunker/shelter\u201d that would be used for \u201csome event where 50%-99.99% of people die [to] ensure that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/16/is-the-effective-altruism-movement-in-trouble\">most EAs [effective altruists] survive\u201d</a> and to develop \u201csensible regulation around human genetic enhancement, and build a lab there\u201d.</p> <p>This same memo noted that \u201cprobably there are other things it\u2019s useful to do with a sovereign country, too\u201d. It distilled in a single paragraph the mind-map of the billionaire class: apocalypse fantasies and bunker futures; a fervent belief in their own, gene-level superiority; a hatred of any sovereignty higher than theirs; and an almost childlike lack of self-reflection, to the extent that you would call yourself an \u201ceffective altruist\u201d just by dint of having fictionalised enough net worth to potentially help others, while simultaneously planning for a future in which all the others have perished.</p> <p>It turned out a lot of billionaires had a plan for that event where 50-99.99% of us all died. An awesome number of them had a private island, or were looking for one. The OpenAI chief Sam Altman and the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel were gonna split to New Zealand and go halvsies on a bunker. The Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa was by no means the only \u201chigh net worth individual\u201d trying to shoot himself into space, though he was the only one who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vedOEzUZKWI\">went on YouTube</a> to describe his exploratory trip, rumoured to have cost $80m (\u00a362m), to the International Space Station.</p> <p>\u201cI did not get aroused whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you wake up in the morning, it\u2019s quite normal for us men to have a happy manhood.\u201d But in two weeks on the ISS, \u201cnot even once did my manhood greet me with energy\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>What they\u2019re trying to escape is civilisation, the rule of law, other people. They\u2019re trying to escape us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More predictably, and to make matters worse, the lack of gravity made his penis float upwards, causing a perspective disturbance that \u201cmade it look like a child\u2019s \u2026 I didn\u2019t feel confident about my manhood in space,\u201d he concluded.</p> <p>What\u2019s it to you, whether or not a billionaire can get an erection in space? Childlike lack of self-reflection, again. Between that and the coming apocalypse, the bunkers, the private islands, the space exploration, the dreams of colonising the sea and living on it, and the land wars, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that what they\u2019re trying to escape is civilisation, the rule of law, other people \u2013 bluntly, us. They\u2019re trying to escape us.</p> <p>When you add in their dreams of living for ever, of siring scores of children, the picture is even clearer: they <em>hate </em>us. They\u2019re not neutral about us; we\u2019re not mere flies on their windscreen. They think any one of them, living to be 700, is worth an infinite number of us in our prime. They think their children are more precious than our children. Who knows, maybe some billionaires don\u2019t hate us or fantasise about our annihilation. But even one should be a red flag.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/31/elon-musk-an-excess-of-billionaires-is-destabilising-politics-just-as-academics-predicted\">An excess of billionaires is destabilising politics \u2013 just as academics predicted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then on 6 November, I realised the ship had sailed. This is an open secret now. The whole world has watched Musk seize a mature democracy, and you can see he hates us with one look at his face.

      "bodyText": "Nearly three years ago, I started working on an idea for a book. It started out with the pretty mild proposition: we\u2019re in a class war, but it\u2019s a weird one, because one side is curiously coy. The capital class used to strut its stuff. It used to build libraries and great estates; it used to tell you it thought it was superior, and why. Now that it is billionaires on one side and everyone else on the other, they are like ghosts. They might tell you what they think, in Ted Talks, at Davos, but it can\u2019t be real: according to them, all they care about is fixing climate change, solving inequality and bringing about world peace. Mysteriously, none of those things ever come about. I dragged my feet a little bit, and while I did so, the billionaires got louder, and maybe truer to their authentic selves. Vladimir Putin, estimated to be worth billions, invaded Ukraine. Elon Musk bought Twitter. Sam Bankman-Fried got outed as not-a-billionaire \u2013 the billions turned out to either belong to someone else, be fictional, be priced in crypto, or all three \u2013 and a lot of his fantasies for the future came tumbling out in the same legal proceedings: a plan, stated in a memo, to purchase the sovereign nation of Nauru in order to construct a \u201cbunker/shelter\u201d that would be used for \u201csome event where 50%-99.99% of people die [to] ensure that most EAs [effective altruists] survive\u201d and to develop \u201csensible regulation around human genetic enhancement, and build a lab there\u201d. This same memo noted that \u201cprobably there are other things it\u2019s useful to do with a sovereign country, too\u201d. It distilled in a single paragraph the mind-map of the billionaire class: apocalypse fantasies and bunker futures; a fervent belief in their own, gene-level superiority; a hatred of any sovereignty higher than theirs; and an almost childlike lack of self-reflection, to the extent that you would call yourself an \u201ceffective altruist\u201d just by dint of having fictionalised enough net worth to potentially help others, while simultaneously planning for a future in which all the others have perished. It turned out a lot of billionaires had a plan for that event where 50-99.99% of us all died. An awesome number of them had a private island, or were looking for one. The OpenAI chief Sam Altman and the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel were gonna split to New Zealand and go halvsies on a bunker. The Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa was by no means the only \u201chigh net worth individual\u201d trying to shoot himself into space, though he was the only one who went on YouTube to describe his exploratory trip, rumoured to have cost $80m (\u00a362m), to the International Space Station. \u201cI did not get aroused whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you wake up in the morning, it\u2019s quite normal for us men to have a happy manhood.\u201d But in two weeks on the ISS, \u201cnot even once did my manhood greet me with energy\u201d. More predictably, and to make matters worse, the lack of gravity made his penis float upwards, causing a perspective disturbance that \u201cmade it look like a child\u2019s \u2026 I didn\u2019t feel confident about my manhood in space,\u201d he concluded. What\u2019s it to you, whether or not a billionaire can get an erection in space? Childlike lack of self-reflection, again. Between that and the coming apocalypse, the bunkers, the private islands, the space exploration, the dreams of colonising the sea and living on it, and the land wars, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that what they\u2019re trying to escape is civilisation, the rule of law, other people \u2013 bluntly, us. They\u2019re trying to escape us. When you add in their dreams of living for ever, of siring scores of children, the picture is even clearer: they hate us. They\u2019re not neutral about us; we\u2019re not mere flies on their windscreen. They think any one of them, living to be 700, is worth an infinite number of us in our prime. They think their children are more precious than our children. Who knows, maybe some billionaires don\u2019t hate us or fantasise about our annihilation. But even one should be a red flag. Then on 6 November, I realised the ship had sailed. This is an open secret now. The whole world has watched Musk seize a mature democracy, and you can see he hates us with one look at his face. You don\u2019t even have to scroll through his X feed. My procrastination wasn\u2019t just uselessness (though a bit of that, sure); it was that I couldn\u2019t keep my mind on this hatred for five minutes straight without getting distracted by something I loved. So while, without question, Musk is faster than me, more ambitious and more effective, I am happier than he is. To pilfer an uncharacteristically cheerful line from Albert Camus: in the midst of this billionaires\u2019 winter, there is, within me and probably you, an invincible summer. And that\u2019s great, but we\u2019ve still got an almighty class war on our hands. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

the opposition who held the post of business secretary for 17 months until the general election, said she and then postal minister <strong>Kevin Hollinrake</strong> had been battling behind the scenes to get Treasury to sign off on funding to more rapidly and generously pay subpostmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal.<br><br>The inquiry was shown a letter sent last August by Badenoch to <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the then chancellor, asking for funding and a plan to increase payments to improve the compensation schemes.<br><br>Hunt rejected the request and \u201cencouraged\u201d Badenoch \u201cto explore the full breadth of other options\u201d. Badenoch, giving evidence on Monday, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was not expecting the documentary [ITV Bates vs the Post Office drama] in January which helped speed things along. It suddenly turned it from a value for money question to a public perception question. This is the point I have been talking about. It is not enough to do the right thing, you have to be seen to be doing the right thing. Many people had not known the arguments [already] taking place behind the scenes at Whitehall. Work was being done by no one was seeing what was taking place.</p> </blockquote> <p>Badenoch said that the TV drama \u201cchanged the priority of the [Horizon] issue which was behind the NHS and security and so on to something we needed to solve now. It raised the prioritisation\u201d.<br><br><strong>Jason Beer</strong>, counsel for the inquiry, said that it is disappointing to hear that it took a TV drama to get the government to change its priorities in relation to the scandal. Badenoch said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is extremely disappointing. If you look at it in the context of what is happening in government. There are 1000 things money is being requested for. After a while decision makers become very dispassionate, it becomes another line in the ledger.

The pound lost by 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2894 while the euro slid by 0.35% versus the US currency, to $1.0680.</p> <p><strong>Ricardo Evangelista</strong>, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 25-basis-point rate cut, the greenback is benefiting from market speculation that incoming US policies could spark inflationary pressures, potentially altering the Fed\u2019s future rate trajectory.</p> <p>Donald Trump has announced plans for a protectionist trade agenda, including significant tariffs on imports. If implemented, these measures could drive consumer prices higher, potentially limiting the Fed\u2019s options for future rate cuts. Against this backdrop, financial markets are responding by offloading Treasuries [US government bonds], which is pushing yields higher.</p> <p>This shift is also creating greater demand for the dollar as investors seek yield advantage, which in turn strengthens the greenback\u2019s position. As a result, the dollar has been gaining momentum across major currency pairs, supported by expectations that US interest rates may remain elevated for a longer period.</p> </blockquote> <p>Traders see a 65% chance of another 25 basis-point rate cut from the Fed in December, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Several Fed officials, including chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, are due to speak this week.</p> <p>IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump being the president-elect has directly led to some paring in rate-cut expectations into 2025, with a potential \u2018Red Wave\u2019 translating to little resistance to his tax cuts and spending plans, coupled with his stance for more tariffs.</p> <p>Overall, that may complicate the Fed\u2019s fight against inflation and we may expect the Fed to be more cautious in its easing process ahead, suggesting upside pressures on yields and a stronger U.S. dollar, which could cap gold prices.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Russian rouble weakened against the dollar as markets pondered the prospects for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, following a conversation between Trump and Russian president <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Bitcoin has just broken through $83,000 for the first time, on hopes that president-elect Donald Trump will favour cryptocurrencies when he returns to the White House. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached a record high of $83,460, up by 9%. The price has more than doubled from around $37,000 a year ago. The Trump trade has spread throughout financial markets since his victory became clear last Wednesday, with the dollar gaining in value as investors await a high-spending US government, which would limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s room for interest rate cuts. The dollar rose by 0.6% on Monday against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, with the euro dropping to its lowest since May, falling by 0.7% to $1.0641. The pound was also down, by 0.46% to $1.2862. Stocks on Wall Street have hit fresh highs and European shares are also pushing higher. Trump has in the past called bitcoin a \u201cscam against the dollar\u201d, but he changed tack during the recent US presidential election campaign, courting the crypto community and appearing at industry events. That has created an expectation of a relaxation of rules to make it easier for retail savers to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u2013 although Trump has not specified any policies. NatWest has bought back shares worth \u00a31bn from the UK government, as the privatisation of the bailed-out bank continues after a plan to offer a chunk of the stock to retail investors was abandoned. The government and NatWest said on Monday that the Treasury\u2019s holding will drop from 14.2% to 11.4%, after the sale of shares at a price of about \u00a33.81, the bank\u2019s closing price on Friday. The sale means the government has now recouped more than \u00a320bn from the sale of shares that it has held since a \u00a346bn bailout in 2008 during the financial crisis, when the Treasury was forced to step in to prevent the bank, then called Royal Bank of Scotland, from going under. The government owned 84% of NatWest when it was part-nationalised. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care \u2013 JK Switzerland\u2019s exchange operator Six Group has struck a deal to buy Aquis Exchange, a UK-based trading exchange and data provider, in a deal worth \u00a3194m. The offer is for 727p in cash for every Aquis share, representing a 120% premium to Friday\u2019s closing price. It has been unanimously recommend by Aquis directors, according to a statement. The Aquis share price more than doubled to 705p on the news. The takeover would be the biggest for Six since its acquisition of Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles, which runs Spain\u2019s stock exchange, for \u20ac2.8bn in 2020. The company said the deal will allow it to expand its exchange business beyond Switzerland and Spain and add the UK firm\u2019s technology and data products. On Wall Street, stocks have opened at record highs, as the post-election rally continued. The Dow Jones gained by 1% while the S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both added 0.3%, hitting fresh highs. The dollar has risen by 0.6% against a basket of major currencies, as investors are betting that the incoming Trump administration\u2019s inflationary polices will limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s scope for further interest rate cuts. Major European stock markets are more than 1% ahead \u2013 Germany\u2019s Dax, France\u2019s CAC and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB \u2013 while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index rose by 0.9% to 8,143. The collapsed crypto exchange FTX is suing Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its former boss Changpeng Zhao for $1.76bn over an allegedly \u201cfraudulent\u201d share deal. The lawsuit also accuses Zhao of sending \u201cfalse, misleading and fraudulent tweets\u201d. In a lawsuit filed in Delaware on Sunday, the FTX estate claims that a stock repurchase agreement in July 2021 between Binance and FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was \u201cfraudulent\u201d because, it says, FTX and its sister company Alameda Research were insolvent at the time, making the deal invalid. The filing claims that FTX and Alameda \u201cmay have been insolvent from inception and certainly were balance-sheet insolvent by early 2021\u201d. FTX bought back Binance\u2019s and its executives\u2019 20% stake in FTX\u2019s international business and 18.4% holding in its US-based unit in July 2021, the filing shows. Bankman-Fried is in prison after being sentenced to 25 years for fraud in March. Zhao stepped down from Binance in April and was sentenced to four months in jail after pleading guilty to money-laundering violations, which are unrelated to this lawsuit. The lawsuit says: Because of its insolvency, the Debtor Plaintiff\u2019s July 2021 transfer of at least $1.76 billion worth of cryptocurrency to its equity holder Binance and certain Binance executives, in the form of a share repurchase, was a constructive fraudulent transfer. The lawsuit also alleges: Beginning on November 6, 2022, Zhao sent a series of false, misleading, and fraudulent tweets that were maliciously calculated to destroy his rival FTX, with reckless disregard to the harm that FTX\u2019s customers and creditors would suffer. A Binance spokesperson said in a statement to Bloomberg: The claims are meritless, and we will vigorously defend ourselves. Kemi Badenoch has said it is \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d that it took the ITV drama about the Post Office scandal to get the government to accelerate compensation payments for wrongfully prosecuted post office branch owners, the inquiry into the Horizon scandal has heard. Badenoch, the leader of the opposition who held the post of business secretary for 17 months until the general election, said she and then postal minister Kevin Hollinrake had been battling behind the scenes to get Treasury to sign off on funding to more rapidly and generously pay subpostmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal. The inquiry was shown a letter sent last August by Badenoch to Jeremy Hunt, the then chancellor, asking for funding and a plan to increase payments to improve the compensation schemes. Hunt rejected the request and \u201cencouraged\u201d Badenoch \u201cto explore the full breadth of other options\u201d. Badenoch, giving evidence on Monday, said: I was not expecting the documentary [ITV Bates vs the Post Office drama] in January which helped speed things along. It suddenly turned it from a value for money question to a public perception question. This is the point I have been talking about. It is not enough to do the right thing, you have to be seen to be doing the right thing. Many people had not known the arguments [already] taking place behind the scenes at Whitehall. Work was being done by no one was seeing what was taking place. Badenoch said that the TV drama \u201cchanged the priority of the [Horizon] issue which was behind the NHS and security and so on to something we needed to solve now. It raised the prioritisation\u201d. Jason Beer, counsel for the inquiry, said that it is disappointing to hear that it took a TV drama to get the government to change its priorities in relation to the scandal. Badenoch said: It is extremely disappointing. If you look at it in the context of what is happening in government. There are 1000 things money is being requested for. After a while decision makers become very dispassionate, it becomes another line in the ledger. It is not irrational but it has to change, it is not helpful either. There is an absence of common sense in a lot of Whitehall. They don\u2019t trust their judgement. People want legal cover. Bitcoin has broken through $82,000 on so-called \u2018Trump trades\u2019 \u2013 with investors betting that a second Donald Trump administration will be more favourable towards the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, touched $82,413 this morning, and is now trading at $82,105. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: Bitcoin always seemed a likely beneficiary of a Trump victory and so it is proving as the cryptocurrency hits a new record high. It\u2019s not just the incoming occupant of the White House which has helped bitcoin, there have also been down-ticket victories for candidates who have a positive stance on the asset class. Notably, one of its main critics, Senate banking chair and Democrat Sherrod Brown, fell to his Republican opponent and a crypto fan Bernie Moreno. The dollar has also gained, rising to a four-month high, as Trump is expected to usher in more inflationary policies, which would limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s scope for further interest rate cuts. The dollar is up by 0.4% against a basket of other major currencies. The euro lost nearly 0.6% to $1.0657, its lowest level since June. Investors worry about potential US tariffs that would damage the eurozone and global economy, once Trump takes office. Here\u2019s our full story on Bitcoin reaching a new record high: President-elect Donald Trump has in the past called bitcoin a \u201cscam against the dollar\u201d, but he changed his tune on cryptocurrency during the US presidential election campaign, courting the crypto community and appearing at industry events. That has created an expectation of a relaxation of rules to make it easier for retail savers to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u2013 although Trump has not specified any policies. Trump even went as far as giving his backing in September to a cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, run by his family, a move that could leave him open to criticisms over potential conflicts of interest if he moves to deregulate digital assets. His son, Donald Trump Jr, has said that cryptocurrency offers an alternative to a banking system that he alleges is tilted against conservatives. The UK insurer Direct Line said it will cut around 550 jobs after losing more motor insurance customers amid higher premiums. The company, which rejected a \u00a33.1bn takeover bid from Belgian rival Ageas earlier this year, lost a further 71,000 own-brand motor customers in the third quarter when insurance premiums rose by 3% year-on-year, on average. The job reductions are part of efforts to save \u00a350m next year, and create a \u201cleaner and more efficient operating model\u201d. The firm said the cuts will include vacancies no longer being filled. The job reductions represent more than 5% of the 9,000 workers employed by the group. Direct Line shares rose by 0.4% this morning. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Direct Line is looking to cut around 550 jobs as the insurance giant continues to battle with internal demons and a tough trading environment. Cutting costs is one angle of attack to try and bring performance back on track, the other angle must come from stabilising the customer base, especially in the all-important motor division. The good news is that the rate of decline in customer numbers is slowing, as insurance prices are now starting to come down after some mammoth hikes were put through earlier in the year. It\u2019s no secret that Direct Line has struggled over the past few years to deal with a challenging motor insurance market, and operational missteps have weighed on performance. But armed with a new leadership team, a more refined strategy, and new growth angles like the relaunch on price comparison sites, this looks like the best version of Direct Line for some time. Whether it\u2019s able to deliver all that\u2019s promised remains to be seen. Adam Winslow took over as chief executive in March, joining from rival insurer Aviva. Jane Poole recently became chief financial officer, and in December, Maz Bown will become chief risk officer, both also joining from Aviva. Winslow said: We delivered double-digit premium growth year on year in motor, home and commercial direct. However, we are in the early stages of a significant turnaround and our Q3 trading is not yet fully reflective of the actions we have taken. The dollar is rising this morning, as investors are betting that president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies could lead to more inflation, and force America\u2019s central bank to keep interest rates higher. The dollar index, which measures its performance against a basket of major currencies, rose by nearly 0.4%. The pound lost by 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2894 while the euro slid by 0.35% versus the US currency, to $1.0680. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explained: Despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 25-basis-point rate cut, the greenback is benefiting from market speculation that incoming US policies could spark inflationary pressures, potentially altering the Fed\u2019s future rate trajectory. Donald Trump has announced plans for a protectionist trade agenda, including significant tariffs on imports. If implemented, these measures could drive consumer prices higher, potentially limiting the Fed\u2019s options for future rate cuts. Against this backdrop, financial markets are responding by offloading Treasuries [US government bonds], which is pushing yields higher. This shift is also creating greater demand for the dollar as investors seek yield advantage, which in turn strengthens the greenback\u2019s position. As a result, the dollar has been gaining momentum across major currency pairs, supported by expectations that US interest rates may remain elevated for a longer period. Traders see a 65% chance of another 25 basis-point rate cut from the Fed in December, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Several Fed officials, including chair Jerome Powell, are due to speak this week. IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said: Trump being the president-elect has directly led to some paring in rate-cut expectations into 2025, with a potential \u2018Red Wave\u2019 translating to little resistance to his tax cuts and spending plans, coupled with his stance for more tariffs. Overall, that may complicate the Fed\u2019s fight against inflation and we may expect the Fed to be more cautious in its easing process ahead, suggesting upside pressures on yields and a stronger U.S. dollar, which could cap gold prices. The Russian rouble weakened against the dollar as markets pondered the prospects for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, following a conversation between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin. The rouble fell by 0.4% to 98 per dollar. The Kremlin has denied that Putin spoke to Trump after his election victory last week. \u201cThere was no conversation,\u201d Dmitry Peskov, the Russian president\u2019s spokesperson, said today, according to Interfax. \u201cThis is completely made up, it is just false information,\u201d Peskov told reporters, adding that Putin did not have \u201cconcrete\u201d plans to speak to Trump. Peskov was responding to a Washington Post report that Trump warned Putin not to escalate his invasion of Ukraine during a call last Thursday. While European stocks are pushing higher, Asian shares fell today, as China\u2019s stimulus package disappointed investors. Germany\u2019s Dax gained 1.2% to 19,447. In Paris, the CAC 40 rose by 1.3% to 7,430. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 climbed by 0.7%, to 8,130. The futures for the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones rose by between 0.2% and 0.3%, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. China approved a 6 trillion yuan plan during a meeting of its national legislature on Friday, designed to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to revive growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said: It\u2019s not exactly the growth rocket many had hoped for. While it\u2019s a substantial number, the stimulus is less about jump-starting economic growth and more about plugging holes in a struggling local government system. The need for action was underlined by weak inflation figures in China. Consumer prices rose by just 0.3% in the year to October, while producer prices fell by 2.9%. Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Although the government in Beijing has redoubled its efforts to boost the economy, consumer prices in October rose at their slowest pace in four months. Deflation in producer prices has deepened. China is suffering from weak domestic demand and no one knows what the impact of the extensive economic stimulus measures will be. Ultimately, the new price data from China gives the impression that prices would have fallen even further if the government had not intervened. Chinese banks extended 500bn yuan in new loans last month, a sharp drop from 1.59 trillion in September. The British biotech sector has received a boost, after London-based Autolus Therapeutics, a UCL spinout, received US regulatory approval for its new treatment for a rare form of leukaemia. The US Food and Drug Administration has given the UK biotech marketing approval for Aucatzyl, for the treatment of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a severe form of blood cancer that is fatal without treatment. Spun out from University College London in 2014, the business develops programmed T-cell therapies: also known as living medicines, they re-engineer patients\u2019 immune systems to recognise and attack cancer. Elias Jabbour, US lead investigator of the FELIX clinical trial of the drug, and professor of leukaemia at The University of Texas, said: Adult ALL is an extremely aggressive cancer, and there is a high unmet medical need that exists in the treatment of patients with this disease once they relapse, where historically they suffer from poor outcomes. This milestone approval, based on the demonstrated clinical benefit of Aucatzyl, brings new hope for adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. The drug, a T-cell immunotherapy that is delivered via infusion, will be manufactured at Autolus\u2019 manufacturing site in Stevenage. Around 8,400 new cases of adult ALL are diagnosed every year in the US and EU. Christian Itin, chief executive of Autolus, said it was \u201ca proud day\u201d for the firm. This milestone is the culmination of many years of hard work, the foundational work by our partners at UCL and the unwavering commitment of our internal team, our external partners and shareholders. The company floated on Nasdaq in 2018, and counts the British life science investment firm Syncona, as well as Blackstone Life Sciences among its backers. UK and other European stocks have risen at the opening bell, while oil prices edged higher after falling earlier, as the threat of supply disruptions from a US storm faded. The FTSE 100 index in London has added 58 points, or 0.7%, to 8,129 in early trading. NatWest shares rose by 1.6% to \u00a33.86 at after the Treasury announced that it had sold another large chunk of its shareholding back to the bank for \u00a31bn, at \u00a33.81 each. Germany\u2019s Dax rose by 0.9% while France\u2019s CAC advanced by 0.8% and Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib rose by 1.1%. In oil markets, Brent crude rose by 0.2% to $74.02 a barrel while US light crude was little changed at $70.44 a barrel. Both benchmarks fell by more than 2% on Friday. China\u2019s stimulus plan disappointed investors. The country\u2019s oil consumption has barely grown this year as economic growth has slowed. Donald Trump\u2019s election promises of raising import tariffs to boost the US economy have clouded the global economic outlook, although expectations that he could tighten sanctions on Opec producers Iran and Venezuela and cut oil supply to global markets helped oil prices to gain more than 1% last week. German financial journalist Holger Zsch\u00e4pitz said on X: Fund manager Jeroen Blokland said on X: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Bitcoin has soared to a new record high of more than $81,000, following Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election last week and the election of some pro-crypto candidates to Congress. The world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency has more than doubled since its low of $38,505 in January. It touched a record high of $81,899 and is now trading at $81,024, up 5.9% on the day. Trump promised to make the United States the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d on the campaign trail and to create a strategic stockpile of bitcoin. He also said he would appoint financial regulators that favour digital assets, and sack the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler. Gensler has led the regulator\u2019s crackdown on cryptocurrencies. Other cryptocurrencies such as ether and dogecoin, promoted by Trump ally Elon Musk, also rose. Other so-called \u2018Trump trades\u2019 \u2013 from US stocks to shorting bonds \u2013 have lost some steam since the election, but cryptocurrencies are still powering ahead. However, one analyst told Reuters that while bitcoin\u2019s rise is fuelled on hopes for reduced regulation of cryptocurrencies, Trump\u2019s focus on other issues could mean he does not do much on crypto initially. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index, also said: Bitcoin\u2019s Trump-pump is alive and well... with Republicans on the cusp of taking the house to confirm a red wave in Congress, it seems the crypto crowd are betting on digital-currency deregulation. In the UK, NatWest has bought back shares worth \u00a31bn from the government, taking a further step towards full private ownership following the bank\u2019s bailout during the financial crisis. In the summer, the government ditched a plan to sell shares to retail investors. The government and NatWest said this morning that the Treasury\u2019s shareholding will drop from 14.2% to 11.4%, after selling shares for nearly \u00a33.81, the bank\u2019s closing price on Friday. The sale means the government has now recouped more than \u00a320bn from the sale of shares held since a 2008 bailout during the financial crisis, when the Treasury stepped in to prevent the bank, then called Royal Bank of Scotland, from going under.

      "bodyText": "Massive win for Ruud. His third top three win of his career and his first outside of clay and just his third win in 12 matches. Not dropping a set will also be a big boost for his chances to advance to the knockouts. That is all from me today! Thanks for tuning in and join us tomorrow for live coverage of Jannik Sinner v Taylor Fritz. More reaction from Ruud as he talks to Sky Sports: I really returned really well when I needed to. When you play Carlos, you don\u2019t want him to find rhythm. Luckily he made a few more errors than usual. We all know his level. He can play out of this world. It\u2019s the first match of the tournament for both of us. It\u2019s a fast indoor court, which I think is neither of our favourite. I play as an underdog. I think there are a lot of players ahead of me here but I tend to do well here. I don\u2019t know why. My game has not been boosting me of confidence in the last few months so it was really nice to get a win. Ruud speaks after his win: It\u2019s only one match but definitely one of the best wins of the season in terms of who I am playing, his level, his ranking. We have all seen Carlos play and I have not been boosting from confidence in the past few months so I want to build on this in Turin. I think he may be dealing with a cold, I have seen him sniffling around. I tried to make him play rallies but it is not easy when you know someone isn\u2019t 100%. Luckily I got a break early, kept it and played some well-executed tennis. Ruud will now play the winner of the match between Zverev and Rublev, who face off tonight. They have this to look forward to. That unexpected win really blows the John Newcombe Group wide open, which also contains Alexander Zverev and Andrey Rublev. A lot for Alcaraz and his team to review. Too many missed drop shots, poor shot selection and struggles from the baseline. *Alcaraz 1-6, 5-6 Ruud (*denotes server) Ruud is now serving for the match and an ideal start with a powerful serve to get him on the board. He has now won 17 of the last 21 points and he just needs three more right now. But Alcaraz\u2019s backhand down the line makes it 15-15; he is not going down without a fight. Ruud does look a bit nervous but he is standing exceptionally firm in the rally. He stands at match point \u2026 but nets a backhand after a short rally. It is 40-40 and you can just feel the tension. The Norwegian hits a stellar first serve for the advantage but Alcaraz\u2019s final ball in the next point is too far for Ruud to reach. Back to deuce and Ruud gets the advantage again. Can he string back-to-back points in his third match point? He can \u2026 with a firing ace! Wow! That is his first win against Alcaraz ever and easily his best win of the year! *Alcaraz 1-6, 5-6 Ruud (*denotes server) The Spaniard hits a pacy first serve and the crowd cheers him on but he then attempts another drop shot, which he nets (his sixth failed drop shot) unsurprisingly! A few more unforced errors and Ruud faces another break point \u2026 and what a return from a rejuvenated Ruud! He was two points away from losing this set and look at him now. Alcaraz 1-6, 5-5 Ruud* (*denotes server) The game isn\u2019t more than a few minutes. Ruud wins it without dropping a point with some strong serves and Alcaraz is looking a shell shocked. *Alcaraz 1-6, 5-4 Ruud (*denotes server) Alcaraz double faults to make it 30-15 and then Ruud hits a looping forehand up and over Alcaraz. The Spaniard thinks it is out but it is on the line. Ruud sees out the game and he is back in the set and breaks. He deserves it too after being a lot more aggressive and showing more willingness to step inside on the court. Alcaraz 1-6, 5-3 Ruud* (*denotes server) Ruud now serves to stay in the second set. He starts but trying to get closer to the net but the match is really starting to be played on Alcaraz\u2019s terms. But he finds a way to go up 40-30 with a good defensive lob and some luck after Alcaraz nets. The Spaniard hits a deep return and immediately has Ruud on the defensive. Alcaraz, while on top, tries the drop shot again and shocking no one, he nets it. Ruud recognises that Alcaraz was retreating very deep for the second serve and opted to go for the quick, fast volley to see out the game. *Alcaraz 1-6, 5-2 Ruud (*denotes server) Alcaraz is recognising that his forehand is what is consistently working for him today. He hits three in a row and he finally is going for the right shots after some poor shot selection. Alcaraz 1-6, 4-2 Ruud* (*denotes server) Alcaraz is rising to the challenge here. His footwork is a lot better and the crispness of his shots is there. A long rally at 15-15 goes his way after he hits a crosscourt forehand. But after playing such a good point, he rushes a dropshot. That is now 10 backhand unforced errors compared to Ruud\u2019s one. He goes back to the forehand on the next point though and wins that before taking the break point with a low shot that Ruud was never going to get to. *Alcaraz 1-6, 3-2 Ruud (*denotes server) Ruud works hard to stay in the first rally but Alcaraz\u2019s forehand pushes him to the brink around every which way on the court. The Spaniard hits an ace to make it 40-0 and Ruud can\u2019t hit the crucial final return. Only the one point dropped for Alcaraz\u2019s service game in this set. Alcaraz 1-6, 2-2 Ruud* (*denotes server) A few more Ruud aces take him up to 40-15 and it looks like another one will see out the game in quick fashion but somehow Alcaraz returns the corner serve and it hits the line just under Ruud\u2019s nose. It only delays the inevitable though and Ruud sees it out. *Alcaraz 1-6, 2-1 Ruud (*denotes server) Better from Alcaraz. His serves are not as strong as the first game of this set but he goes back to the basics, with a fantastic crosscourt volley. He makes it 2-1 but needs to focus on Ruud\u2019s service games if he wants to make up for that first set. Alcaraz 1-6, 1-1 Ruud* (*denotes server) Alcaraz misses a fairly routine forehand, unusual for him to go down 0-30 and then hits a backhand out to make it 0-40. He sees it out with shot from close to the net, looking very confident as he does so. *Alcaraz 1-6, 1-0 Ruud (*denotes server) Alcaraz is ready to go immediately and goes up 40-0 on his serve, targetting the far corner. Four first serves and game over. Alcaraz is tilted. He can\u2019t get better of Ruud\u2019s serves or returns at all. The Norwegian wins the set with an ace after going up 40-0. Alcaraz finishes the set with 15 unforced errors compared to Ruud\u2019s 7. The Norwegian\u2019s first and second serve percentages have also been much higher. He has been aggressive and he has had the control and consistency, which is especially impressive given Alcaraz is a better player on this surface. *Alcaraz 1-5 Ruud (*denotes server) The Spaniard nets another drop shot to go down early on but ties it up 15-15 right away. But Ruud is hitting very fast returns and somehow the Norwegian is rushing the world No 3. This is very unexpected. He hits two more outs and frustratingly whacks away the spare ball. Ruud to now serve for the set. Alcaraz 1-4 Ruud* (*denotes server) Alcaraz tries to take the second serve return early but Ruud is pushing, serving faster than he usually does. He goes up 30-15 but he then nets an easy shot, his fourth unforced error of the match, and looks at his team in frustration. He then uncharacteristically misses a forehand but does well to keep the ball in play on the next point. Alcaraz misses a routine drop shot and after a few of deuces with the two swapping deuces Ruud finally sees it out. That was a long game, just over 10 mins, but a huge one for the Norwegian. He is here to play! *Alcaraz 1-3 Ruud (*denotes server) Massive return from Ruud to make it 30-0. It\u2019s a strong serve and he\u2019s falling backwards trying to get to it, but he hits the a spinny shot leaving Alcaraz no chance. The world No 7 hits a forehand that looks out but the electronic line calls shows it is in. Alcaraz is shaken and Ruud breaks! Alcaraz 1-2 Ruud* (*denotes server) Beautiful touch from Alcaraz to make it 15-15. Ruud tries to get to the short drop shot but hits it wide but his next serve is a bullet that Alcaraz wildly mishits. An ace takes the Norwegian up 40-30 and he wins the game after Alcaraz hits the next return out. *Alcaraz 1-1 Ruud (*denotes server) Ruud returns Alcaraz\u2019s first serve well out and then nets the next. The Spaniard makes it 40-0 after a short rally, his forehand unleashing all over the court to make Ruud run. And from there it is smooth sailing. Alcaraz 0-1 Ruud* (*denotes server) Ruud gets the first points on the board after Alcaraz hits one long but the Spaniard then goes 30-15 up with two powerful backhands. Ruud then nets a forehand but makes up for it with an ace. He holds off another break point to take it to deuce and the two swap advantages for a while but it is Ruud who draws first blood after the Spaniard nets a drop shot. One of the reasons Ruud is so good on clay is because he has a bit more time to set up his forehand. It is a lot more rushed on the hardcourts but he did well to move Alcaraz around in the first game. Yesterday, Sinner got off to a winning start and Medvedev had a bit of a tantrum. Read our report below. And we\u2019re about to start today\u2019s play. Ruud won the toss and elected to serve. Alcaraz is making just his second appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the semis last year. He lost his opening match Alexander Zverev and told the ATP website that he is hoping to make a fast start this year. Last year was a difficult end of the year for me. I could not play at my best. The last two matches here were pretty good matches for me but the previous two, three tournaments I didn\u2019t play at my best, so I realised I had to change a little bit at this time of the year, which I did this year. I come here a little bit different. I approach this tournament a little differently, knowing there are things I have to change if I am to have a good result here and go far. Last year I didn\u2019t start well from the first matches. I will try to play the same level and will try to play good tennis. I am coming here with a lot of motivation. The players are out on the court and now warming up. Huge cheers for Alcaraz as he walks in, as expected. Ruud will be the underdog in this match and playing against the crowd. This pair\u2019s head-to-head record does not bode well for Ruud, with Alcaraz winning all four of their matches. Their last meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 2023 Beijing Open on hard court which the Spaniard won 6-4, 6-2. For those new to tennis, the ATP Finals is the biggest men\u2019s tennis event after the four grand slams and the format is quite different to other events. The top eight players are separated into two groups of four where they each play three round-robin matches. After the group stage, the top two face off in the semi-finals and a final to determine the winner.

      "body": "<p>Take a drive through the Salinas or Central valleys in California and you\u2019ll pass from town to town advertising its specialty fruit or vegetable: strawberries in Watsonville, garlic in Gilroy, pistachios in Avenal and almonds in Ripon. More than 400 types of commodities are grown in the Golden state \u2013 including a third of the vegetables and three-quarters of the fruits and nuts produced in the United States.</p> <p>Much of that food is grown by immigrant farm workers \u2013 many of whom are undocumented. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), about half of the country\u2019s 2.4 million agricultural farm workers do not have legal status in the US. But farm worker advocates say the number is much higher in places like California, where it can be \u201cas high as 70% in some areas\u201d, according to Alexis Guild, vice-president of strategy and programs at Farmworker Justice, a non-profit based in Washington DC.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201claunch the largest deportation program in American history\u201d by targeting millions of undocumented immigrants could upend the lives of the majority of these agricultural workers who grow and harvest our food \u2013 which would dramatically hit California\u2019s communities and economy, with ripple effects that would touch every table in the country.</p> <p>\u201cWithout undocumented immigrant labor, we wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain a food supply at the capacity that we have right now,\u201d said Ana Padilla, executive director of the Community and Labor Center at the University of California at Merced.</p> <p>Farm workers already perform dangerous and often underpaid labor. In the fields, they are vulnerable to pesticide exposure and workplace injuries doing work that is exempt from federal overtime laws. Trump and his allies have repeatedly said that undocumented immigrants have \u201ctaken\u201d jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans, but farm worker advocates say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/h2a-worker-program-migrant-farm-food\">these are not jobs</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/dehydration-farm-workers-california-safe-drinking-water\">US citizens</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/05/california-mass-shooting-survivor-sues\">are eager to hold</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRather than thinking about how immigrants \u2018took\u2019 jobs that existed, the historic wave of migration from Mexico that began in the 1970s is really a story of the growth of an industry and a very large and profitable one at that,\u201d said Edward Flores, a sociologist and faculty director of the Community and Labor Center, who compares the size of California\u2019s agricultural industry to Hollywood.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that there were so many people working in agriculture meant that the nation exported much more produce than it otherwise would have \u2013 that it opened up opportunities for people all along the supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>In 2023, California\u2019s agricultural exports totaled <a href=\"https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?StateFIPS=06&amp;StateName=California&amp;ID=17854\">more than $24.7bn</a>, according to the USDA.

      "bodyText": "Take a drive through the Salinas or Central valleys in California and you\u2019ll pass from town to town advertising its specialty fruit or vegetable: strawberries in Watsonville, garlic in Gilroy, pistachios in Avenal and almonds in Ripon. More than 400 types of commodities are grown in the Golden state \u2013 including a third of the vegetables and three-quarters of the fruits and nuts produced in the United States. Much of that food is grown by immigrant farm workers \u2013 many of whom are undocumented. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), about half of the country\u2019s 2.4 million agricultural farm workers do not have legal status in the US. But farm worker advocates say the number is much higher in places like California, where it can be \u201cas high as 70% in some areas\u201d, according to Alexis Guild, vice-president of strategy and programs at Farmworker Justice, a non-profit based in Washington DC. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201claunch the largest deportation program in American history\u201d by targeting millions of undocumented immigrants could upend the lives of the majority of these agricultural workers who grow and harvest our food \u2013 which would dramatically hit California\u2019s communities and economy, with ripple effects that would touch every table in the country. \u201cWithout undocumented immigrant labor, we wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain a food supply at the capacity that we have right now,\u201d said Ana Padilla, executive director of the Community and Labor Center at the University of California at Merced. Farm workers already perform dangerous and often underpaid labor. In the fields, they are vulnerable to pesticide exposure and workplace injuries doing work that is exempt from federal overtime laws. Trump and his allies have repeatedly said that undocumented immigrants have \u201ctaken\u201d jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans, but farm worker advocates say these are not jobs US citizens are eager to hold. \u201cRather than thinking about how immigrants \u2018took\u2019 jobs that existed, the historic wave of migration from Mexico that began in the 1970s is really a story of the growth of an industry and a very large and profitable one at that,\u201d said Edward Flores, a sociologist and faculty director of the Community and Labor Center, who compares the size of California\u2019s agricultural industry to Hollywood. \u201cThe fact that there were so many people working in agriculture meant that the nation exported much more produce than it otherwise would have \u2013 that it opened up opportunities for people all along the supply chain.\u201d In 2023, California\u2019s agricultural exports totaled more than $24.7bn, according to the USDA. The state was the nation\u2019s sole producer of many specialty crops \u2013 including almonds, artichokes, figs, olives, pomegranates, raisins and walnuts \u2013 and the leading producer of other staples, such as lettuce and celery. \u201cProposed deportations would be absolutely devastating not just for immigrant households, but most American households,\u201d Flores said. \u201cMass deportations would disrupt the food chain at a time when inflation is one of workers\u2019 most pressing concerns.\u201d He added that such deportations would slow production and increase prices of many grocery store staples, including milk, wheat and eggs. Without the undocumented immigrant workforce, the United States would probably import more of its food supply \u2013 making food prices vulnerable to fluctuations and to Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs. (The United States currently imports about 15% of its food supply \u2013 including about a third of vegetables, half of its fruit and 94% of seafood.) A mass deportation operation would face logistical and financial hurdles: a recent report from the American Immigration Council estimates that a one-time mass deportation would cost at least $315bn \u2013 so the real reason to threaten to deport undocumented farm workers, advocates and academics say, is to discourage immigrant laborers from organizing for better working conditions. \u201cThere\u2019s a contradiction in business owners who employ undocumented immigrants and at the same time support Trump and his proposal for the largest deportation initiative in US history,\u201d said Flores. \u201cUnless your aim is to have greater control over labor than ever before. Because under such a proposal, an employer could recruit a vulnerable workforce and then government would provide the means to get rid of them at will.\u201d During his previous administration and the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump expedited H-2A visas for agricultural workers \u2013 but his allies have voiced disapproval of even legal immigration options for farm workers.

      "body": "<p>Could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> have won the election if she had promised to change course in Gaza? It\u2019s impossible to know, of course, but there\u2019s reason to think so. Instead, Harris hewed far too closely to Biden\u2019s position, alienating large numbers of voters along the way. The result? We can expect the catastrophe for the Palestinian people to continue, while we learn to live with a much more dangerous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, a man whose far-right agenda threatens many of us in and out of the United States.</p> <p>What seems to have doomed Harris most was not so much traditional Democrats casting votes for the Republican Trump, though there was <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/06/trump-wins-dearborn-and-makes-gains-in-hamtramck/76085841007/\">some</a> of that. In fact, party loyalty, at around 95% for both parties, was basically the <a href=\"https://www.nbcwashington.com/decision-2024/2024-voter-turnout-election-demographics-trump-harris/3762138/\">same</a> as in 2020. Rather, Harris\u2019s shortcomings point to the rank-and-file of the Democratic party not coming out to vote and to more first-time voters <a href=\"https://www.nbcwashington.com/decision-2024/2024-voter-turnout-election-demographics-trump-harris/3762138/\">casting</a> Republican ballots. We don\u2019t have the final voter tally yet, but so far Harris has amassed just over 68m votes, compared with Trump\u2019s 72m. Biden, by contrast, earned over 81m votes in 2020. By the time the final numbers are in, it\u2019s likely that Trump will have won more than the 74m votes he had in 2020, and Harris will have been the first Democrat to lose the popular vote in 20 years.</p> <p>Some of those lost votes surely must be attributable to Harris\u2019s weak position on Palestine. A significant majority of young people <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/younger-americans-stand-out-in-their-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/\">sympathize</a> with Palestinian rights, according to the Pew Research Center, and young people are also highly critical of Biden\u2019s policies on Palestine. Meanwhile, reporting from around the nation indicates that voter turnout among young people in this election was low. The Chicago board of elections <a href=\"https://abc7chicago.com/post/gen-voter-turnout-2024-young-time-voters-have-mixed-reaction-president-elect-donald-trump-win/15519621/\">noted</a> that 53% of registered voters between the ages of 18 and 24 cast a ballot, well below the city\u2019s average turnout of 58%. And compared with the 2020 election, Trump doubled his support from first-time voters there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/30/bernie-sanders-israel-gaza-harris-trump\">How can I vote for Kamala Harris if she supports Israel\u2019s war?

And while Black voters continued to overwhelmingly support Harris, their numbers also dropped, reflecting a lack of excitement for the vice-president. Christopher Shell, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/05/biden-harris-gaza-black-voters/\">Foreign Policy</a> magazine that \u201cit\u2019s hard to ignore the impact of US war-making under the Biden-Harris administration and the administration\u2019s inconsistent stance on issues like the Israel-Palestine conflict, which likely deflated enthusiasm for Harris among the influential Black voting bloc\u201d.</p> <p>If you\u2019re wondering what such inconsistencies regarding Gaza could be, you can watch a report by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/01/politics/video/kfile-different-messages-harris-campaign-israel-gaza-ebof-digvid\">CNN</a> that aired on 1 November, which showed how the Harris campaign aired two completely different ads about their position. One ad, aimed at Arab American voters in Michigan, shows Harris speaking from a podium. \u201cWhat has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,\u201d she says. \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent.\u201d Meanwhile, in another ad, this time aimed at Jewish voters in Pennsylvania, she says: \u201cLet me be clear. I will always stand up for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many thousands of people had been warning the Democrats for months that they had to take a stand against the wholesale slaughter of innocent people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It gets worse.

CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski sums this all up understatedly. \u201cHere you have two entirely different constituencies,\u201d he says, \u201cand they are getting two entirely different messages.\u201d</p> <p>I realize I sound like I\u2019m Monday-morning quarterbacking, but many <a href=\"https://www.uncommittedmovement.com/\">thousands</a> of people \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/17/biden-gaza-israel-dark-brandon\">myself</a> included \u2013 had been warning the Democrats for months that they had to take a stand against the wholesale slaughter of innocent people if they wanted to earn our trust, let alone earn our vote. Instead, not only did the Harris campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/22/democratic-national-convention-uncommitted-delegates-protest-palestine\">refuse to let a Palestinian American on stage</a> during their national convention in August and not only did they remove an <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2024/10/22/harris-campaign-regrets-muslims-removal-from-rally-says-hes-welcome/75796758007/\">Arab Muslim Democrat from a rally</a> in late October, but they also decided in their wisdom to trot out two different messages to two different communities, thinking no one would notice. It seems they believed that Democrats would not vote for Trump in any large number, but how did they not realize that if you are repeatedly ignored, insulted and slighted by your party, then you just might not come out to vote.</p> <p>Obviously, Gaza was not the only issue in this campaign, and voters had multiple reasons for their choices, including the economy and concerns over asylum policies, among others. But conventional wisdom already seems to be lining up to say that Gaza played no discernible <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/projects/2024-us-president-election-live-updates-harris-trump/\">role</a> in Harris\u2019s defeat, pointing out that the margins in Trump\u2019s victories in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia appear to be greater than any measurable voter discontent over a largely US-funded genocide, the term, incidentally, that prominent experts increasingly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/378913/israel-gaza-genocide-icj\">use</a> to describe Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza.</p> <p>But much of that post-election analysis is based on exit polling, and exit polling, as far as I know, does not aim to capture why people did not come out to vote in the first place. Why Democratic voters didn\u2019t show up is the crucial question that must be posed. And the answer, I suspect, is abundantly clear. Not changing course on Gaza was a colossal mistake on the part of the Harris campaign, a fatal error certainly for Palestinians and quite likely, as we now see, for Americans, too.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

But conventional wisdom already seems to be lining up to say that Gaza played no discernible role in Harris\u2019s defeat, pointing out that the margins in Trump\u2019s victories in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia appear to be greater than any measurable voter discontent over a largely US-funded genocide, the term, incidentally, that prominent experts increasingly use to describe Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. But much of that post-election analysis is based on exit polling, and exit polling, as far as I know, does not aim to capture why people did not come out to vote in the first place. Why Democratic voters didn\u2019t show up is the crucial question that must be posed. And the answer, I suspect, is abundantly clear. Not changing course on Gaza was a colossal mistake on the part of the Harris campaign, a fatal error certainly for Palestinians and quite likely, as we now see, for Americans, too.

The tiger in question \u2013 whose forced participation outraged animal rights activists \u2013 was not the one which lives on the Louisiana State University (LSU) campus, Mike VII. Its name is Omar Bradley, ostensibly in honor of the famed US military general from the second world war. The animal is reportedly owned by a man with a history of citations from the US agriculture department over a lack of proper care for his animals, according to the Louisiana newspaper the Advocate. Following the death of the school\u2019s previous tiger, Mike VI, in 2016, LSU announced that future Mike the Tigers, the school\u2019s mascot, would no longer be brought on to the field \u2013 ending a longstanding campus tradition. According to the school\u2019s website, Mike VI, who died from a rare form of cancer, had attended 33 of 58 home games between 2007 and 2015.

As a workaround, Landry arranged for a tiger to be imported from Florida for the game \u2013 much to the chagrin of animal rights activists, who protested outside the stadium. Many also questioned Landry spending the efforts of his government on the stunt with his state being ranked as the worst overall \u2013 and one of the most dangerous \u2013 in the US just months earlier. When the tiger was towed on to the field with a black curtain draped over the cage, huge display boards played a short video detailing the history of LSU\u2019s live mascot. Stadium lights darkened and a spotlight was pointed at the cage as the curtain was lifted, revealing the tiger inside as many fans cheered. Initially, the tiger was lying down, and soon after started pacing in a circle. Minutes later, the cage was wheeled off the field as pre-game festivities went on.

      "body": "<p>Eight out of 115 dairy workers, or 7%, who worked with H5N1-infected cows in Michigan and Colorado have antibodies to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bird-flu\">bird flu</a>, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7344a3.htm\">new study</a> from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2013 a rate significantly higher than known cases of the highly pathogenic virus, which means existing efforts are not protecting, diagnosing and treating people at risk, experts said.</p> <p>It could become even harder to detect cases amid the fall migration of wild birds, the upcoming human flu season, and repercussions of the second Trump administration\u2019s proposed policies to curtail public health and expand deportation of immigrants, who serve as the backbone of the agricultural workforce in the US.</p> <p>The new survey from the CDC and state health departments looked at blood samples from people who worked with H5-infected cows in Michigan and Colorado between June to August 2024.</p> <p>Out of the eight people who had previously undetected cases of the highly pathogenic bird flu, four remembered having symptoms, mostly conjunctivitis, and the other four did not recall having symptoms.</p> <p>All eight workers were Spanish speakers who reported milking infected cows or cleaning milk parlors. None of them wore respirators, and less than half wore eye protection like goggles.</p> <p>Notably, only one person said they had worked with infected cows, even though all of them were working with cows on farms with known infections \u2013 pointing to barriers in workers understanding the risks they face.</p> <p>\u201cIt really speaks to the importance of more on-farm training around H5 as well as ways to protect from H5,\u201d Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Thursday.</p> <p>The news of cases that flew beneath the radar is \u201ccompletely unsurprising\u201d, said Jennifer Nuzzo, the director of the Pandemic Center and a professor of epidemiology at Brown University School of Public Health.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you test people at their place of work, and if the consequence of testing positive is that they have to stay home and possibly not earn an income, you should expect that people might not tell you if they\u2019ve had symptoms. Also, everything we know about flu gives us the very strong suspicion that there would be asymptomatic infections,\u201d Nuzzo said.</p> <p>Until now, the CDC has recommended testing only people who report symptoms after having direct animal contact.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not doing enough to make sure that we are protecting people from getting infected and certainly making sure that people who are infected get access to medicines that could potentially keep them from getting severely ill,\u201d Nuzzo said.</p> <p>The CDC is now bolstering measures to protect workers, including expanding recommendations to test farm workers who are exposed to the virus but don\u2019t develop symptoms, and offering those workers access to flu antivirals.</p> <p>\u201cWe in public health need to cast a wider net in terms of who is offered a test so that we can identify, treat and isolate those individuals,\u201d Nirav Shah, the CDC\u2019s principal deputy director, said on Thursday. Identifying cases and treating people helps to keep a mild infection from turning into a severe one \u2013 and it reduces the chances that the virus will spread onward among people.</p> <p>\u201cThe less room we give this virus to run, the fewer chances it has to cause harm or to change,\u201d Shah said. The agency is also improving guidance and education on the importance of personal protective equipment.</p> <p>\u201cBecause we haven\u2019t seen severe illness and deaths yet, I think there\u2019s been some complacency around trying to control this virus, but I\u2019ve always said we shouldn\u2019t wait for farm workers to die before we take action to protect them,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you should gamble with people\u2019s lives like that.\u201d</p> <p>She believes existing stockpiles of H5N1 vaccines should be offered to farm workers, pending their authorization from regulatory agencies. Vaccines can help prevent severe illness, particularly among a population that may be hesitant to come forward with an illness that could jeopardize their job or even their ability to stay in the country.</p> <p>\u201cJust offer it for people who may want to protect themselves,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cThis virus is not going away. This virus is going to represent an even greater threat to human health as it continues to find its way into more and more US farms.\u201d</p> <p>If the \u201cmoral imperative\u201d to protect agricultural workers doesn\u2019t move Americans, perhaps the economic effects of higher costs of milk, eggs and meat will, she said. \u201cNobody wants the cost of groceries to be any higher than they already are.\u201d</p> <p>So far, there have been 46 official cases of H5N1 diagnosed in people this year, more than half of which have been among dairy farmworkers.

      "bodyText": "Eight out of 115 dairy workers, or 7%, who worked with H5N1-infected cows in Michigan and Colorado have antibodies to bird flu, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2013 a rate significantly higher than known cases of the highly pathogenic virus, which means existing efforts are not protecting, diagnosing and treating people at risk, experts said. It could become even harder to detect cases amid the fall migration of wild birds, the upcoming human flu season, and repercussions of the second Trump administration\u2019s proposed policies to curtail public health and expand deportation of immigrants, who serve as the backbone of the agricultural workforce in the US. The new survey from the CDC and state health departments looked at blood samples from people who worked with H5-infected cows in Michigan and Colorado between June to August 2024. Out of the eight people who had previously undetected cases of the highly pathogenic bird flu, four remembered having symptoms, mostly conjunctivitis, and the other four did not recall having symptoms. All eight workers were Spanish speakers who reported milking infected cows or cleaning milk parlors. None of them wore respirators, and less than half wore eye protection like goggles. Notably, only one person said they had worked with infected cows, even though all of them were working with cows on farms with known infections \u2013 pointing to barriers in workers understanding the risks they face. \u201cIt really speaks to the importance of more on-farm training around H5 as well as ways to protect from H5,\u201d Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Thursday. The news of cases that flew beneath the radar is \u201ccompletely unsurprising\u201d, said Jennifer Nuzzo, the director of the Pandemic Center and a professor of epidemiology at Brown University School of Public Health. \u201cWhen you test people at their place of work, and if the consequence of testing positive is that they have to stay home and possibly not earn an income, you should expect that people might not tell you if they\u2019ve had symptoms. Also, everything we know about flu gives us the very strong suspicion that there would be asymptomatic infections,\u201d Nuzzo said. Until now, the CDC has recommended testing only people who report symptoms after having direct animal contact. \u201cWe are not doing enough to make sure that we are protecting people from getting infected and certainly making sure that people who are infected get access to medicines that could potentially keep them from getting severely ill,\u201d Nuzzo said. The CDC is now bolstering measures to protect workers, including expanding recommendations to test farm workers who are exposed to the virus but don\u2019t develop symptoms, and offering those workers access to flu antivirals. \u201cWe in public health need to cast a wider net in terms of who is offered a test so that we can identify, treat and isolate those individuals,\u201d Nirav Shah, the CDC\u2019s principal deputy director, said on Thursday. Identifying cases and treating people helps to keep a mild infection from turning into a severe one \u2013 and it reduces the chances that the virus will spread onward among people. \u201cThe less room we give this virus to run, the fewer chances it has to cause harm or to change,\u201d Shah said. The agency is also improving guidance and education on the importance of personal protective equipment. \u201cBecause we haven\u2019t seen severe illness and deaths yet, I think there\u2019s been some complacency around trying to control this virus, but I\u2019ve always said we shouldn\u2019t wait for farm workers to die before we take action to protect them,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you should gamble with people\u2019s lives like that.\u201d She believes existing stockpiles of H5N1 vaccines should be offered to farm workers, pending their authorization from regulatory agencies. Vaccines can help prevent severe illness, particularly among a population that may be hesitant to come forward with an illness that could jeopardize their job or even their ability to stay in the country. \u201cJust offer it for people who may want to protect themselves,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cThis virus is not going away. This virus is going to represent an even greater threat to human health as it continues to find its way into more and more US farms.\u201d If the \u201cmoral imperative\u201d to protect agricultural workers doesn\u2019t move Americans, perhaps the economic effects of higher costs of milk, eggs and meat will, she said. \u201cNobody wants the cost of groceries to be any higher than they already are.\u201d So far, there have been 46 official cases of H5N1 diagnosed in people this year, more than half of which have been among dairy farmworkers. Another nine people have now been identified by blood testing, for a total of 55 people affected by bird flu in 2024. Other influenza variants will soon begin circulation in people this fall, which raises the possibility of reassortment \u2013 a process where different flu variants combine and potentially gain worse attributes. \u201cBy allowing this virus to circulate, we could give it a runway to develop the ability to more easily infect people, and crucially, to be able to spread easily between people,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cIf the virus can do that, we will be in a new pandemic.\u201d",

Specker said while asylum claims \u201crequire some degree of administrative processing \u2026 what our findings are telling us is that the way a person is treated while their asylum claim is being processed can make a really big difference\u201d. \u2022 In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m a researcher of media manipulation, and watching the 2024 US election returns was like seeing the Titanic sink.</p> <p>Every day leading up to 5 November, there were more and more outrageous claims being made in an attempt across social media to undermine election integrity: conspiracy theories focused on a tidal wave of immigrants plotting to <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1849718117297246377\">undermine the right wing</a>, allegations that there were millions of excess ballots circulating in California, and rumors that the voting machines were already corrupted by malicious algorithms.</p> <p>All of the disinformation about corrupt vote counts turned out not to be necessary, as Donald Trump won the election decisively. But the election proved that disinformation is no longer the provenance of anonymous accounts amplified by bots to mimic human engagement, like it was in 2016. In 2024, <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308\">lies travel further and faster</a> across social media, which is now a battleground for narrative dominance. And now, the owners of the platforms circulating the most incendiary lies have direct access to the Oval Office.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Over the past decade, we have watched social media platforms warp public opinion by deciding what is seen and when users see it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We talk a lot about social media \u201cplatforms\u201d. The word \u201cplatform\u201d is interesting as it means both a stated political position and a technological communication system. Over the past decade, we have watched social media platforms warp public opinion by deciding <em>what</em> is seen and <em>when</em> users see it, as algorithms double as newsfeed and timeline editors. When tech CEOs encode their political beliefs into the design of platforms, it\u2019s a form of technofascism, where technology is used for political suppression of speech and to repress the organization of resistance to the state or capitalism.</p> <p>Content moderation at these platforms now reflects the principles of the CEO and what that person believes is in the public\u2019s interest. The political opinions of tech\u2019s overlords, like Musk and Zuckerberg, are now directly embedded in their algorithms.</p> <p>For example, Meta has limited the circulation of critical discussions about political power, reportedly even downranking posts that use the word <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/16/instagram-limits-political-content-shadowban-election-posts/\">\u201cvote\u201d on Instagram</a>. Meta\u2019s Twitter clone, <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@andymstone/post/DBewqA1vk_f/while-this-is-an-error-that-should-not-have-happened-karenattiah-neither-was-act\">Threads, suspended journalists</a> for reporting on Trump\u2019s former chief of staff describing <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-military-generals-hitler/680327/\">Trump\u2019s admiration of Hitler</a>. Threads built in a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91069546/instagram-threads-meta-filter-political-content-change-settings\">politics filter</a> that is turned on by default.</p>    <p>Implementing these filtering mechanisms illustrates a sharp difference from Meta\u2019s embrace of politicians who got personalized white-glove service in 2016 as <a href=\"https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/how-facebook-and-googles-campaign-embeds-benefit-their-bottom-lines\">Facebook embedded employees</a> directly in political campaigns, who advised on branding and reaching new audiences. It\u2019s also a striking reversal of Zuckerberg\u2019s free speech position in 2019. Zuckerberg gave a presentation at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYMX-ArjYz8\">Georgetown University</a> claiming that he was inspired to create Facebook because he wanted to give students a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/17/zuckerberg-standing-voice-free-expression/\">voice during the Iraq war</a>. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/oct/17/zuckerberg-mlk-frederick-douglass-facebook\">historical revisionism</a> was quickly skewered in the media. (Facebook\u2019s predecessor allowed users to rate the appearance of Harvard female freshmen. Misogyny was the core of its design.) Nevertheless, his false origin story encapsulated a vision of how Zuckerberg once believed society and politics should be organized, where political discussion was his guiding reason to bring people into community.</p> <p>However, he now appears to have abandoned this position in favor of disincentivizing political discussion altogether. Recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/27/mark-zuckerberg-says-white-house-pressured-facebook-to-censor-covid-19-content\">Zuckerberg wrote</a> to the Republican Jim Jordan saying he regretted his content moderation decisions during the pandemic because he acted under pressure from the Biden administration. The letter itself was an obvious attempt to curry favor as Trump rose as the Republican presidential candidate. Zuckerberg has reason to fear Trump, who has mentioned wanting to <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-threatens-jail-mark-zuckerberg-meta-election-book-1235090792/\">arrest Zuckerberg </a>for deplatforming him on Meta products after the January 6 Capitol riot.</p> <p>X seems to have embraced the disinformation chaos and fully fused Trump\u2019s campaign into the design of X\u2019s content strategies. Outrageous assertions circle the drain on X, including false claims such as that immigrants are eating pets in Ohio, Kamala Harris\u2019s Jamaican <a href=\"https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1849183972343119888\">grandmother was white</a>, and that immigrants are siphoning aid meant for <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/oct/23/2-weeks-450-posts-how-elon-musk-uses-his-x-profile/\">Fema</a>. It\u2019s also worth noting that Musk is the biggest <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-musk-x-election-influence-immigration/\">purveyor of anti-immigrant</a> conspiracy theories on X. The hiss and crackle of disinformation is as ambient as it is unsettling.</p> <p>There are no clearer signs of Musk\u2019s willingness to use platform power than his relentless amplification of his own account as well as Trump\u2019s Twitter account on X\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d algorithm. Moreover, Musk bemoaned the link suppression by Twitter in 2020 over Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop while then hypocritically working with the Trump campaign in 2024 to ban accounts and links to leaked documents emanating from the Trump campaign that painted JD Vance in a negative light.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>What we learn from the content strategies of X and Meta is simple: the design of platforms is now inextricable from the politics of the owner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Musk understands that he will personally benefit from being close to power. He supported Trump with a controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/05/elon-musk-america-pac-election-giveaway-lawsuit\">political action committee</a> that gave away cash to those who signed his online petition. Musk also paid millions for canvassers and spent many evenings in Pennsylvania stumping for Trump. With Trump\u2019s win, he will need to make good on his promise of placing Musk in a position on the not-yet-created \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d (Doge \u2013 which is also the name of Musk\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency).

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m a researcher of media manipulation, and watching the 2024 US election returns was like seeing the Titanic sink. Every day leading up to 5 November, there were more and more outrageous claims being made in an attempt across social media to undermine election integrity: conspiracy theories focused on a tidal wave of immigrants plotting to undermine the right wing, allegations that there were millions of excess ballots circulating in California, and rumors that the voting machines were already corrupted by malicious algorithms. All of the disinformation about corrupt vote counts turned out not to be necessary, as Donald Trump won the election decisively. But the election proved that disinformation is no longer the provenance of anonymous accounts amplified by bots to mimic human engagement, like it was in 2016. In 2024, lies travel further and faster across social media, which is now a battleground for narrative dominance. And now, the owners of the platforms circulating the most incendiary lies have direct access to the Oval Office. We talk a lot about social media \u201cplatforms\u201d. The word \u201cplatform\u201d is interesting as it means both a stated political position and a technological communication system. Over the past decade, we have watched social media platforms warp public opinion by deciding what is seen and when users see it, as algorithms double as newsfeed and timeline editors. When tech CEOs encode their political beliefs into the design of platforms, it\u2019s a form of technofascism, where technology is used for political suppression of speech and to repress the organization of resistance to the state or capitalism. Content moderation at these platforms now reflects the principles of the CEO and what that person believes is in the public\u2019s interest. The political opinions of tech\u2019s overlords, like Musk and Zuckerberg, are now directly embedded in their algorithms. For example, Meta has limited the circulation of critical discussions about political power, reportedly even downranking posts that use the word \u201cvote\u201d on Instagram. Meta\u2019s Twitter clone, Threads, suspended journalists for reporting on Trump\u2019s former chief of staff describing Trump\u2019s admiration of Hitler. Threads built in a politics filter that is turned on by default. Implementing these filtering mechanisms illustrates a sharp difference from Meta\u2019s embrace of politicians who got personalized white-glove service in 2016 as Facebook embedded employees directly in political campaigns, who advised on branding and reaching new audiences. It\u2019s also a striking reversal of Zuckerberg\u2019s free speech position in 2019. Zuckerberg gave a presentation at Georgetown University claiming that he was inspired to create Facebook because he wanted to give students a voice during the Iraq war. This historical revisionism was quickly skewered in the media. (Facebook\u2019s predecessor allowed users to rate the appearance of Harvard female freshmen. Misogyny was the core of its design.) Nevertheless, his false origin story encapsulated a vision of how Zuckerberg once believed society and politics should be organized, where political discussion was his guiding reason to bring people into community. However, he now appears to have abandoned this position in favor of disincentivizing political discussion altogether. Recently, Zuckerberg wrote to the Republican Jim Jordan saying he regretted his content moderation decisions during the pandemic because he acted under pressure from the Biden administration. The letter itself was an obvious attempt to curry favor as Trump rose as the Republican presidential candidate. Zuckerberg has reason to fear Trump, who has mentioned wanting to arrest Zuckerberg for deplatforming him on Meta products after the January 6 Capitol riot. X seems to have embraced the disinformation chaos and fully fused Trump\u2019s campaign into the design of X\u2019s content strategies. Outrageous assertions circle the drain on X, including false claims such as that immigrants are eating pets in Ohio, Kamala Harris\u2019s Jamaican grandmother was white, and that immigrants are siphoning aid meant for Fema. It\u2019s also worth noting that Musk is the biggest purveyor of anti-immigrant conspiracy theories on X. The hiss and crackle of disinformation is as ambient as it is unsettling. There are no clearer signs of Musk\u2019s willingness to use platform power than his relentless amplification of his own account as well as Trump\u2019s Twitter account on X\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d algorithm. Moreover, Musk bemoaned the link suppression by Twitter in 2020 over Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop while then hypocritically working with the Trump campaign in 2024 to ban accounts and links to leaked documents emanating from the Trump campaign that painted JD Vance in a negative light. Musk understands that he will personally benefit from being close to power. He supported Trump with a controversial political action committee that gave away cash to those who signed his online petition. Musk also paid millions for canvassers and spent many evenings in Pennsylvania stumping for Trump. With Trump\u2019s win, he will need to make good on his promise of placing Musk in a position on the not-yet-created \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d (Doge \u2013 which is also the name of Musk\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency). While it sure seems like a joke taken too far, Musk has said he plans to cut $2tn from the national budget, which will wreak havoc on the economy and could be devastating when coupled with the mass deportation of 10 million people. In short, what we learn from the content strategies of X and Meta is simple: the design of platforms is now inextricable from the politics of the owner. This wasn\u2019t inevitable. In 2016, there was a public reckoning that social media had been weaponized by foreign adversaries and domestic actors to spread disinformation on a number of wedge issues to millions of unsuspecting users. Hundreds of studies were conducted in the intervening years, by internal corporate researchers and independent academics, showing that platforms amplify and expose audiences to conspiracy theories and fake news, which can lead to networked incitement and political violence. By 2020, disinformation had become its own industry and the need for anonymity lessened as rightwing media makers directly impugned election results, culminating in January 6. That led to an unprecedented decision by social media companies to ban Trump, who was still the sitting president, and a number of other high-profile rightwing pundits, thus illustrating just how powerful social media platforms had become as political actors. In reaction to this unprecedented move to curb disinformation, the richest man in the world, Musk, bought Twitter, laid off much of the staff, and sent internal company communications to journalists and politicians in 2022. Major investigations of university researchers and government agencies ensued, naming and shaming those who engaged with Twitter\u2019s former leadership and made appeals for the companies to enforce its own terms of service during the 2020 election. Since then, these CEOs have ossified their political beliefs in the design of algorithms and by extension dictated political discourse for the rest of us. Whether it\u2019s Musk\u2019s strategy of overloading users with posts from himself and Trump, or Zuckerberg\u2019s silencing of political discussion, it\u2019s citizens who suffer from such chilling of speech. Of course, there is no way to know decisively how disinformation affected individual voters, but a recent Ipsos poll shows Trump voters believed disinformation on a number of wedge issues, claiming that immigration, crime, and the economy are all worse than data indicates.

      "bodyText": "Alyse Bradley has done the maths. The cost of living with multiple chronic health conditions has left her at least $400,000 out of pocket over the past two decades. Each year the 37-year-old pays $600 for regular GP visits, $2,000 for specialist appointments, $1,000 for scans, $4,800 for ongoing pain treatments including physiotherapy, $1,400 for a variety of medications and $1,200 for vitamins. Bradley estimates she has lost between $5,000 and $10,000 in annual income through unpaid leave when she is unable to work. This was especially the case early in her career when employers couldn\u2019t see anything was physically wrong and would not believe her. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Bradley, now a professional working in finance, started experiencing symptoms from severe complex endometriosis, adenomyosis and chronic pelvic pain as a teenager but only received a diagnosis at age 27. Amid the physical and emotional challenges caused by the diseases, Bradley says she experienced intense anxiety from the financial impacts. Over the years she has done her best to manage the financial burden. She got a second job working weekends after racking up thousands of dollars of debt that she has only recently cleared. She has been forced to move in with her mother, on and off, after several endometriosis surgeries. \u201cNot only daily are you worried about pain, but the cost of it, you actually think about it all the time,\u201d Bradley says. She is now the treasurer for QENDO, a peak body for those affected by endometriosis and other pelvic health-related conditions. Bradley was able to put down a deposit on her own apartment last year at the age of 36, but still feels \u201clike I\u2019m many years behind my friends, especially with savings in the bank\u201d. The cost-of-living crisis is worsening the gender health gap, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has warned. It says women are experiencing more years in poor health than men and they are more likely to forgo healthcare as out-of-pocket expenses rise. The peak body for GPs also says Medicare\u2019s gender bias means women pay more than men for basic healthcare. The RACGP president, Dr Nicole Higgins, says women are more likely than men to have chronic conditions \u2013 not only those related to their reproductive systems including endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, but also autoimmune and mental health conditions. According to government data, adult women have a higher overall rate (56%) of having at least one of 10 common non-gendered chronic conditions compared with adult men (49%), with an especially higher prevalence for conditions including osteoporosis, arthritis, asthma, mental and behavioural conditions. Many women are missing out on care because they can\u2019t afford it, Higgins says, with women nearly twice as likely to delay seeing a GP. \u201cIn the past 12 months one in 25 women have delayed care, compared to one in 40 men.\u201d Women are also penalised because of the way Medicare rebates are structured, Higgins says. \u201cMedicare rewards procedural medicine \u2013 not the cognitive, the talking, the preventative medicine. It penalises people the longer they spend with their doctor.\u201d The college is urging the federal government to increase Medicare rebates for longer GP consultations. Yvonne Appleby requires care for several chronic conditions: type 2 diabetes, severe chronic asthma, glaucoma, severe arthritis in her knees and high blood pressure since the birth of her son. She has also suffered migraines up until menopause and had benign breast lumps removed. The 60-year-old\u2019s specialist treatments have proved costly; the $600 for a brain MRI which confirmed her glaucoma was borrowed from her mother. Since a severe asthma attack hospitalised her for more than two weeks, she has been forced to cut back her work hours. Appleby says most of her part-time fortnightly wage of $645 goes on medical expenses, even with her pension card giving her significant \u201cgodsend\u201d discounts on all her medications. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I live in the family home where I was born, because if I had to pay rent I\u2019d have zero hope \u2026 you wouldn\u2019t be able to afford rent or medicine at the same time, you\u2019d have to choose one,\u201d she says. She has always been able to bulk bill her regular GP appointments \u201cotherwise it just would have cost me a fortune \u2013 in and out all the time\u201d. But earlier this year Appleby\u2019s GP died, forcing her to swap doctors at the clinic, which now leaves her $64.85 out of pocket each appointment. Finding a different GP who bulk bills doesn\u2019t feel like an option, she says. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to change clinics because they\u2019ve got all my medical history from my previous GP, and it\u2019s just all too difficult.\u201d Dr Nisha Khot, the vice-president of the peak body for obstetricians and gynaecologists, agrees the Medicare gender gap needs to be addressed \u2013 including the rebate inequalities for items specific to women\u2019s health. Khot points to contraception. \u201cWhen men have a vasectomy procedure, the Medicare rebate is more than $200, whereas when women have an intrauterine device (IUD) insertion \u2013 which actually is a procedure that takes longer than doing a vasectomy \u2013 the Medicare rebate for that is $75.\u201d Khot says the rebates for many gender-specific Medicare items including pregnancy scans have not changed in more than three decades, despite becoming more detailed and more complex, leading patients of obstetricians and gynaecologists to have the highest out-of-pocket expenses out of all medical specialties. The National Women\u2019s Health Advisory Council was formed in late 2022 to address medical misogyny. Ged Kearney, the assistant health minister and chair of the council, says the government is conducting a gender audit of specific Medicare services to ensure fairer rebates for women as part of the Continuous Medicare review. Khot welcomes Kearney\u2019s commitment to look at the rebate system with an intersectional and gender lens. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see that commitment turned into reality because that will make a huge difference.\u201d The government has committed to fund longer gynaecologist appointments, which will come into effect next year, but more items need to be given greater rebates, Khot says. Bradley says the health industry and politics have historically been governed by men \u2013 many of whom \u201ceven in 2024 have no idea\u201d about the health issues women face and the costs. \u201cThe stigma around these conversations is however slowly changing but we still have a lot to do.\u201d Khot says there is \u201cno good reason\u201d for the stark gender gap in healthcare. Like Bradley, Khot too says she is hopeful for change, \u201cbecause there is more of an interest [in the issue] and more people are willing to talk about it \u2026 I\u2019ve always said that it takes a coalition of women\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A former communications director for Kamala Harris has made the unlikely suggestion that Joe Biden resign so she can become the first woman to serve as US president after her defeat to Donald Trump in the 5 November election. Jamal Simmons offered the thought during an appearance as a panelist on Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union news show when asked what should be the top priority for the US before Trump begins his second presidency in January. Though there is no indication Biden has considered it, Simmons said he \u201ccould resign the presidency in the next 30 days [to briefly] make Kamala Harris the president of the United States\u201d. Simmons said the move would not only spare Harris from having to certify her own defeat to Trump in the US Senate as part of her role as vice-president \u2013 but it also \u201cwould dominate the news at a point [when] Democrats have to learn\u201d to seize the public\u2019s attention. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s been a phenomenal president,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cHe\u2019s lived up to so many of the promises he\u2019s made. \u201cThere\u2019s one promise left that he can fulfill: being a transitional figure.\u201d Dana Bash, State of the Union\u2019s host, replied by alluding to how the idea had previously been discussed among social media users who were disillusioned with how voters had returned Trump to the White House at the vice-president\u2019s expense. \u201cThis has now jumped from an internet meme to a Sunday morning talk show,\u201d Bash remarked. Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic party\u2019s ticket in July when Biden dropped his re-election bid in the wake of a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June. Biden endorsed Harris to face the Republican party leader in the 5 November election. But the pair\u2019s relationship became tense as she sought to distance herself from his record, making it difficult to see Simmons\u2019 vision of Biden stepping down in the closing days of his presidency becoming reality. Things between Harris and Biden came close to rock bottom in the waning days of the race, as her team tried to capitalize on a comedian at a pro-Trump rally in New York City insulting Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d. They felt undermined in their effort when Biden soon came out and appeared to refer to Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201cgarbage\u201d, giving Republicans the opportunity to express offense in the press. Biden\u2019s subsequent clarification that he meant to only single out Trump\u2019s \u201csupporter\u2019s \u2026 demonization of Latinos\u201d \u2013 meaning the comedian\u2019s \u2013 rang hollow. Harris ultimately lost every key battleground to Trump, costing her the electoral college and the popular vote, leaving her as the first Democratic presidential candidate since 2004 to lose the latter. David Plouffe, a senior Harris campaign adviser, soon wrote on the social media platform X that her team had \u201cdug out of a deep hole\u201d in running against Trump \u201cbut not enough\u201d. The post from Plouffe \u2013 who guided Barack Obama\u2019s successful 2008 run for the presidency \u2013 was widely interpreted as a dig against Biden for dropping out long after critics had first pressured him to do so. Plouffe subsequently deleted his X account. And reportedly sources from within the president\u2019s team told Fox News that Plouffe was a \u201csanctimonious ass\u201d \u2013 and that Biden had managed to beat Trump in 2020 without his help. Simmons served as Harris\u2019s communications director for about a year beginning in January 2022. The political operative is the co-host of the TrailBlaze podcast.",

      "bodyText": "The mayor of Perugia, where the British student Meredith Kercher was murdered, has apologised for allowing a controversial TV series co-produced by Amanda Knox to be filmed in the Italian city. Angry residents displayed banners reading \u201cRispetto per Meredith\u201d (respect for Meredith) around the city as the crew arrived to film scenes of Blue Moon, an eight-part drama chronicling Knox\u2019s battle to clear her name of the murder, that will be aired on the Disney-owned streaming service Hulu. Kercher, 21, was murdered in the house she shared with Knox on 1 November 2007. Kercher\u2019s body was found in her bedroom, partly undressed and with several stab wounds. Knox, 37, and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, were twice convicted of the murder before being definitively acquitted in 2015 in a court ruling that described \u201cstunning flaws\u201d in the investigation that led to their convictions. Perugia, a medieval city appreciated for its cobbled alleyways, art and chocolate, has long struggled to shake off the image associated with it as a result of the notorious murder and the years of legal wrangling that followed. \u201cFor too long, Perugia was sadly famous in the world as the city of Meredith Kercher\u2019s murder,\u201d Margherita Scoccia, a former councillor, said on Facebook. \u201cIs it right that our community is associated with such a terrible crime again?\u201d Vittoria Ferdinandi, the mayor of Perugia, apologised in an open letter to residents, saying that when deciding to authorise filming, she had overlooked \u201cthe people and their sorrow, which is still alive in them\u201d. She explained that her administration could have refused permission, but that the scenes \u201cwould have been filmed in any other town in our region\u201d. Ferdinandi said hosting the series allowed the authorities to have greater control over protecting the city\u2019s image \u201cbecause, as requested, we are able to view and authorise every scene\u201d. Hulu said Blue Moon was \u201cbased on the true story of how Knox was wrongfully convicted for the murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, and her 16-year odyssey to set herself free\u201d. The Kercher family said last week that they found it \u201cdifficult to understand\u201d how the series served any purpose. Orvieto, another Umbrian town, has also featured in the series, which is being co-produced by Monica Lewinsky, who was at the centre of a 1990s media storm after an affair with the then US president, Bill Clinton. Knox and Sollecito spent four years in prison before their release in 2011. Since then, Knox earned a reported \u00a33.5m for her memoir, took part in a Netflix documentary about the case in 2016, and has been the subject of other books and films. The filming of the drama comes a few months after a Florence court upheld a slander conviction against Knox for wrongly accusing Patrick Lumumba, who owned a bar in Perugia, of Kercher\u2019s murder. Carlo Pacelli, Lumumba\u2019s lawyer, claimed last week that his client had still not received the compensation money that Knox was ordered to pay over the allegation. Rudy Guede, who was the only person definitively convicted of the murder, was released from prison in November 2021 after completing 13 years of a 16-year-sentence.",

Almost five years since the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said hybrid working \u2013 part travelling to work, and part at home \u2013 appeared to be \u201chere to stay\u201d for some workers more than others. In analysis highlighting how the shift could amplify pre-existing social divisions, the ONS said the likelihood of hybrid working was split across age groups, job type and education. As well as the large disparity in hybrid working between workers with degree-level education and those with no qualification, the ONS also found that those aged over 30, parents and managers and professionals were the most likely to log on from home. While almost half (45%) of people in senior managerial jobs \u2013 regardless of sector \u2013 followed a hybrid-working model, as few as 3% of those in shopfloor roles in the retail sector, cleaning services, caring and leisure jobs were in a similar position.

Messages posted by Patrick Ruane on social media were described by a judge who sentenced him at the Old Bailey as \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d during a volatile time. The trial previously heard that the 55-year-old had targeted individuals including the UK government\u2019s chief medical officer and the chief executive officer of Covid vaccine developer Pfizer in a series of posts during 2021. Ruane had replied to a post about Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, saying: \u201cThe weakest point of the scull [sic] is the back of the scull and all it would take is riding a bike very fast and whacking target over the back of head with a rounders bat but a mace [a piece of metal ball and chain] would be way better.\u201d In response to the creator of the AstraZeneca vaccine getting a standing ovation at Wimbledon, he commented: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame there was not a sharp shooter to take that fucking POS [piece of shit] out.\u201d An audio producer who worked in films, Ruane also posted images of semtex explosive and called for an \u201cIRA playbook\u201d to be implemented after the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, extended lockdown powers for a further period. Prosecutor Julia Faure Walker said that posts by Ruane spanned months and encouraged serious violence and disruption designed to influence the government or intimidate a section of the public. They reached a \u201cvery large audience\u201d through two Telegram chat groups, one of which had 18,000 users. Judge Richard Marks KC said on Monday that Ruane could not be sure people would not act out what was said in the messages. He went on to say that Ruane had a \u201ccompulsive and obsessive\u201d mindset about the vaccines and that he often posted the messages while \u201cblind drunk\u201d.

      "body": "<p>A horse in colourful medieval garb ambles past, its rider heading off to the first sword fight of the day. From across the fence, music from a group of jitterbug dancers boogie-woogies through the air. And here, in a small field dotted with picnic benches, a group of red-coated cavaliers are preparing for a musket demonstration. \u201cI\u2019ve tried muskets but I close my eyes when I fire,\u201d confides Victoria Barton, who chooses to stand behind the safety line with me as the fighters load and light up their weapons. \u201cPlus,\u201d she says, as their guns fire, clouds of smoke blooming over the soldiers\u2019 heads, \u201cI like my eyelashes.\u201d</p> <p>When I visit, there are 65 re-enactors here at <a href=\"https://www.coam.org.uk/\">Chiltern Open Air Museum</a>, a 45-acre site that has hosted the filming of Horrible Histories, Downton Abbey and Masters of the Air. Most of the participants at this <a href=\"https://www.coam.org.uk/events/britain-at-war\">weekend event</a>, all re-creating battles or soldiers\u2019 encampments not just from the civil wars but across the ages, are volunteers. They give up their evenings and weekends to breathe life into old stories.</p> <p>For the last 30 years, Barton and her husband have been part of the <a href=\"https://ecws.org.uk/\">English Civil War Society</a>, a leading historical re-enactment group. \u201cI\u2019d heard of re-enactors and thought they were weird,\u201d she confesses. \u201cBut then I met them and they were surprisingly normal.\u201d She surveys the array of 17th-century-outfitted adults around her and shifts the weight of the large red drum on her shoulder. \u201cWell,\u201d she gives a half-shrug, \u201cmostly normal.\u201d</p>    <p>Some people join football teams in their spare time. Others form book groups. But if you\u2019re a keen historian, have you ever considered living history? The umbrella term contains a kaleidoscope of forms, including professional actors telling tales, amateur re-enactors flocking to muddy fields and keen volunteers giving guided tours around ruins. All to share their full-bodied, microscopically detailed love of days gone by.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got friends here I\u2019ve known for over 40 years,\u201d says Alistair North, dapperly dressed as a civil wars royalist officer. \u201cIt gets you out of the house and out with your mates,\u201d agrees a gentle 76-year-old in the Oxfordshire Home Guard Living History Group. But it\u2019s not just retirees who re-enact the past. In the first world war soldiers\u2019 encampment, there is a young man who has been doing this since he was six.

But these sticklers for total accuracy quickly slip into sticky, problematic issues of exclusion. A man dressed as part of the American army in the second world war gives me an even look when I ask about women joining his regiment. \u201cWe don\u2019t rewrite history,\u201d he says coolly, swiftly shutting down that line of enquiry.</p>    <p>Everyone else I speak to is far more welcoming.

      "bodyText": "A horse in colourful medieval garb ambles past, its rider heading off to the first sword fight of the day. From across the fence, music from a group of jitterbug dancers boogie-woogies through the air. And here, in a small field dotted with picnic benches, a group of red-coated cavaliers are preparing for a musket demonstration. \u201cI\u2019ve tried muskets but I close my eyes when I fire,\u201d confides Victoria Barton, who chooses to stand behind the safety line with me as the fighters load and light up their weapons. \u201cPlus,\u201d she says, as their guns fire, clouds of smoke blooming over the soldiers\u2019 heads, \u201cI like my eyelashes.\u201d When I visit, there are 65 re-enactors here at Chiltern Open Air Museum, a 45-acre site that has hosted the filming of Horrible Histories, Downton Abbey and Masters of the Air. Most of the participants at this weekend event, all re-creating battles or soldiers\u2019 encampments not just from the civil wars but across the ages, are volunteers. They give up their evenings and weekends to breathe life into old stories. For the last 30 years, Barton and her husband have been part of the English Civil War Society, a leading historical re-enactment group. \u201cI\u2019d heard of re-enactors and thought they were weird,\u201d she confesses. \u201cBut then I met them and they were surprisingly normal.\u201d She surveys the array of 17th-century-outfitted adults around her and shifts the weight of the large red drum on her shoulder. \u201cWell,\u201d she gives a half-shrug, \u201cmostly normal.\u201d Some people join football teams in their spare time. Others form book groups. But if you\u2019re a keen historian, have you ever considered living history? The umbrella term contains a kaleidoscope of forms, including professional actors telling tales, amateur re-enactors flocking to muddy fields and keen volunteers giving guided tours around ruins. All to share their full-bodied, microscopically detailed love of days gone by. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends here I\u2019ve known for over 40 years,\u201d says Alistair North, dapperly dressed as a civil wars royalist officer. \u201cIt gets you out of the house and out with your mates,\u201d agrees a gentle 76-year-old in the Oxfordshire Home Guard Living History Group. But it\u2019s not just retirees who re-enact the past. In the first world war soldiers\u2019 encampment, there is a young man who has been doing this since he was six. North points to a 21-year-old pikeman whose father got him into the hobby. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few areas you see where teenagers and pensioners are genuinely mates,\u201d North says proudly.

      "bodyText": "Prosecutors have spent 18 months considering whether to charge a former army instructor at Deepcut barracks where five recruits died more than 20 years ago. A file recommending that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) charge a former member of the Royal Logistic Corps for misconduct in a public office was sent last year but prosecutors said they were still unable to provide guidance on when a decision would be made. Surrey police launched a fresh investigation into Deepcut barracks, near Camberley, Surrey, after the 2018 inquest into the death of Pte Sean Benton, who killed himself at the barracks in 1995. He had been found dead with five gunshot wounds to the chest. Benton was one of five young soldiers whose deaths triggered accusations of a culture of bullying at Deepcut in the 1990s and 2000s that drove recruits to take their lives. The Daily Mail reported that Surrey police\u2019s review of the deaths of soldiers at the barracks found evidence to support charging one retired soldier, who is in his 70s, for his physical and verbal abuse of one of the trainees. It is understood that the CPS has privately apologised to the families of deceased soldiers after they complained about the length of time it had taken to reach a decision. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said: \u201cWe received a file of evidence from Surrey police following an investigation into allegations of misconduct in a public office. \u201cWe are carefully considering this complex material and cannot provide a timeframe as to when a decision will be made.\u201d Four young soldiers at Deepcut killed themselves and a fifth died of a drugs overdose. Initial investigations into the deaths were subsequently criticised as inadequate and a 2006 review concluded that recruits had experienced \u201charassment, discrimination and oppressive behaviour\u201d. Benton\u2019s family had noticed he had appeared thin and withdrawn when on leave at their home in Hastings, East Sussex, and on one occasion had cried before returning to his barracks. Five months after Benton\u2019s death, Pte Cheryl James, 18, was found with a bullet wound to her head after being posted on guard duty. A fresh inquest concluded in 2016 that she had killed herself. An inquest revealed life at the barracks to be chaotic and dangerous. Pte Anthony Bartlett, 26, died from a suspected drug overdose in July 2001. In September 2001, Pte Geoff Gray, 17, died from two gunshot wounds to his head while on guard duty. Pte James Collinson, 17, was found dead in March 2002 from a single gunshot wound to his head. He was also on guard duty. Surrey police did not respond to a request for comment. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump, for the first time, won a majority of the popular vote. He took the US presidency with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-president.html\">huge swings</a> in his favour, increasing his share of first-time voters, young voters, black voters and Latino voters. And he gained among <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls\">voters earning under $100,000</a>, while wealthier voters preferred Harris \u2013 a reversal of the class alignments in 2020. Current voting tallies suggest the swing to the Republicans was largely caused by mass abstention among Democrat voters. This result echoes global trends. Trump and his new coalition will now head a loose alliance of far-right governments from India to Hungary, Italy, the Philippines, Argentina, the Netherlands and Israel.</p> <p>The rhythm of far-right successes began with Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s landslide in Hungary\u2019s 2010 parliamentary election. Since Narendra Modi\u2019s victory in the 2014 Indian general election, it has scarcely paused: Trump\u2019s first ascent to the White House, the Brexit vote and Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s success in the Philippines all took place in 2016. Two years later, Jair Bolsonaro scored an upset in Brazil. Since the pandemic, the Brothers of Italy won the Italian general election in 2022 and Javier Milei took the Argentinian presidency in 2023. For most of this period, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud has ruled Israel in coalition with far-right parties. Even where it is not in power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/far-right\">the far right</a> is gaining, as in France and Germany. In the long view, the defeat of Trump in 2020 and Bolsonaro in 2022 were predictable oscillations in a general pattern of ascent.</p> <p>Why does the far right keep winning? Is it \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d, as James Carville put it during Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential run? The idea that far-right voting reflects a protest by the economically \u201cleft behind\u201d is quite popular.</p> <p>There is a kernel of truth to this: the state of the economy was the single biggest motive for Trump voters in 2024. Liberals, snarking about the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibecession\">vibecession</a>\u201d \u2013 the mistaken belief by the public that the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/22/poll-economy-recession-biden\">is in recession</a> \u2013 say GDP <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/americans-wages-are-higher-than-they-have-ever-been-and-employment-is-near-its-all-time-high/\">is growing</a> and inflation is modest at 2.4%. But headline figures don\u2019t reflect how most people experience the economy. Prices are <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/why-your-july-4th-bbq-may-be-pricier-this-year.html\">20% higher</a> than before the pandemic and, more importantly, prices for essentials such as food are <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/price-of-food\">up 28%</a>. Household debt was a major stress factor. Biden also cut a raft of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/23/biden-social-safety-net-2024-00128488\">popular benefits</a> established during the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, most people don\u2019t believe the headline figures.</p> <p>Yet this narrative barely scratches the surface. First, the evidence suggests that people don\u2019t always vote with their wallets: studies from the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/selfinterest-vs-symbolic-politics-in-policy-attitudes-and-presidential-voting/5B2780252B4243E89C9AD4A3B3426A6A\">20th century</a> up to <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1718155115\">the present</a> show that simple measures of economic self-interest aren\u2019t a very good predictor of voting behaviour. The economy matters, of course, but not as a simple metric of aggregate wellbeing. It is a space in which people judge their personal standing relative to how they perceive the state of society. Personal setbacks are generally only politicised when they are perceived as part of a wider crisis. Second, while the far right can\u2019t win without gaining some working-class support, in the US, Brazil, India and the Philippines, it relies on a bedrock of middle-class support. Besides, millions regularly have their economic lives wrecked without going far right: the poorest in most societies generally aren\u2019t very <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13501763.2023.2278647#d1e195\">susceptible to their message</a>. Third, in strictly material terms the economic offer of today\u2019s far right is paltry, yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/nov/10/kamala-harris-is-just-the-latest-victim-of-global-trend-to-oust-incumbents\">incumbency has been incredibly forgiving</a> for nationalist governments.</p> <p>In India, after average consumer expenditure fell, Modi was re-elected in 2019 with a 6% swing. In the Philippines, as the number of \u201cpoor\u201d Filipinos surged, Duterte\u2019s successor Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr won 58% of the vote in 2022 \u2013 an increase of almost 20 points. Even in defeat, they do surprisingly well. Average incomes rose <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/f11d5ffb-9752-44e3-9caa-ce6005bba6fd/republican-claim-about-5k-rising-income-issue-brief-final.pdf\">more slowly</a> under Trump than his predecessor, yet he added 10 million voters to his base in 2020. And if people voted with their wallets, why would many working-class Americans back a candidate committed to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/07/trump-taxes-republican-congress/\">cutting taxes for the rich</a>?</p> <p>The political effects of economic misery are more indirect than \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d implies. Economic shocks are mediated by the existing emotional currents in society. The middle-class and more affluent workers can identify with the rich and resent the poor, migrants and \u201cspongers\u201d who threaten their lifestyle. Mostly resentment results in impotent complaint.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump, for the first time, won a majority of the popular vote. He took the US presidency with huge swings in his favour, increasing his share of first-time voters, young voters, black voters and Latino voters. And he gained among voters earning under $100,000, while wealthier voters preferred Harris \u2013 a reversal of the class alignments in 2020. Current voting tallies suggest the swing to the Republicans was largely caused by mass abstention among Democrat voters. This result echoes global trends. Trump and his new coalition will now head a loose alliance of far-right governments from India to Hungary, Italy, the Philippines, Argentina, the Netherlands and Israel. The rhythm of far-right successes began with Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s landslide in Hungary\u2019s 2010 parliamentary election. Since Narendra Modi\u2019s victory in the 2014 Indian general election, it has scarcely paused: Trump\u2019s first ascent to the White House, the Brexit vote and Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s success in the Philippines all took place in 2016. Two years later, Jair Bolsonaro scored an upset in Brazil. Since the pandemic, the Brothers of Italy won the Italian general election in 2022 and Javier Milei took the Argentinian presidency in 2023. For most of this period, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud has ruled Israel in coalition with far-right parties. Even where it is not in power, the far right is gaining, as in France and Germany. In the long view, the defeat of Trump in 2020 and Bolsonaro in 2022 were predictable oscillations in a general pattern of ascent. Why does the far right keep winning? Is it \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d, as James Carville put it during Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential run? The idea that far-right voting reflects a protest by the economically \u201cleft behind\u201d is quite popular. There is a kernel of truth to this: the state of the economy was the single biggest motive for Trump voters in 2024. Liberals, snarking about the \u201cvibecession\u201d \u2013 the mistaken belief by the public that the economy is in recession \u2013 say GDP is growing and inflation is modest at 2.4%. But headline figures don\u2019t reflect how most people experience the economy. Prices are 20% higher than before the pandemic and, more importantly, prices for essentials such as food are up 28%. Household debt was a major stress factor. Biden also cut a raft of popular benefits established during the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, most people don\u2019t believe the headline figures. Yet this narrative barely scratches the surface. First, the evidence suggests that people don\u2019t always vote with their wallets: studies from the 20th century up to the present show that simple measures of economic self-interest aren\u2019t a very good predictor of voting behaviour. The economy matters, of course, but not as a simple metric of aggregate wellbeing. It is a space in which people judge their personal standing relative to how they perceive the state of society. Personal setbacks are generally only politicised when they are perceived as part of a wider crisis. Second, while the far right can\u2019t win without gaining some working-class support, in the US, Brazil, India and the Philippines, it relies on a bedrock of middle-class support. Besides, millions regularly have their economic lives wrecked without going far right: the poorest in most societies generally aren\u2019t very susceptible to their message. Third, in strictly material terms the economic offer of today\u2019s far right is paltry, yet incumbency has been incredibly forgiving for nationalist governments. In India, after average consumer expenditure fell, Modi was re-elected in 2019 with a 6% swing. In the Philippines, as the number of \u201cpoor\u201d Filipinos surged, Duterte\u2019s successor Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr won 58% of the vote in 2022 \u2013 an increase of almost 20 points. Even in defeat, they do surprisingly well. Average incomes rose more slowly under Trump than his predecessor, yet he added 10 million voters to his base in 2020. And if people voted with their wallets, why would many working-class Americans back a candidate committed to cutting taxes for the rich? The political effects of economic misery are more indirect than \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d implies. Economic shocks are mediated by the existing emotional currents in society. The middle-class and more affluent workers can identify with the rich and resent the poor, migrants and \u201cspongers\u201d who threaten their lifestyle. Mostly resentment results in impotent complaint. Hit by shocks, most people are ill-placed to confront their causes and tend to withdraw from politics. Today\u2019s far right offers a different answer \u2013 what the political theorist William Connolly calls a \u201cpolitics of existential revenge\u201d. It replaces real disasters with imaginary disasters. Trump warns of \u201ccommunist\u201d takeover and amplifies the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory. His supporters rail against \u201cwhite genocide\u201d and satanic child-molesting elites. Instead of opposing injustice, they vilify those who threaten social hierarchies like class, race and gender. Instead of confronting systems, they give you enemies you can kill. This is disaster nationalism. It runs deeper than elections. Rising from the cauldrons of cyberfascism, \u201clone wolf\u201d murders have increased since 2010. Pogroms have erupted in Delhi and the West Bank. In the US, vigilantes attacked Black Lives Matter protesters. Britain and Ireland have been shaken by racist riots. And in recent years, there have been bungled \u201cinsurrections\u201d such as the storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters in January 2021 and the trucker blockades intended to block Lula\u2019s accession to power in Brazil.

Bolsonaro came from nearly 20 points behind to almost winning after a summer of deadly violence. Addressing economic issues will defuse some of this. David Brooks acknowledges in the New York Times that Harris\u2019s centrism \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d and that the Democrats may need to \u201cembrace a Bernie Sanders-style disruption\u201d.

Starmer became the first UK leader to attend France\u2019s national commemoration event since Winston Churchill in 1944. No 10 and the \u00c9lys\u00e9e are said to be hoping the meeting will be a significant European moment for France and the UK, two leading Nato powers, amid fears on the continent about the future of the alliance after Trump\u2019s re-election. The prime minister flew to Paris early on Monday to attend the event with French and British veterans. He also had a breakfast reception with representatives of the British defence community in France. A spokesperson for No 10 said Starmer and Macron discussed how to put Ukraine in a strong position. \u201cThe leaders started by discussing the situation in Ukraine, including how best to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position going into the winter,\u201d they said. \u201cTurning to the Middle East, both underscored their deep concern at the situation in Gaza and Lebanon.

On Sunday, a UK cabinet minister said the government was examining all possible options in terms of a potential change of approach to Ukraine by the US. Whitehall officials were \u201cconsidering and planning lots of different scenarios\u201d, Darren Jones told Sky News on Sunday. Jones said the UK would not be stepping back from its own commitments. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any countenance of the idea that we\u2019re stepping back from that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re offering them \u00a33bn a year, which you know, in the fiscal context here in the UK, is difficult but the right decision for us,\u201d he said. \u201cOfficials will be considering and planning lots of different scenarios \u2013 as they would do under any administration \u2013 to make sure that the UK is in the strongest possible position.\u201d However, Jones said he would not specifically commit to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the current parliament, saying security and defence were a priority but that meant \u201ctrade-offs\u201d in other areas. Military experts have said the incoming Trump administration has given new impetus to the need for Nato allies to \u201cmend fences\u201d. Dr Karin von Hippel, the director of the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said it was a symbolic moment to have the French president and Starmer stand united. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the United Kingdom and the EU to mend fences and forge a stronger relationship now that Trump has won. The same applies to UK bilateral relations with European countries. \u201cAmerica will no longer be a reliable partner for any European country, including the UK. So as much bridge building and scenario planning that can be done now is critical, including deciding where they will push back on the United States when they disagree.\u201d In Paris on Monday, Starmer will also meet the new French prime minister, Michel Barnier, the former Brexit negotiator whom Starmer met several times as shadow Brexit secretary. Starmer said: \u201cI am honoured to be in Paris to stand united with President Macron in tribute to the fallen of the first world war who made the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom we enjoy today. \u201cThese events are vital in ensuring the memory of millions of young soldiers, sailors and aviators live on for generations to come.\u201d Announcing the visit, Starmer promised \u00a310m of government funds for the 80th anniversaries of VE Day and VJ Day on 8 May and 15 August next year, promising events to involve tens of thousands of military personnel. The prime minister has repeatedly said the UK\u2019s commitment to Ukraine would be \u201cironclad\u201d no matter the US president\u2019s approach, although officials in Kyiv have told the Guardian they are frustrated over Britain\u2019s failure to supply additional long-range missiles. On Sunday, the UK\u2019s chief of the defence staff said approximately 1,500 Russian troops were being killed and injured every day. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said Russia was still paying an \u201cextraordinary price\u201d for Putin\u2019s invasion and October was the worst month for losses since the conflict began in February 2022. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 November 2024. The Armistice Day event in Paris marked the formal ending of the first world war, not \u201cthe 80th anniversary of the start of the liberation of France\u201d in the second world war, as an earlier version said.",

      "body": "<h2>Arsenal deliver at last</h2> <p>Five goals, five different goalscorers and a clean sheet \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s performance against Brighton felt like it was a long time coming. So often this season they have created chances but not been clinical. On Friday night, however, they were in the mood, producing a high-intensity first half that left Brighton shell-shocked. Beth Mead and Emily Fox combined brilliantly down the right, Katie McCabe and Caitlin Foord equally so down the left to exploit the weakness of the visitors\u2019 full-backs and fallible defensive structure. A trademark Mead goal reminded fans of more fruitful times, a spectacular finish from Frida Maanum the same. The special moment of the night, however, belonged to Lina Hurtig. Her 76th-minute header was her first goal in 362 days, a perfect return after the Sweden winger had spent the best part of the last year on the sidelines. <strong>SD</strong></p> <h2>Creative Hemp shows her importance</h2> <p>The Manchester City winger Lauren Hemp made another strong case for being the best winger in the WSL by providing a hat-trick of assists in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/08/manchester-city-tottenham-womens-super-league-match-report\">their 4-0 victory at home to Tottenham</a>. The Jamaica striker Khadija Shaw grabbed the headlines with her three goals but it was Hemp\u2019s own, different kind of treble that took her up to a division-leading five assists from seven games. Hemp was tried on both flanks by the Manchester City head coach, Gareth Taylor, who said: \u201cLauren has been top. She had a lot of joy playing against their right-back over on the other side. Against [Ashleigh] Neville [who is right-footed] it was quite a challenge for her, cutting on the inside, but that allowed [Kerstin] Casparij to get a little bit further forward. I\u2019m a big fan of Lauren\u2019s. She\u2019s such a big player for this team, in a very good team and her relationship with Jill [Roord] on the left side and Leila [Ouahabi] and obviously Bunny [Shaw] has been really good.\u201d <strong>TG</strong></p> <h2>De Pauw frustration at winless Villa</h2> <p>Robert de Pauw was a frustrated figure following Aston Villa\u2019s 0-0 draw with Manchester United and said he is sick of seeing his team drop points. Villa enjoyed more possession and had more shots than United at Leigh Sports Village but failed to make the most of them. The result leaves them 11th in the WSL table, level with Everton. Although De Pauw was pleased with his team\u2019s performance he is still longing for that first WSL victory. \u201cI am a little bit sick of good performances without the three points,\u201d the Villa manager said. \u201cThat frustrates me still. But I am proud of the way the girls played, they showed fire and determination from the beginning.\u201d <strong>EH</strong></p>    <h2>Bompastor hails her two \u2018No 1s\u2019</h2> <p>The England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton may have kept a fourth clean sheet in six WSL starts this season with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/liverpool-chelsea-wsl-match-report\">Chelsea\u2019s 3-0 win at Liverpool</a> but the Blues manager, Sonia Bompastor, insists that both Hampton and Zecira Musovic are \u201cNo 1s\u201d in her team. The Sweden keeper has been favoured for both of Chelsea\u2019s Women\u2019s Champions League matches so far this term and therefore looks set to start away at Celtic on Wednesday, but Bompastor says: \u201cIt was not on purpose to do that, to give one competition to one keeper and the other competition to another one. It\u2019s just like making sure both of them get games, because they deserve it. I have the chance to have two really good goalkeepers. For me, they are both No 1s. I told them that. They know. Performance is obviously really important for them. There is a very good competition between them.\u201d <strong>TG</strong></p> <h2>Can Hammers build on crucial win?</h2> <p>West Ham were dominant in their 1-0 defeat of Leicester City, their first win of the season. Viviane Asseyi, who collected Manuela Pavi\u2019s perfectly weighted through-ball before rounding the keeper and slotting in, said: \u201cThe last game we also dominated and we didn\u2019t have a victory at the end. Today\u2019s good because the work finally paid off and we have to keep going because it\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d The win has come at a critical time for the Hammers, with Brighton up next followed by fellow relegation battlers Crystal Palace and Aston Villa before the winter break. Three points were enough to put Rehanne Skinner\u2019s side up to ninth but it will also fill them with confidence heading into games where they have a realistic chance of hauling themselves further away from the relegation zone. <strong>SW</strong></p> <h2>Palace \u2018not quite there\u2019 with WSL rivals</h2> <p>Laura Kaminski said her Crystal Palace side are not quite on par with their WSL rivals after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/wsl-roundup-relegation-everton-crystal-palace-leicester-west-ham-aston-villa\">dropping points against Everton</a>. Palace took the lead just 29 seconds into Sunday\u2019s match through Indiah-Paige Riley but failed to make the most of their chances for the rest of the game. Honoka Hayashi went on to equalise for Everton with about 20 minutes left. After the match, Kaminski argued that her team\u2019s lack of top-tier experience is the main reason they have struggled to rack up points. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not quite there yet,\u201d the Crystal Palace manager said. \u201cWe\u2019re seven games into the WSL and I\u2019m asking the players to bury chances like we\u2019ve been here seven years!\u201d <strong>EH</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/961\"> <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table table--football table--striped\"> <thead> <tr> <th class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\"><abbr title=\"Position\">Pos</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Team</th> <th class=\"football-stat--played\"><abbr title=\"Played\">P</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--difference\"><abbr title=\"Goal difference\">GD</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--points\"><abbr title=\"Points\">Pts</abbr></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">1</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man City Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">12</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">19</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Chelsea Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">20</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">18</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">13</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Arsenal Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">12</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man Utd Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">12</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Liverpool FC Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">9</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Tottenham Hotspur Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">7</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Leicester Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">5</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">9</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">West Ham Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">5</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">10</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Crystal Palace Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-13</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">5</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">11</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Aston Villa Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">3</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">12</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Everton Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-11</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">3</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> </figure>",

She\u2019s such a big player for this team, in a very good team and her relationship with Jill [Roord] on the left side and Leila [Ouahabi] and obviously Bunny [Shaw] has been really good.\u201d TG De Pauw frustration at winless Villa Robert de Pauw was a frustrated figure following Aston Villa\u2019s 0-0 draw with Manchester United and said he is sick of seeing his team drop points. Villa enjoyed more possession and had more shots than United at Leigh Sports Village but failed to make the most of them. The result leaves them 11th in the WSL table, level with Everton. Although De Pauw was pleased with his team\u2019s performance he is still longing for that first WSL victory. \u201cI am a little bit sick of good performances without the three points,\u201d the Villa manager said. \u201cThat frustrates me still. But I am proud of the way the girls played, they showed fire and determination from the beginning.\u201d EH Bompastor hails her two \u2018No 1s\u2019 The England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton may have kept a fourth clean sheet in six WSL starts this season with Chelsea\u2019s 3-0 win at Liverpool but the Blues manager, Sonia Bompastor, insists that both Hampton and Zecira Musovic are \u201cNo 1s\u201d in her team. The Sweden keeper has been favoured for both of Chelsea\u2019s Women\u2019s Champions League matches so far this term and therefore looks set to start away at Celtic on Wednesday, but Bompastor says: \u201cIt was not on purpose to do that, to give one competition to one keeper and the other competition to another one. It\u2019s just like making sure both of them get games, because they deserve it. I have the chance to have two really good goalkeepers. For me, they are both No 1s. I told them that. They know. Performance is obviously really important for them. There is a very good competition between them.\u201d TG Can Hammers build on crucial win? West Ham were dominant in their 1-0 defeat of Leicester City, their first win of the season. Viviane Asseyi, who collected Manuela Pavi\u2019s perfectly weighted through-ball before rounding the keeper and slotting in, said: \u201cThe last game we also dominated and we didn\u2019t have a victory at the end. Today\u2019s good because the work finally paid off and we have to keep going because it\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d The win has come at a critical time for the Hammers, with Brighton up next followed by fellow relegation battlers Crystal Palace and Aston Villa before the winter break. Three points were enough to put Rehanne Skinner\u2019s side up to ninth but it will also fill them with confidence heading into games where they have a realistic chance of hauling themselves further away from the relegation zone. SW Palace \u2018not quite there\u2019 with WSL rivals Laura Kaminski said her Crystal Palace side are not quite on par with their WSL rivals after dropping points against Everton. Palace took the lead just 29 seconds into Sunday\u2019s match through Indiah-Paige Riley but failed to make the most of their chances for the rest of the game. Honoka Hayashi went on to equalise for Everton with about 20 minutes left. After the match, Kaminski argued that her team\u2019s lack of top-tier experience is the main reason they have struggled to rack up points. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not quite there yet,\u201d the Crystal Palace manager said. \u201cWe\u2019re seven games into the WSL and I\u2019m asking the players to bury chances like we\u2019ve been here seven years!\u201d EH",

This was nothing like that. It was a sign of progress but if the prize was much closer, it evaded the touch. \u201cThey had been in the game,\u201d wrote Nils Weber of Hamburger Morgenpost. \u201cNot always on equal terms with their clearly superior opponents, but within reach of something tangible until the final whistle. Promoted team against title favourites. The final result actually looks really good. They held up well but didn\u2019t take anything tangible home with them. That hurt.\u201d</p> \n<p>It may have done but this was a day \u2013 a weekend \u2013 for focusing on what football could be, not just what it is. A weekend to celebrate. St Pauli have a new plan to close the gap, if not to Bayern then to other potential top-flight competitors. It was announced at the beginning of last month that this most socialist of clubs had a plan to be able to exist at the top table in the modern world. A cooperative of supporters would buy a majority stake in Millerntor, raising tens of millions to support a club whose community-focused ethos has compelled it to reject commercial deals from gambling or crypto enterprises, for example.</p> \n<p>And for all the past week at the Millerntor, the building\u2019s facade heralded the future. The large club crest was covered with the badge of the cooperative formed to purchase the stadium as the initiative got set to launch. The initial take-up has been strong. St Pauli announced on Monday morning that 6,650 individuals have already become part of Football Cooperative Sankt Pauli eG, pledging a collective sum of \u20ac8,661,500. \u201cWe have experienced a huge rush,\u201d said the cooperative board\u2019s spokesman Andreas Borcherding, \u201cand we are looking forward to working with the members of the cooperative.\u201d There is a way to go. The cooperative aims to raise up to \u20ac30m in total, with each share costing \u20ac850, the minimum investment, but the emphatic response has stoked real optimism. \u201cAll of this shows us that the time is absolutely ripe for a different kind of football,\u201d underlined club president Oke G\u00f6ttlich, \u201cand a different kind of financing in professional football.\u201d</p> \n<p>St Pauli\u2019s particular image and character is without doubt a selling point. Millerntor is a \u201cspecial\u201d place, as Vincent Kompany was moved to say after the game. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many better things than watching a football match here,\u201d added his sporting director Christoph Freund. So St Pauli preserving their greatest asset, while monetising and protecting it (there are club vetoes built in to prevent a covert hostile takeover), seems like it might be a masterstroke.</p> \n<p>On the pitch it might be more graft than craft. Eric Smith\u2019s block on Harry Kane to prevent the England captain from getting his customary goal, in which the Swedish defender injured himself, is indicative of the sort of investment Blessin\u2019s players are making. Their moment will come at the end of the month, when the next home game is against Holstein Kiel, the other promoted team and the one directly below <em>Die Kiezkicker</em> in the table, third-bottom against second-bottom.</p> \n<p>On the pitch bad runs are made to be broken. Off it a football club\u2019s home is sacred, and St Pauli\u2019s holds the key to their future and their sense of self, for this season and beyond.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"18ce9d24-b781-4bf6-b7d0-8b8c75d39914\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Union Berlin 0-0 Freiburg, Leipzig 0-0 M\u00f6nchengladbach, Werder Bremen 2-1 Holstein Kiel, St Pauli 0-1 Bayern Munich, Mainz 3-1 Dortmund, Bochum 1-1 Leverkusen, Heidenheim 1-3 Wolfsburg, Stuttgart 2-3 Eintracht, Augsburg 0-0 Hoffenheim</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Talking points</strong></h2> \n<p>\u2022 Bayern\u2019s reward for putting in the hard yards was a second successive weekend in which all their numbers came up, with Leizpig (now five points behind) held at home by an impressive Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, as were Bayer Leverkusen (nine points back) and Borussia Dortmund (10 behind) losing.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Leverkusen dropping points for the third Bundesliga game in a row wasn\u2019t really the story on Castroper Stra\u00dfe, as rock-bottom Bochum celebrated only a second point of the season via substitute Koji Miyoshi\u2019s smartly finished and thoroughly unexpected 89th-minute equaliser. The newly-appointed veteran coach Dieter Hecking (or Hec-KING, as Bild headlined) was the hero of the hour, though, for breathing life into their ailing season, despite having barely coached since leaving Hamburg in 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s an outstanding coach,\u201d enthused Bochum midfielder Gerrit Holtmann on the Hecking effect, \u201cone with charisma and aura. He gives us something and you simply believe everything he says. If he told me that I would play for Real Madrid, I would believe him.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Whether Dortmund\u2019s latest setback really constitutes a headline is also open to discussion. Their 3-1 loss at Mainz was not helped by Emre Can\u2019s early red card \u2013 playing 65 mins with 10 men was absolutely the last thing they needed given their current injury crisis \u2013 but this was another defensive disasterclass, yielding a sixth straight away defeat in all competitions. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with driving home from every city with a defeat. It\u2019s pissing me off,\u201d moaned Julian Brandt. It\u2019s not just a defensive issue either. After his howitzer in Hamburg Musiala has scored more in away Bundesliga games that Dortmund as a whole (five versus four).</p> \n<p>\u2022 Goals are coming more easily to Eintracht Frankfurt, with Omar Marmoush\u2019s sublime free-kick turning out to be the winner in a five-goal Sunday thriller at Stuttgart; the Egyptian forward now has 11 for the season, making him joint Bundesliga top scorer with Kane. Sebastian Hoeness\u2019s hosts almost managed a colossal comeback from 3-0 down, with what had initially appeared to be a stoppage-time equaliser by Chris F\u00fchrich ruled out after prolonged Stuttgart celebrations and then a lengthy VAR check. Captain Kevin Trapp, who also saved an Ermedin Demirovi\u0107 penalty, complained to Dazn that it was \u201cunacceptable that we stopped playing at 3-0 up\u201d but nevertheless, Eintracht sit pretty in third going into the international break.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Elsewhere there are concerns for two of the league\u2019s European adventurers. Heidenheim goalkeeper Kevin M\u00fcller had a nightmare as they slumped to a home loss against Wolfsburg, their fourth defeat in five, while Pellegrino Materazzo was fired on Monday after Hoffenheim\u2019s goalless draw at Augsburg left them fourth from bottom with just nine points from the 10 games.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

On the pitch bad runs are made to be broken. Off it a football club\u2019s home is sacred, and St Pauli\u2019s holds the key to their future and their sense of self, for this season and beyond. Talking points \u2022 Bayern\u2019s reward for putting in the hard yards was a second successive weekend in which all their numbers came up, with Leizpig (now five points behind) held at home by an impressive Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, as were Bayer Leverkusen (nine points back) and Borussia Dortmund (10 behind) losing. \u2022 Leverkusen dropping points for the third Bundesliga game in a row wasn\u2019t really the story on Castroper Stra\u00dfe, as rock-bottom Bochum celebrated only a second point of the season via substitute Koji Miyoshi\u2019s smartly finished and thoroughly unexpected 89th-minute equaliser. The newly-appointed veteran coach Dieter Hecking (or Hec-KING, as Bild headlined) was the hero of the hour, though, for breathing life into their ailing season, despite having barely coached since leaving Hamburg in 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s an outstanding coach,\u201d enthused Bochum midfielder Gerrit Holtmann on the Hecking effect, \u201cone with charisma and aura. He gives us something and you simply believe everything he says. If he told me that I would play for Real Madrid, I would believe him.\u201d \u2022 Whether Dortmund\u2019s latest setback really constitutes a headline is also open to discussion. Their 3-1 loss at Mainz was not helped by Emre Can\u2019s early red card \u2013 playing 65 mins with 10 men was absolutely the last thing they needed given their current injury crisis \u2013 but this was another defensive disasterclass, yielding a sixth straight away defeat in all competitions. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with driving home from every city with a defeat. It\u2019s pissing me off,\u201d moaned Julian Brandt. It\u2019s not just a defensive issue either. After his howitzer in Hamburg Musiala has scored more in away Bundesliga games that Dortmund as a whole (five versus four). \u2022 Goals are coming more easily to Eintracht Frankfurt, with Omar Marmoush\u2019s sublime free-kick turning out to be the winner in a five-goal Sunday thriller at Stuttgart; the Egyptian forward now has 11 for the season, making him joint Bundesliga top scorer with Kane. Sebastian Hoeness\u2019s hosts almost managed a colossal comeback from 3-0 down, with what had initially appeared to be a stoppage-time equaliser by Chris F\u00fchrich ruled out after prolonged Stuttgart celebrations and then a lengthy VAR check. Captain Kevin Trapp, who also saved an Ermedin Demirovi\u0107 penalty, complained to Dazn that it was \u201cunacceptable that we stopped playing at 3-0 up\u201d but nevertheless, Eintracht sit pretty in third going into the international break. \u2022 Elsewhere there are concerns for two of the league\u2019s European adventurers. Heidenheim goalkeeper Kevin M\u00fcller had a nightmare as they slumped to a home loss against Wolfsburg, their fourth defeat in five, while Pellegrino Materazzo was fired on Monday after Hoffenheim\u2019s goalless draw at Augsburg left them fourth from bottom with just nine points from the 10 games.",

The 23-year-old, who is giving evidence at Woolwich crown court, initially pleaded not guilty to escaping from HMP Wandsworth in south-west London in September 2023. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told jurors on Monday she had asked Khalife if he wanted the escape charge to be put to him again. When it was, he said: \u201cI\u2019m guilty.\u201d He continues to deny gathering information useful to an enemy, collecting a list of Special Forces soldiers that would be useful for terrorism, and perpetrating a bomb hoax. Khalife escaped from the prison by clinging to the underside of a food delivery truck using a sling made from kitchen trousers. After his recapture he claimed he was hoping to be kept in a high-security unit (HSU) at a different prison, the court had previously heard. The court heard he made a fake escape attempt on 21 August in the hope he would be moved to the HSU but decided that a genuine escape was his only option after the incident was not reported to senior prison staff. Khalife wanted to be kept in the HSU at HMP Belmarsh \u2013 a prison within a prison holding some of the country\u2019s most dangerous criminals \u2013 because he believed he would be safer there, the court heard. Five days before his successful escape, he attached a sling to the underside of the lorry made from kitchen trousers and carabiners. The sling \u201cwasn\u2019t spotted at Wandsworth gate or any other prison\u201d, Khalife said. \u201cWhen the tail lift raised it covered me entirely,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf the makeshift sling wasn\u2019t noticed, they\u2019re hardly going to notice me.\u201d While on the run, Khalife bought clothes from Marks &amp; Spencer and a coffee from McDonald\u2019s, and walked beside the River Thames before being caught by police three days later. \u201cI accept that I left the prison and I didn\u2019t have any permission,\u201d he told jurors. \u201cI was never a real spy.

When flash floods inundated </em><em>Nova Scotia</em><em>, she was working at a group home and raising her two boys, aged </em><em>six and 11. Those floods would result in the death of her youngest son.</em></p> \n<p>Before the floods, I was always with my boys. Always. I never got a sitter. I wasn\u2019t dating. If I was off on a weekend, I never wanted to let the boys go. We would do all sorts of stuff together: watching movies, going to the park, or outside with the animals. They always wanted to go swimming or the splash pad. We would skip school and go to the skating rink, which I got in trouble for from the principal. If I didn\u2019t get them out of the house, all I would hear was two kids, five years apart, tussling.</p> \n<p>They had a strong bond with one another. Alex, my oldest son, would let Colton sleep with him and they would make forts. He\u2019s younger at heart than Colton was. The age gap helped because Alex was like: \u201cI don\u2019t have to grow up so fast.\u201d He\u2019s still anti-girl, whereas Colton was like: \u201cI\u2019ll take all the girlfriends.\u201d He was always a charmer. I would be brushing my hair and even if I looked like crap, he\u2019d go: \u201cMommy, you\u2019re still beautiful.\u201d He was probably doing it to everybody else because he knew it was just buttering us all up.</p> \n<p>Colton was our glue. I have a lot of pictures of the three of us and he\u2019s in the middle. I have a picture of him standing shirtless in front of a little pile of wood. He was just a hard worker. His brother loved it because he got out of half the stuff that I asked him to do. Where his brother still doesn\u2019t know what he wants to do, Colton knew what he wanted to do. He\u2019s like: \u201cI\u2019m going to do 4-H and I want to do Scouts.\u201d He was still too young to do most of those. He never got those chances.</p> \n<p><strong>I knew early on something wasn\u2019t right. All day long, it had thundered. I love thunder and lightning storms, or I should say I loved them.</strong></p> \n<p>Colton loved it just about as much as I did. He and I used to listen to thunder and lightning on my phone, put it beside the bed, and we would fall asleep to it. It started around 10am. It\u2019d be light, then it would be intense, and then it\u2019d be light. I found it very strange.</p> \n<p>Colton was in and out of the house that day. I had to sleep for a night shift. He was at an age where he could entertain himself and just pop in if he really needed something. His brother was around and capable of watching him. He just prides himself so much in being a big brother.</p> \n<p>I didn\u2019t sleep that day. I tried. If I did sleep, I slept maybe 30 minutes. The rain really started around 7pm when I came on shift.</p> \n<p>It started raining so hard. I kept checking the radar and it kept saying it was going to end. It never stopped. You wouldn\u2019t even have a break between thunder and lightning. You would see lightning and thunder at the exact same moments. I remember screaming in the middle of my yard the next morning: \u201cWould it just stop fucking raining!?\u201d So much happened in the middle. It was like doomsday. It was like doomsday. I can\u2019t even grasp it to this day.</p> \n<p>I touched base with Chris, Colton\u2019s dad. He had just picked Colton up. I don\u2019t know why but I begged him to spend the night at my house. I was like: \u201cPlease just turn around. Can you just please spend the night and watch Colton at my house?\u201d I remember Chris saying to me a couple days later I should have just screamed at him. He was like: \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to go to Brooklyn [in Nova Scotia].\u201d I said: \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s fine. I know Colton wants to see Natalie.\u201d</p> \n<p>Natalie lives next door in the same duplex. He hadn\u2019t seen her in about a month. She was a grade ahead of Colton. Natalie would tell her mom: \u201cColton\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201d I\u2019m not 100% sure if Colton was really into that. But, for a little six-year-old, he loved saying he had a girlfriend.</p> \n<p>Chris touched base with me a couple of times and was like: \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to bed.\u201d I was in the mind frame of: \u201cOK, they\u2019re sleeping, they\u2019re fine.\u201d I got my one client to sleep by 12.30am. I had been scrolling Facebook and seen they were calling for an emergency alert on the scanner.</p> \n<p>I remember hearing: \u201cI need that emergency alert. I needed it a half-hour ago.\u201d My other client got up just as I heard there was massive flooding in Brooklyn. I was like: I\u2019ll just take care of her and then I\u2019ll call Chris. I wish I had called him then because it took me 15 minutes, and 15 minutes is what he says he would have needed.</p> \n<p>I called him at 2.28am. He answered the phone. I think he said \u201cshit\u201d. He was touching water when he put his feet over the bed and got up. He went to the side door and flicked on the porch light. He watched the shed float by the door as I was on the phone with him. He was panicked. It was his voice. It was nothing but panic.</p> \n<p>I told him, \u201cCall 911,\u201d and that I would try to call and wake up Natalie\u2019s parents, Nick and Courtney. I did not reach anybody. I called my dad, told him Chris was in trouble, that Chris was going to try and get to his mother\u2019s and call me. That was a call I never got.</p> \n<p>After Chris got off the phone with me, he called 911. While he was on the phone with 911, the house started to crack like a tree coming down. It was the water pushing against the house. There was so much water his side door wouldn\u2019t open. He debated if it was shallow enough to put the dog and Colton out the front window. He didn\u2019t want to do that so he went back to the side door. The pressure had eased up enough that the door opened. As he was walking out to the driveway, dog in one hand and Colton in the other, his truck floated away.</p> \n<p>When he got to the front of the house, Nick and Courtney were trying to open their door and they couldn\u2019t because of the pressure inside. It took Chris pushing and Nick and Courtney pulling. They got the door open and that\u2019s when Chris watched a tractor-trailer drive through and get taken where his truck had already got swept off into the water. Chris, Nick and Courtney made the decision to get into Nick\u2019s Ford F-450. They put Natalie, Colton, Courtney and her two-year-old son, Christian, in the back seat. They had one dog and Chris\u2019s dogs. They left a cat and a dog named Skye in the house because Skye was too scared. The water just kept rising.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/2024-cop/climate-breakdown-reporting-team\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I was dialling phone numbers, trying to get in relief staff. It\u2019s almost like a dream when you\u2019re trying to dial 911 and you can\u2019t hit the numbers. Every number was like that. I couldn\u2019t press the buttons into the phone without having to stop and try it again. I had gone back on to the scanner and I heard there was a family stuck on Highway 14 in Brooklyn along the dyke. I only knew one family there. I knew it was Chris, his neighbours and the kids.</p> \n<p>I tried to call Chris and it just went to voicemail. I remember hearing on the scanner that there\u2019s a child in the water. I was hoping I misheard. I walked outside, down the stairs, to check on the other part of the building because there were clients there as well. I was soaked. It was raining so hard. I stopped. I couldn\u2019t move. I was frozen in more than one way. I have never been this cold in my life. I remember saying: \u201cNo, Colton. Please no. God, no.\u201d I was pleading with the rain and lightning.</p> \n<p>I eventually did move. I went next door and got a hold of another colleague. When she did arrive at 4.30am, I repeated to her: \u201cGrace, he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s gone, Grace. He\u2019s cold. He\u2019s cold. I feel it. He\u2019s cold.\u201d I don\u2019t remember much of that, but I guess I just said it over and over again. In the meantime, my dad called my mom, woke her up, had my uncle go out and get her. When she showed up, I was the same. At about 5am I made my way to Chris\u2019s mother\u2019s with my mom. I waited for the rain to stop. I waited for the thunder to stop. It never stopped.</p> \n<p>Around 5.20am I got a call from Truro hospital. I was like: \u201cYou have to be fucking kidding me. That hospital\u2019s not close. How am I going to get there?\u201d</p> \n<p>The nurse said: \u201cIs this Tera?\u201d I said: \u201cYes.\u201d She goes: \u201cI have good news. I have Chris here. He\u2019s in shock. But he\u2019s OK.\u201d I remember saying: \u201cThat\u2019s great, but what about Colton?\u201d She had said: \u201cColton?\u201d I went: \u201cYes, Colton, my son, he\u2019s six.\u201d She goes: \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s not here. We don\u2019t have him.\u201d</p> \n<p>I told my mom I had to go into town. I went to our community centre. The gentlemen said: \u201cThere\u2019s just families here.\u201d I was like: \u201cMy six-year-old\u2019s missing. I just need to look.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget the whispering looks and faces of concern. He wasn\u2019t there. I went to Windsor hospital. He wasn\u2019t there.</p> \n<p>Being desperate but not wanting to bug people trying to help other people, I made my way to the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] station where I asked if anybody had found him. I needed to get to Chris. Even though Chris and I are divorced, he was the only one who knew what happened to my baby. He was the only one who knew what happened to our baby.</p> \n<p>When my brother picked me up and we started making our way to Truro, we had to drive through Brooklyn. I remember seeing the road, not far around that bend where Chris lived, and it was barricaded. There were emergency vehicles, helicopters, cop cars and people wearing orange everywhere. I had taken Colton\u2019s stuffed duck that he stole from me. It was a gift from a friend. I wouldn\u2019t let go. I was crying. I put the seat reclined back so I didn\u2019t see the water.</p> \n<p>It was one hell of a drive. There were rocks on the road. There were roads we\u2019d get to and we\u2019d turn around. I remember putting up my seat knowing we were pretty much getting there and looking out the passenger window. There was a fair right in front of the hospital. There was a fucking fair. There was a ferris wheel. There were lights lit up. I just remember going: \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to see happiness.</p> \n<p>We drove up to a drop-off spot just as Chris was being discharged. I remember hugging him and Natalie\u2019s parents. We went to school together. I remember hugging everybody and crying. We just didn\u2019t have our babies. We didn\u2019t have our children. They didn\u2019t have their little girl and I didn\u2019t have my little boy. We didn\u2019t know what to say. We were just four parents gutted. We get in the car. Chris and I are crying. That\u2019s the first time I realized they didn\u2019t flee in Chris\u2019s truck. He goes: \u201cIt was gone.\u201d It took a day for Chris to tell me other facts. I heard bits and pieces of it on the drive home.</p> \n<p><strong>The hardest thing for people to understand is that they had nowhere to go. There was no way to get on the roof of the house. They had no hills. They had no high spots. The house was in the middle of a river.</strong></p> \n<p>Their only option was the truck. They had to back up to turn around in the driveway, which cost them valuable time. The truck was getting hung up on the new pavement. The water kept rising. They went to turn left out of the driveway and that\u2019s when the current on the left side of the house came so hard that it picked up the nose of the truck.</p> \n<p>As it picked up the nose of the truck, somebody said roll down the windows. They cranked down the windows and they got sucked out of the truck. Nobody even had a chance to grab Colton and Natalie. The water gave them no option. Nick went out one window. Courtney and her two-year-old went out one window. And Chris went out the other. Chris was the last one holding on to the truck. It had gone sideways.</p> \n<p>Chris had a hold of the window ledge with his foot. Chris lost hold of the truck and was swept away when he tried to throw himself down into the water to get the kids. I\u2019d heard the emergency alert go off at 3.06am, Colton would have been dead almost half an hour.</p> \n<p>It was a long drive back home into Windsor. I had friends show up to try and comfort me and Chris. I remember friends trying to make me eat. I remember my eyes hurting.</p> \n<p>I think somebody gave me lorazepam. I went to sleep and I did not turn. I woke up around 6am and I thought I heard Colton tiptoeing into my room. I swore it was Colton tiptoeing into my room. He rarely missed sleeping with me. I realized, when I scooched back in my bed and threw the blanket back, he wasn\u2019t there. That\u2019s when I realized that it was real and everything that happened the night before came flooding back.</p> \n<p>I got up, grabbed one of Colton\u2019s stuffies, and walked outside. I sat on the front doorstep. Dump trucks started driving by and lining up around the corner. I was like: \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d I live on a dead-end road. I walked down and the end of my road was gone. It was gone. A tiny river we have had just taken a road and cut off six houses. At the end of their driveway was a 3ft drop or more. I remember standing there with his stuffy, seeing a neighbour, and the neighbour going: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I walked home and realized my neighbours had taken my animals and taken care of them. I didn\u2019t realize half my shed was ready to fall down.</p> \n<p><strong>I remember my chest was so tight. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I was struggling to process \u201cColton\u2019s not coming home\u201d.</strong></p> \n<p>I remember calling our mental health crisis line. They called me back and went: \u201cWell, our mental health crisis van can meet you at 11.30 but it does not go to rural municipalities. You have to drive to Sackville, maybe Mount Uniacke.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to drive 40 minutes to Sackville. I didn\u2019t want to leave Hants County. All I could remember thinking was: \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just come here?\u201d</p> \n<p>At this point, I hadn\u2019t told Alex. His dad, Edward, and I had a brief conversation about taking his phone because his friends had Facebook and were starting to message him if Colton was OK. He was 3km away from where Colton died in Brooklyn. My dad went with me and I remember driving around the barricade again and seeing all the people searching. I got to Alex\u2019s dad\u2019s and went in. Alex looked at me and goes: \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d I went: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> \n<p>I said: \u201cAll those helicopters you see and hear that are flying over above you \u2026\u201d He goes: \u201cYes.\u201d I said: \u201cThey\u2019re looking for your brother and they\u2019re looking for Natalie.\u201d I remember him looking at me and going: \u201cIs there any chance they\u2019re going to find him?\u201d I said: \u201cThere is a chance, but the more time that goes on, the worse those chances get.\u201d I couldn\u2019t take the hope out of him. He was trying to be hopeful and I just couldn\u2019t do it. He cried, but he cried with a blank look. His eyes just went dark. He wasn\u2019t mad, he wasn\u2019t sobbing. He just had these little tears and he was quiet.</p> \n<p>I remember me and his dad hugging him together. We were close. Colton called Edward \u201cUncle Eddie\u201d. I gave Alex the option to stay with me and he said: \u201cI\u2019m going to stay with Dad.\u201d I said: \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to see how I can help your brother.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then and there was when I decided I was going to ground search and rescue. And that\u2019s when I met the head of command, Jason Butler. Jason took me in and showed me where they were searching. He gave me the best update he could and offered to take me on site.</p> \n<p>This beautiful field that I once drove by every day was a lake. It was so hot and sunny. I just saw little bits of the truck that the kids were in. The house had moved off its foundation, across the front lawn, and was stopped by a tree. It smelled of rot and feces. The tractor-trailer that went in was filled with processed chicken. Septic tanks had been exposed.</p> \n<p>I chose to stay at ground search and rescue as much as I could. They told me, if you see people laughing, don\u2019t take it to heart. If you see people having a nap, don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have given it a second thought. It helped me to see them laughing because Colton was always down for a good joke. It didn\u2019t take me long to start asking how they are doing.</p> \n<p>I wanted them to know that I\u2019m Colton\u2019s mom. I am so thankful for you. I encouraged them to nap. I encourage them to rest. I learned to make jokes with them, smile with them, and tell them stories about Colton. I know some people made the comments that I needed to put myself first, but helping people was the best medicine I could have.</p> \n<p>The next day, my parents showed up with all my family. I remember my uncle coming. He had lost his wife in May. I gave him the biggest hug. I was like: \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that aunt Marlene went because she knew. The only reason I think I\u2019m going to be OK today is because she\u2019s got Colton.\u201d That day was the day they found Natalie. Some people had been searching a beach and found her. She was in the Minas Basin.</p> \n<p><strong>I remember going: \u201cOh God, what if he went out there? No, he has to be in the field.\u201d I remember looking out and going: \u201cHe could be anywhere.\u201d</strong></p> \n<p>There was so much mud on everything. The mud wasn\u2019t just on the ground. The mud was 10, 15ft up in the air. That\u2019s when it clued in they weren\u2019t just going to walk upon a little boy in a red shirt. They\u2019re going to come across a little boy covered in mud and he wouldn\u2019t be seen right away.</p> \n<p>Alex called and asked if he could stop in. He\u2019s always soft hearted and super kind. I made sure he didn\u2019t have to look and see how they were searching for Colton. But he was like: \u201cI want to look.\u201d He met Jason, looked at some of the stuff, and goes: \u201cMommy, I heard they found someone.\u201d I went, \u201cYes, buddy, they did.\u201d He goes: \u201cWho\u2019d they find.\u201d I said: \u201cNatalie.\u201d He goes: \u201cMom, did she say anything about Colton?\u201d I said: \u201cNo, she can\u2019t.\u201d That\u2019s when he knew his brother was never coming home. He knew but he just said: \u201cOh.\u201d</p> \n<p>The next day, I got a call from the RCMP. They said: \u201cWe finally got the field drained completely. We\u2019re going to search it this morning. Can you not come today just in case?\u201d I said: \u201cOK.\u201d That morning, I had gone to the Superstore. I bought these carnations that weren\u2019t even worth 50% off. They looked like the inside of a piece of salmon. But Colton had wanted to buy them for me before he died. I tried to go to the dollar store to buy these ugly earrings he also wanted me to buy that day. They weren\u2019t there. So I ordered a pair off Amazon the same morning.</p> \n<p>I remember Chris and I going to where Courtney and Nick were. I went out on the back deck and I got this strange message on my phone from a friend. She goes: \u201cWhere are you at?\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cNick and Courtney\u2019s grandmother\u2019s.\u201d I knew the RCMP were hunting me. I remember sitting in that rocking bench. I remember rocking back in it. I remember looking out on to the hill and there were windmills in the distance. I remember looking at the windmills. It wasn\u2019t long before the RCMP showed up and asked for some privacy with us. I remember them sitting down and they said they conducted a search of the field. They found a body. They believed it was Colton and that Colton is dead. I\u2019ve never felt such heartbreak and relief at the same time.</p> \n<p><strong>I remember getting upset with the coroner\u2019s office because I didn\u2019t want them to do an autopsy and they didn\u2019t give me a choice.</strong></p> \n<p>I remember saying to them: \u201cFine, can I just identify the body?\u201d They sent a picture through email to my brother because they didn\u2019t think I could do it.</p> \n<p>It would have been nice if I had somebody looking out for my interests and helping me advocate for what I want, even if I wasn\u2019t totally right, instead of me just taking the word for it and going: \u201cOK.\u201d I made one request and that was for them to keep him as close to Natalie as possible because I didn\u2019t want them separating again.</p> \n<p>Natalie was convinced she was going to marry Colton. They liked lighting off fireworks. They liked fishing in the river. There\u2019s a video of them making a water slide in the backyard. They needed to stay together. They had been beside each other when it happened. They were together and they went together.</p> \n<p>From there, the days drag. We had a very small family viewing on Saturday. It was like hitting a wall when I rounded the corner and I just saw his little body in this little white casket. We had him put in his Spider-Man costume and put the carnations he wanted me to have put on his chest. I wanted him to have a piece of his blankie. I didn\u2019t know what I expected when I put his blanket in his hand. I knew it was going to be stiff. But it still wasn\u2019t what I expected.</p> \n<p>After everybody left, the funeral director and I walked in holding Chris on either side. Chris cried really, really bad. Then, I went back in by myself, knelt down, put my head against the casket, and played with Colton\u2019s hair. His blond hair. I rubbed his chest and talked to him. I closed my eyes. I don\u2019t know if I was asleep. But, seeing him, it was the most peace I\u2019d been in. I must have stayed there for an hour. I remember Chris and the funeral director checking in to see if I was sleeping. I kissed Colton goodbye.</p> \n<p>I miss him so much. Working the way I was, I did not realize how much he was there for me. Alex will be like: \u201cMom, you need to go and have a nap.\u201d But he was doing what he should be doing, which was hanging out with his friends. Colton wanted to be there for me as much as I was there for him. If I was sitting on the couch and looked tired, he\u2019d be like: \u201cI got a blanket, not just for me, but for you too, Mom.\u201d</p> \n<p>If he was eating something, he always made a point to share with me. If I didn\u2019t feel like eating, he\u2019d always be like: \u201cOh, here\u2019s a snack, Mom, I got one for you too.\u201d Colton took care of me. It sounds weird to say it out loud. I\u2019m sure some people don\u2019t realize that until they sit there and think about their own situation and be like: \u201cWhoa.\u201d Colton was the main person taking care of me.</p> \n<p>The day we had him cremated, we all went out to the house. Ground search and rescue had been cleaning up that area. The field had been drained. The vehicles had been pulled out. We sat there and threw rocks at the house. There was something therapeutic in throwing rocks at something still standing in that area. We weren\u2019t supposed to go in the house but I did. The floor was all bubbled up. I remember seeing some of Colton\u2019s pictures on the wall and I took them down because I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of them ripping down the house with his pictures in it.</p> \n<p><strong>The next day was Natalie\u2019s funeral. Courtney asked me to wear my prom dress because Natalie never got a prom. She wanted everyone to look like a princess.</strong></p> \n<p>Somehow, after 13 years, I still fit into my prom dress. Not the most elegant fit. But I wore it. I sobbed so hard during Natalie\u2019s funeral. That\u2019s probably why I didn\u2019t sob at Colton\u2019s. They were back-to-back funerals.</p> \n<p>I couldn\u2019t find anything to wear. What does Spider-Man\u2019s mom wear? David\u2019s bridal had given me this beautiful dark blue gown. I overdressed, but Colton wouldn\u2019t have cared. He would have just called me beautiful. He was the only one in the world that ever called me beautiful like that all the time. My dad came out of the bathroom wearing a full-on Spider-Man costume. He says: \u201cAre you OK if I wear this?\u201d It was too tight in an area, but that\u2019s OK. I said: \u201cDad, of course. I\u2019m not going to tell you not to wear it.\u201d</p> \n<p>I chose the church because it was a church I used to attend and I didn\u2019t have to go to Brooklyn. Colton loved the building from the outside. When I got out to go in for his service, there were first responders \u2013 ground search and rescue, fire \u2013 all lined up. There were hundreds of people. There were people who wore Spider-Man shirts and blue and orange because his favourite colour was blue and orange. We walked down the aisle to Crazy Frog. We played Thunder by Imagine Dragons. I remember saying in my speech: \u201cWe debated not playing it, but it is Colton\u2019s favourite song so good luck to y\u2019all.\u201d We played Sunflower by Post Malone because he liked that song too and made us think of him. A little bit of exposure therapy.</p> \n<p>I remember telling everybody that it\u2019s OK. I remember addressing Colton\u2019s classmates and Alex\u2019s friends and saying that it\u2019s OK. It didn\u2019t feel right if I didn\u2019t try to talk to Colton\u2019s classmates. I remember saying Colton wouldn\u2019t want us sad forever. I had so many people that needed to know I was thankful and Colton would be thankful. I wouldn\u2019t have this closure and, really, no family would, if it wasn\u2019t for the hundreds of individuals who came forward to help. I got to see Colton. I got to see him one last time.</p> \n<p>Jason, who was in command those two days, and deputy fire chief Brett Tetanish, the man I heard on that scanner pleading for that alert, brought my boy home. It came full circle. Jason was paired up with Brett. I hold them very dear to me for what they found, and that was my boy. Because I know it wasn\u2019t rainbows and butterflies.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve had people come up to me since and say I saved lives with what I said at the funeral. That I mentally saved lives. That I\u2019m a hero. I don\u2019t feel like one. They\u2019re my heroes. It really didn\u2019t hit me, until months went by, what some of these people experienced while trying to search for these kids. I didn\u2019t realize how much my empathetic self was helping people. How I handled myself at ground search and rescue was more than just healing for me. It was healing for other people.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s when I made Colton\u2019s Facebook page. I post thoughts and opinions on the storm. It\u2019s good for me because I don\u2019t want to let go of it yet. Whether climate change is natural or we\u2019ve sped it up, we\u2019re not preparing ourselves for these weather events. It helps me regulate myself and know he\u2019s not forgotten.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s this whole generation of kids that are going to remember Colton. They write notes like: \u201cOh, Colton. I missed you today. Let\u2019s run for Colton even though he didn\u2019t have cancer.\u201d People should be proud of that and proud of their kids. One day, they\u2019ll remember they had a friend die in such a way. They are going to be like: \u201cThis is our world and we got to look out for everyone else.\u201d</p> \n<p>We ended the funeral with Bloody Mary by Lady Gaga because Colton liked watching Wednesday Addams and loved singing that too. I hugged people for two hours. Two hours of hugging strangers and political people. Somebody whispered to me: \u201cThey found her.\u201d There had been four people that had died. I remember driving to the funeral, looking out the window going: \u201cThere\u2019s still somebody missing.\u201d They were calling off the search. But the people who came to Colton\u2019s funeral still didn\u2019t give up. They didn\u2019t give up hope. She had been found in Advocate Harbor. They found her. They found her. I remember the church lighting up through the stained glass windows. It got really bright and I remember thinking: \u201cI\u2019m going to get through this.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>This testimonial was produced with the help of the <a href=\"https://climatedisasterproject.com/\">Climate Disaster Project</a>; thanks to Sean Holman, Aldyn Chwelos, Darren Schuettler, Ricardo Garcia, Cristine Gerk, Tracy Sherlock, Lisa Taylor.</em></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Design and development by</em> Harry Fischer <em>and</em> Pip Lev.</p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "Location Martock, Canada Disaster Nova Scotia floods, 2023 Tera works with people who have physical and mental disabilities and lives in the same rural municipality she grew up in: West Hants. When flash floods inundated Nova Scotia, she was working at a group home and raising her two boys, aged six and 11. Those floods would result in the death of her youngest son. Before the floods, I was always with my boys. Always. I never got a sitter. I wasn\u2019t dating. If I was off on a weekend, I never wanted to let the boys go. We would do all sorts of stuff together: watching movies, going to the park, or outside with the animals. They always wanted to go swimming or the splash pad. We would skip school and go to the skating rink, which I got in trouble for from the principal. If I didn\u2019t get them out of the house, all I would hear was two kids, five years apart, tussling. They had a strong bond with one another. Alex, my oldest son, would let Colton sleep with him and they would make forts. He\u2019s younger at heart than Colton was. The age gap helped because Alex was like: \u201cI don\u2019t have to grow up so fast.\u201d He\u2019s still anti-girl, whereas Colton was like: \u201cI\u2019ll take all the girlfriends.\u201d He was always a charmer. I would be brushing my hair and even if I looked like crap, he\u2019d go: \u201cMommy, you\u2019re still beautiful.\u201d He was probably doing it to everybody else because he knew it was just buttering us all up. Colton was our glue. I have a lot of pictures of the three of us and he\u2019s in the middle. I have a picture of him standing shirtless in front of a little pile of wood. He was just a hard worker. His brother loved it because he got out of half the stuff that I asked him to do. Where his brother still doesn\u2019t know what he wants to do, Colton knew what he wanted to do. He\u2019s like: \u201cI\u2019m going to do 4-H and I want to do Scouts.\u201d He was still too young to do most of those. He never got those chances. I knew early on something wasn\u2019t right. All day long, it had thundered. I love thunder and lightning storms, or I should say I loved them. Colton loved it just about as much as I did. He and I used to listen to thunder and lightning on my phone, put it beside the bed, and we would fall asleep to it. It started around 10am. It\u2019d be light, then it would be intense, and then it\u2019d be light. I found it very strange. Colton was in and out of the house that day. I had to sleep for a night shift. He was at an age where he could entertain himself and just pop in if he really needed something. His brother was around and capable of watching him. He just prides himself so much in being a big brother. I didn\u2019t sleep that day. I tried. If I did sleep, I slept maybe 30 minutes. The rain really started around 7pm when I came on shift. It started raining so hard. I kept checking the radar and it kept saying it was going to end. It never stopped. You wouldn\u2019t even have a break between thunder and lightning. You would see lightning and thunder at the exact same moments. I remember screaming in the middle of my yard the next morning: \u201cWould it just stop fucking raining!?\u201d So much happened in the middle. It was like doomsday. It was like doomsday. I can\u2019t even grasp it to this day. I touched base with Chris, Colton\u2019s dad. He had just picked Colton up. I don\u2019t know why but I begged him to spend the night at my house. I was like: \u201cPlease just turn around. Can you just please spend the night and watch Colton at my house?\u201d I remember Chris saying to me a couple days later I should have just screamed at him. He was like: \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to go to Brooklyn [in Nova Scotia].\u201d I said: \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s fine. I know Colton wants to see Natalie.\u201d Natalie lives next door in the same duplex. He hadn\u2019t seen her in about a month. She was a grade ahead of Colton. Natalie would tell her mom: \u201cColton\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201d I\u2019m not 100% sure if Colton was really into that. But, for a little six-year-old, he loved saying he had a girlfriend. Chris touched base with me a couple of times and was like: \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to bed.\u201d I was in the mind frame of: \u201cOK, they\u2019re sleeping, they\u2019re fine.\u201d I got my one client to sleep by 12.30am. I had been scrolling Facebook and seen they were calling for an emergency alert on the scanner. I remember hearing: \u201cI need that emergency alert. I needed it a half-hour ago.\u201d My other client got up just as I heard there was massive flooding in Brooklyn. I was like: I\u2019ll just take care of her and then I\u2019ll call Chris. I wish I had called him then because it took me 15 minutes, and 15 minutes is what he says he would have needed. I called him at 2.28am. He answered the phone. I think he said \u201cshit\u201d. He was touching water when he put his feet over the bed and got up. He went to the side door and flicked on the porch light. He watched the shed float by the door as I was on the phone with him. He was panicked. It was his voice. It was nothing but panic. I told him, \u201cCall 911,\u201d and that I would try to call and wake up Natalie\u2019s parents, Nick and Courtney. I did not reach anybody. I called my dad, told him Chris was in trouble, that Chris was going to try and get to his mother\u2019s and call me. That was a call I never got. After Chris got off the phone with me, he called 911. While he was on the phone with 911, the house started to crack like a tree coming down. It was the water pushing against the house. There was so much water his side door wouldn\u2019t open. He debated if it was shallow enough to put the dog and Colton out the front window. He didn\u2019t want to do that so he went back to the side door. The pressure had eased up enough that the door opened. As he was walking out to the driveway, dog in one hand and Colton in the other, his truck floated away. When he got to the front of the house, Nick and Courtney were trying to open their door and they couldn\u2019t because of the pressure inside. It took Chris pushing and Nick and Courtney pulling. They got the door open and that\u2019s when Chris watched a tractor-trailer drive through and get taken where his truck had already got swept off into the water. Chris, Nick and Courtney made the decision to get into Nick\u2019s Ford F-450. They put Natalie, Colton, Courtney and her two-year-old son, Christian, in the back seat. They had one dog and Chris\u2019s dogs. They left a cat and a dog named Skye in the house because Skye was too scared. The water just kept rising. I was dialling phone numbers, trying to get in relief staff. It\u2019s almost like a dream when you\u2019re trying to dial 911 and you can\u2019t hit the numbers. Every number was like that. I couldn\u2019t press the buttons into the phone without having to stop and try it again. I had gone back on to the scanner and I heard there was a family stuck on Highway 14 in Brooklyn along the dyke. I only knew one family there. I knew it was Chris, his neighbours and the kids. I tried to call Chris and it just went to voicemail. I remember hearing on the scanner that there\u2019s a child in the water. I was hoping I misheard. I walked outside, down the stairs, to check on the other part of the building because there were clients there as well. I was soaked. It was raining so hard. I stopped. I couldn\u2019t move. I was frozen in more than one way. I have never been this cold in my life. I remember saying: \u201cNo, Colton. Please no. God, no.\u201d I was pleading with the rain and lightning. I eventually did move. I went next door and got a hold of another colleague. When she did arrive at 4.30am, I repeated to her: \u201cGrace, he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s gone, Grace. He\u2019s cold. He\u2019s cold. I feel it. He\u2019s cold.\u201d I don\u2019t remember much of that, but I guess I just said it over and over again. In the meantime, my dad called my mom, woke her up, had my uncle go out and get her. When she showed up, I was the same. At about 5am I made my way to Chris\u2019s mother\u2019s with my mom. I waited for the rain to stop. I waited for the thunder to stop. It never stopped. Around 5.20am I got a call from Truro hospital. I was like: \u201cYou have to be fucking kidding me. That hospital\u2019s not close. How am I going to get there?\u201d The nurse said: \u201cIs this Tera?\u201d I said: \u201cYes.\u201d She goes: \u201cI have good news. I have Chris here. He\u2019s in shock. But he\u2019s OK.\u201d I remember saying: \u201cThat\u2019s great, but what about Colton?\u201d She had said: \u201cColton?\u201d I went: \u201cYes, Colton, my son, he\u2019s six.\u201d She goes: \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s not here. We don\u2019t have him.\u201d I told my mom I had to go into town. I went to our community centre. The gentlemen said: \u201cThere\u2019s just families here.\u201d I was like: \u201cMy six-year-old\u2019s missing. I just need to look.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget the whispering looks and faces of concern. He wasn\u2019t there. I went to Windsor hospital. He wasn\u2019t there. Being desperate but not wanting to bug people trying to help other people, I made my way to the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] station where I asked if anybody had found him. I needed to get to Chris. Even though Chris and I are divorced, he was the only one who knew what happened to my baby. He was the only one who knew what happened to our baby. When my brother picked me up and we started making our way to Truro, we had to drive through Brooklyn. I remember seeing the road, not far around that bend where Chris lived, and it was barricaded. There were emergency vehicles, helicopters, cop cars and people wearing orange everywhere. I had taken Colton\u2019s stuffed duck that he stole from me. It was a gift from a friend. I wouldn\u2019t let go. I was crying. I put the seat reclined back so I didn\u2019t see the water. It was one hell of a drive. There were rocks on the road. There were roads we\u2019d get to and we\u2019d turn around. I remember putting up my seat knowing we were pretty much getting there and looking out the passenger window. There was a fair right in front of the hospital. There was a fucking fair. There was a ferris wheel. There were lights lit up. I just remember going: \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to see happiness. We drove up to a drop-off spot just as Chris was being discharged. I remember hugging him and Natalie\u2019s parents. We went to school together. I remember hugging everybody and crying. We just didn\u2019t have our babies. We didn\u2019t have our children. They didn\u2019t have their little girl and I didn\u2019t have my little boy. We didn\u2019t know what to say. We were just four parents gutted. We get in the car. Chris and I are crying. That\u2019s the first time I realized they didn\u2019t flee in Chris\u2019s truck. He goes: \u201cIt was gone.\u201d It took a day for Chris to tell me other facts. I heard bits and pieces of it on the drive home. The hardest thing for people to understand is that they had nowhere to go. There was no way to get on the roof of the house. They had no hills. They had no high spots. The house was in the middle of a river. Their only option was the truck. They had to back up to turn around in the driveway, which cost them valuable time. The truck was getting hung up on the new pavement. The water kept rising. They went to turn left out of the driveway and that\u2019s when the current on the left side of the house came so hard that it picked up the nose of the truck. As it picked up the nose of the truck, somebody said roll down the windows. They cranked down the windows and they got sucked out of the truck. Nobody even had a chance to grab Colton and Natalie. The water gave them no option. Nick went out one window. Courtney and her two-year-old went out one window. And Chris went out the other. Chris was the last one holding on to the truck. It had gone sideways. Chris had a hold of the window ledge with his foot. Chris lost hold of the truck and was swept away when he tried to throw himself down into the water to get the kids. I\u2019d heard the emergency alert go off at 3.06am, Colton would have been dead almost half an hour. It was a long drive back home into Windsor. I had friends show up to try and comfort me and Chris. I remember friends trying to make me eat. I remember my eyes hurting. I think somebody gave me lorazepam. I went to sleep and I did not turn. I woke up around 6am and I thought I heard Colton tiptoeing into my room. I swore it was Colton tiptoeing into my room. He rarely missed sleeping with me. I realized, when I scooched back in my bed and threw the blanket back, he wasn\u2019t there. That\u2019s when I realized that it was real and everything that happened the night before came flooding back. I got up, grabbed one of Colton\u2019s stuffies, and walked outside. I sat on the front doorstep. Dump trucks started driving by and lining up around the corner. I was like: \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d I live on a dead-end road. I walked down and the end of my road was gone. It was gone. A tiny river we have had just taken a road and cut off six houses. At the end of their driveway was a 3ft drop or more. I remember standing there with his stuffy, seeing a neighbour, and the neighbour going: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I walked home and realized my neighbours had taken my animals and taken care of them. I didn\u2019t realize half my shed was ready to fall down. I remember my chest was so tight. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I was struggling to process \u201cColton\u2019s not coming home\u201d. I remember calling our mental health crisis line. They called me back and went: \u201cWell, our mental health crisis van can meet you at 11.30 but it does not go to rural municipalities. You have to drive to Sackville, maybe Mount Uniacke.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to drive 40 minutes to Sackville. I didn\u2019t want to leave Hants County. All I could remember thinking was: \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just come here?\u201d At this point, I hadn\u2019t told Alex. His dad, Edward, and I had a brief conversation about taking his phone because his friends had Facebook and were starting to message him if Colton was OK. He was 3km away from where Colton died in Brooklyn. My dad went with me and I remember driving around the barricade again and seeing all the people searching. I got to Alex\u2019s dad\u2019s and went in. Alex looked at me and goes: \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d I went: \u201cYes.\u201d I said: \u201cAll those helicopters you see and hear that are flying over above you \u2026\u201d He goes: \u201cYes.\u201d I said: \u201cThey\u2019re looking for your brother and they\u2019re looking for Natalie.\u201d I remember him looking at me and going: \u201cIs there any chance they\u2019re going to find him?\u201d I said: \u201cThere is a chance, but the more time that goes on, the worse those chances get.\u201d I couldn\u2019t take the hope out of him. He was trying to be hopeful and I just couldn\u2019t do it. He cried, but he cried with a blank look. His eyes just went dark. He wasn\u2019t mad, he wasn\u2019t sobbing. He just had these little tears and he was quiet. I remember me and his dad hugging him together. We were close. Colton called Edward \u201cUncle Eddie\u201d. I gave Alex the option to stay with me and he said: \u201cI\u2019m going to stay with Dad.\u201d I said: \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to see how I can help your brother.\u201d Then and there was when I decided I was going to ground search and rescue. And that\u2019s when I met the head of command, Jason Butler. Jason took me in and showed me where they were searching. He gave me the best update he could and offered to take me on site. This beautiful field that I once drove by every day was a lake. It was so hot and sunny. I just saw little bits of the truck that the kids were in. The house had moved off its foundation, across the front lawn, and was stopped by a tree. It smelled of rot and feces. The tractor-trailer that went in was filled with processed chicken. Septic tanks had been exposed. I chose to stay at ground search and rescue as much as I could. They told me, if you see people laughing, don\u2019t take it to heart. If you see people having a nap, don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have given it a second thought. It helped me to see them laughing because Colton was always down for a good joke. It didn\u2019t take me long to start asking how they are doing. I wanted them to know that I\u2019m Colton\u2019s mom. I am so thankful for you. I encouraged them to nap. I encourage them to rest. I learned to make jokes with them, smile with them, and tell them stories about Colton. I know some people made the comments that I needed to put myself first, but helping people was the best medicine I could have. The next day, my parents showed up with all my family. I remember my uncle coming. He had lost his wife in May. I gave him the biggest hug. I was like: \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that aunt Marlene went because she knew. The only reason I think I\u2019m going to be OK today is because she\u2019s got Colton.\u201d That day was the day they found Natalie. Some people had been searching a beach and found her. She was in the Minas Basin. I remember going: \u201cOh God, what if he went out there? No, he has to be in the field.\u201d I remember looking out and going: \u201cHe could be anywhere.\u201d There was so much mud on everything. The mud wasn\u2019t just on the ground. The mud was 10, 15ft up in the air. That\u2019s when it clued in they weren\u2019t just going to walk upon a little boy in a red shirt. They\u2019re going to come across a little boy covered in mud and he wouldn\u2019t be seen right away. Alex called and asked if he could stop in. He\u2019s always soft hearted and super kind. I made sure he didn\u2019t have to look and see how they were searching for Colton. But he was like: \u201cI want to look.\u201d He met Jason, looked at some of the stuff, and goes: \u201cMommy, I heard they found someone.\u201d I went, \u201cYes, buddy, they did.\u201d He goes: \u201cWho\u2019d they find.\u201d I said: \u201cNatalie.\u201d He goes: \u201cMom, did she say anything about Colton?\u201d I said: \u201cNo, she can\u2019t.\u201d That\u2019s when he knew his brother was never coming home. He knew but he just said: \u201cOh.\u201d The next day, I got a call from the RCMP. They said: \u201cWe finally got the field drained completely. We\u2019re going to search it this morning. Can you not come today just in case?\u201d I said: \u201cOK.\u201d That morning, I had gone to the Superstore. I bought these carnations that weren\u2019t even worth 50% off. They looked like the inside of a piece of salmon. But Colton had wanted to buy them for me before he died. I tried to go to the dollar store to buy these ugly earrings he also wanted me to buy that day. They weren\u2019t there. So I ordered a pair off Amazon the same morning. I remember Chris and I going to where Courtney and Nick were. I went out on the back deck and I got this strange message on my phone from a friend. She goes: \u201cWhere are you at?\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cNick and Courtney\u2019s grandmother\u2019s.\u201d I knew the RCMP were hunting me. I remember sitting in that rocking bench. I remember rocking back in it. I remember looking out on to the hill and there were windmills in the distance. I remember looking at the windmills. It wasn\u2019t long before the RCMP showed up and asked for some privacy with us. I remember them sitting down and they said they conducted a search of the field. They found a body. They believed it was Colton and that Colton is dead. I\u2019ve never felt such heartbreak and relief at the same time. I remember getting upset with the coroner\u2019s office because I didn\u2019t want them to do an autopsy and they didn\u2019t give me a choice. I remember saying to them: \u201cFine, can I just identify the body?\u201d They sent a picture through email to my brother because they didn\u2019t think I could do it. It would have been nice if I had somebody looking out for my interests and helping me advocate for what I want, even if I wasn\u2019t totally right, instead of me just taking the word for it and going: \u201cOK.\u201d I made one request and that was for them to keep him as close to Natalie as possible because I didn\u2019t want them separating again. Natalie was convinced she was going to marry Colton. They liked lighting off fireworks. They liked fishing in the river. There\u2019s a video of them making a water slide in the backyard. They needed to stay together. They had been beside each other when it happened. They were together and they went together. From there, the days drag. We had a very small family viewing on Saturday. It was like hitting a wall when I rounded the corner and I just saw his little body in this little white casket. We had him put in his Spider-Man costume and put the carnations he wanted me to have put on his chest. I wanted him to have a piece of his blankie. I didn\u2019t know what I expected when I put his blanket in his hand. I knew it was going to be stiff. But it still wasn\u2019t what I expected. After everybody left, the funeral director and I walked in holding Chris on either side. Chris cried really, really bad. Then, I went back in by myself, knelt down, put my head against the casket, and played with Colton\u2019s hair. His blond hair. I rubbed his chest and talked to him. I closed my eyes. I don\u2019t know if I was asleep. But, seeing him, it was the most peace I\u2019d been in. I must have stayed there for an hour. I remember Chris and the funeral director checking in to see if I was sleeping. I kissed Colton goodbye. I miss him so much. Working the way I was, I did not realize how much he was there for me. Alex will be like: \u201cMom, you need to go and have a nap.\u201d But he was doing what he should be doing, which was hanging out with his friends. Colton wanted to be there for me as much as I was there for him. If I was sitting on the couch and looked tired, he\u2019d be like: \u201cI got a blanket, not just for me, but for you too, Mom.\u201d If he was eating something, he always made a point to share with me. If I didn\u2019t feel like eating, he\u2019d always be like: \u201cOh, here\u2019s a snack, Mom, I got one for you too.\u201d Colton took care of me. It sounds weird to say it out loud. I\u2019m sure some people don\u2019t realize that until they sit there and think about their own situation and be like: \u201cWhoa.\u201d Colton was the main person taking care of me. The day we had him cremated, we all went out to the house. Ground search and rescue had been cleaning up that area. The field had been drained. The vehicles had been pulled out. We sat there and threw rocks at the house. There was something therapeutic in throwing rocks at something still standing in that area. We weren\u2019t supposed to go in the house but I did. The floor was all bubbled up. I remember seeing some of Colton\u2019s pictures on the wall and I took them down because I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of them ripping down the house with his pictures in it. The next day was Natalie\u2019s funeral. Courtney asked me to wear my prom dress because Natalie never got a prom. She wanted everyone to look like a princess. Somehow, after 13 years, I still fit into my prom dress. Not the most elegant fit. But I wore it. I sobbed so hard during Natalie\u2019s funeral. That\u2019s probably why I didn\u2019t sob at Colton\u2019s. They were back-to-back funerals. I couldn\u2019t find anything to wear. What does Spider-Man\u2019s mom wear? David\u2019s bridal had given me this beautiful dark blue gown. I overdressed, but Colton wouldn\u2019t have cared. He would have just called me beautiful. He was the only one in the world that ever called me beautiful like that all the time. My dad came out of the bathroom wearing a full-on Spider-Man costume. He says: \u201cAre you OK if I wear this?\u201d It was too tight in an area, but that\u2019s OK. I said: \u201cDad, of course. I\u2019m not going to tell you not to wear it.\u201d I chose the church because it was a church I used to attend and I didn\u2019t have to go to Brooklyn. Colton loved the building from the outside. When I got out to go in for his service, there were first responders \u2013 ground search and rescue, fire \u2013 all lined up. There were hundreds of people. There were people who wore Spider-Man shirts and blue and orange because his favourite colour was blue and orange. We walked down the aisle to Crazy Frog. We played Thunder by Imagine Dragons. I remember saying in my speech: \u201cWe debated not playing it, but it is Colton\u2019s favourite song so good luck to y\u2019all.\u201d We played Sunflower by Post Malone because he liked that song too and made us think of him. A little bit of exposure therapy. I remember telling everybody that it\u2019s OK. I remember addressing Colton\u2019s classmates and Alex\u2019s friends and saying that it\u2019s OK. It didn\u2019t feel right if I didn\u2019t try to talk to Colton\u2019s classmates. I remember saying Colton wouldn\u2019t want us sad forever. I had so many people that needed to know I was thankful and Colton would be thankful. I wouldn\u2019t have this closure and, really, no family would, if it wasn\u2019t for the hundreds of individuals who came forward to help. I got to see Colton. I got to see him one last time. Jason, who was in command those two days, and deputy fire chief Brett Tetanish, the man I heard on that scanner pleading for that alert, brought my boy home. It came full circle. Jason was paired up with Brett. I hold them very dear to me for what they found, and that was my boy. Because I know it wasn\u2019t rainbows and butterflies. I\u2019ve had people come up to me since and say I saved lives with what I said at the funeral. That I mentally saved lives. That I\u2019m a hero. I don\u2019t feel like one. They\u2019re my heroes. It really didn\u2019t hit me, until months went by, what some of these people experienced while trying to search for these kids. I didn\u2019t realize how much my empathetic self was helping people. How I handled myself at ground search and rescue was more than just healing for me. It was healing for other people. That\u2019s when I made Colton\u2019s Facebook page. I post thoughts and opinions on the storm. It\u2019s good for me because I don\u2019t want to let go of it yet. Whether climate change is natural or we\u2019ve sped it up, we\u2019re not preparing ourselves for these weather events. It helps me regulate myself and know he\u2019s not forgotten. There\u2019s this whole generation of kids that are going to remember Colton. They write notes like: \u201cOh, Colton. I missed you today. Let\u2019s run for Colton even though he didn\u2019t have cancer.\u201d People should be proud of that and proud of their kids. One day, they\u2019ll remember they had a friend die in such a way. They are going to be like: \u201cThis is our world and we got to look out for everyone else.\u201d We ended the funeral with Bloody Mary by Lady Gaga because Colton liked watching Wednesday Addams and loved singing that too. I hugged people for two hours. Two hours of hugging strangers and political people. Somebody whispered to me: \u201cThey found her.\u201d There had been four people that had died. I remember driving to the funeral, looking out the window going: \u201cThere\u2019s still somebody missing.\u201d They were calling off the search. But the people who came to Colton\u2019s funeral still didn\u2019t give up. They didn\u2019t give up hope. She had been found in Advocate Harbor. They found her. They found her. I remember the church lighting up through the stained glass windows. It got really bright and I remember thinking: \u201cI\u2019m going to get through this.\u201d This testimonial was produced with the help of the Climate Disaster Project; thanks to Sean Holman, Aldyn Chwelos, Darren Schuettler, Ricardo Garcia, Cristine Gerk, Tracy Sherlock, Lisa Taylor.

      "body": "<p>The Kremlin has denied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/trump-putin-ukraine-war\">reports</a> that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, spoke to the US president-elect, Donald Trump, calling the media reports \u201cpure fiction\u201d.</p> <p>The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/10/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine/\">first reported</a> that a call had taken place, citing unidentified sources, and said Trump had told Putin he should not escalate the Ukraine war. Reuters also reported on a call.</p> <p>\u201cIt is completely untrue. It is pure fiction; it is simply false information,\u201d the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said when asked about the call. \u201cThere was no conversation.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most obvious example of the quality of the information that is being published now, sometimes even in fairly reputable publications.\u201d</p> <p>Peskov added that Putin had no specific plans to speak to Trump.</p> <p>According to the Washington Post, Trump reminded Putin of \u201cWashington\u2019s sizeable military presence in Europe\u201d. It added that Trump expressed interest in follow-up conversations on \u201cthe resolution of Ukraine\u2019s war soon\u201d.</p> <p>The reported call took place after Putin on Thursday congratulated Trump on his election win and expressed admiration for the way Trump reacted to an assassination attempt during the campaign.</p> <p>Peskov has a history of dismissing media reports that later prove to be true; most recently, he labelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/north-korean-troops-russia-arrived-ukraine-seoul\">reports of North Korean soldiers arriving in Russia</a> as \u201cfake news\u201d, despite credible audio and visual evidence confirming their presence. Still, the Kremlin\u2019s swift denial of the phone call with Trump is likely to raise eyebrows, especially given that both leaders have previously expressed openness to dialogue.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s team has not yet confirmed the call. When asked by Fox News for comment about the Washington Post report, Trump\u2019s communication director, Steven Cheung, released a statement saying: \u201cWe do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.\u201d</p> <p>Peskov on Monday also accused European leaders of continuing to seek a \u201cstrategic defeat\u201d of Russia.

      "bodyText": "The Kremlin has denied reports that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, spoke to the US president-elect, Donald Trump, calling the media reports \u201cpure fiction\u201d. The Washington Post first reported that a call had taken place, citing unidentified sources, and said Trump had told Putin he should not escalate the Ukraine war. Reuters also reported on a call. \u201cIt is completely untrue. It is pure fiction; it is simply false information,\u201d the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said when asked about the call. \u201cThere was no conversation. \u201cThis is the most obvious example of the quality of the information that is being published now, sometimes even in fairly reputable publications.\u201d Peskov added that Putin had no specific plans to speak to Trump. According to the Washington Post, Trump reminded Putin of \u201cWashington\u2019s sizeable military presence in Europe\u201d. It added that Trump expressed interest in follow-up conversations on \u201cthe resolution of Ukraine\u2019s war soon\u201d. The reported call took place after Putin on Thursday congratulated Trump on his election win and expressed admiration for the way Trump reacted to an assassination attempt during the campaign. Peskov has a history of dismissing media reports that later prove to be true; most recently, he labelled reports of North Korean soldiers arriving in Russia as \u201cfake news\u201d, despite credible audio and visual evidence confirming their presence. Still, the Kremlin\u2019s swift denial of the phone call with Trump is likely to raise eyebrows, especially given that both leaders have previously expressed openness to dialogue. Trump\u2019s team has not yet confirmed the call. When asked by Fox News for comment about the Washington Post report, Trump\u2019s communication director, Steven Cheung, released a statement saying: \u201cWe do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.\u201d Peskov on Monday also accused European leaders of continuing to seek a \u201cstrategic defeat\u201d of Russia. He was responding to a question about the possibility that Britain would allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow long-range missile systems to hit targets inside Russia. The Kremlin repeatedly said Putin was ready to discuss Ukraine with the west but that it did not mean he was willing to alter Moscow\u2019s demands. On 14 June, Putin staked out a maximalist position for an end to the war: Ukraine would have to drop its Nato ambitions and withdraw all its troops from all the territory of four regions claimed by Russia. During the election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war \u201cwithin a day\u201d but did not explain how he would do so. He also spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, according to reports. The Ukrainian president later confirmed the conversation with Trump, describing it as an \u201cexcellent call\u201d. Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars worth of military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticised and railed against with other Republican lawmakers. The US president, Joe Biden, will host Trump for a traditional post-election meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday, where the current US leader is expected to try to convince the president-elect not to withdraw support from Ukraine when he takes office. The meeting will take place against the backdrop of reports that Russia, with support from North Korean soldiers, is planning a significant assault to drive Ukrainian forces out of its western Kursk region. On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Moscow had assembled a force of 50,000 troops, including North Koreans, in the region bordering Ukraine for an attack. According to US intelligence, 10,000 North Korean soldiers have arrived in Russia, a figure that Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief says includes 500 officers and three generals. In August, Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into the Kursk region, capturing settlements within Russian territory in what was widely seen as a major embarrassment for Putin. However, Russia has gradually recaptured some of this territory and also made steady advances across much of eastern Ukraine.",

      "body": "<p>New College of Florida, which has been the subject of a rightwing takeover that has reversed its previous reputation as a liberal arts school, has hired ideologically aligned rightwing faculty and staff for a range of positions, in a process that an internal open letter said \u201coften replaced faculty expertise with administrative fiat\u201d.</p> <p>New College of Florida (NCF) was targeted by the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, who made transforming the liberal institution into a conservative one a centerpiece of his ill-fated presidential campaign that sought to take on liberal causes. Its board of trustees is now dominated by DeSantis allies, triggering campus turmoil and the exodus of some staff.</p> <p>Some in the Republican party see the effort to transform New College as a model in a wider battle to take on American higher education, which the rightwing sees as dominated by left-leaning institutions and leaders. With Donald Trump returning to power after winning the presidential election last week, many rightwing activists could seek to replicate what has happened to New College across the US.</p> <p>The Guardian has identified several faculty members who have a history of connections with rightwing media, far-right thinktanks and the so-called \u201cNew Right\u201d. The hires are of a piece with the hard-right drift at the college since DeSantis appointed new members to the governing board of trustees including the culture warrior Christopher Rufo, which in turn appointed a new administration led by Richard Corcoran, a longtime Republican activist and former political candidate in Florida.</p> <p>In an internally circulated open letter to Corcoran written by the chairs of a key committee, staff members have complained that hiring processes now involved the \u201carbitrary replacement of searches in specific fields with open-field searches, searches with no requirement for a PhD in the field, insertion of candidates with no rationale, and job offers made without a recommendation from the search committee\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian emailed NCF for comment but received no response.</p> <h2>Rightwing hires</h2> <p>New College has appointed a raft of faculty and staff with a history in rightwing politics since Corcoran assumed control.</p> <p>The most prominent appointments \u2013 previously reported on by local news media and <a href=\"https://ncfcatalyst.com/presidential-scholars-in-residence-two-faces-from-new-colleges-new-program/\">the college\u2019s Catalyst</a> student newspaper \u2013 are the new presidential scholars in residence, which are visiting appointments made at Corcoran\u2019s direct discretion.</p> <p>One, Bruce Gilley, is a political scientist on sabbatical from Portland State University.</p> <p>In 2017, he published a paper entitled \u201cThe Case for Colonialism\u201d in Third World Quarterly, which touched off a firestorm of controversy by arguing that western colonialism was largely beneficial for colonised nations, and that colonial rule often provided better governance than indigenous alternatives.</p>    <p>Following that publication, 15 members of the journal\u2019s editorial board resigned, alleging that the article did not undergo proper peer review and calling for its retraction. Critics argued that the article ignored the vast body of scholarship documenting colonialism\u2019s brutality, ongoing impacts and the racist ideologies that underpinned it.</p> <p>Beyond that controversy, Gilley has embraced a rightwing non-profit seeking to push conservative ideology in higher education. He serves on the national board of the National Association of Scholars (NAS), and leads the subsidiary Oregon Association of Scholars.</p> <p>NAS is a partner organization in Project 2025, the policy blueprint for a prospective Trump administration spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. Its funders include the conservative mega-donors the Scaife and Bradley foundations, and Thomas Klingenstein, who also serves on the NAS board and as chair of the rightwing Claremont Institute.</p> <p>Gilley also regularly ventilates controversial rightwing opinions on X, formerly Twitter.</p> <p>In recent days, Gilley has claimed that \u201cDems want illegal immigration \u2026 to import votes\u201d, echoing the \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d conspiracy theory. He also <a href=\"https://x.com/BruceDGilley/status/1849608451346903145\">described</a> Chile\u2019s former president Michelle Bachelet as a \u201cdiversity hire\u201d.</p> <p>Employment records obtained by the Guardian indicate that New College is paying Gilley $130,000 for his yearlong residency. According to Florida state salary records, that puts him among the highest-paid faculty members at NCF in 2024, with most other faculty earning less than $100,000.</p> <p>Emails first obtained by American Oversight show that Gilley was first recommended to Corcoran not long after his appointment by \u201cyacht lawyer\u201d Robert Allen, an New College alumnus, former board of trustees member, and Republican operative who has <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/sarasota/2023/02/27/trump-ron-desantis-robert-allen-led-new-college-makeover/69942836007/\">claimed credit</a> for encouraging DeSantis to move on the college\u2019s board.</p> <p>In January 2020, after being re-elected on an \u201canti-woke\u201d platform, DeSantis appointed a clutch of rightwingers with no Florida connections to the governing board of trustees, including Rufo, the retired academic Mark Bauerlain, Hillsdale College\u2019s Matthew Spaulding, and <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/staff/ryan-anderson\">Ryan T Anderson</a>, a former fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who was previously best known for anti-LGBTQ+ activism.</p> <p>The Heritage Foundation has recently become better known as the principal architect of Project 2025. Last month, NCF <a href=\"https://www.ncf.edu/news/new-college-earns-recognition-from-heritage-foundation-as-a-great-option-for-higher-education/\">trumpeted on its website</a> that Heritage had issued a report rating New College as a \u201cgreat option\u201d for conservative students and parents.</p> <p>In a 23 April 2023 email, just weeks after the previous college president, Patricia Okker, was fired and Corcoran appointed as interim head, Allen wrote to Corcoran: \u201cHas anyone mentioned Bruce Gilley, MA Oxford, PhD Princeton, teaches at Portland State to you, as a potential prof?\u201d</p> <p>Corcoran replied: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard about Gilley.\u201d</p> <p>Other presidential scholars include Andrew Doyle, an \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/andrewdoyle_com/status/1225112293261791232z\">anti-woke</a>\u201d writer and broadcaster from the UK who associated with rightwing media outlets there including Spiked Online and GB News.</p> <p>Another, Joseph Loconte, a conservative academic and former <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/staff/joseph-loconte\">Heritage Foundation</a> director. According to Florida salary records, Loconte is being paid $165,000 for his residency.</p> <p>The Guardian emailed Gilley for comment on his Portland State University address. He responded: \u201cFuck you, you ideological midwit. And please quote me.\u201d</p> <h2>Nathan Allen</h2> <p>Earlier in the same April 2023 email exchange, Allen linked Corcoran to a <a href=\"https://nathan-a-allen.medium.com/when-lilacs-last-in-the-palm-court-bloomd-d4185dbb474\">Medium post</a>, adding: \u201cWe need to find the author \u2026 I will send you another one by him shortly.\u201d</p> <p>Corcoran replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking and he\u2019s helping.

      "bodyText": "New College of Florida, which has been the subject of a rightwing takeover that has reversed its previous reputation as a liberal arts school, has hired ideologically aligned rightwing faculty and staff for a range of positions, in a process that an internal open letter said \u201coften replaced faculty expertise with administrative fiat\u201d. New College of Florida (NCF) was targeted by the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, who made transforming the liberal institution into a conservative one a centerpiece of his ill-fated presidential campaign that sought to take on liberal causes. Its board of trustees is now dominated by DeSantis allies, triggering campus turmoil and the exodus of some staff. Some in the Republican party see the effort to transform New College as a model in a wider battle to take on American higher education, which the rightwing sees as dominated by left-leaning institutions and leaders. With Donald Trump returning to power after winning the presidential election last week, many rightwing activists could seek to replicate what has happened to New College across the US. The Guardian has identified several faculty members who have a history of connections with rightwing media, far-right thinktanks and the so-called \u201cNew Right\u201d. The hires are of a piece with the hard-right drift at the college since DeSantis appointed new members to the governing board of trustees including the culture warrior Christopher Rufo, which in turn appointed a new administration led by Richard Corcoran, a longtime Republican activist and former political candidate in Florida. In an internally circulated open letter to Corcoran written by the chairs of a key committee, staff members have complained that hiring processes now involved the \u201carbitrary replacement of searches in specific fields with open-field searches, searches with no requirement for a PhD in the field, insertion of candidates with no rationale, and job offers made without a recommendation from the search committee\u201d. The Guardian emailed NCF for comment but received no response. Rightwing hires New College has appointed a raft of faculty and staff with a history in rightwing politics since Corcoran assumed control. The most prominent appointments \u2013 previously reported on by local news media and the college\u2019s Catalyst student newspaper \u2013 are the new presidential scholars in residence, which are visiting appointments made at Corcoran\u2019s direct discretion. One, Bruce Gilley, is a political scientist on sabbatical from Portland State University. In 2017, he published a paper entitled \u201cThe Case for Colonialism\u201d in Third World Quarterly, which touched off a firestorm of controversy by arguing that western colonialism was largely beneficial for colonised nations, and that colonial rule often provided better governance than indigenous alternatives. Following that publication, 15 members of the journal\u2019s editorial board resigned, alleging that the article did not undergo proper peer review and calling for its retraction. Critics argued that the article ignored the vast body of scholarship documenting colonialism\u2019s brutality, ongoing impacts and the racist ideologies that underpinned it. Beyond that controversy, Gilley has embraced a rightwing non-profit seeking to push conservative ideology in higher education. He serves on the national board of the National Association of Scholars (NAS), and leads the subsidiary Oregon Association of Scholars. NAS is a partner organization in Project 2025, the policy blueprint for a prospective Trump administration spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. Its funders include the conservative mega-donors the Scaife and Bradley foundations, and Thomas Klingenstein, who also serves on the NAS board and as chair of the rightwing Claremont Institute. Gilley also regularly ventilates controversial rightwing opinions on X, formerly Twitter. In recent days, Gilley has claimed that \u201cDems want illegal immigration \u2026 to import votes\u201d, echoing the \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d conspiracy theory. He also described Chile\u2019s former president Michelle Bachelet as a \u201cdiversity hire\u201d. Employment records obtained by the Guardian indicate that New College is paying Gilley $130,000 for his yearlong residency. According to Florida state salary records, that puts him among the highest-paid faculty members at NCF in 2024, with most other faculty earning less than $100,000. Emails first obtained by American Oversight show that Gilley was first recommended to Corcoran not long after his appointment by \u201cyacht lawyer\u201d Robert Allen, an New College alumnus, former board of trustees member, and Republican operative who has claimed credit for encouraging DeSantis to move on the college\u2019s board. In January 2020, after being re-elected on an \u201canti-woke\u201d platform, DeSantis appointed a clutch of rightwingers with no Florida connections to the governing board of trustees, including Rufo, the retired academic Mark Bauerlain, Hillsdale College\u2019s Matthew Spaulding, and Ryan T Anderson, a former fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who was previously best known for anti-LGBTQ+ activism. The Heritage Foundation has recently become better known as the principal architect of Project 2025. Last month, NCF trumpeted on its website that Heritage had issued a report rating New College as a \u201cgreat option\u201d for conservative students and parents. In a 23 April 2023 email, just weeks after the previous college president, Patricia Okker, was fired and Corcoran appointed as interim head, Allen wrote to Corcoran: \u201cHas anyone mentioned Bruce Gilley, MA Oxford, PhD Princeton, teaches at Portland State to you, as a potential prof?\u201d Corcoran replied: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard about Gilley.\u201d Other presidential scholars include Andrew Doyle, an \u201canti-woke\u201d writer and broadcaster from the UK who associated with rightwing media outlets there including Spiked Online and GB News. Another, Joseph Loconte, a conservative academic and former Heritage Foundation director. According to Florida salary records, Loconte is being paid $165,000 for his residency. The Guardian emailed Gilley for comment on his Portland State University address. He responded: \u201cFuck you, you ideological midwit. And please quote me.\u201d Nathan Allen Earlier in the same April 2023 email exchange, Allen linked Corcoran to a Medium post, adding: \u201cWe need to find the author \u2026 I will send you another one by him shortly.\u201d Corcoran replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking and he\u2019s helping. Great guy. Just emailing with him this afternoon again.\u201d The man they were talking about, Nathan Allen, is New College\u2019s VP of strategy and special projects. Allen has little online presence other than his ideologically charged Medium blog, where he lets loose his own broadsides at the left, American universities and other institutions, and other perceived enemies. Some of those posts include full-throated, conspiracy-minded attacks on the academics Allen now helps to administer. In a June 2020 post, Allen wrote: \u201cThese Marxists and their affiliated majors don\u2019t exist because students actually major in them\u201d, adding \u201cThey are the thought police \u2013 on campus and nationally. They burn the books, tear down the statues, purge the faculties of thought crimes, assign value, and control the narrative.\u201d Also in that post, Allen characterized the public intellectual and current independent presidential candidate, Cornel West, as having been \u201cthe CEO [of] Race Inc for three decades, adding of West: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the leading neo-Marxists who calls for the destruction of America.\u201d The Guardian emailed Nathan Allen for comment on the posts in September, and asked if he had changed his views. Allen did not respond directly, but an NCF spokesperson, Nathan March, replied in an email: \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly explore Mr Allen\u2019s writing and appropriately gain context about New College without having read When Lilacs Last in the Palm Court Bloom\u2019d.\u201d That post is an elaborate criticism of NCF under previous administrations, which Allen claims stems from a failure of leadership, a lack of a distinct identity, and a reliance on shallow marketing strategies. Faculty The rightwing hiring spree has also extended to faculty. New faculty that New College boasted about in a specially created booklet earlier this year include Spencer Klavan, a former fellow at the rightwing Claremont Institute and assistant editor of The American Mind, a regular author in rightwing publications including the Claremont Review of Books and Law and Liberty, and a podcaster. Casey Wheatland, meanwhile, is a newly appointed political scientist whose PhD comes from the conservative private university, Hillsdale College. Hillsdale, which declines federal government funding in order to avoid Title IX provisions against sex discrimination, has been cited as an inspiration for changes at New College, with a DeSantis ally expressing the hope that it might become a \u201cHillsdale of the south\u201d. Wheatland defended his dissertation in March 2022, according to Hillsdale\u2019s website. He has published just three peer-reviewed papers, according to online research repositories, including one in the Catholic Social Science Review. US News and World Report puts Hillsdale\u2019s program in political science equal second-last on its ranked list of graduate schools in that discipline. On X, Wheatland has promoted conspiracy-minded positions consistent with those of the extremist so-called \u201cNew Right\u201d. On 1 August, Wheatland linked to a paper that he claimed showed that \u201cnot only do non-citizens vote in US elections, they do so at high enough numbers to change public policy at the national level\u201d. It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in the US and there is no credible evidence that they do so in significant numbers. On 21 June, Wheatland wrote that an 1879 supreme court decision forbidding Mormon polygamy showed that traditional heterosexual marriage was \u201cat the root of our social relations and obligations\u201d. On 4 June, Wheatland responded to an AP story on Wisconsin\u2019s attorney general filing charges against lawyers who assisted Donald Trump in his attempts to overturn the election in that state by writing: \u201cGableman\u2019s investigation found many illegalities.\u201d In August 2022, the speaker of Wisconsin\u2019s state assembly, Robin Vos, fired Michael Gableman and ended his scandal-plagued investigation into the results, which a court who sanctioned the former judge decreed had found no evidence of election fraud. In September, Wheatland wrote a thread defending the views of Daryl Cooper, the revisionist historian who caused a scandal when Tucker Carlson spoke to him as a guest on his show on X. The Guardian emailed Wheatland for comment in September. In an email, he said: \u201cI do not teach my students any particular political position.

I believe its purposes are rigorous inquiry and debate.\u201d Wheatland locked his X account in late September, not long after the Guardian contacted him. Pushback Inside New College, faculty have pushed back on hiring processes for new faculty, which they allege have been subject to undue interference from Corcoran and his administration. The Guardian obtained a 31 May open letter from David Gillman and Nova Myhill, co-chairs of New College\u2019s education committee, which relayed the faculty\u2019s \u201cdeep concerns over changes at New College in the conduct of faculty searches\u201d, which they say has \u201cresulted in some hires that negatively affect the ability of programs, including interdisciplinary programs which depend on faculty hired into various disciplines, to fill the needs of students\u201d. Without naming any specific hires, the letter said: \u201cWe see a breakdown of established processes with no new processes to take their place.\u201d The letter further alleges: \u201cThis has resulted in insertion of new lines with no rationale, arbitrary replacement of searches in specific fields with open-field searches, searches with no requirement for a PhD in the field, insertion of candidates with no rationale, and job offers made without a recommendation from the search committee.\u201d Since Corcoran assumed control of New College, it has plummeted in national rankings of liberal arts schools; attracted controversy for dumping library books and materials from a gender and diversity center that the administration closed; and invited controversial speakers to campus. Last week, Inside Higher Ed reported on a brewing clash over changes to the core curriculum, which critics say is being \u201cdriven by conservative ideologues\u201d.",

However, experts argue that drought is not the only cause of Ecuador\u2019s energy crisis. It reflects deeper structural problems within the power sector, with insufficient investment, misguided policy decisions, slow reactions to repeated warnings and a lack of strategies to adapt to extreme weather events. Since 23 September, Ecuador has been hit by rolling blackouts, which peaked at the beginning of November, with power cuts lasting up to 14 hours a day, mainly during daylight and evening hours, when demand is highest. As a result, the country\u2019s economy has been severely affected, with small and medium-sized businesses the worst hit. According to the labour ministry, more than 3,500 jobs have been lost due to the blackouts. Industry bodies estimate the power cuts have cost Ecuador\u2019s economy at least $2bn (\u00a31.5bn), with that figure rising daily. This setback is another challenge for the South American country, which has experienced a sharp decline in economic growth this year while confronting a worsening security crisis. In response, President Daniel Noboa has adopted a hard-line policy against organised crime, drawing inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s anti-crime efforts. Businesses have been trying to adapt and work by candlelight or the light of phones while halting certain services during blackout hours. Many others have turned to diesel generators to keep operating. Researchers from the Universidad de Las Am\u00e9ricas found that using generators comes at the expense of health and the environment, as diesel emits high levels of toxins, such as sulphur dioxide and a mixture of harmful particulates. Protesters in Quito took to the streets recently, calling for an end to the power cuts and Noboa\u2019s resignation, saying his administration has not been transparent about how the crisis is being managed. *** Ecuador has generated more than 70% of its electricity through hydropower since 2017, after the inauguration of several large-scale hydro projects, such as the Coca Codo Sinclair plant.

Erasmus\u2019s world champions returned to the world No 1 ranking with a patchy 32-15 victory over Scotland on Sunday as they kicked off their own run of Tests in the northern hemisphere. They now travel to Twickenham to take on Steve Borthwick\u2019s side, who are reeling after suffering two late losses to New Zealand and Australia, 24-22 and 42-37, respectively, having expected to win both on home soil. \u201cTwickenham will be a different challenge,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cThat\u2019s 80,000 people, that\u2019s a different kind of pressure. England will be very desperate to win. They almost beat New Zealand, they almost beat Australia. It\u2019s going to be a very, very tough game.\u201d Saturday will be South Africa\u2019s first match against England since their dramatic 16-15 World Cup semi-final win in France last year when their opponents had led for most of the match. Losing tight games late on has since become a bad habit for Borthwick\u2019s team. In further ominous news for the hosts, who have lost Tom Curry and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso from their squad as a result of injury, the Springboks deliberately employed a 7-1 bench split in Edinburgh in order to keep their famed forwards as fresh as possible, with late replacements accounting for both England\u2019s World Cup defeats against South Africa in 2019 and 2023. \u201cWe rested the two packs for reasons. We want the team to be fresh with the six-day turnaround,\u201d Erasmus added.",

The first Paraguayan edition of his collected articles was only released in 1988. Following in his internationalist footsteps, many of his descendants became key figures in leftist movements across Latin America, including his granddaughter Soledad Barrett, who was murdered by Brazil\u2019s military regime in 1973.

With prices reflecting its status, however, fans are always on the lookout for bargains for the colourful range, which is still made in the original foundry established in 1925 in the village of Fresnoy-le-Grand, about two hours north of Paris. So when the company announced a sale at its warehouse in Andover, Hampshire, at the weekend, demand was expected to be high, though few would have predicted just how high. Bargain-hunters found themselves queueing for up to four hours on the pavement outside as hundreds turned up at an industrial estate to take advantage of offers of up to half-price on casserole pots, saucepans, kettles and more. Such was the popularity of the two-day sale that Hampshire police were called to deal with the ensuing traffic chaos as social media videos showed hundreds of cars parked on the side of neighbouring roads around the business park. \u201cWe attended London Road and the A3093 in Andover [on] Saturday morning following reports of heavy congestion in the area,\u201d a spokesperson for Hampshire constabulary told the Telegraph. \u201cWe began receiving reports at 9.45am and we attended to assist with traffic control.

The firm\u2019s popularity has endured since its founders, the industrialists Armand Desaegher and Octave Aubecq, who met at the Brussels Fair a century ago, designed the first cocotte in the brand\u2019s most recognisable orange Volcanic enamel, the signature hue inspired by the fiery colour of molten cast iron inside the foundry moulds. In the 1960s, it introduced its yellow Elysee range. The most expensive Le Creuset set sold belonged to Marilyn Monroe. whose set of Elysee yellow cast iron pieces was auctioned at Christie\u2019s for $25,300 (\u00a319,600) in 1999. Today, the range can be bought in many different colours. An entire pallet of 157 pieces including tableware, baking ware and crockery was recently on offer at Costco in the US for $4,500 (approximately \u00a33,500).",

Inter, the reigning champions, had hoped to overtake Napoli and claim the leaders\u2019 jersey. A draw kept them trapped in the middle of a breakaway group instead. After 12 games, Serie A\u2019s top six teams are separated by only two points and have started to pull ahead of the rest of the pack.</p> \n<p>More on that later. Scott McTominay\u2019s 23rd-minute goal from a corner forced Inter to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/european-football-roundup-barcelona-inter-napoli-roma\">chase this game</a>. No small task, against an Antonio Conte team who had already collected seven clean sheets. Yet Calhanoglu brought them level with a sensational goal before half-time, taking advantage of standoffish defending to line up a 25-yard drive that swerved away from the goalkeeper Alex Meret.</p> \n<p>Inter looked poised to go on and win. Their hunger to do so had been apparent already from the midweek selection to face Arsenal, Simone Inzaghi giving Champions League rests to Marcus Thuram, Nicol\u00f2 Barella, Federico Dimarco, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alessandro Bastoni. Depth is this squad\u2019s greatest strength, but the side that faced Napoli was far closer to a first-choice XI.</p> \n<p>Dimarco hit a post at the start of the second half, and drew a further save from Meret, before Inter were awarded their penalty with just over a quarter of an hour left to play. Frank Zambo Anguissa\u2019s boot caught Denzel Dumfries\u2019s shin as the pair challenged for a ball. The contact was light, but the referee Maurizio Mariani had a clear view.</p> \n<p>It felt like game over for Napoli. Giving Calhanoglu the chance to beat you from 12 yards has been a more reliable path to defeat than offering Elena Delle Donne a shot from basketball\u2019s free-throw line. The Inter midfielder simply does not miss. Only this time, he did, slamming his shot against the left-hand upright.</p> \n<p>The contest was not over. Barella called Meret into action again moments later, sidestepping a defender\u2019s lunge but aiming too close to the keeper. A draw almost became a defeat for Inter when Cyril Ngonge crossed to fellow Napoli substitute Giovanni Simeone in injury time. The Argentinian hooked his shot over from six yards.</p> \n<p>That late let-off could not ease Inzaghi\u2019s frustration. \u201cIt leaves a bitter taste,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the lads had not played as well as this, I might not have this bitter taste, but we had a great performance tonight against a strong opponent. Lots of teams who played in the Champions League have had problems.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fe21003f-b5ae-45c3-9d31-1d01833be163\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lecce 1-1 Empoli, Juventus 2-0 Torino, Cagliari 3-3 Milan, Venezia 1-2 Parma, Inter 1-1 Napoli, Monza 0-1 Lazio, Roma 2-3 Bologna, Fiorentina 3-1 Verona, Atalanta 2-1 Udinese</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A not-so-subtle reminder of the additional challenges his team faced, compared to opponents who missed out on Europe altogether. From the moment Conte was named as Napoli\u2019s manager this summer, pundits have wondered whether the lighter calendar might aid him in restoring the <em>Partenopei</em> as title contenders. We have a long way to go yet, but the answer so far is a resounding yes.</p> \n<p>Inter remain the favourites, having demonstrated last season how they are built to win marathons even more than sprints. Equally, we cannot dismiss the first third of a season as a fluke. Napoli have earned their position on top of the pile, and the impact of playing fewer games may only become more pronounced the longer this season goes, given the fresh expansions to the European calendar.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of games,\u201d said Calhanoglu. \u201cReally a lot. We don\u2019t have time to stop and look at the table because every time we want to take a rest there\u2019s another one to play. It\u2019s not so hard physically. But mentally it\u2019s not so easy.\u201d</p> \n<p>His team is not alone in facing such pressures. Every other top-six side \u2013 Atalanta, Fiorentina, Lazio and Juventus \u2013 is also competing in Europe besides Napoli. All but the <em>Bianconeri</em> are doing so with considerably smaller financial resources than Inter.</p> \n<p>There was a hint of fatigue in Atalanta\u2019s slow start against Udinese this weekend. They were fortunate not to concede a second-minute penalty when Isak Hien controlled the ball with an arm and grateful to their goalkeeper, Marco Carnesecchi, for keeping out a string of chances before finally letting one in from Hassane Kamara on the stroke of half-time. But they roared back in the second-half to win 2-1.</p> \n<p>It felt like their season in microcosm. The Bergamo club collected just two wins and two draws from their first eight games across all competitions, struggling to adapt after losing Gianluca Scamacca and Teun Koopmeiners in August \u2013 the former to injury and the latter to a \u20ac55m Juventus move. Ademola Lookman was late to return to the fold after having his head turned by transfer talk, too.</p> \n<p>Now they have taken eight wins from the last nine \u2013 a sequence interrupted only by a draw with Celtic. Atalanta beat Napoli 3-0 at the Stadio Maradona and have piled up 31 league goals already \u2013 five more than the next-most prolific side, Inter. After winning the Europa League in May, there is growing belief that Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s team could sustain a bid for the Scudetto.</p> \n<p>That might be a more distant prospect for Fiorentina, though if Moise Kean can keep up his strike rate of one goal every 114 minutes, who knows? Like Atalanta, the Viola have won six league games in a row \u2013 a run that has seen them thrash Roma 5-1 and Lecce 6-0. Raffaele Palladino insisted he is not even looking at the table after this weekend\u2019s 3-1 win over Verona, but if he did he would see his team have the same points and a better goal difference than Inter.</p> \n<p>Marco Baroni\u2019s Lazio have been less eye-catching but no less impressive. Their last 11 games have yielded 10 victories and a 1-0 loss in a game which they played a man down from the 24th minute. Mattia Zaccagni fired them past Monza this weekend. Juventus beat Torino 2-0, staying sixth while also extending their run as the last unbeaten team in the division.</p> \n<p>It is hard to imagine that the race will stay this tight, that all of these teams can sustain the pace they have set. Then again, not so long ago, it was hard to picture Calhanoglu missing the target from 12 yards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

It is hard to imagine that the race will stay this tight, that all of these teams can sustain the pace they have set. Then again, not so long ago, it was hard to picture Calhanoglu missing the target from 12 yards.",

      "body": "<p>As anyone who has tried pointing their phone\u2019s camera at a menu in a foreign country lately will know, machine translation has improved rapidly since the first days of Google Translate. The utility of AI-powered translation in situations like this is unquestionable \u2013 but the proposed use of AI in literary translation has been significantly more controversial.</p> <p>Dutch publisher Veen Bosch &amp; Keuning\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/04/dutch-publisher-to-use-ai-to-translate-books-into-english-veen-bosch-keuning-artificial-intelligence\">announcement that it would use AI translation for commercial fiction</a> has outraged both authors and translators \u2013 despite attempts to reassure them with promises that no books will be translated in this way without careful checking and that authors will have to give consent. </p> <p>\u201cA translator translates more than just words, we build bridges between cultures, taking into account the target readership every step of the way,\u201d says Michele Hutchison, winner of 2020\u2019s International Booker prize for her translation of Lucas Rijneveld\u2019s The Discomfort of Evening. \u201cWe smuggle in subtle clues to help the reader understand particular cultural elements or traditions. We convey rhythm, poetry, wordplay, metaphor. We research the precise terminology for say agricultural machinery, even in a novel.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/29/its-exciting-its-powerful-how-translated-fiction-captured-a-new-generation-of-readers\">\u2018It\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s powerful\u2019: how translated fiction captured a new generation of readers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Translators and authors have also pointed out that AI translation requires very careful checking and editing \u2013 ideally by someone who knows both languages. At that point, that person may as well be translating the text themselves. Cultural sensitivity is a particular concern, as AI has been known to produce things that are wildly inappropriate.</p> <p>\u201cLast year a reader flagged some issues in a French edition of one of my books,\u201d says Juno Dawson, author of the Her Majesty\u2019s Royal Coven series. \u201cThe translator had used a slightly outdated term to describe a trans person. We were able to change the term before publication. It\u2019s these nuances I suspect AI would miss, meaning that AI generated content would then require stringent editing anyway.\u201d</p> <p>There are however some scenarios in which machine translation could arguably help the creators of cultural works. For writers working in minority languages, for instance, whose works are not currently translated into English or other languages at all, an AI-assisted translation could bring them to the attention of many more readers. And in video games, localisation can be one of the bigger costs for smaller independent developers, especially those for whom English is not a native language. AI translation of in-game text could theoretically help those developers reach a much larger audience, and help players who speak minority languages to enjoy their games more. But here, too, there are obvious limitations.</p> <p>Dr Jack Ratcliffe is the designer and CEO of Noun Town, a mixed-reality language learning game in which players walk around a virtual town, speaking to the locals in one of 40 supported languages. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing a simplistic game where the text is, press left and right and A to jump, you could probably machine translate that, and suddenly it\u2019s way more accessible to lots of people in different languages,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you have any kind of nuance, characters who are talking to each other, and you want to convey that as a game creator \u2026 I would be terrified going with AI.\u201d</p>    <p>Noun Town has around 50,000 lines of dialogue, all of it translated and voice acted by humans, and checked by language teachers. The studio did experiment with AI translation, says Ratcliffe, and found that when they used it with languages other than English the results were significantly worse.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found in our tests that going <em>into </em>English is actually OK, though nothing with AI is ever perfect,\u201d he says. \u201cThese large language models have learned a lot of English. Going into other languages, especially less popular languages, it gets more and more out there, more and more confused.\u201d</p> <p>Any game developer making a game with lots of words and dialogue, then, is looking at a high localisation cost \u2013 and presumably cares about the meaning and nuance of those words as much as the author of a book.</p> <p>When it comes to how people feel about AI translation, there is a definite distinction between utility and craft. Few object to using AI in the same way as a dictionary, to discern meaning. But translators, of course, do much more than that. As Dawson puts it: \u201cThese writers are artists in their own right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve started adding a line \u2018hand-crafted without the use of generative AI\u2019 to my translations,\u201d says Hutchison. \u201cAs translators we need to be very vocal about what our work involves right now, given the threat to our existence.

      "bodyText": "As anyone who has tried pointing their phone\u2019s camera at a menu in a foreign country lately will know, machine translation has improved rapidly since the first days of Google Translate. The utility of AI-powered translation in situations like this is unquestionable \u2013 but the proposed use of AI in literary translation has been significantly more controversial. Dutch publisher Veen Bosch &amp; Keuning\u2019s announcement that it would use AI translation for commercial fiction has outraged both authors and translators \u2013 despite attempts to reassure them with promises that no books will be translated in this way without careful checking and that authors will have to give consent. \u201cA translator translates more than just words, we build bridges between cultures, taking into account the target readership every step of the way,\u201d says Michele Hutchison, winner of 2020\u2019s International Booker prize for her translation of Lucas Rijneveld\u2019s The Discomfort of Evening. \u201cWe smuggle in subtle clues to help the reader understand particular cultural elements or traditions. We convey rhythm, poetry, wordplay, metaphor. We research the precise terminology for say agricultural machinery, even in a novel.\u201d Translators and authors have also pointed out that AI translation requires very careful checking and editing \u2013 ideally by someone who knows both languages. At that point, that person may as well be translating the text themselves. Cultural sensitivity is a particular concern, as AI has been known to produce things that are wildly inappropriate. \u201cLast year a reader flagged some issues in a French edition of one of my books,\u201d says Juno Dawson, author of the Her Majesty\u2019s Royal Coven series. \u201cThe translator had used a slightly outdated term to describe a trans person. We were able to change the term before publication. It\u2019s these nuances I suspect AI would miss, meaning that AI generated content would then require stringent editing anyway.\u201d There are however some scenarios in which machine translation could arguably help the creators of cultural works. For writers working in minority languages, for instance, whose works are not currently translated into English or other languages at all, an AI-assisted translation could bring them to the attention of many more readers. And in video games, localisation can be one of the bigger costs for smaller independent developers, especially those for whom English is not a native language. AI translation of in-game text could theoretically help those developers reach a much larger audience, and help players who speak minority languages to enjoy their games more. But here, too, there are obvious limitations. Dr Jack Ratcliffe is the designer and CEO of Noun Town, a mixed-reality language learning game in which players walk around a virtual town, speaking to the locals in one of 40 supported languages. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing a simplistic game where the text is, press left and right and A to jump, you could probably machine translate that, and suddenly it\u2019s way more accessible to lots of people in different languages,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you have any kind of nuance, characters who are talking to each other, and you want to convey that as a game creator \u2026 I would be terrified going with AI.\u201d Noun Town has around 50,000 lines of dialogue, all of it translated and voice acted by humans, and checked by language teachers. The studio did experiment with AI translation, says Ratcliffe, and found that when they used it with languages other than English the results were significantly worse. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found in our tests that going into English is actually OK, though nothing with AI is ever perfect,\u201d he says. \u201cThese large language models have learned a lot of English. Going into other languages, especially less popular languages, it gets more and more out there, more and more confused.\u201d Any game developer making a game with lots of words and dialogue, then, is looking at a high localisation cost \u2013 and presumably cares about the meaning and nuance of those words as much as the author of a book. When it comes to how people feel about AI translation, there is a definite distinction between utility and craft. Few object to using AI in the same way as a dictionary, to discern meaning. But translators, of course, do much more than that. As Dawson puts it: \u201cThese writers are artists in their own right.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve started adding a line \u2018hand-crafted without the use of generative AI\u2019 to my translations,\u201d says Hutchison. \u201cAs translators we need to be very vocal about what our work involves right now, given the threat to our existence. It\u2019s a lot more than just typing with a dictionary.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US air force has backpedaled on a claim that the supreme court\u2019s recent reversal of the Chevron doctrine shields it against regulators\u2019 orders to clean drinking water the military polluted in Tucson, Arizona. The air force\u2019s bases partially contaminated water supplies for more than 500,000 people with toxic PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d and other dangerous compounds. In a July letter in which it refused to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s May orders to address the problem, air force attorneys cited the reversal of Chevron. It claimed \u201cthe EPA\u2019s order can not withstand review\u201d. However, in a 24 October letter, the air force changed its position, and agreed to partially fund treatment plants that will remove the extremely high levels of PFAS contaminating some of Tucson\u2019s water supplies. The change of course follows an August Guardian story on the issue that generated outrage. Legal observers who reviewed the claim in August highly doubted it would hold up if the military attempted to act on it. The new plan agreed upon by the air force, city of Tucson and EPA was \u201cexcellent\u201d and would address the PFAS pollution while stipulating that the air force pay its fair share, said David Uhlmann, an assistant administrator with the EPA\u2019s enforcement division. \u201cThis plan provides a long-term solution to address PFAS pollution in the aquifer,\u201d Uhlmann said, noting that it was especially important in the desert west where drinking water supplies are limited. The supreme court in late June overturned the 40-year-old Chevron doctrine, one of its most important precedents. The decision sharply cut regulators\u2019 power by giving judges the final say in interpreting ambiguous areas of the law during rule-making. Judges previously gave deference to regulatory agency experts on such questions, and the reversal is expected to have a profound impact on the EPA\u2019s ability to protect the public from pollution. A 10-sq-mile (26 sq km) area around the facilities and Tucson international airport was in the 1980s designated as a Superfund site, an action reserved for the nation\u2019s most polluted areas. While several air force bases are responsible for trichloroethylene (TCE) \u2013 volatile organic compounds \u2013 and PFAS contamination, the municipal airport also used PFAS-laden firefighting foam on the site and is responsible for some of the pollution. Filtration systems put in place in 2014 for TCE and other chemicals are currently removing PFAS, but the systems were not designed to remove PFAS, and the added burden is straining the system. Officials previously shut down a well in 2021 when contaminated water nearly broke through the system, the EPA wrote. Such a breach could leave the entire Arizona city without safe water. The air force\u2019s refusal to comply with the EPA order was viewed as an early indication of how polluters will wield the ruling to evade responsibility and underscored the stakes. Legal observers in August said the military was attempting to expand the scope of the Chevron ruling, and it could not be applied to EPA enforcement actions like the Tucson order \u2013 it only affects the rule-making process. Moreover, one arm of a presidential administration cannot sue another, so the military cannot sue the EPA. Uhlmann said he was not sure why the air force made the Chevron claim, but added he did not \u201cthink the statements made in the July letter were views shared by senior defense officials or air force leadership\u201d. \u201cThe EPA and DoD take seriously the obligation of the US government to address PFAS contamination and other forms of pollution related to operation of DoD installations,\u201d Uhlmann told the Guardian. Part of the dispute lay in the level of responsibility for the pollution, and the new agreement will continue an investigation into the percentage for which each party must pay. In the meantime, the air force has agreed to pay for 50% of past costs, which the city has so far covered. It will also pay 50% of the future capital costs for new plants, as well as operation and maintenance into perpetuity.

In 1982, there was a BBC1 TV show called Pebble Mill at One, which featured Glynn Christian as its pioneering TV chef, who I think paved the way for the likes of Keith Floyd and all the celebrity chefs who followed. Glynn used to cook privately for my parents\u2019 business partners, and through this connection my brother Al got his 15 minutes of fame at the age of 13. I don\u2019t remember the whys and wherefores; I just knew that he was going to cook on the television! I don\u2019t know if there was a brief, but my pa decided that Al should cook a fish dish: namely golden pan-fried fish with ginger and spring onions. The Chinese characters for this dish translate literally as \u201cfried, sealed fish\u201d, which loses all of its poetry, but what it lacks in translation, it makes up for in flavour.</p> <p>My father is not a soft taskmaster, so for weeks running up to the event, he must have made Al cook this dish every night, sometimes even twice a night, until he was satisfied that he had perfected the technique. He would stand behind Al, watching critically over his shoulder. The ginger was too fine, then not fine enough. The spring onions were cut unevenly. The fish was cooked, but not golden \u2013 the heat was too low; the fish was golden but not cooked \u2013 the heat was too high. I remember the focus, the concentration, the single-mindedness of those cooking sessions, and it felt as if we were having to eat 5,000 fishes in a month.</p> <p>I usually steam my fish, but I recently decided to replicate that same dish at home. This method of cooking produces food that evokes an oral sensation that the Chinese call \u201cmouth fragrant\u201d \u2013 that is, literally something that smells good in your mouth. Fish with a slightly firmer flesh produces the best results, because it can withstand all the swirling around in the pan; thanks to its meatier texture, my kids call this \u201cchicken fish\u201d. I don\u2019t have to focus or concentrate in the same way as my brother did, partly because I\u2019m not cooking for my pa and partly because I\u2019m not nine years old, but properly chopped ingredients do make a difference, so I try to do him and the dish justice.</p> <p>My kids like sauce, and I like sauce \u2013 in fact, I reckon I could survive mostly on rice and sauce \u2013 so the proportions below are just enough to enrobe the fish while maintaining its crisp edges.

And that\u2019s how we ended up doing things together.\u201d</p> <p>Ed was Ed Kuepper; Chris was Chris Bailey. And the three of them, kids in Brisbane at the start of the 70s, would become the Saints, the band that kickstarted Australian punk, the band who released their first, thrilling single (I\u2019m) Stranded in September 1976 \u2013 before the Damned or the Pistols or the Clash had got anything out \u2013 and then arrived in the UK the following year as a fully formed maelstrom of intensity and ambition.</p> <p>Now the band\u2019s debut album has been reissued in a deluxe box set edition, and Kuepper and Hay have assembled a band to perform together, first in Australia but with hopes of coming to Europe. Mudhoney\u2019s Mark Arm is singing in place of Bailey, who died in 2022, and fellow heroes of Australian alternative music Mick Harvey (Birthday Party, Bad Seeds) and Peter Oxley (Sunnyboys) complete the lineup.</p> <p>\u201cChris and I had met in school detention,\u201d Kuepper says. \u201cWe were both outsiders in terms of music and politics.\u201d And in Brisbane, in Queensland, it wasn\u2019t hard to feel like an outsider. The state was run by a hard-right premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and it was not a place in which youthful exuberance was encouraged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/70Blia4zXTBhuExWQjX2DA?si=HwWKv7zlQWuMgtooPto4Tg\">  <iframe height=\"352\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/70Blia4zXTBhuExWQjX2DA?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re living in it, you get used to it,\u201d Hay says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the frog in the boiling water \u2013 you never really kind of notice as the temperature rises. But whenever you went out, there was always the feeling that the police will come and grab you. If you were under 20, you were a target.\u201d</p> <p>Once they started writing songs, the trio \u2013 especially Kuepper, with his ultra-fast, ultra-tough guitar playing \u2013 divined the energy of the earliest rock\u2019n\u2019roll, filtered through the energy and aggression of the Stooges, with a big dose of homegrown garage rock heroes the Masters Apprentices.</p> <p>\u201cI had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to sound like,\u201d Kuepper says. \u201cAnd Chris was just a natural as a singer. We were working on something that was, in my mind, completely unique.\u201d You can hear quite how focused that vision was on a set of home recordings from 1974, later released as The Most Primitive Band in the World: this is quite clearly high-energy punk rock, before the fact.</p> <p>The only problem was that no one knew who they were, and there was virtually no opportunity to play in Brisbane. \u201cIn Queensland, the music industry was dominated by one promoter,\u201d says Kym Bradshaw, who joined as bassist in 1976. \u201cHe wanted bands who only played covers like Smoke on the Water, and the Saints were never going to do that.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cI had a fairly romantic idea that we would just cut through with the purity of our vision,\u201d Kuepper says. \u201cThat because we were so different to everything else in town it would have a massive drawing effect \u2013 which it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>In June 1976, the Saints went into the studio and cut (I\u2019m) Stranded, pressing just 500 copies. Few in Australia cared, but Kuepper sent copies to the English music press. \u201cSingle of this and every week,\u201d wrote Jonh Ingham in Sounds. The response led EMI in the UK to order the Australian branch of the label to sign up the band, and they recorded their first album at the end of the year, releasing it in February 1977. Now the time had come to leave home.</p> <p>First, the band began playing around Sydney and Melbourne in early 1977, which was a mixed experience. \u201cA lot of people had started to hear <em>about</em> us, but they hadn\u2019t heard us,\u201d Kuepper says. \u201cWe did some ridiculous shows in Sydney. We played with the Ritchie Family, who were an American disco group. Who came up with that idea?\u201d</p> <p>But one Sydney show \u2013 featured in the new box \u2013 did pass into legend. On 21 April 1977, the Saints played alongside local proto-punk legends Radio Birdman at Paddington Town Hall, and Bailey sarcastically thanked \u201cthe local chapter of the Hitler Youth\u201d for decorating the venue with Radio Birdman\u2019s red and black military-styled insignia.</p> <p>Mythology records this as some huge event, though the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/X5YP_tsPzmg?si=VK5reNcocWWSrESu\">video of the show</a> shows an audience entirely unbothered. \u201cSome people took offence at Chris\u2019s commentary,\u201d Kuepper says. \u201cAnd it was a small scene, so it became a big thing. But most people didn\u2019t give a shit.\u201d Nevertheless, the sheer power and velocity of the band is evident from the footage, Hay driving the band with ferocious drumming.</p> <p>By early summer, the Saints were in the UK. \u201cIt was absolutely necessary for us to move to London,\u201d Kuepper says. \u201cIt was just planned to be a couple of months to tour and maybe do some recording, but it was really enjoyable, and it was really promising. And so we decided there was absolutely no reason for us to move back to Australia.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_db5TrZ75II\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_db5TrZ75II?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Things began promisingly. Their single This Perfect Day \u2013 arguably the single most exciting song from the first wave of punk \u2013 hit No 34 in the charts and the band appeared on Top of the Pops, Bailey throwing forth nihilism in a Jaggeresque drawl over backing that sounded like the end of the world: \u201cI need nothing / Don\u2019t need no one / I need nothing / Nothing at all.\u201d</p> <p>They didn\u2019t look like punks: they wore street clothes, and Bailey even had long hair. While some were dismayed, others were inspired. \u201cI remember Mark E Smith talking about seeing the Saints on the TV,\u201d Mick Harvey says. \u201cHe loved them because they were just wearing old jumpers. He could see that they were not part of any kind of fashion or movement. They were just in their own zone and didn\u2019t care about anything else.\u201d</p> <p>This Perfect Day, though, didn\u2019t rise in the charts after Top of the Pops. EMI, for whatever reason, failed to press enough copies, and with no one able to buy it, the single rapidly disappeared. Artistically, the band were reaching a high point, but already things were beginning to go wrong.</p> <p>The second and third Saints albums \u2013 Eternally Yours and Prehistoric Sounds \u2013 departed from the punk template, adding horns, incorporating hints of soul, and straying into the edges of post-punk before punk even entered its post-phase. They were remarkable and brilliant, but not what anyone particularly expected or wanted outside the Saints, or even in some cases within the Saints.</p> <p>Hay says EMI regarded them as mere \u201ccolonials\u201d, rarely considering their interests. As 1977 progressed and punk ossified into a series of postures \u2013 pogoing, gobbing, lowest common denominator riffing \u2013 the band felt more and more at odds with the scene they thought would welcome them. Bradshaw left during 1977, and Bailey was growing disillusioned as well.</p>    <p>\u201cInitially, Chris had the time of his life,\u201d Kuepper says. \u201cBut I wanted to push things musically in a way he didn\u2019t see eye to eye with. He was starting to write more himself \u2013 I had always rejected his songs. I feel bad about that these days. But they weren\u2019t representative of what we were doing.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey was so unhappy that Kuepper had to talk him out of leaving before they recorded Prehistoric Sounds, and as soon as it was released, the band was dropped by EMI and fell apart. Bailey would soon take the name for himself, and put together a new and very different version of the Saints. But in the intervening years, the original Saints began to assume their position of one of the pioneers of both punk and Australian rock.</p> <p>\u201cThere were two of the best songwriters Australia has ever produced in that band,\u201d Mick Harvey says. \u201cAustralians, in their bizarre way, are very proud that this crazy band from Brisbane went over and showed there was stuff happening in Australia that you couldn\u2019t have imagined.\u201d</p> <p>Bradshaw remembers being back in Brisbane \u201ca little while ago, and there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-06/brisbane-mural-honours-musical-legacy-of-the-saints/9230768\">a huge mural</a> \u2013 it must be 100 yards long \u2013 and it\u2019s all about the Saints.

It was the latest example of Infantino\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.as.com/soccer/fifa-congratulates-sportsman-trump-on-election-victory-n/\">oleaginous flattery</a> of Trump, whom in 2018 Infantino called <a href=\"https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-fifa-president-gianni-infantino-u-s-soccer-president-carlos-cordeiro-2026-world-cup/\">\u201cpart of the Fifa team\u201d</a>.

The expanded 48-team tournament in 2026 is a joint effort with Mexico and Canada but most matches will take place in the US. \u201cFootball Unites The World!\u201d Infantino added in his victory message to Trump.</p> <p>The next American president\u2019s power to set tone and policy may be problematic, though, given his status as a confrontational figurehead who uses sports as a tool for sowing division and scoring points against rivals, and as a politician whose nativist conservative beliefs run contrary to the progressive internationalist values espoused by many leagues and governing bodies.</p> <p>The competitions are money-making operations for Fifa and the International Olympic Committee and public relations opportunities for the hosts. \u201cEvery time countries host the Olympics and the World Cup they\u2019re trying to get their message out to the world, trying to use it as an opportunity to show off.

Since 2008, the Olympics have been held in Russia and twice in China; there have also been World Cups in Russia and Qatar, with tournaments in Morocco and Saudi Arabia on the horizon.</p> <p>The 2026 World Cup is the first \u201cto incorporate human rights in its bidding process, which requires the US government to adhere to the highest human rights standards,\u201d says Andrea Florence, director of the Sport &amp; Rights Alliance, a coalition of advocacy groups. \u201cTrump\u2019s previous disregard to international human rights obligations could have far-reaching consequences, not only jeopardising protections in the US but potentially setting a troubling precedent for future global sporting events.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s track record of exploiting workers and weaponising trans women and girls in sport, potential plans for mass deportation of immigrants and turning military forces against citizens, and general racist, misogynistic and transphobic rhetoric are areas of particular concern \u2013 all of which can and will exacerbate human rights violations at mega sporting events.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump, Infantino spends much of his time in Florida: Fifa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/06/fifa-legal-department-move-prompts-fears-of-delay-to-sexual-abuse-cases\">legal and ethics</a> divisions are newly <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/fifa-world-cup/article291866095.html\">based in Miami</a>.

But Trump\u2019s agenda contradicts some of the pledges outlined in Fifa\u2019s 2026 <a href=\"https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/494d934f7de1bad/original/FWC26-Human-Rights-Framework_Final_EN_24-July-2024.pdf\">Human Rights Framework</a>, which says the organisation aims to make the World Cup \u201cone of the most diverse and inclusive celebrations of all time\u201d.</p> <p>The framework highlights a commitment to support potentially at-risk groups, including women, ethnic minorities, disabled people, immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, migrant workers, LGBTQ+ people and journalists. These are all sections of society that Trump has attacked, whether through rhetoric, policy, or both.</p> <p>Many American sports bodies, including all the major leagues and the US Soccer Federation, have incorporated Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives into their corporate cultures and hiring practices in an attempt to boost support for, and representation of, minority groups.</p>    <p>These types of initiatives are certain to be targets for the Trump administration, and perhaps the conservative-dominated US supreme court. This year a right-wing legal group founded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/01/trump-stephen-miller-anti-white-racism-plan\">Stephen Miller</a>, an architect of Trump\u2019s anti-immigration policies, filed a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/06/rooney-rule-legal-complaint-diversity-eeoc/\">federal civil rights lawsuit</a> against the NFL arguing that its Rooney Rule, which obliges teams to interview minority candidates for senior posts, is illegal.</p> <p>The Olympics and World Cup were awarded to the US during Trump\u2019s first term and he clearly feels a sense of ownership: as the Paris Games closed, Trump <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-takes-credit-la-2028-olympics-1937666\">credited himself</a> with securing the Olympics.

      "bodyText": "Very soon after the outcome of the US presidential election was clear, Fifa\u2019s president issued an old photograph of himself shaking hands with a beaming, football-clasping, Donald Trump. \u201cCongratulations Mr President! We will have a great Fifa World Cup and a great Fifa Club World Cup in the United States of America!\u201d Gianni Infantino wrote on social media. It was the latest example of Infantino\u2019s oleaginous flattery of Trump, whom in 2018 Infantino called \u201cpart of the Fifa team\u201d. And vice versa, it seems. In January 2020, during Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial, Infantino introduced him at a dinner for CEOs in Davos and said Trump had the same \u201cfibre\u201d as world-class footballers. \u201cHe is a competitor,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cHe says actually what many think, but more importantly, he does, then, what he says.\u201d Trump called Infantino \u201cmy great friend\u201d. The US will be the centre of the sporting world during Trump\u2019s second term as hosts of the 2025 Club World Cup, the 2026 men\u2019s World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games. The expanded 48-team tournament in 2026 is a joint effort with Mexico and Canada but most matches will take place in the US. \u201cFootball Unites The World!\u201d Infantino added in his victory message to Trump. The next American president\u2019s power to set tone and policy may be problematic, though, given his status as a confrontational figurehead who uses sports as a tool for sowing division and scoring points against rivals, and as a politician whose nativist conservative beliefs run contrary to the progressive internationalist values espoused by many leagues and governing bodies. The competitions are money-making operations for Fifa and the International Olympic Committee and public relations opportunities for the hosts. \u201cEvery time countries host the Olympics and the World Cup they\u2019re trying to get their message out to the world, trying to use it as an opportunity to show off. That\u2019s kind of what hosting these mega-events are about,\u201d says Adrien Bouchet, director of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. \u201cHis idea of what the United States is these days \u2013 it\u2019ll be interesting to see what it entails.\u201d Trump is a leader with authoritarian instincts who swept to power with a dark and violent vision of \u201ca nation that is dying\u201d, calling the US \u201clike a garbage can for the rest of the world to dump the people that they don\u2019t want\u201d. His political platform could spark tension between the culturally open and cosmopolitan cities that will stage events and a national government stoking insularity and intolerance. If his anti-democracy aspirations are realised, the American showpieces are at risk of becoming the latest in a lengthening line of mega-events in illiberal countries. Since 2008, the Olympics have been held in Russia and twice in China; there have also been World Cups in Russia and Qatar, with tournaments in Morocco and Saudi Arabia on the horizon. The 2026 World Cup is the first \u201cto incorporate human rights in its bidding process, which requires the US government to adhere to the highest human rights standards,\u201d says Andrea Florence, director of the Sport &amp; Rights Alliance, a coalition of advocacy groups. \u201cTrump\u2019s previous disregard to international human rights obligations could have far-reaching consequences, not only jeopardising protections in the US but potentially setting a troubling precedent for future global sporting events. \u201cTrump\u2019s track record of exploiting workers and weaponising trans women and girls in sport, potential plans for mass deportation of immigrants and turning military forces against citizens, and general racist, misogynistic and transphobic rhetoric are areas of particular concern \u2013 all of which can and will exacerbate human rights violations at mega sporting events.\u201d Like Trump, Infantino spends much of his time in Florida: Fifa\u2019s legal and ethics divisions are newly based in Miami. Fifa promises it is \u201ccommitted to respecting all internationally recognised human rights and shall strive to promote the protection of these rights.\u201d But rights groups have already sounded the alarm over Fifa\u2019s handling of Saudi Arabia\u2019s uncontested bid. \u201cFifa\u2019s failure to implement its own human rights policies in relation to Saudi Arabia\u2019s bid to host the 2034 World Cup make it all the more important that national, state and local officials in the US, Canada and Mexico move forward to implement the 2026 human rights framework,\u201d said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. With stadiums already built, the 2026 World Cup presents less risk to construction workers than Qatar 2022, Saudi Arabia or the 2030 edition that will largely be held in Morocco, Portugal and Spain. But Trump\u2019s agenda contradicts some of the pledges outlined in Fifa\u2019s 2026 Human Rights Framework, which says the organisation aims to make the World Cup \u201cone of the most diverse and inclusive celebrations of all time\u201d. The framework highlights a commitment to support potentially at-risk groups, including women, ethnic minorities, disabled people, immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, migrant workers, LGBTQ+ people and journalists. These are all sections of society that Trump has attacked, whether through rhetoric, policy, or both. Many American sports bodies, including all the major leagues and the US Soccer Federation, have incorporated Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives into their corporate cultures and hiring practices in an attempt to boost support for, and representation of, minority groups. These types of initiatives are certain to be targets for the Trump administration, and perhaps the conservative-dominated US supreme court. This year a right-wing legal group founded by Stephen Miller, an architect of Trump\u2019s anti-immigration policies, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the NFL arguing that its Rooney Rule, which obliges teams to interview minority candidates for senior posts, is illegal. The Olympics and World Cup were awarded to the US during Trump\u2019s first term and he clearly feels a sense of ownership: as the Paris Games closed, Trump credited himself with securing the Olympics. Though Trump is a friend of Fifa, relations are considerably cooler between the president-elect and the IOC, which has not commented on his victory. After some Christians criticised segments of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony as blasphemous, Trump labelled the show \u201ca disgrace\u201d and promised to prevent any sacrilegious content appearing in 2028. Friction between Democrat-run cities and Republican state and national leaders is a feature of American politics and it is not hard to imagine a war of words breaking out between LA 2028 organisers and the White House given the $900m in federal infrastructure funds committed ahead of the Games and since California is a liberal state Trump has routinely assailed as a hellscape. In 2020, Karen Bass, now the mayor of Los Angeles, called Trump a racist who \u201cessentially [gives] license to racists\u201d. Environmental goals are now routine for sporting events \u2013 LA wants to be \u201cno car\u201d \u2013 but it is hard to imagine a Republican administration will push organisers to keep their promises given that Trump has called climate change \u201ca hoax\u201d and intends to scupper clean energy projects. Trump is also expected to roll back federal protections for gay and transgender people. He targeted two female boxing Olympic gold medallists in his election campaign, claiming they are men as a justification for his plan to revoke anti-discrimination measures issued by the Biden administration. \u201cWe will of course keep men out of women\u2019s sports,\u201d he said \u2013 a stance that seems sure to put him at loggerheads with the IOC and other governing bodies who set gender eligibility criteria. Hurling sports deeper into the culture wars also brings risks for sponsors. In September the IOC lost one of its key supporters, Toyota, with the automaker\u2019s chairman complaining that the Games are \u201cincreasingly political\u201d. But Trump has sought to blur the lines between sport and politics, looking for confrontations with the NFL, NBA and the US women\u2019s soccer team over national anthem protests against civil rights abuses. Using sports as a patriotic purity test, he has termed players with opposing political stances as un-American and said the US team were eliminated from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup because players were too woke and \u201copenly hostile to America\u201d.

As well as using sports to burnish his celebrity status and seek political advantage, the president-elect has a direct financial stake through his golf courses, three of which hosted tournaments last year on the Saudi-financed LIV Golf tour, with another stop in 2024. Rory McIlroy expressed optimism this month that Trump can act as a peace broker between LIV and the PGA Tour. \u201cTrump has a great relationship with Saudi Arabia. He\u2019s got a great relationship with golf. He\u2019s a lover of golf. So, maybe. Who knows?\u201d McIlroy said. If Trump were to pressure Ukraine into a ceasefire in the war with Russia, Vladimir Putin may see an opening, perhaps with Trump\u2019s help, to push for Russia\u2019s reintegration into Fifa, Uefa and Olympic competitions. He may be less conciliatory towards Iran, who are likely to qualify for 2026: the country was allegedly behind a plot to kill him. Stadiums should be packed in a diverse nation of more than 335 million people. But Trump has vowed to reinstate and expand his first-term \u201cMuslim travel ban\u201d, which affected countries including Iran and Nigeria. Citizens of only 42 countries are allowed visa-free entry to the US and in some places it may already be too late for foreign fans to apply for a tourist visa to attend the finals. Last week the wait for an appointment in Bogota was 710 days; in Istanbul it was 692 days. Given Trump\u2019s intention to devote resources to mass deportations and curtailing legal immigration, reducing Biden-era backlogs for visitors is unlikely to be a priority. Even if restrictions are temporarily eased for the tournaments, upheaval at the border, combined with an abrasive and isolationist foreign policy and economic stresses from Trump\u2019s proposed trade tariffs, may strain relations with allies, dissuade visitors and tarnish the US\u2019s image abroad; hardly conducive to a festive atmosphere for international sports\u2019 biggest parties.",

      "body": "<p>One day in the 1990s, I was playing with my cousin in a local park in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, the capital of Romanian-speaking Moldova, when two little girls from the Russian-speaking minority asked us what our names were. We told them: Mihai and Maria Paula. They immediately rebaptised us: \u201c<em>Misha i Masha!</em>\u201d To them, we were all Russians after all.</p> <p>In 2024, such expressions of cultural imperialism are still rife in Putin\u2019s Russia, but you wouldn\u2019t expect to find them among Russian liberals, an estimated million of whom left their country after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago.</p> <p>And yet there are still moments like these, such as at a Chi\u0219in\u0103u concert earlier this year by Russian cult band Mashina Vremeni (Time Machine), whose founder Andrey Makarevich has been branded a \u201cforeign agent\u201d by his home country over his criticism of the invasion. When the crowd was slow to pick up on Makarevich\u2019s attempt to cue up a sing-along, he tried to talk them up: \u201cThis is what our nation is like, we never get things right the first time round.\u201d There it was again, that old reflex: \u201cour nation.\u201d</p> <p>In this particular case, perhaps age can explain, if not excuse, such deeply ingrained attitudes: Mashina Vremeni was founded in 1969, when Moldova was still forced to share a nation with Russia through the Soviet Union.</p>    <p>But the younger members of the supposedly liberal Russian diaspora seem just as prone to revealing slips of the tongue. Tatar pop-rock singer Zemfira, who has also been labelled a foreign agent and has lived in exile since the start of the war, made her debut on the music scene in the late 90s. Yet in the middle of a performance in Chi\u0219in\u0103u in June, she told her audience that after touring Europe, she felt \u201cat home here because I am a Soviet person\u201d.</p> <p>Hearing those words from within the crowd, I couldn\u2019t believe that the artist I admired did not realise that her feeling of \u201chome\u201d \u2013 probably inspired by the architecture of a city destroyed in the second world war and most Moldovans\u2019 fluency in Russian \u2013 was the direct result of Russia once having occupied my country.</p> <p>Lithuanian philosopher Viktoras Bachmetjevas had a similar experience at a concert by Russian rock musician Boris Grebenshchikov in March last year. Blacklisted in the Soviet Union in the 70s and 80s, and again in Putin\u2019s Russia since 2022, there is little doubt about Grebenshchikov\u2019s dissident credentials. But did he understand that even he, as a Russian citizen at odds with the regime, could still be held accountable for his country\u2019s actions?</p> <p>\u201cI kept waiting, wanting him to make an anti-war gesture, but he did not,\u201d Bachmetjevas recalls. During the concert, the stage was lit in blue and yellow colours, which the philosopher perceived as too timid a statement of solidarity with Ukraine. \u201cNow is not the time for subtle gestures.\u201d</p> <p>Bachmetjevas is one of a growing number of intellectuals in central and eastern Europe who propose that we think about post-invasion Russia in the same ethical category as Nazi Germany. While war and other crimes should be persecuted on an individual basis, he argues, responsibility for the country\u2019s conduct in Ukraine cannot be completely offloaded to its political elite. \u201cBy definition, political responsibility, which individuals carry as members of their political community, is a collective one,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>Does the fact that the Russian state is a dictatorship not negate the argument for collective responsibility? Bachmetjevas argues that Russia\u2019s citizens allowed democracy to wither away into tyranny, giving up their freedoms in exchange for promises of prosperity and national greatness. \u201cNo Russian citizen is single-handedly culpable for what happened and is happening \u2013 it is precisely a collective failure.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the Russians who have left their country since the start of the invasion have settled in Georgia, Armenia, Serbia and Turkey, in the Baltics or other EU states. Yet within the post-2022 Russian diaspora, \u201cvery few put in an effort to learn the languages and understand the context of the country they moved to\u201d, argues Armenian anthropologist Lusine Kharatyan. Typically, she says, Russians try harder to integrate in the EU or the US rather than in countries of the former Soviet bloc, where Russian is often still spoken as a second language due to its history of occupation and migration.</p> <p>Even some members of the liberal Russian diaspora espouse \u201ca nostalgia for a lost \u2018greatness\u2019\u201d, Kharatyan adds. Invited to a Russian-in-exile gathering in 2022, the Yerevan-based author said she felt as if she was mostly talked at rather than talked to. Some migrant activists tried to \u201cteach the locals\u201d about urban or environmental issues with little attempt to learn about previous local initiatives, something that Kharatyan attributes to a Russian superiority complex towards \u201cbackward and traditional\u201d Armenians.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we are supposed to read all those great Russian classics,\u201d she says, Russians volunteering to read Armenian classics was \u201crarely the case\u201d.</p>    <p>Kyiv-based novelist Andrey Kurkov agrees that notions of Russian cultural supremacy and its political imperialism have become inextricably intertwined: \u201cPushkin statues in Ukraine are not about literature but about marking Russian territory,\u201d he says. \u201cTo prove that they don\u2019t merely want a \u2018redecorated Russia\u2019 with one tsar replaced by another.\u201d Kurkov adds that members of the Russian opposition need to \u201cgive up on the idea of their greatness\u201d.</p> <p>There are some positive examples of Russian intellectuals denouncing the imperialist discourse. Journalist Mikhail Zygar wrote his 2023 book War and Punishment: The Story of Russian Oppression and Ukrainian Resistance to tackle seven persistent myths used to justify Moscow\u2019s colonisation of Ukraine.</p> <p>\u201cMany Russian writers and historians are complicit in facilitating this war,\u201d Zygar writes in the introduction. \u201cIt is their words and thoughts over the past 350 years that sowed the seeds of Russian fascism and allowed it to flourish, although many would be horrified today to see the fruits of their labour \u2026 We overlooked the fact that, for many centuries, \u2018great Russian culture\u2019 belittled other countries and peoples, suppressed and destroyed them.\u201d</p>    <p>When Berlin-based Russian author Vladimir Sorokin, author of the terrifyingly prophetic dystopian novel Day of the Oprichnik, came to meet his Chi\u0219in\u0103u readers in April earlier this year, he kept mentioning his Romanian translations, respectfully acknowledging the difference between Moldova and his native country.</p> <p>Russian actor Masha Mashkova, who condemned the invasion of Ukraine and now lives in the US, also added Romanian surtitles to the Chi\u0219in\u0103u performance of her new play, Nadezhdiny, based on the diary of her Chi\u0219in\u0103u-born great-great-grandmother, a printer and copy editor who married the Kharkiv-born revolutionary Evgeny Osipovich Zelensky-Nadezhdin. Now on a global tour, Nadezhdiny will also have Latvian surtitles in Riga in an effort to attract local audiences. </p> <p>\u201cAs a Russian, I want to tell people in Moldova that I am aware of being a guest in your country and I respect your choice of language,\u201d Mashkova says. \u201cAnd I think my great-great-grandmother would have liked that.\u201d</p>",

I can still feel his hug.\u201d</p> <p>Garfunkel was speaking as he promoted new album Father and Son, made with his son Art Jr, who also discussed his father\u2019s reunion with Simon. \u201cThey\u2019ve had their ups and downs over the years, but after the meeting, Dad was so happy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe called me and said, \u2018Paul\u2019s my brother; he\u2019s family.\u2019 I do think there is a possibility of them getting together musically. I\u2019m speaking hypothetically here, but maybe a big TV/charity event. And with a bit of encouragement from their peers in the music industry, that could lead to some new material.\u201d</p>    <p>Simon &amp; Garfunkel were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed duos in US history, part of a mid-1960s generation who turned folk music into a pop cultural phenomenon. Their debut album initially flopped but the single The Sound of Silence became a slow-burn success, leading to a series of hit albums that culminated with Bridge Over Troubled Water in 1970.</p> <p>But they had a fractious relationship, starting towards the beginning of their partnership, with a solo single Simon recorded under a pseudonym: \u201cThe friendship was shattered for life \u2026 I never forget, and I never really forgive,\u201d Garfunkel later wrote in his memoir.</p> <p>Simon was also affronted by Garfunkel\u2019s acting career, which had begun in the late 1960s. \u201cI think if Artie had become a big movie star he would have left,\u201d Simon wrote in his own memoir. \u201cInstead of just being the guy who sang Paul Simon songs, he could be Art Garfunkel, a big star all by himself \u2026 This made me think about how I could still be the guy who wrote songs and sing them. I didn\u2019t need Artie.\u201d Simon split them up following Bridge Over Troubled Water, despite being at the height of their fame with a Grammy award for album of the year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/04/i-never-said-i-was-going-to-retire-paul-simon-on-disability-drive-and-the-mystery-behind-his-greatest-songs\">\u2018I never said I was going to retire ...\u2019 Paul Simon on disability, drive and the mystery behind his greatest songs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They reunited in 1981 for a huge concert in New York\u2019s Central Park, but didn\u2019t continue past a world tour the following year. There was another reunion tour in 1993, but again, they didn\u2019t fully reconcile. In 2001, Paul Simon said as he was inducted into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/22/cher-ozzy-osbourne-tribe-called-quest-2024-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-inductees\">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>: \u201cI regret the ending of our friendship. I hope that some day before we die we will make peace with each other. No rush.\u201d</p> <p>In 2003, they launched the Old Friends tour, but that kindly title couldn\u2019t paper over deeper rifts. Garfunkel remained angry in 2015 at the duo\u2019s split, saying in an interview: \u201cHow can you walk away from this lucky place on top of the world, Paul? What\u2019s going on with you, you idiot? How could you let that go, jerk?\u201d Simon said in 2016: \u201cQuite honestly, we don\u2019t get along. So it\u2019s not like it\u2019s fun [to perform together] \u2026 So that\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d</p> <p>Simon, 83, has retired from touring, and even one-off live performances were imperilled by hearing loss he began experiencing during the recording of 2023 album <a href=\"https://sevenpsalms.paulsimon.com/\">Seven Psalms</a>. But he told the Guardian in an interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/04/i-never-said-i-was-going-to-retire-paul-simon-on-disability-drive-and-the-mystery-behind-his-greatest-songs\">in October</a>: \u201cI\u2019m hoping to eventually be able to do a full-length concert.

Their debut album initially flopped but the single The Sound of Silence became a slow-burn success, leading to a series of hit albums that culminated with Bridge Over Troubled Water in 1970. But they had a fractious relationship, starting towards the beginning of their partnership, with a solo single Simon recorded under a pseudonym: \u201cThe friendship was shattered for life \u2026 I never forget, and I never really forgive,\u201d Garfunkel later wrote in his memoir. Simon was also affronted by Garfunkel\u2019s acting career, which had begun in the late 1960s. \u201cI think if Artie had become a big movie star he would have left,\u201d Simon wrote in his own memoir. \u201cInstead of just being the guy who sang Paul Simon songs, he could be Art Garfunkel, a big star all by himself \u2026 This made me think about how I could still be the guy who wrote songs and sing them. I didn\u2019t need Artie.\u201d Simon split them up following Bridge Over Troubled Water, despite being at the height of their fame with a Grammy award for album of the year. They reunited in 1981 for a huge concert in New York\u2019s Central Park, but didn\u2019t continue past a world tour the following year. There was another reunion tour in 1993, but again, they didn\u2019t fully reconcile. In 2001, Paul Simon said as he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: \u201cI regret the ending of our friendship. I hope that some day before we die we will make peace with each other. No rush.\u201d In 2003, they launched the Old Friends tour, but that kindly title couldn\u2019t paper over deeper rifts. Garfunkel remained angry in 2015 at the duo\u2019s split, saying in an interview: \u201cHow can you walk away from this lucky place on top of the world, Paul? What\u2019s going on with you, you idiot? How could you let that go, jerk?\u201d Simon said in 2016: \u201cQuite honestly, we don\u2019t get along. So it\u2019s not like it\u2019s fun [to perform together] \u2026 So that\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d Simon, 83, has retired from touring, and even one-off live performances were imperilled by hearing loss he began experiencing during the recording of 2023 album Seven Psalms. But he told the Guardian in an interview in October: \u201cI\u2019m hoping to eventually be able to do a full-length concert. I\u2019m optimistic. Six months ago I was pessimistic.\u201d Garfunkel, also 83, continues to perform live and will appear at five New York City concerts this month alongside his son and other members of his family.",

      "bodyText": "A young Australian actor at the centre of a multimillion-dollar defamation case in the US alleges in documents filed to the Los Angeles superior court that Rebel Wilson made up lies about her and bullied and harassed her on the set of The Deb. Charlotte MacInnes, who stars in the comedy which premiered at the Toronto international film festival in September, alleged in the documents that Wilson repeated claims that one of the film\u2019s three producers, Amanda Ghost, sexually harassed and abused MacInnes, even after she told Wilson no such behaviour had occurred. \u201cI was deeply disturbed by this behaviour, and felt very bullied and harassed by Wilson, who was the director of the film and in a position of authority over me,\u201d MacInnes alleged. \u201cNothing that I told Wilson could reasonably have conveyed that I was reporting any misconduct, because there was no misconduct. \u201cI also understand [there were] claims that I was subjected to \u2018depraved sexual demands\u2019 and that \u2018MacInnes remains captive by Ghost and Cameron as she is shuttled from city to city with them including Boston, New York, and London\u2019. \u201cThese statements are completely false and absurd. I have no idea what could cause Wilson and her attorney to make up such lies about me.\u201d The alleged sexual misconduct is one of three key accusations by Wilson that the film\u2019s three producers, Ghost, her husband Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden are suing the Australian for defamation over. On Wilson\u2019s Instagram account which has more than 11 million followers and in her declarations filed to the court, Wilson has also accused Ghost and Cameron of scheming to embezzle A$900,000 of The Deb\u2019s funding, along with various bullying and unlawful imprisonment allegations. Wilson is countersuing and seeking to use California\u2019s anti-Slapp laws, designed to protect freedom of speech on matters of public interest, to strike the defamation claims made against her. Lawyers acting for the producers filed a motion to strike Wilson\u2019s claim late on Friday LA time, alleging Wilson\u2019s declaration in support of her motion included \u201cmultiple blatant falsehoods and rises to the level of outright perjury\u201d and that Wilson\u2019s complaint focused on a private business dispute, not a public issue. Documents lodged include MacInnes\u2019s declaration, along with statements that offer further evidence on the wrangling over The Deb\u2019s writing credits, which appears to have further inflamed the dispute that could now see both sides\u2019 legal bills run into the millions. Lawyers acting for the producers have requested a 90-day stay in proceedings to establish the source of an anonymous website they say accused Ghost, a British-born producer of Indo-Trinidadian heritage, of being an \u201cIndian Ghislaine Maxwell\u201d. The argument for the stay includes allegations the website, which contained \u201cgrotesque lies\u201d, was registered with the domain name amandaghost.com two days after Wilson sent threatening emails warning she was poised for \u201cgoing public\u201d to \u201cvery publicly ruin them\u201d. Lawyers acting for the producers also allege Wilson\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, sent the producers an email threatening to \u201cblow up\u201d one or more of the plaintiffs in a public filing that included \u201csex trafficking\u201d, which he said \u201ccan\u2019t be good for the film\u201d. The producers have also filed statements alleging Wilson threatened the film\u2019s writer Hannah Reilly, the recipient of the Rebel Wilson theatremaker scholarship that is administered through the Australian Theatre for Young People, which resulted in her play being turned into a film. After Reilly refused to grant Wilson writing credits for the film, Wilson turned to the Australian Writers\u2019 Guild for arbitration and emailed Reilly\u2019s agent, warning: \u201cMoving forward with an arbitration puts your client at significant financial risk and also destroys any remaining relationship or support that your client would receive from me and my associates in the industry.\u201d The AWG found against Wilson\u2019s claim, allowing her to only claim an \u201cadditional writing\u201d credit for the film. The court will hear Wilson\u2019s anti-Slapp motion and the producers\u2019 request for a stay in proceedings on 21 November.",

      "body": "<p>Countries meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, for the Cop29 climate summit are under pressure to find ways to raise money to help poorer nations cut greenhouse gas emissions, shift to a low-carbon economy, and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather.</p> <p>At least $1tn a year is needed. Developed countries are willing to ensure about half of that is provided from public sources, leaving a large gap that countries are hoping to fill with other sources of cash, known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/17/rich-countries-must-urgently-help-poor-nations-hit-by-climate-crisis-says-v20\">innovative forms of finance</a>.</p> <p>These can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/24/rich-countries-could-raise-5tn-of-climate-finance-a-year-study-says\">levies on high-carbon activities</a>, from private jets to oil and gas extraction, or taxes on wealth, an idea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jun/04/global-rich-pay-more-climate-crisis-architect-paris-deal\">gaining traction as global inequality soars</a>. But all of these innovative forms of finance have winners and losers, and some are likely to be difficult to implement.</p> <p>Here are some of the main ideas being considered.</p> <h2>Reform of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other multilateral development banks</h2> <p>The World Bank and other development institutions are supposed to help poor and vulnerable countries alleviate poverty, develop their economies and give their citizens access to basic services. Climate finance should be a major focus. But many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/10/world-bank-must-take-quantum-leap-to-tackle-climate-crisis-un-expert-says\">developing countries complain this finance is meagre, difficult to access, costly and bureaucratic</a>. Accessing finance from the private sector is also tricky for them.</p> <p>If the World Bank were to reform its practices to help \u201cde-risk\u201d investments in poor countries, for instance by providing loan guarantees, that could unlock billions in finance from the private sector and public funds. The World Bank could also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/14/climate-focused-reform-world-bank-could-be-done-year-al-gore\">provide far more climate finance</a> if its replenishment round, coming up next month in South Korea, elicits sizeable pledges from donor countries. That prospect may, however, have been damaged by the election of Donald Trump in the US \u2013 unless other developed countries step up.</p> <p><strong>Rationality: </strong>5/5<br><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> 4/5<br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Can and must be done urgently</p> <h2>Taxes on profits from fossil fuels</h2> <p>Fossil fuel companies, both private companies and those owned by their governments, have enjoyed an unprecedented bonanza since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Five of the biggest private companies alone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/19/worlds-largest-oil-companies-have-made-281bn-profit-since-invasion-of-ukraine\">made more than $280bn in profit in the two years after the invasion</a>. These bumper profits were not linked to any productivity gains or new production but were purely the result of price rises generated by the invasion.</p> <p>Taxing fossil fuel wealth would seem an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/27/windfall-tax-on-covid-profits-could-ease-catastrophic-food-crisis-says-oxfam\">obvious source of climate finance</a>. Even the staid and conservative International Energy Agency has supported windfall taxes on the profits. </p>    <p>Petrostates should also be required to pay up, according to a group of former world leaders headed by Gordon Brown, the former UK prime minister. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/28/former-world-leaders-seek-25bn-levy-on-oil-states-revenues-to-pay-for-climate-damage\">wrote an open letter last year asking for a $25bn levy on petrostates</a>, which would barely dent such countries\u2019 profits but make their first significant contribution to climate finance.</p> <p><strong>Rationality:</strong> 5/5<br><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> 2/5<br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Morally right, but faces powerful opposition</p> <h2>Frequent flyer levy</h2> <p>Only about one in 10 people worldwide take an airline flight in any given year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/17/people-cause-global-aviation-emissions-study-covid-19\">according to research from 2018</a>. Even in the UK, most people do not fly in any given year, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/25/1-of-english-residents-take-one-fifth-of-overseas-flights-survey-shows\">about 20% of international flights are taken by about 1% of the population</a>. One long-haul flight generates as much <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/jul/19/carbon-calculator-how-taking-one-flight-emits-as-much-as-many-people-do-in-a-year\">carbon dioxide as the average person in many developing countries does in a year</a>.</p> <p>Flying is a high-carbon activity mainly by the rich, who fly many times more frequently than the average person. So levies on flying \u2013 in particular if they are introduced in such a way that people are spared charges on their first one or two trips each year, or that fall most heavily on business and first-class passengers \u2013 should target the enormous and growing carbon inequality gap.</p> <p><strong>Rationality:</strong> 4/5<br><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> 5/5<br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Should be a top priority, as a small charge added to a business class flight is hard to argue against and easy to collect</p> <h2>Levy on shipping</h2> <p>International shipping causes about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and other pollutants, because ships use a particularly dirty form of diesel. There is much room for improving the fleet, and promising work is being done on using hydrogen, and even sails, to power future ships.</p> <p>A small <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/22/pressure-grows-on-shipping-industry-to-accept-carbon-levy\">charge on shipping based on the carbon emissions of vessels</a> would be relatively easy to apportion and collect, as ships are closely licensed. Shipping is governed by the International Maritime Organization, a branch of the UN, which has long been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/07/shipping-emissions-levy-delayed-but-goals-for-greenhouse-gas-cuts-agreed\">accused of foot-dragging</a> on reducing the climate impact of the sector, but which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/26/shipping-emissions-could-be-halved-without-damaging-trade-research-finds\">finally begun to move</a>.</p>    <p>Detractors argue that charges on shipping would be passed on to consumers, adding to price inflation. However, a large proportion of the world\u2019s fleet is engaged in carrying fossil fuels, such as liquefied natural gas, and coal, so taxing that would be another incentive to move to cleaner energy.</p> <p><strong>Rationality:</strong> 4/5<br><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> 4/5<br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Instituting a shipping levy has already begun, through the IMO, and could be in place this decade with support from governments</p> <h2>Wealth tax</h2> <p>The world\u2019s billionaires came out of the Covid pandemic richer than ever before. Since 2020, according to Oxfam, <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/wealth-five-richest-men-doubles-2020-five-billion-people-made-poorer-decade-division#:~:text=The%20past%20three%20years'%20supercharged,than%20the%20rate%20of%20inflation.\">their wealth has grown by a staggering $3.3tn</a>, three times faster than the rate of inflation. The world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2024/jan/15/worlds-five-richest-men-double-their-money-as-poorest-get-poorer\">richest five men have doubled their money</a>, while the purchasing power of the poorest 60% has fallen significantly over the same period.</p> <p>These rates of global inequality have not been experienced in well over a century. Yet wealth is more lightly taxed now than in decades. Carbon emissions are following the same pattern: the Guardian reported last year on how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2023/nov/20/the-great-carbon-divide-climate-chasm-rich-poor\">a great carbon divide has opened up</a>, and is widening, as the world\u2019s wealthiest people indulge in luxury lifestyles with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/28/carbon-emissions-of-richest-1-increase-hunger-poverty-and-deaths-says-oxfam#:~:text=Oxfam's%20research%20found%20that%20fifty,425%20hours%20in%20the%20air.\">outsize emissions attached</a>.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has proposed a billionaire tax of 2% that could raise $250bn while affecting only 100 families in the world.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/28/brazil-radical-plan-tax-global-super-rich-tackle-climate-crisis\">few governments have been willing to publicly oppose the policy</a>, many are obstructive in private. Governments are reluctant to announce taxes on billionaires for fear they will flee to more attractive regimes.</p> <p>In fact, most of those who might flee have already gone, and there are ways of levying taxes \u2013 on assets, shares and property, for instance \u2013 that would make flight harder. But the influence of billionaires is proving hard even for progressive governments to counter.</p> <p><strong>Rationality:</strong> 5/5<br><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> 1/5<br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Money talks, and politicians listen. A wealth tax faces stiff opposition from powerful billionaires, so only if political leaders hear clamour from their voters will it have a chance</p> <h2>Reform of harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, agriculture and fishing</h2> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/18/more-than-494bn-subsidies-a-year-are-harmful-to-the-climate-says-report\">$650bn is spent each year in the developing world on harmful subsidies</a> to fossil fuels, agriculture and fisheries, and other polluting industries that do environmental damage. While a small amount of these subsidies could be redistributed to benefit the poor and protect them from high prices, most of the sums are wasted or encourage wasteful practices, such as the excess use of fossil fuels, overfishing or the overextraction of water for farming.</p>    <p>Redirecting these subsidies, to stop them doing active harm and recoup the wasted cash, would free up large chunks of government money in the developed and the developing world and reduce damage to the planet.</p> <p><strong>Rationality:</strong> 5/5<br><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> 2/5<br><strong>Verdict:</strong> This should be a no-brainer, but decades of subsidies have created reliance among some politically powerful industries, which must be weaned off public money for the greater good</p> <h2>Proceeds from carbon trading</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/carbon-markets-credits-offsets-deforestation-aoe\">Selling carbon offsets is an attractive prospect</a>: keeping existing forests is essential to maintain the planet\u2019s vital carbon sinks, and as they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere they help to soak up the emissions from harmful activities. Selling carbon credits could in theory encourage the protection of forests and other carbon sinks, while allowing some emitting activities \u2013 such as flying \u2013 to carry on.</p> <p>Monitoring whether carbon credits are real has become much easier in recent years, with the development of satellite imaging systems that can peep under the canopy of forests and see whether trees are being removed or roads built secretly. It is also possible to more accurately estimate how much carbon vegetation is absorbing from the atmosphere.</p> <p>But the carbon offset sector is beset with problems over the integrity of credits, the transparency of the systems used to estimate their value, and problems over double counting, as well as cases of Indigenous people being poorly treated. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe\">Investigations by the Guardian have uncovered widespread problems in the sector</a>, including companies and consumers paying for credits that have been found ecologically worthless.</p> <p><strong>Rationality:</strong> 2/5<br><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> 1/5<br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Carbon trading is a poor substitute for the real solution of paying developing countries for the good they do for the planet by keeping their forests standing</p> <h2>Carbon tax</h2> <p>If the culprit in the climate crisis is carbon dioxide, why not tax it directly? A carbon tax has been frequently proposed, as a way of encouraging countries, companies and individuals to move away from fossil fuels towards clean energy.</p> <p>Most countries already have carbon taxes in some form, but without calling them carbon tax. These are taxes on fuels or the industries and activities that use fuels and produce goods with them. They are usually not based on the amount of emissions produced, however.</p> <p>Some countries have also embraced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/emissionstrading\">domestic emissions trading schemes</a>, like those in the EU and China, that achieve some of the same ends.</p> <p>However, while a global carbon tax has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/07/carbon-pricing-would-raise-trillions-needed-to-tackle-climate-crisis-says-imf\">frequently proposed</a>, it has proved too easy for detractors, such as fossil fuel companies, to attack, and has never been implemented.</p> <p><strong>Rationality:</strong> 5/5<br><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> 0/5<br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Economists are wedded to the idea of a carbon tax as the most economically efficient way to bring down emissions. But theoretical elegance is no match for real world special interests, and 30 years of theorising has brought the prospect of a global carbon tax no closer. It is time to abandon this utopian concept and seek more realistic solutions while there is time.</p>",

Reform of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other multilateral development banks The World Bank and other development institutions are supposed to help poor and vulnerable countries alleviate poverty, develop their economies and give their citizens access to basic services. Climate finance should be a major focus. But many developing countries complain this finance is meagre, difficult to access, costly and bureaucratic. Accessing finance from the private sector is also tricky for them. If the World Bank were to reform its practices to help \u201cde-risk\u201d investments in poor countries, for instance by providing loan guarantees, that could unlock billions in finance from the private sector and public funds. The World Bank could also provide far more climate finance if its replenishment round, coming up next month in South Korea, elicits sizeable pledges from donor countries. That prospect may, however, have been damaged by the election of Donald Trump in the US \u2013 unless other developed countries step up. Rationality: 5/5 Ease of implementation: 4/5 Verdict: Can and must be done urgently Taxes on profits from fossil fuels Fossil fuel companies, both private companies and those owned by their governments, have enjoyed an unprecedented bonanza since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Five of the biggest private companies alone made more than $280bn in profit in the two years after the invasion. These bumper profits were not linked to any productivity gains or new production but were purely the result of price rises generated by the invasion. Taxing fossil fuel wealth would seem an obvious source of climate finance. Even the staid and conservative International Energy Agency has supported windfall taxes on the profits. Petrostates should also be required to pay up, according to a group of former world leaders headed by Gordon Brown, the former UK prime minister. They wrote an open letter last year asking for a $25bn levy on petrostates, which would barely dent such countries\u2019 profits but make their first significant contribution to climate finance. Rationality: 5/5 Ease of implementation: 2/5 Verdict: Morally right, but faces powerful opposition Frequent flyer levy Only about one in 10 people worldwide take an airline flight in any given year, according to research from 2018. Even in the UK, most people do not fly in any given year, and about 20% of international flights are taken by about 1% of the population. One long-haul flight generates as much carbon dioxide as the average person in many developing countries does in a year. Flying is a high-carbon activity mainly by the rich, who fly many times more frequently than the average person. So levies on flying \u2013 in particular if they are introduced in such a way that people are spared charges on their first one or two trips each year, or that fall most heavily on business and first-class passengers \u2013 should target the enormous and growing carbon inequality gap. Rationality: 4/5 Ease of implementation: 5/5 Verdict: Should be a top priority, as a small charge added to a business class flight is hard to argue against and easy to collect Levy on shipping International shipping causes about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and other pollutants, because ships use a particularly dirty form of diesel. There is much room for improving the fleet, and promising work is being done on using hydrogen, and even sails, to power future ships. A small charge on shipping based on the carbon emissions of vessels would be relatively easy to apportion and collect, as ships are closely licensed. Shipping is governed by the International Maritime Organization, a branch of the UN, which has long been accused of foot-dragging on reducing the climate impact of the sector, but which has finally begun to move. Detractors argue that charges on shipping would be passed on to consumers, adding to price inflation. However, a large proportion of the world\u2019s fleet is engaged in carrying fossil fuels, such as liquefied natural gas, and coal, so taxing that would be another incentive to move to cleaner energy. Rationality: 4/5 Ease of implementation: 4/5 Verdict: Instituting a shipping levy has already begun, through the IMO, and could be in place this decade with support from governments Wealth tax The world\u2019s billionaires came out of the Covid pandemic richer than ever before. Since 2020, according to Oxfam, their wealth has grown by a staggering $3.3tn, three times faster than the rate of inflation. The world\u2019s richest five men have doubled their money, while the purchasing power of the poorest 60% has fallen significantly over the same period. These rates of global inequality have not been experienced in well over a century. Yet wealth is more lightly taxed now than in decades. Carbon emissions are following the same pattern: the Guardian reported last year on how a great carbon divide has opened up, and is widening, as the world\u2019s wealthiest people indulge in luxury lifestyles with outsize emissions attached. Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has proposed a billionaire tax of 2% that could raise $250bn while affecting only 100 families in the world. Although few governments have been willing to publicly oppose the policy, many are obstructive in private. Governments are reluctant to announce taxes on billionaires for fear they will flee to more attractive regimes. In fact, most of those who might flee have already gone, and there are ways of levying taxes \u2013 on assets, shares and property, for instance \u2013 that would make flight harder. But the influence of billionaires is proving hard even for progressive governments to counter. Rationality: 5/5 Ease of implementation: 1/5 Verdict: Money talks, and politicians listen. A wealth tax faces stiff opposition from powerful billionaires, so only if political leaders hear clamour from their voters will it have a chance Reform of harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, agriculture and fishing More than $650bn is spent each year in the developing world on harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, agriculture and fisheries, and other polluting industries that do environmental damage. While a small amount of these subsidies could be redistributed to benefit the poor and protect them from high prices, most of the sums are wasted or encourage wasteful practices, such as the excess use of fossil fuels, overfishing or the overextraction of water for farming. Redirecting these subsidies, to stop them doing active harm and recoup the wasted cash, would free up large chunks of government money in the developed and the developing world and reduce damage to the planet. Rationality: 5/5 Ease of implementation: 2/5 Verdict: This should be a no-brainer, but decades of subsidies have created reliance among some politically powerful industries, which must be weaned off public money for the greater good Proceeds from carbon trading Selling carbon offsets is an attractive prospect: keeping existing forests is essential to maintain the planet\u2019s vital carbon sinks, and as they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere they help to soak up the emissions from harmful activities. Selling carbon credits could in theory encourage the protection of forests and other carbon sinks, while allowing some emitting activities \u2013 such as flying \u2013 to carry on. Monitoring whether carbon credits are real has become much easier in recent years, with the development of satellite imaging systems that can peep under the canopy of forests and see whether trees are being removed or roads built secretly. It is also possible to more accurately estimate how much carbon vegetation is absorbing from the atmosphere. But the carbon offset sector is beset with problems over the integrity of credits, the transparency of the systems used to estimate their value, and problems over double counting, as well as cases of Indigenous people being poorly treated. Investigations by the Guardian have uncovered widespread problems in the sector, including companies and consumers paying for credits that have been found ecologically worthless. Rationality: 2/5 Ease of implementation: 1/5 Verdict: Carbon trading is a poor substitute for the real solution of paying developing countries for the good they do for the planet by keeping their forests standing Carbon tax If the culprit in the climate crisis is carbon dioxide, why not tax it directly? A carbon tax has been frequently proposed, as a way of encouraging countries, companies and individuals to move away from fossil fuels towards clean energy. Most countries already have carbon taxes in some form, but without calling them carbon tax. These are taxes on fuels or the industries and activities that use fuels and produce goods with them. They are usually not based on the amount of emissions produced, however. Some countries have also embraced domestic emissions trading schemes, like those in the EU and China, that achieve some of the same ends. However, while a global carbon tax has been frequently proposed, it has proved too easy for detractors, such as fossil fuel companies, to attack, and has never been implemented. Rationality: 5/5 Ease of implementation: 0/5 Verdict: Economists are wedded to the idea of a carbon tax as the most economically efficient way to bring down emissions. But theoretical elegance is no match for real world special interests, and 30 years of theorising has brought the prospect of a global carbon tax no closer. It is time to abandon this utopian concept and seek more realistic solutions while there is time.",

      "bodyText": "There is an oddly entertaining, if largely unenlightening, debate available online between Richard Dawkins and Jordan Peterson, two big beasts of the performing sage circuit. They discuss the Bible, or more specifically, Peterson\u2019s latest study of its contents in his new book, We Who Wrestle With God. Dawkins, looking increasingly bemused, quietly but repeatedly asks Peterson if he really believes in the virgin birth or whether Cain and Abel actually existed, and Canada\u2019s best-known controversial psychologist responds with a series of ever more excitable exegeses of the biblical text. On one side, a dogged scientific literalism, and on the other, allegorical grappling with transcendence. The viewer feels something like a tender sympathy towards the puppyishly enthused Peterson, whose arm-waving rapture is entirely lost on the celebrated biologist. But that sympathy can\u2019t long survive the badgering prolixity of the Canadian\u2019s prose. He\u2019s been this way before, mining Judeo-Christian scripture for wisdom and social archetypes in his bestseller 12 Rules for Life and its follow-up, Beyond Order. In the first instance, the religiosity was firmly harnessed to behavioural instruction, but the tie was loosened in the second book as Peterson warmed to his messiah status among men who feel out of step with the modern world. This time he really goes the whole hog and devotes more than 500 pages to deciphering stories from the Old Testament, with added references from the gospels, Dostoevsky and The Lion King. Yes, \u201cthe Disney animated masterpiece\u201d gets a mention, as do the Brothers Grimm and various Greek myths, because while Peterson may or may not be a believing Christian (he certainly sounds like one), he is unquestionably a believing Jungian who can\u2019t pass a myth without wanting to unpack its meaning. It\u2019s the Bible, though, that is the urtext for Peterson, the founding document of life\u2019s rules, to which he returns with evermore righteous fervour. \u201cThe biblical stories illuminate the eternal path forward up the holy mountain to the heavenly city,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhile simultaneously warning of the apocalyptic dangers lurking in the deviant, the marginal, the monstrous, the sinful, the unholy, the serpentine, and the positively demonic.\u201d Read that in a Northern Irish accent and you can almost summon up the ghost of Ian Paisley. Peterson begins at the beginning with Genesis, revelling in its poetic declarations about the origins of the cosmos that do not exactly tally with the scientific evidence. But we\u2019re not in the arena of facts or empirical theses. This is textual analysis as self-consciously profound psychological insight. According to Genesis, the fruit of God\u2019s week of labours are, by his own reckoning, \u201cvery good\u201d. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d asks Peterson in a rhetorical formula that quickly becomes tiring, not least because almost every line in the Bible is open to various interpretations, before answering that it shows that God is benevolent in \u201cintent and outcome\u201d. He goes on to highlight how, as a result, humans are charged with forever reiterating the creative process \u2013 \u201cA more optimistic conception of humanity could hardly be imagined.\u201d Well, it might be argued that a conception of humanity that didn\u2019t view it as born into sin would be more optimistic, but that\u2019s the point about the Bible: you can find in it whatever you want to find, if you look hard enough. And what Peterson finds is that it provides the fundamental moral principles that enable humans to shape a good life from the chaos of free will. It\u2019s that old theological catch: you\u2019re at liberty to do whatever you want, as long as it\u2019s what God demands. Thus he concludes that the alternative to God-prescribed morality is relativism, in which good and evil are just subjective points of view. This is of course an old and endlessly rebutted argument, with atheists and anthropologists noting that morality predated and existed beyond the reach of Christianity, which has endorsed countless historical acts of evil (citing the Bible for justification), and in any case, if humans wrote the Bible, they also created its moral codes. But for Peterson, to reject the Christian cosmology of hell and heaven is to embrace a nihilism in which all is permissible and nothing meaningful. There is a growing fashion in our secular age for \u201ccultural Christianity\u201d, the appreciation, popularised by Tom Holland in his book Dominion, of the fact that post-Enlightenment liberalism rests on foundations built by an avowedly Christian society. In this understanding, we are the unconscious beneficiaries of a particular religious history, which survives in myriad unnoticed forms. But Peterson is not suggesting his readers value the concepts of tolerance and forgiveness that arguably gained greater currency as a result of the Roman empire adopting Christianity.

Some will need the flexibility offered by an easy-access account.</p> <p>Average easy-access interest rates have fallen since the start of August, when the Bank last cut interest rates, coming down from 3.15% to 3.03%.</p> <p>Competition between providers means that there are still some decent interest rates around, though Mark Hicks at Hargreaves Lansdown says Thursday\u2019s base rate cut will mean \u201csome accounts get less generous\u201d.</p> <p>And be aware that some easy access accounts do have restrictions \u2013 for example, a limit on the number of withdrawals you can make.</p> <p>Last Thursday, best-buy easy-access accounts included Atom Bank\u2019s Instant Saver Reward, which pays up to 4.85%, and Coventry Building Society\u2019s Triple Access Saver (Online) (5), paying 4.83%.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"65fdb235-bd6c-4f1a-9901-ed1c29224305\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>An Isa may be nicer</strong> </h2> <p>It was announced in the budget that the annual Isa investment limit will stay at \u00a320,000 until at least 2030. With more and more people being landed with an unwelcome tax bill for their savings, tax-free cash Isas are now very much back in vogue. Any interest you earn is all yours, while with a standard non-cash Isa savings account, you may have to pay some tax.</p> <p>With some non-Isa accounts still paying 5% interest or more, there are people who are not well-off but have decent-ish sums tucked away who are hitting their tax-free limit. This relates to the personal savings allowance, which lets basic-rate taxpayers receive \u00a31,000 of interest each financial year without paying any tax, falling to \u00a3500 for higher-rate taxpayers.</p> <p>So if you are looking to put some money into savings or switch provider, and are not using your Isa allowance at all, or only using a bit of it, that arguably doesn\u2019t make sense. Remember that you can sign up to multiple cash Isas during one tax year, provided the overall maximum allowance is not breached.</p> <p>The cash Isa market saw renewed competition last week, says Moneyfacts, with top-paying providers now including app-based company Moneybox offering a 5.17% variable on balances of \u00a3500-plus. But a lower rate of 0.75% applies if you make more than three withdrawals in a year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, fixed-rate cash Isas are paying up to 4.6%, with the highest rates typically reserved for those tying up their cash for six or 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cSavers are the ones who feel the force of cuts to interest rates and, to add insult to injury, they will see no rise to any personal tax or savings allowances in the short term \u2013 making cash Isas increasingly attractive,\u201d says Rachel Springall at Moneyfacts.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"b64bc3bb-8a86-4b10-8256-b02462b931d3\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>Have fun with premium bonds</strong></h2> <p>The bad news for Britain\u2019s army of premium bond holders is that the odds of winning a prize are about to get a bit worse. And premium bonds don\u2019t pay any interest, so they are more vulnerable to inflation than other savings.</p> <p>But one thing they have in their favour \u2013 aside from the possibility that you might (but probably won\u2019t) win big \u2013 is that any prizes you win are free from income tax and capital gains tax. That will appeal to some people worried about possible tax bills on their savings and investments.</p> <p>NS&amp;I (National Savings &amp; Investments) recently announced that the premium bond prize fund rate \u2013 the proportion of the total amount invested paid out in prizes \u2013 is being cut from 4.4% to 4.15% next month. As a result, the odds of winning with each \u00a31 bond number will reduce, from 21,000-1 to 22,000-1.</p> <p>While the total value of prizes last month was \u00a3461m, it is estimated this will fall next month to \u00a3435m. And a rejig of the prize pot means there will be fewer big-money prizes and slightly more \u00a325 ones.</p> <p>Laura Suter at investment platform AJ Bell says the prize fund rate is effectively the average rate paid out on prizes, \u201cbut in reality there is no guarantee of receiving any return, as many bond holders will never win a prize, particularly those with smaller amounts of cash saved in the bonds\u201d.</p>",

Easy access \u2013 the top deals Not everyone will be willing, or able, to put their savings out of reach for a while. Some will need the flexibility offered by an easy-access account. Average easy-access interest rates have fallen since the start of August, when the Bank last cut interest rates, coming down from 3.15% to 3.03%. Competition between providers means that there are still some decent interest rates around, though Mark Hicks at Hargreaves Lansdown says Thursday\u2019s base rate cut will mean \u201csome accounts get less generous\u201d. And be aware that some easy access accounts do have restrictions \u2013 for example, a limit on the number of withdrawals you can make. Last Thursday, best-buy easy-access accounts included Atom Bank\u2019s Instant Saver Reward, which pays up to 4.85%, and Coventry Building Society\u2019s Triple Access Saver (Online) (5), paying 4.83%. An Isa may be nicer It was announced in the budget that the annual Isa investment limit will stay at \u00a320,000 until at least 2030. With more and more people being landed with an unwelcome tax bill for their savings, tax-free cash Isas are now very much back in vogue. Any interest you earn is all yours, while with a standard non-cash Isa savings account, you may have to pay some tax. With some non-Isa accounts still paying 5% interest or more, there are people who are not well-off but have decent-ish sums tucked away who are hitting their tax-free limit. This relates to the personal savings allowance, which lets basic-rate taxpayers receive \u00a31,000 of interest each financial year without paying any tax, falling to \u00a3500 for higher-rate taxpayers. So if you are looking to put some money into savings or switch provider, and are not using your Isa allowance at all, or only using a bit of it, that arguably doesn\u2019t make sense. Remember that you can sign up to multiple cash Isas during one tax year, provided the overall maximum allowance is not breached. The cash Isa market saw renewed competition last week, says Moneyfacts, with top-paying providers now including app-based company Moneybox offering a 5.17% variable on balances of \u00a3500-plus. But a lower rate of 0.75% applies if you make more than three withdrawals in a year. Meanwhile, fixed-rate cash Isas are paying up to 4.6%, with the highest rates typically reserved for those tying up their cash for six or 12 months. \u201cSavers are the ones who feel the force of cuts to interest rates and, to add insult to injury, they will see no rise to any personal tax or savings allowances in the short term \u2013 making cash Isas increasingly attractive,\u201d says Rachel Springall at Moneyfacts. Have fun with premium bonds The bad news for Britain\u2019s army of premium bond holders is that the odds of winning a prize are about to get a bit worse. And premium bonds don\u2019t pay any interest, so they are more vulnerable to inflation than other savings. But one thing they have in their favour \u2013 aside from the possibility that you might (but probably won\u2019t) win big \u2013 is that any prizes you win are free from income tax and capital gains tax. That will appeal to some people worried about possible tax bills on their savings and investments. NS&amp;I (National Savings &amp; Investments) recently announced that the premium bond prize fund rate \u2013 the proportion of the total amount invested paid out in prizes \u2013 is being cut from 4.4% to 4.15% next month. As a result, the odds of winning with each \u00a31 bond number will reduce, from 21,000-1 to 22,000-1. While the total value of prizes last month was \u00a3461m, it is estimated this will fall next month to \u00a3435m. And a rejig of the prize pot means there will be fewer big-money prizes and slightly more \u00a325 ones. Laura Suter at investment platform AJ Bell says the prize fund rate is effectively the average rate paid out on prizes, \u201cbut in reality there is no guarantee of receiving any return, as many bond holders will never win a prize, particularly those with smaller amounts of cash saved in the bonds\u201d.",

Predictably, Wembley moved fast when I got in touch. It offered you tickets for an event of your choice plus \u201chospitality\u201d to make amends. A spokesperson said: \u201cAll accidents and incidents that take place at Wembley Stadium are reported and investigated. This matter has now been reviewed and a response sent directly to the individual concerned. We apologise for the delay.\u201d Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

      "body": "<p>Last October, Joe Biden made the most significant address of a presidency defined by war. Sitting in the Oval Office, he asked Congress to approve $106bn in emergency aid mainly to arm Ukraine and Israel in their ongoing wars. He barely attempted to explain what the US was seeking to achieve in either place, or how the fighting would come to an end. Instead, he claimed that American allies, and freedom itself, were under attack, and the US had to help because of its very identity as a nation. \u201cWe are, as my friend Madeleine Albright said, \u2018the indispensable nation\u2019,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/20/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-unites-states-response-to-hamass-terrorist-attacks-against-israel-and-russias-ongoing-brutal-war-against-ukraine/\">Biden intoned</a>. Albright had served as secretary of state in the late 1990s, at the apex of America\u2019s global dominance.</p> <p>The next day I attended a meeting of \u201coutside experts\u201d convened by the national security council. The group, in fact mostly composed of seasoned national security hands, showered praise on the administration for Biden\u2019s soaring speech. If the attenders had made up the US Congress, they would have rubber-stamped the aid that afternoon and probably added billions more. (The actual Congress balked at the request, approving it only after five months of uncertainty.)</p> <p>I thought to myself, I must be living in another country than these people. The president just asked the American public to pay $106bn \u2013 almost double the budget of the state department, and on top of about $1tn in annual national security spending \u2013 to supply multiple overseas wars whose consequences for ordinary Americans were abstract at best. Not only that: the president seemed to imply that Americans had no choice in the matter because, as all right-thinking people knew, we are the indispensable nation.</p> <p>I was so close to the priests yet so far from the priesthood.</p> <p>I felt less alone, but more uneasy, when I recalled what Jake Sullivan <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/yes-america-can-still-lead-the-world/576427/\">had written in 2019</a>, a year before Biden appointed him to be national security adviser. Back then, Sullivan had urged Democrats to retire the notion that the United States was the world\u2019s indispensable nation. \u201cBy itself, indispensability is more wearying than energizing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt speaks to fulfilling others\u2019 needs, not one\u2019s own. And it comes with no limits.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving the meeting, I realized that the process of political learning and policy adaptation that Democrats had attempted after their loss to Trump in 2016 \u2013 an effort that informed Biden\u2019s campaign and first year in office, when he denounced \u201cforever wars\u201d and withdrew US troops from Afghanistan \u2014 was over. White House officials evidently believed that they had made the necessary changes and were back in command of American politics and now could proudly defend the system and tout its most orthodox of orthodoxies.</p> <p>So when Biden and then Harris ran for president in 2024, they did so as the candidates of the system, right down to campaigning with Dick Cheney\u2019s daughter Liz. They touted her moral rectitude even as most of the country knew the Cheneys for sponsoring foreign policy disaster.</p> <p>Little wonder Trump relished the opportunity to talk about foreign policy in this election, just as in 2016. Foreign policy helped Trump to make his central pitch: that he was the outsider who would upend a failing system, dispense with self-referential elite pabulum, and resort to all manner of methods to bring change. The Biden-turned-Harris campaign, remarkably, accepted the role Trump cast for it: high-minded defender of the status quo. In her lone presidential debate, Harris did not even state an intention to try to bring the war in Ukraine to a close. She chose instead to express offense at Trump\u2019s willingness to deal with dictators. America must stand, she said, as a \u201cleader upholding international rules and norms\u201d.</p> <p>As in 2016, the Democrats permitted Trump to be the candidate who <em>at least</em> <em>recognized</em> that the wars should end sooner rather than later, who <em>at least recognized</em> that Cheney-era military interventionism was a major failure (and a bipartisan one), who <em>at least recognized</em> that the specter of what Trump constantly called \u201cWorld War III\u201d was a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/opinion/america-world-war-iii.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Y04.dbMP.djIPfur0d4ow&amp;smid=url-share\">real danger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/opinion/harris-foreign-policy-america.html?unlocked_article_code=1.T04.bTW8.-s7TO-yEaHhM&amp;smid=url-share\">must be avoided</a> through realistic thinking, not wishful platitudes, and not only by deterring adversaries through military strength but also by being unafraid to seek diplomatic accommodations that serve America\u2019s best interests.</p> <p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t foreign policy that caused American voters to give Trump the largest victory for Republicans in decades.

      "body": "<h2>Arsenal in need of ruthless edge</h2> <p>It took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn\u2019t managed since September \u2013 they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week \u2013 and last month at Bournemouth \u2013 Gabriel Martinelli\u2019s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn\u2019t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea\u2019s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard\u2019s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz\u2019s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin \u00d8degaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. <strong>Dominic Booth</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea 1-1 Arsenal</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Slot driving Reds to remarkable start</h2> <p>Only once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club\u2019s 30-year wait <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/25/tearful-jurgen-klopp-hails-incredible-moment-for-liverpool\">for the league title</a>. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">prospering from Villa corners repeatedly</a> on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season\u2019s title race. \u201cWe should have learned from last year,\u201d said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. \u201cWe\u2019re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can\u2019t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 2-0 Aston Villa</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Baleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton</h2> <p>Jo\u00e3o Pedro and Matt O\u2019Riley were the scoring heroes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/brighton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Brighton\u2019s memorable comeback</a> against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian H\u00fcrzeler having being brought in to replace Mois\u00e9s Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of \u00a3115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton\u2019s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. \u201cIf there are big clubs who want me, it\u2019s not something that worries me or gets me excited,\u201d he said before the City game. \u201cI just need to work hard and keep a cool head.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/brighton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Brighton 2-1 Manchester City</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Can United adapt to Amorim?</h2> <p>With R\u00faben Amorim incoming as Manchester United\u2019s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese\u2019s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. \u201cThat is a very good question,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can\u2019t comment on that.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/manchester-united-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester United 3-0 Leicester</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Newcastle subs pushing to start</h2> <p>The substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players\u2019 talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems \u2013 specifically gambling \u2013 for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the \u201cbust\u201d section. \u201cHarvey Barnes did what he does, he\u2019s an outstanding player,\u201d said Eddie Howe. Barnes\u2019 goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. \u201cI can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,\u201d he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/nottingham-forest-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">Nottingham Forest 1-3 Newcastle</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Ipswich\u2019s young duo catch the eye</h2> <p>Ipswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon\u2019s work for two of England\u2019s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around \u00a335m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap\u2019s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich\u2019s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/tottenham-ipswich-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham 1-2 Ipswich</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Bees need to take home sting on the road</h2> <p>Brentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the \u00a340m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli \u2013 and yet you\u2019d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/brentford-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">more home points</a> (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league\u2019s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford\u2019s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank\u2019s own admission, his team are \u201cnot perfect\u201d but they\u2019ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break. <strong>DB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/brentford-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Brentford 3-2 Bournemouth</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Time to clamp down on timeout farce</h2> <p>With Wolves in trouble and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/wolves-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">facing repeated attacks</a>, Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves\u2019s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O\u2019Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/wolves-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Wolves 2-0 Southampton</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Summerville a rare light amid gloom</h2> <p>A lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham\u2019s summer signings: \u00a3130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham\u2019s most consistent threat, his effort against the post <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/west-ham-everton-premier-league-match-report\">the closest either they or Everton came</a>. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquet\u00e1 remains available \u2013 but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/west-ham-everton-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham 0-0 Everton</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Wilson: to start or not to start?</h2> <p>What does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/crystal-palace-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">slotted in against Crystal Palace</a>, his third goal of the week from the bench. \u201cHe is doing the right things,\u201d Marco Silva, Fulham\u2019s manager, said. \u201cHe is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it\u2019s going to be easier for me, but I can\u2019t.\u201d The predicament is understandable. Fulham\u2019s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi\u2019s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. \u201cLast season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I\u2019m sure that he\u2019s going to be better this season,\u201d Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskj\u00e6r-esque substitute for a little longer. <strong>Taha Hashim</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a

      "bodyText": "Arsenal in need of ruthless edge It took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn\u2019t managed since September \u2013 they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week \u2013 and last month at Bournemouth \u2013 Gabriel Martinelli\u2019s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn\u2019t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea\u2019s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard\u2019s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz\u2019s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin \u00d8degaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. Dominic Booth Match report: Chelsea 1-1 Arsenal Slot driving Reds to remarkable start Only once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club\u2019s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season\u2019s title race. \u201cWe should have learned from last year,\u201d said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. \u201cWe\u2019re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can\u2019t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.\u201d Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 2-0 Aston Villa Baleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton Jo\u00e3o Pedro and Matt O\u2019Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton\u2019s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian H\u00fcrzeler having being brought in to replace Mois\u00e9s Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of \u00a3115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton\u2019s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. \u201cIf there are big clubs who want me, it\u2019s not something that worries me or gets me excited,\u201d he said before the City game. \u201cI just need to work hard and keep a cool head.\u201d Ed Aarons Match report: Brighton 2-1 Manchester City Can United adapt to Amorim? With R\u00faben Amorim incoming as Manchester United\u2019s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese\u2019s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. \u201cThat is a very good question,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can\u2019t comment on that.\u201d Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester United 3-0 Leicester Newcastle subs pushing to start The substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players\u2019 talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems \u2013 specifically gambling \u2013 for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the \u201cbust\u201d section. \u201cHarvey Barnes did what he does, he\u2019s an outstanding player,\u201d said Eddie Howe. Barnes\u2019 goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. \u201cI can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,\u201d he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it. John Brewin Match report: Nottingham Forest 1-3 Newcastle Ipswich\u2019s young duo catch the eye Ipswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon\u2019s work for two of England\u2019s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around \u00a335m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap\u2019s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich\u2019s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out. Nick Ames Match report: Tottenham 1-2 Ipswich Bees need to take home sting on the road Brentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the \u00a340m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli \u2013 and yet you\u2019d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league\u2019s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford\u2019s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank\u2019s own admission, his team are \u201cnot perfect\u201d but they\u2019ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break. DB Match report: Brentford 3-2 Bournemouth Time to clamp down on timeout farce With Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves\u2019s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O\u2019Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. Will Unwin Match report: Wolves 2-0 Southampton Summerville a rare light amid gloom A lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham\u2019s summer signings: \u00a3130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham\u2019s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquet\u00e1 remains available \u2013 but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. Jonathan Wilson Match report: West Ham 0-0 Everton Wilson: to start or not to start? What does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. \u201cHe is doing the right things,\u201d Marco Silva, Fulham\u2019s manager, said. \u201cHe is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it\u2019s going to be easier for me, but I can\u2019t.\u201d The predicament is understandable. Fulham\u2019s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi\u2019s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. \u201cLast season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I\u2019m sure that he\u2019s going to be better this season,\u201d Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskj\u00e6r-esque substitute for a little longer.

But that is controversial. Private sector cash comes with strings attached and can drive countries further into debt. It is also harder to access for the poorest countries that need it most, particularly in order to help them cope with the impacts of extreme weather, an activity that few private sector companies have been prepared to fund to date.</p> <p>In a statement that some parties will find controversial, Babayev wrote: \u201cWith competing priorities, there simply isn\u2019t enough money in the world to fund developing countries\u2019 transition to clean energy solely through grants or concessional financing \u2013 let alone cover adaptation and loss and damage.\u201d</p> <p>Many civil society groups are wary of an expanded role for the private sector. Mariana Paoli, the global advocacy lead at Christian Aid, said: \u201cGovernment finance is so much better than private finance when it comes to tackling climate change. Governments are the only ones able to provide finance in the form of grants, which are the only way to address the growing needs of developing countries to address the climate crisis. Private finance is guided by profits and is almost always loans, therefore worsening the debt crisis that many developing countries are facing.\u201d</p> <p>She argued that it should not be counted towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/21/bonn-climate-conference-key-takeaways\">sums developing countries are demanding</a>, known as the \u201cnew collective quantified goal\u201d (NCQG) in UN jargon. \u201cPrivate companies are not accountable to the Paris agreement. Any climate change-related investment they make is welcome but it\u2019s separate from what should be discussed at the talks in Baku,\u201d she said.</p> <p>However, many developing countries accept that private finance must play a role. A spokesperson for the Alliance of Small Island States said: \u201cAt the core of the NCQG is developed countries fulfilling their commitments under the Paris agreement. A key focus is the provision of public finance from developed to developing countries. An additional pillar is the mobilisation of substantive private financing, by specific public interventions of developed countries. The onus must be on the public efforts to advance enhanced finance.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, told the opening session of the conference on Monday that inflation would result from a continued reliance on fossil fuels and that tackling the climate crisis would also help to tackle economic problems. </p> <p>\u201cIf at least two-thirds of the world\u2019s nations cannot afford to cut emissions quickly, then every nation pays a brutal price. If nations can\u2019t build resilience into supply chains, the entire global economy will be brought to its knees. No country is immune,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In a veiled but pointed reference to the new presidency in the US, he warned that all countries must play a role. \u201cLet\u2019s dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity. An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest,\u201d he said.</p>",

In a statement that some parties will find controversial, Babayev wrote: \u201cWith competing priorities, there simply isn\u2019t enough money in the world to fund developing countries\u2019 transition to clean energy solely through grants or concessional financing \u2013 let alone cover adaptation and loss and damage.\u201d Many civil society groups are wary of an expanded role for the private sector. Mariana Paoli, the global advocacy lead at Christian Aid, said: \u201cGovernment finance is so much better than private finance when it comes to tackling climate change. Governments are the only ones able to provide finance in the form of grants, which are the only way to address the growing needs of developing countries to address the climate crisis. Private finance is guided by profits and is almost always loans, therefore worsening the debt crisis that many developing countries are facing.\u201d She argued that it should not be counted towards the sums developing countries are demanding, known as the \u201cnew collective quantified goal\u201d (NCQG) in UN jargon. \u201cPrivate companies are not accountable to the Paris agreement. Any climate change-related investment they make is welcome but it\u2019s separate from what should be discussed at the talks in Baku,\u201d she said. However, many developing countries accept that private finance must play a role. A spokesperson for the Alliance of Small Island States said: \u201cAt the core of the NCQG is developed countries fulfilling their commitments under the Paris agreement. A key focus is the provision of public finance from developed to developing countries. An additional pillar is the mobilisation of substantive private financing, by specific public interventions of developed countries. The onus must be on the public efforts to advance enhanced finance.\u201d Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, told the opening session of the conference on Monday that inflation would result from a continued reliance on fossil fuels and that tackling the climate crisis would also help to tackle economic problems. \u201cIf at least two-thirds of the world\u2019s nations cannot afford to cut emissions quickly, then every nation pays a brutal price. If nations can\u2019t build resilience into supply chains, the entire global economy will be brought to its knees. No country is immune,\u201d he said. In a veiled but pointed reference to the new presidency in the US, he warned that all countries must play a role. \u201cLet\u2019s dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity. An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest,\u201d he said.",

Kyler Murray was leveled by Jets linebacker Quincy Williams, losing his helmet in the process. The old Murray might have been annoyed with his offensive line. But this year\u2019s Murray is a cold-blooded beast. This year\u2019s Murray stood up, smiled, and went on to throw a dime to Marvin Harrison Jr for a touchdown.</p>    <p>Murray demolished the Jets defense in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671678\">an easy 31-6 win</a>. His new-found maturity was evident, especially when it came to his decision-making and accuracy. Murray only had two incompletions on the day and at one point threw 17 straight completions, a Cardinals record. He was adept on the ground, punching in two of Arizona\u2019s touchdowns with his legs to go through another through the air. Most importantly, he genuinely looks like he\u2019s having fun.</p> <h2><strong>Video of the week</strong></h2> <p>Pittsburgh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671641\">28-27 win</a> over the Washington Commanders was a nailbiter. But it was the first and last touchdowns that illustrated how spectacular the Steelers\u2019 offense is becoming under Russell Wilson. George Pickens put up the first points of the game with a catch he was going to make come hell or high water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1855676723620397352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">GEORGE PICKENS TD OH MY <br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PITvsWAS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PITvsWAS</a> on CBS/Paramount+<br>\ud83d\udcf1: <a href=\"https://t.co/waVpO909ge\">https://t.co/waVpO909ge</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rFXdORC9VE\">pic.twitter.com/rFXdORC9VE</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1855676723620397352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>The game-sealing catch came from brand new acquisition Mike Williams on a beautiful floated pass from Wilson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/steelers/status/1855718487869518064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FIRST TD AS A STEELER!!!!!!!!<br><br>\ud83d\udcf2 Stream on NFL+: <a href=\"https://t.co/COxKRnr6Mc\">https://t.co/COxKRnr6Mc</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qaxvtHNvcM\">pic.twitter.com/qaxvtHNvcM</a></p>&mdash; Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steelers/status/1855718487869518064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>There were some defensive holes and an embarrassing missed attempt at a fake punt, but there\u2019s a lot to like in Pittsburgh. Starting with Wilson, who is 3-0 as the Steelers\u2019 starter. Now at 7-2 and rolling, the Steelers have passed the \u201cWill Mike Tomlin keep his consecutive streak of non-losing seasons alive?\u201d stage. The goals are much loftier now.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>23</strong>. That\u2019s the number of consecutive drives without a touchdown for the Chicago Bears. The hope that defined the Bears\u2019 offseason and early season has evaporated. Chicago fans were booing from start to finish as the pulseless Bears offense continued its freefall in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671873\">a 19-3 loss to the New England Patriots</a>. No 1 overall pick Caleb Williams once again held on to the ball way too long. Has this kid ever heard of a checkdown? Are the coaches even trying to draw up some high-percentage plays? In any event, the combination of Williams dancing around, and a feeble offensive line resulted in nine sacks. Somehow Williams escaped this one unscathed physically. His mental state may be a different story. The Bears have fallen to 4-5 and a coaching change seems inevitable.</p>    <h2><strong>Elsewhere around the league</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 There was a nice moment in the 49ers-Bucs game when San Francisco rookie wideout Ricky Pearsall caught his first NFL touchdown just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/02/san-francisco-49er-ricky-pearsall-shooting\">two months after being shot in the chest</a>. Speaking of comebacks, running back extraordinaire Christian McCaffrey made his season debut after dealing with achilles tendinitis. Last season\u2019s offensive player of the year picked up where he left off, accounting for 107 total yards on Sunday. He was especially productive from the slot, and it was immediately clear that his presence transforms the 49ers offense.</p>    <p>\u2022 We briefly mentioned the Lions game above, but it\u2019s hard to do it justice. Jared Goff threw five interceptions, Detroit were 23-7 down at halftime and the Lions <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671787\">still won 26-23</a> to move to 8-1 for the season. They\u2019re not only the best team in the NFL, they\u2019re also the most exciting to watch.</p> <p>\u2022 Jerry Jones told reporters that he will not fire Mike McCarthy during this season. His rationale is regretting the times he\u2019s made a coaching move midseason. The Dallas Cowboys fell to 3-6 after being <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671676\">smoked by the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday</a>. Cooper Rush, starting for an injured Dak Prescott, threw for only 45 yards, and the team lost four fumbles. Jones appears content to torture his fanbase for the rest of the season.</p> <p>\u2022 What a debut for interim head coach Darren Rizzi, who led the New Orleans Saints to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671733\">a 20-17 upset of the Atlanta Falcons</a>. It was a surprising turn of events for Rizzi, who later told the media that he had expected a crappy day.

Tracy deserves little blame, though, as he again was a bright spot for the Giants, rushing for 103 yards, including a sensational 32-yard touchdown and a 5.7 yard per carry average.

Murray demolished the Jets defense in an easy 31-6 win. His new-found maturity was evident, especially when it came to his decision-making and accuracy. Murray only had two incompletions on the day and at one point threw 17 straight completions, a Cardinals record. He was adept on the ground, punching in two of Arizona\u2019s touchdowns with his legs to go through another through the air. Most importantly, he genuinely looks like he\u2019s having fun. Video of the week Pittsburgh\u2019s 28-27 win over the Washington Commanders was a nailbiter. But it was the first and last touchdowns that illustrated how spectacular the Steelers\u2019 offense is becoming under Russell Wilson. George Pickens put up the first points of the game with a catch he was going to make come hell or high water. The game-sealing catch came from brand new acquisition Mike Williams on a beautiful floated pass from Wilson. There were some defensive holes and an embarrassing missed attempt at a fake punt, but there\u2019s a lot to like in Pittsburgh. Starting with Wilson, who is 3-0 as the Steelers\u2019 starter. Now at 7-2 and rolling, the Steelers have passed the \u201cWill Mike Tomlin keep his consecutive streak of non-losing seasons alive?\u201d stage. The goals are much loftier now. Stat of the week 23. That\u2019s the number of consecutive drives without a touchdown for the Chicago Bears. The hope that defined the Bears\u2019 offseason and early season has evaporated. Chicago fans were booing from start to finish as the pulseless Bears offense continued its freefall in a 19-3 loss to the New England Patriots. No 1 overall pick Caleb Williams once again held on to the ball way too long. Has this kid ever heard of a checkdown? Are the coaches even trying to draw up some high-percentage plays? In any event, the combination of Williams dancing around, and a feeble offensive line resulted in nine sacks. Somehow Williams escaped this one unscathed physically. His mental state may be a different story. The Bears have fallen to 4-5 and a coaching change seems inevitable. Elsewhere around the league \u2022 There was a nice moment in the 49ers-Bucs game when San Francisco rookie wideout Ricky Pearsall caught his first NFL touchdown just two months after being shot in the chest. Speaking of comebacks, running back extraordinaire Christian McCaffrey made his season debut after dealing with achilles tendinitis. Last season\u2019s offensive player of the year picked up where he left off, accounting for 107 total yards on Sunday. He was especially productive from the slot, and it was immediately clear that his presence transforms the 49ers offense. \u2022 We briefly mentioned the Lions game above, but it\u2019s hard to do it justice. Jared Goff threw five interceptions, Detroit were 23-7 down at halftime and the Lions still won 26-23 to move to 8-1 for the season. They\u2019re not only the best team in the NFL, they\u2019re also the most exciting to watch. \u2022 Jerry Jones told reporters that he will not fire Mike McCarthy during this season. His rationale is regretting the times he\u2019s made a coaching move midseason. The Dallas Cowboys fell to 3-6 after being smoked by the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. Cooper Rush, starting for an injured Dak Prescott, threw for only 45 yards, and the team lost four fumbles. Jones appears content to torture his fanbase for the rest of the season. \u2022 What a debut for interim head coach Darren Rizzi, who led the New Orleans Saints to a 20-17 upset of the Atlanta Falcons. It was a surprising turn of events for Rizzi, who later told the media that he had expected a crappy day. Literally. \u2022 Poor Tyrone Tracy Jr. The rookie appeared inconsolable on the New York Giants sideline after fumbling the first snap of overtime to set up an easy Carolina Panthers game-winning field goal. Tracy deserves little blame, though, as he again was a bright spot for the Giants, rushing for 103 yards, including a sensational 32-yard touchdown and a 5.7 yard per carry average. In fact, Giants fans ought to be marveling over Tracy\u2019s football IQ as the 20-17 loss puts the 2-8 Giants in the picture to secure the No 1 pick in the 2025 draft. Miami\u2019s stud QB Cam Ward must look especially attractive to Big Blue after Daniel Jones turned in another abysmal performance, underthrowing his targets throughout and tossing two picks. \u2022 It appears more International Games are on the docket. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told NFL Network\u2019s Colleen Wolfe that the league is targeting eight regular games out of the country including a return to Brazil and Mexico, as well as adding an Ireland match. I\u2019m sure the players will be thrilled.",

      "body": "<p>Artificial boulders fill the studio of Vector architects in Beijing, like the result of a dramatic landslide, their craggy polystyrene surfaces rendered with chalky grey plaster. One rock has a striking house sprouting from its summit, a group of intersecting cubic volumes crowned with <a href=\"https://www.vectorarchitects.com/en/projects/30\">a curving barrel-vaulted roof</a>. Another has a cluster of industrial looking buildings nestled at its base, connected by an intricate colonnade. A third features a series of momentous terraces and rectangular pits carved into a gulley, with the air of an ancient burial site.<br><br>These are the enigmatic visions of Dong Gong, an architect who has risen to prominence in China as a conjuror of mesmerising spaces, crafting libraries, schools and museums that feel grown out of, or hewn into, their sites, built with extraordinary attention to detail. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/article/2024/may/24/aranya-chinas-seaside-haven-lying-flat-generation\">seashore library in Aranya</a> feels like a miniature jewel-like version of <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/96824/ad-classics-convent-of-la-tourette-le-corbuiser\">Le Corbusier\u2019s La Tourette monastery</a>, marooned on the beach, where daylight pierces through angled shafts and plays across the sculpted concrete walls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Architecture needs to reclaim its raison d\u2019\u00eatre, to soothe our bodies and souls</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His <a href=\"https://www.vectorarchitects.com/en/projects/64\">courtyard elementary school in Shenzhen</a> is a protected oasis, its classrooms and running track wrapping a grove of mature banyan trees in the middle of the bustling high-rise metropolis, a world away from the usual state-mandated educational barracks. While Chinese cities continue to build at relentless speed, moving mountains and razing neighbourhoods overnight, Dong\u2019s approach is to slow down, and draw on the value of what is already there.<br><br>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/12/chinas-glut-of-idle-property-causes-headache-for-the-government\">China\u2019s current economic slowdown</a> has actually been helpful,\u201d he says, sitting in his office in Beijing, where a framed drawing of La Tourette leans against the wall. \u201cIt means we can slow down too, and rediscover a kind of thoughtfulness.\u201d While big commercial offices that worked for the country\u2019s major real estate developers are struggling, the likes of Vector architects see the current moment as a chance to take stock, recalibrate, and encourage their clients to approach things more carefully. Where demolition was once the default, the economic lull has given more currency to the option of retaining and reusing existing structures \u2013 a boon for both heritage and the environment.</p>    <p>Born in 1972, Dong trained at Tsinghua University in Beijing and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and worked in the offices of Richard Meier and Steven Holl in New York. Returning to China to found his practice in 2008, he is part of a generation of Chinese architects, now mostly in their 50s, who, having worked abroad, came back with a different perspective on the country\u2019s recent decades of rapid urbanisation. In contrast to the frenetic pace and vast size of city-building before them, they prefer to work at a smaller scale, exploring handmade materials and reviving vernacular techniques.<br><br>This generation came to maturity at an opportune moment, just as China\u2019s central government shifted its primary focus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/24/chinas-rural-revolution-architects-rescuing-villages-oblivion-tofu-rice-wine-lotus-tea\">away from high-rise mega-development towards rural revitalisation</a>, with an emphasis on reinvigorating depopulated areas. This coincided with a widespread longing among burnt-out young urbanites for a more primitive, rustic life \u2013 a rural nostalgia, or <em>jizhu xiangchou</em>, for a simpler, slower, more meditative world, away from the stress of the city. And it spawned a strong appetite for a kind of architecture stripped back to its raw elements, with a renewed focus on soothing all the senses. \u201cArchitecture needs to reclaim its raison d\u2019etre,\u201d says Dong, \u201cto soothe our body and soul.\u201d His buildings, which put an emphasis on atmosphere, playing with light and shadow, and the haptic quality of materials, have clearly struck a chord.</p>    <p>His practice\u2019s 15 years of soul-soothing, spirit-uplifting work has now been brought together in <a href=\"https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847835744/\">Vector Architects: Dong Gong and the Art of Building</a>, a hefty English-language monograph, featuring about 20 projects built across the country. One of the most famous, which<a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5342\"> featured in a recent exhibition at MoMA in New York</a>, is a hotel in Yangshuo, a paradisiacal place in the lush southern province of Guangxi. At a time when postwar industrial relics were seen as blights on the landscape to be swept away, Vector\u2019s client proposed retaining a derelict 1960s sugarcane mill, and transforming it into an atmospheric place to stay.</p> <p>The architects added a series of pitch-roofed wings on either side of the mill, <a href=\"https://www.vectorarchitects.com/en/projects/32\">fronted with perforated concrete blocks and connected by delicate bamboo canopies</a>. It is impossibly photogenic, an instant hit on Chinese social media, its swimming pool framed by a colonnade of columns like a classical ruin, with jagged limestone peaks rising in the background. Like Vector\u2019s fairytale chapel and library in Aranya, it became <em>wanghong</em> (internet-famous) overnight. But the projects aren\u2019t just made to look good in photos, like so much Instagram-friendly fodder. They have an impeccable quality of finish when experienced in person \u2013 an exacting result that is due to intense on-site supervision. For the Yangshuo hotel, the architects couldn\u2019t find a manufacturer who could produce the quality of the concrete blocks they wanted, so they made them on-site themselves. It was also a cost-efficient option that saved on transportation and allowed for adaptation and customisation on site.<br><br>\u201cIn China, the builders don\u2019t necessarily look at the drawings,\u201d says Dong. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant battle, every day.\u201d His solution is to send a site architect to supervise every stage of every project, from the manufacture of building materials, to the prototyping and calibration of joints and details, overseeing every stage of the construction process. They can sometimes be stationed on site for three years, far from home. \u201cThey become like the mafia guy,\u201d he jokes, \u201creporting everything back here to the office, so we can keep on top of every detail.\u201d</p> <p>The scrupulous approach pays off. From the cast in-situ concrete to the timber joinery, Vector\u2019s buildings are of a quality rarely seen elsewhere in the country, more akin to the level of finish you might find in Switzerland or Japan. Western architects working in China often bemoan how their precious designs are bodged by sloppy builders, but Dong\u2019s work shows that quality is possible, if you take the trouble to fight for it.<br><br>It\u2019s also a reflection of the practice\u2019s hands-on design process. The Beijing studio is a <em>wunderkammer</em> of huge working models so they can be opened up and seen from the inside, and qualities of light and shadow can be tested. A model of the seashore library features handles that can be wound to slide the building apart, revealing its complex cross-section. Other projects, with their concrete waffle ceilings and brutalist bulk, look like they could be from another era, summoning strains not only of Le Corbusier, but the forms of Alvar Aalto, Louis Khan, or the muscular brutalism of Paul Rudolph, echoing an era before computers took over the manual craft of making spaces.</p>    <p><br>There\u2019s a touch of surrealism, too, lightening what could otherwise feel overly dour. Dong prises another model apart to reveal a stack of three curious cylindrical spaces inside a tower-like structure. This is the <a href=\"https://www.vectorarchitects.com/en/projects/65\">Chapel of Music</a>, completed last year, also in Aranya, one of Vector\u2019s most theatrical creations yet. Ascending a long curving ramp, visitors find themselves inside a tall concrete chamber, ringed by a circular reclining bench. The domed ceiling is pieced by a halo of nine holes, about 20cm in diameter, marking the ends of long copper tubes, that poke up into the floor above, where further tiered seating surrounds a small performance space.</p> <p>The room is capped by a large circular skylight, which can be raised so the sound of music can not only filter down to the listening chamber below, but also spill on to the public plaza outside. \u201cIt\u2019s like music from heaven,\u201d says Dong, with a gnomic smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d<br><br>The studio\u2019s walls are covered with dreamy computer renderings of dramatic Piranesian spaces, depicting tiny figures at the base of deep concrete wells, at the summit of <a href=\"https://www.vectorarchitects.com/en/projects/75\">mountain-top concrete lookouts</a>, or traversing vertiginous concrete stairs \u2013 vignettes for various museums, hotels and performance spaces in the making. They\u2019re seductive images, but it\u2019s an awful lot of concrete.<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re now trying to use less,\u201d Dong says, \u201cbut it\u2019s still the cheapest option here.

      "bodyText": "Artificial boulders fill the studio of Vector architects in Beijing, like the result of a dramatic landslide, their craggy polystyrene surfaces rendered with chalky grey plaster. One rock has a striking house sprouting from its summit, a group of intersecting cubic volumes crowned with a curving barrel-vaulted roof. Another has a cluster of industrial looking buildings nestled at its base, connected by an intricate colonnade. A third features a series of momentous terraces and rectangular pits carved into a gulley, with the air of an ancient burial site. These are the enigmatic visions of Dong Gong, an architect who has risen to prominence in China as a conjuror of mesmerising spaces, crafting libraries, schools and museums that feel grown out of, or hewn into, their sites, built with extraordinary attention to detail. His seashore library in Aranya feels like a miniature jewel-like version of Le Corbusier\u2019s La Tourette monastery, marooned on the beach, where daylight pierces through angled shafts and plays across the sculpted concrete walls. His courtyard elementary school in Shenzhen is a protected oasis, its classrooms and running track wrapping a grove of mature banyan trees in the middle of the bustling high-rise metropolis, a world away from the usual state-mandated educational barracks. While Chinese cities continue to build at relentless speed, moving mountains and razing neighbourhoods overnight, Dong\u2019s approach is to slow down, and draw on the value of what is already there. \u201cChina\u2019s current economic slowdown has actually been helpful,\u201d he says, sitting in his office in Beijing, where a framed drawing of La Tourette leans against the wall. \u201cIt means we can slow down too, and rediscover a kind of thoughtfulness.\u201d While big commercial offices that worked for the country\u2019s major real estate developers are struggling, the likes of Vector architects see the current moment as a chance to take stock, recalibrate, and encourage their clients to approach things more carefully. Where demolition was once the default, the economic lull has given more currency to the option of retaining and reusing existing structures \u2013 a boon for both heritage and the environment. Born in 1972, Dong trained at Tsinghua University in Beijing and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and worked in the offices of Richard Meier and Steven Holl in New York. Returning to China to found his practice in 2008, he is part of a generation of Chinese architects, now mostly in their 50s, who, having worked abroad, came back with a different perspective on the country\u2019s recent decades of rapid urbanisation. In contrast to the frenetic pace and vast size of city-building before them, they prefer to work at a smaller scale, exploring handmade materials and reviving vernacular techniques. This generation came to maturity at an opportune moment, just as China\u2019s central government shifted its primary focus away from high-rise mega-development towards rural revitalisation, with an emphasis on reinvigorating depopulated areas. This coincided with a widespread longing among burnt-out young urbanites for a more primitive, rustic life \u2013 a rural nostalgia, or jizhu xiangchou, for a simpler, slower, more meditative world, away from the stress of the city. And it spawned a strong appetite for a kind of architecture stripped back to its raw elements, with a renewed focus on soothing all the senses. \u201cArchitecture needs to reclaim its raison d\u2019etre,\u201d says Dong, \u201cto soothe our body and soul.\u201d His buildings, which put an emphasis on atmosphere, playing with light and shadow, and the haptic quality of materials, have clearly struck a chord. His practice\u2019s 15 years of soul-soothing, spirit-uplifting work has now been brought together in Vector Architects: Dong Gong and the Art of Building, a hefty English-language monograph, featuring about 20 projects built across the country. One of the most famous, which featured in a recent exhibition at MoMA in New York, is a hotel in Yangshuo, a paradisiacal place in the lush southern province of Guangxi. At a time when postwar industrial relics were seen as blights on the landscape to be swept away, Vector\u2019s client proposed retaining a derelict 1960s sugarcane mill, and transforming it into an atmospheric place to stay. The architects added a series of pitch-roofed wings on either side of the mill, fronted with perforated concrete blocks and connected by delicate bamboo canopies. It is impossibly photogenic, an instant hit on Chinese social media, its swimming pool framed by a colonnade of columns like a classical ruin, with jagged limestone peaks rising in the background. Like Vector\u2019s fairytale chapel and library in Aranya, it became wanghong (internet-famous) overnight. But the projects aren\u2019t just made to look good in photos, like so much Instagram-friendly fodder. They have an impeccable quality of finish when experienced in person \u2013 an exacting result that is due to intense on-site supervision. For the Yangshuo hotel, the architects couldn\u2019t find a manufacturer who could produce the quality of the concrete blocks they wanted, so they made them on-site themselves. It was also a cost-efficient option that saved on transportation and allowed for adaptation and customisation on site. \u201cIn China, the builders don\u2019t necessarily look at the drawings,\u201d says Dong. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant battle, every day.\u201d His solution is to send a site architect to supervise every stage of every project, from the manufacture of building materials, to the prototyping and calibration of joints and details, overseeing every stage of the construction process. They can sometimes be stationed on site for three years, far from home. \u201cThey become like the mafia guy,\u201d he jokes, \u201creporting everything back here to the office, so we can keep on top of every detail.\u201d The scrupulous approach pays off. From the cast in-situ concrete to the timber joinery, Vector\u2019s buildings are of a quality rarely seen elsewhere in the country, more akin to the level of finish you might find in Switzerland or Japan. Western architects working in China often bemoan how their precious designs are bodged by sloppy builders, but Dong\u2019s work shows that quality is possible, if you take the trouble to fight for it. It\u2019s also a reflection of the practice\u2019s hands-on design process. The Beijing studio is a wunderkammer of huge working models so they can be opened up and seen from the inside, and qualities of light and shadow can be tested. A model of the seashore library features handles that can be wound to slide the building apart, revealing its complex cross-section. Other projects, with their concrete waffle ceilings and brutalist bulk, look like they could be from another era, summoning strains not only of Le Corbusier, but the forms of Alvar Aalto, Louis Khan, or the muscular brutalism of Paul Rudolph, echoing an era before computers took over the manual craft of making spaces. There\u2019s a touch of surrealism, too, lightening what could otherwise feel overly dour. Dong prises another model apart to reveal a stack of three curious cylindrical spaces inside a tower-like structure. This is the Chapel of Music, completed last year, also in Aranya, one of Vector\u2019s most theatrical creations yet. Ascending a long curving ramp, visitors find themselves inside a tall concrete chamber, ringed by a circular reclining bench. The domed ceiling is pieced by a halo of nine holes, about 20cm in diameter, marking the ends of long copper tubes, that poke up into the floor above, where further tiered seating surrounds a small performance space. The room is capped by a large circular skylight, which can be raised so the sound of music can not only filter down to the listening chamber below, but also spill on to the public plaza outside. \u201cIt\u2019s like music from heaven,\u201d says Dong, with a gnomic smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d The studio\u2019s walls are covered with dreamy computer renderings of dramatic Piranesian spaces, depicting tiny figures at the base of deep concrete wells, at the summit of mountain-top concrete lookouts, or traversing vertiginous concrete stairs \u2013 vignettes for various museums, hotels and performance spaces in the making. They\u2019re seductive images, but it\u2019s an awful lot of concrete. \u201cWe\u2019re now trying to use less,\u201d Dong says, \u201cbut it\u2019s still the cheapest option here. The structural code for timber is not as developed here yet, but it\u2019s on the way. China now has clear carbon targets, so I think it will happen.\u201d As the country ramps up efforts to decarbonise its power supply \u2013 boasting two-thirds of the world\u2019s wind and solar projects under construction \u2013 tackling the embodied carbon of its buildings will be the next big challenge. Its up to Dong and his agenda-setting peers to show that just as atmospheric, seductive, soulful spaces can be made without resorting to untold tonnes of board-marked concrete. \u2022 Vector Architects: Dong Gong and the Art of Building is published by Rizzoli. https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847835744/",

She also claimed the company\u2019s data showed western Sydney drivers would be worse off, because more commuted locally as opposed to those who drive eastwards to the CBD.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T22:18:25.314Z\">at 10.18pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-673128a68f08a089b90bc658\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peter-hannam\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T21:48:04.327Z\">9.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Burst of renewable energy commitments in September quarter</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>We\u2019re heard various warnings about the relative lack of new renewable energy investments in the past year or so \u2013 at least if we\u2019re to manage the exit of aging coal-fired power plants and meet our clean energy targets.</p> \n  <p>The September quarter, it turns out, was one of the most promising quarters for some time, the <strong>Clean Energy Council</strong> reports today.</p> \n  <p>In the July-September months, more than 1,400 megawatts of new wind and solar farms worth $3.3bn reached financial sign-off, the best since the end of 2022. CEC chief <strong>Kane Thornton</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we sustain the level of investment for new wind and solar power plants which we have seen in the third quarter of this year, we can get back on track to achieving Australia\u2019s target of 82% renewable energy generation by 2030.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Most of the new projects were either onshore wind (offshore not actually happening \u2013 yet) or big batteries. Rooftop solar has tended to make solar farms a bit less attractive.</p> \n  <p>According to the council, there are 89 renewable electricity generation projects that have either reached financial commitment or are under construction, representing 13.9 gigawatts of capacity in the pipeline. There are also 49 storage projects working their way forward from financial commitment, equivalent to 9.7GW/ 24.3GW-hours in capacity/energy output.</p> \n  <p>While that sounds good, it\u2019s notable that not a lot of capacity has lately come online. The council notes the September quarter saw just three renewable electricity generation projects, totalling 168MW of new capacity, were actually commissioned in Q3 2024.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll get the summer readiness report soon from the Australian Energy Market Operator, and it won\u2019t be surprising to hear we may face a few tight spots particularly if there are extended heatwaves and coal-fired plants drop out for unscheduled reasons.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T21:55:13.094Z\">at 9.55pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-673127148f088b29b8c43473\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T21:41:28.125Z\">9.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Raygun says she is \u2018not retiring\u2019 from breaking, despite reports</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Breaker <strong>Rachael Gunn</strong>, better known as Raygun, has said she is not retiring from breaking despite reports suggesting she would.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/07/raygun-retires-rachael-gunn-competitive-breaking-australian-olympic-breakdancer\">Last week</a> she told 2DayFm she was \u201cgoing to keep competing, for sure, but that seems a really difficult thing for me to do now, to approach a battle\u201d, due to the scrutiny she received after her performance at the Paris Olympics.</p> \n  <p>Speaking on the Today Show this morning, Gunn said she never used the word retire and that her comments had been misinterpreted:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I was talking on 2DayFm about how I\u2019m not going to do certain competitions anymore \u2013 which didn\u2019t seem like such a big deal because breaking is not going to be in the Olympics anyway.

Opposition leader to focus on cost of living and migration</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The opposition leader, <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, has flagged his election campaign will focus on cost of living and migration, linking the latter to the release of 224 unlawful non-citizens who had been in indefinite detention.</p> \n  <p>In a press conference yesterday, Dutton was asked if the Coalition would mirror <strong>Donald Trump</strong>\u2019s successful election campaign in the US.</p> \n  <p>Dutton responded the opposition would run its \u201cown campaign\u201d but flagged some of the issues in the US, such as \u201cmigration\u201d, were a focus in Australia too. </p> \n  <p>The opposition leader turned to the release of hundreds of immigration detainees, known as the NZYQ cohort, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/08/australia-high-court-indefinite-detention-ruling-government\">a high court decision in November 2023</a> that indefinite detention is unlawful. Dutton inaccurately claimed the Albanese government had a choice in their release, and described the entire cohort as \u201chardened criminals\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Certainly cost of living, certainly interest rates, certainly migration because the government has released over 200 hardened criminals from immigration detention <strong>when they didn\u2019t need to do so .</strong>.. so our country is less safe as a result of the decisions that the Albanese government\u2019s made and we are poorer as a community as well.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following today. Here\u2019s a wrap of the biggest stories: One person is dead and a child has been taken to hospital with serious injuries after a a truck crashed into a kindergarten in Riddells Creek, about 45km north-west of Melbourne. A man has died after being crushed beneath a turbine blade while working at a regional Victorian windfarm, with a union claiming safety concerns at the site were raised at a meeting two weeks ago. The opposition transport spokesperson Bridget McKenzie has defended herself after revelations she failed to declare 16 flight upgrades over the past nine years, saying her history of criticising the lack of competition in Australian aviation is important to note, adding she thought: \u201cAnthony Albanese, has been influenced by his personal and financial relationship with Qantas.\u201d At the Geelong Botanic Gardens, a rare corpse plant began blooming this afternoon. The corpse flower only blooms once every 10 years or so. Private Richard Norden, a 19-year-old Australian soldier who rescued his wounded commander while seriously injured and under enemy gunfire in the Vietnam war, has been posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Rachael Gunn, better known as Raygun, has said she is not retiring from breaking despite reports suggesting she would. We\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow. Climate activists glued to Melbourne sculpture unfurl banner saying \u2018You don\u2019t need to glue yourself to an artwork\u2019 Activists glued themselves to a sculpture at the entrance of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and unfurled a banner saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to glue yourself to an artwork to drive urgent climate action\u201d. A spokesperson for the climate activist group Rouser said two of its members were doing what they were telling other people they didn\u2019t have to do, to show the public they could drive urgent climate action without taking extreme, disruptive measures. \u201cActivists are only glueing on to artworks, blockading traffic and disrupting public events because so few everyday people are driving urgent action,\u201d Rouser\u2019s creative director Rob Beamish said. \u201cBut if enough people have regular conversations, there\u2019s hope for the cultural change that will lead to real climate action.\u201d The David Shrigley bronze, called Really Good, was not damaged during the protest, which lasted for about 90 minutes before police successfully unglued the protesters. NSW police win pay rises of up to 40% in biggest wage increase in 30 years Police in New South Wales are set to be the best paid in the nation, thanks to a \u201cgenerational\u201d wage increase of up to 40% under a new pay deal. The deal comes amid threats of industrial action from nurses and transport workers battling the state government for better pay offers. More than 10,000 constables, senior constables and sergeants will receive increases of at least 25% before shift allowances while pay scales have been simplified. It means the salary for a level 3 senior constable will jump from $107,600 to $146,600 by mid-2027. The four-year deal, which includes backpay to 1 July, is in line with what the union had demanded and officials have asked members to accept the government\u2019s offer. \u201cWe set the bar high and for good reason,\u201d the Police Association of NSW president, Kevin Morton, told members on Monday. \u201cFor the vast majority of members, this is a generational change to your award. \u201cThis offer will see the highest pay increases achieved in the last 30 years for NSW Police [and] outstrips what we have seen accepted by other public-sector agencies.\u201d Full story here: \u2018It stinks\u2019: reports from the once-in-a-decade flowering of Geelong\u2019s corpse plant Our reporter Henry Belot has been suffering for his craft today, covering the once-in-a-decade flowering of the \u201ccorpse plant\u201d. \u201cIt stinks,\u201d is his professional appraisal of the situation. Despite this, people have turned out in huge numbers to witness the botanical event. Senators and experts grill department officials on mentions of populist parties in mis- and disinformation bill Throughout the course of the hearing on the misinformation and disinformation bill today, opposition and crossbench senators as well as legal experts have been concerned about a part of the explanatory memorandum for the bill that mentions examples of populist parties in other parts of the world that have had success politically as a result of disinformation allegedly spread by those parties. The document says Australia hasn\u2019t experienced this yet but \u201cexperience from around the world suggests that content of this nature, if disseminated at scale, can influence public opinion and sway voter behaviour to such an extent that the outcome of an electoral process can no longer be said to represent the free will of the electorate\u201d. LNP senator Matt Canavan said it was one of the \u201cmost remarkable paragraphs\u201d he\u2019d ever read in a bill or memorandum, and questioned the communications department about its inclusion and what the meaning of it was. The department\u2019s deputy secretary of communications and media, James Chisholm, said it wasn\u2019t about the party or the person making the comments, but the disinformation being spread. He said: So electoral integrity here is concerned with ensuring that factual information is made available to the public, rather than disinformation and misinformation about candidates or the electoral process itself. We\u2019re not concerned here about the party itself, its beliefs. We\u2019re not concerned about the authors of the information as much about the statements, the content, and whether or not they are mis- or disinformation, which would then also need to have the significant, far reaching consequences, as defined in the bill. Chisholm said the bill wasn\u2019t about censorship, but codes the platforms undertake to deal with misinformation and disinformation, building on the existing industry-developed voluntary code. Husic questioned on effect of Trump presidency on regulating AI and social media The industry minister, Ed Husic, has been asked about how the Albanese government will respond to a Donald Trump presidency in the fields of artificial intelligence and social media regulation. The context for the questions was Trump\u2019s promise to repeal Biden\u2019s artificial intelligence executive order and the influence of Elon Musk over Trump. On AI, Husic told reporters in Canberra: We will harmonise where we can and localise where we have to. That is, we will work with other [countries] where we absolutely can find common ground, to give people the assurance in the Australian context about the use of AI, we will take the steps necessary so people have the confidence to use it. On social media, particularly whether Trump could oppose Labor\u2019s misinformation and disinformation bill, Husic said: We take our responsibility to the Australian people seriously. I think people here want us to be able to deal with issues in a way that reflects our national priorities. And so I think you\u2019ll see we continue to do what we have to do. This follows vice president-elect, JD Vance, warning America\u2019s allies in Nato to \u201crespect free speech\u201d. Vance said: Nato wants us to continue us being a good participant in this military alliance \u2013 why don\u2019t you respect American values and respect free speech? It\u2019s insane that we would support a military alliance if that military alliance isn\u2019t going to be pro free speech. I think we can do both, but we have to say that American power comes with certain strings attached, one of those is: respect free speech. Only a couple of weeks ago, odds seemed to favour the development of a La Ni\u00f1a event in the Pacific, a climate driver that tends to bring wetter-than-usual conditions to much of Australia. The latest run of the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s main Access model, though, has all but ruled out La Ni\u00f1a this year, or into 2025. BoM had been a bit of an outlier among global weather agencies in estimating La Ni\u00f1a would soon be under way. (Its US counterpart, NOAA, still rates the odds of one as a 60% chance, although they have a lower threshold to declare one.) While sea surface temperatures have taken on La Ni\u00f1a-like characteristics, the atmosphere above hasn\u2019t \u201ccoupled\u201d in a way that reinforces the conditions needed for an event to take hold. (Some experts had been doubtful for a while that we could go from three La Ninas in a row to El Ni\u00f1o and back to La Ni\u00f1a. Such a combination would have been a first as far as records go. That said, climate change can mean the past isn\u2019t always a guide to the future.) Anyway, BoM\u2019s model run also has conditions in the Indian Ocean shifting back towards neutral. They had been in the \u201cnegative phase\u201d that tends to produce above-average rainfall for a lot of Australia. The bureau will provide its fortnightly update of the main climate drivers influencing Australia\u2019s weather on Tuesday afternoon. Perhaps we\u2019ll see them drop their \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a Watch\u201d reading for the Pacific. Criminal trial date set for former ATO official Richard Boyle The criminal trial against Richard Boyle, a former Australian Taxation Office official, has been scheduled for three weeks in November 2025. At a directions hearing in a South Australian district court on Monday morning, the former ATO employee was told he\u2019d face trial in a year\u2019s time. Boyle\u2019s final attempt at avoiding a criminal trial was unsuccessful after the high court last week dismissed his application to appeal an earlier ruling preventing him from using whistleblower protections. Boyle has been charged with 24 offences, including the alleged use of his mobile phone to take photographs of taxpayer information and to covertly record conversations with colleagues. Boyle went to the media about the agency\u2019s pursuit of debts, including the use of orders that require a bank to hand over money from a personal or business account without the permission of the taxpayer, after initially attempting to report the concerns internally and to the inspector general of taxation. The former ATO official had attempted to use protections under the Public Interest Disclosure Act to shield him for any criminal offences undertaken while preparing the disclosure. In March 2023, the district court judge Liesl Kudelka, however, said the law was \u201csilent\u201d on whether whistleblowers should be protected for allegedly criminal acts done while collecting evidence or investigating before a disclosure.

Victoria police said: \u201cIt\u2019s believed at this early stage a truck collided with a kindergarten on Main Road around 2.20pm.\u201d \u201cOne adult, who is yet to be formally identified, has died at the scene. A child was injured and has been taken to hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries,\u201d police said in a statement. The driver of the truck has been taken to hospital for observation. Police said the exact circumstances are still being investigated and are asking anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Severe thunderstorm warning for Northern Tablelands and North West Slopes and Plains A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for parts of northern NSW over the next several hours. The Bureau of Meteorology said a surface trough is lying through northern parts of the state with \u201cvery moist, unstable conditions to its east\u201d. Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding, large hailstones and damaging winds in the warning area over the next several hours. Locations which may be affected include Glen Innes, Guyra and Emmaville. \u2018Not just another statistic,\u2019 union says of worker\u2019s death at windfarm The Australian Workers Union says it is frustrated and angry following news a worker was killed at the Golden Plains windfarm in Rokewood this morning. AWU Victoria state secretary Ronnie Hayden said \u201cthis devastating loss could have been prevented\u201d. Just two weeks ago, union delegates from three different unions met with Vestas management to raise serious safety concerns, telling them it was only dumb luck that nobody had been killed on site yet. The incident occurs against a backdrop of mounting safety concerns at the project, the AWU claimed, saying it has consistently raised concern on the pressure facing workers due to project delays. This is not just another statistic, this is a worker who went to work and never came home. Anthony Pratt, one of Australia\u2019s richest men, has announced he has been granted a green card and will move to the United States. The billionaire head of Pratt Industries announced his move in a post to LinkedIn earlier today, where he listed three reasons it was \u201ctime to live in America\u201d: (1) My family are all US citizens. (2) Over the past 30 years we have invested to build 70 factories in America, creating 12,000 well-paying American manufacturing jobs. (3) I will remain chairman of Visy Australia, and will be returning to Australia on a regular basis. At the Geelong Botanic Gardens, a rare corpse plant is expected to begin blooming this afternoon. Also known as amorphophallus titanum, the corpse flower only blooms once every 10 years or so. The bloom lasts only 24 to 48 hours, with a powerful smell released \u2013 likened to rotting flesh. An update from the Gardens at midday said the plant had begun opening, and our very own Henry Belot is on his way to the scene to bring us the latest. In the meantime, you can follow along with the livestream below: Lingering doubts, end of subsidies put EVs in slow lane Misconceptions and the early removal of rebates have put the brakes on electric car sales, an industry group warns, as figures show adoption has slowed. But as AAP reports, the sales of hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles continued to accelerate over the last six months despite challenging economic conditions, according to analysis by the Australian Automobile Association. The peak motoring body has released a quarterly update to its online Electric Vehicle Index showing new vehicle sales dropping 7.6% in the third quarter of the year, with almost 15,000 fewer cars sold. Sales of internal combustion engine vehicles dropped further than the average, falling 9.1% during the three-month period, but electric vehicles slid by 25%. Battery-powered cars made up 6.5% of all new cars sold, down from 8.1% last quarter, which is their lowest market share since 2022. The results came after the removal of rebates for electric car sales in every state and territory except Western Australia. Despite the fall in electric vehicle sales, lower-emission hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles have surged in Australia. Hybrid vehicle sales increased by 3.3% to more than 48,000 sales during the quarter, or a share of more than 16%, while plug-in hybrid car sales jumped by 56.6% from a lower base. Some plug-in hybrid vehicles are eligible for fringe benefit tax cuts from the federal government, though these incentives are due to expire in April 2025. Liberals pick former RSL chief to take on teal MP in Mackellar A former space-industry boss and Liberal prime minister\u2019s son-in-law says he will help reduce the pressure of rising rents, mortgages and food prices if elected to federal parliament. As AAP reports, James Brown is expected to be endorsed in the coming days as the Liberal candidate for Mackellar as the party tries to wrest back the northern Sydney seat from teal independent Sophie Scamps. The 44-year-old father of two spent more than a decade in the Australian army before serving as president of RSL NSW and chief executive of the Space Industry Association. His national profile was also boosted through his marriage to Daisy Turnbull, the daughter of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, before the pair separated during the pandemic. Brown previously had preselection tilts at Liberal Senate seats left vacant by former defence minister Marise Payne and the late Jim Molan. He was also heavily involved in the party\u2019s recent failed campaign to retain the state seat of Pittwater, which makes up about half of Mackellar. The Bureau of Meteorology has published a severe weather update, looking at the storms forecast for south-east Queensland and north-east NSW: Vestas \u2018working closely with emergency services\u2019 after worker died at its Victorian windfarm Danish energy company Vestas has released a statement after a man died while working at its regional Victorian windfarm this morning. Victoria police say the man was crushed by a blade shortly after 8am at Golden Plains windfarm in Rokewood, about 133km west of Melbourne and 69km north-west of Geelong. In a statement, a Vestas spokesperson says a \u201cworkplace accident\u201d occurred: The site has been closed and we are working closely with emergency services and the authorities. The spokesperson says Danny Nielsen, senior vice president and country head for Vestas Australia and New Zealand, will provide an update to the media outside the site at 3pm. Myki slowly recovering after readers unable to be used following 3G shutdown Victoria\u2019s ageing public transport ticketing system, Myki, is slowly recovering after readers were unable to be used when Telstra shuttered its 3G network last week. The readers use mobile networks to ensure users can touch on. The issue affected trams and buses across the Victorian public transport network last week, despite \u2013 as Guardian Australia revealed \u2013 the Victorian government investing $3.3m into upgrading the outdated Myki ticketing system in preparation for the 3G network being shut down. A software update has been issued, and all trams should now have functioning Myki readers, the department said, as 91% of vehicles with issues have been fixed. The remaining buses affected are expected to be fixed in the coming days. A department of transport and planning spokesperson said: Crews are making progress rectifying the issue - with the majority of buses and all trams back online. The issue comes ahead of a replacement Myki system expected to be rolled out across Victoria next year. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has rejected a push from some on his backbench including Keith Pitt and Matt Canavan to dump Australia\u2019s commitment to net zero due to the election of Donald Trump. Littleproud was asked if Peter Dutton \u2013 who also supports keeping the commitment \u2013 should revisit it. He told Sky News: No. And while President Trump\u2019s made some soundings about that, you have got to understand your place in the world. They are 330m people, we\u2019re 27m people, we\u2019re a trading nation. The only people that will hurt out of that will be our farmers and our mining sector. Because what will happen is while we think we can go and lead the world on it, what will happen is we will get a tariff whacked on our commodity. So, we might want to beat our chest and sound big about it, but you have got to understand where the world is. Now the world has all signed up to this, but we don\u2019t need to experience what the country is at the moment, which is trying to achieve it all by 2030. We will do it in a uniquely Australian way, and we\u2019ll take our time to do it and do it properly, so that there isn\u2019t an impact on the economy. And that is why, as leader of the Nationals, I am the first leader to be able to get the Coalition to agree to nuclear energy being part of that grid, to have that complement and supplement with gas and coal, with [carbon capture and storage] and having some renewables. We will have a balance, we\u2019ll do it properly, we\u2019ll do it sensibly. But I think we should just take a deep breath on trying to be Trump-esque here in Australia, because there are unintended consequences, and they are farmers and miners. You\u2019ll note that Littleproud\u2019s comments are largely directed at his internal detractors, arguing that he\u2019s done more than predecessors (or potential successors) on nuclear power. BoM predicts thunderstorms in south-east Queensland and north-east NSW In more weather news, severe thunderstorms are forecast in south-eastern Queensland and north-east NSW this afternoon, as we flagged earlier. Here are some maps from the Bureau of Meteorology, showing the areas affected: Watch and act for bushfire in Queensland The Queensland Fire Department has issued a watch and act warning for the rural town of Forsayth amid a large, slow-moving fire. The warning area covers Forsayth Airport and Stockman Creek Road, including Forsayth township, Einasleigh Road and Curralle Station, and says: A large, slow-moving fire is burning Einasleigh Road. It is travelling towards Forsayth. Conditions could get worse quickly. People are urged to avoid driving on Einasleigh Road. The governor general and prime minister have announced the posthumous awarding of the Victoria Cross, Australia\u2019s highest military honour, to Private Richard Norden, a veteran of the Vietnam war. Norden, then aged 19, ran into enemy fire after his platoon was ambushed during the Battle of Fire Support Base Coral in 1968, one of a series of actions fought between Australia and North Vietnamese forces near Saigon, to recover a wounded comrade and then retrieve the body of another. Governor general Sam Mostyn said at a Remembrance Day event in Canberra, announcing the honour: The Victoria Cross for Australia is Australia\u2019s highest military honour, the awarding of it speaks to Private Norden\u2019s courage and selflessness in the heat of battle, his ongoing legacy and the bravery of generations of our service personnel. This is an historic occasion for Australia and the Australian Defence Force, and a very significant day for Private Norden\u2019s loved ones. There has been a strong campaign to see Norden awarded the Victoria Cross, uniting many within the Australian military community. Norden, who died in 1972 from injuries sustained in a police motorcycle accident, while serving in the Australian Capital Territory police, was awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) before his death, but many felt this was inadequate. Anthony Albanese acknowledged the campaign for Norden to receive the Victoria Cross in his Remembrance Day address: In honouring Richard Norton and all he fought for, Australia also honours all those who fought for him: his fellow veterans, those who served alongside him, and those who took up his cause when they learned of his story. Everyone who kept alive the memory of his valour, everyone who has championed and advocated due recognition of Richard Norden, and everyone who has kept faith with Australia\u2019s promise to remember all those who have served and their loved ones. A man has died while working at a windfarm in Victoria, police have confirmed. In a statement, police said the man was working at Rokewood windfarm when he was crushed beneath a fan blade shortly after 8am this morning. First responders attempted to revive him but he was declared dead at the scene. WorkSafe will investigate the incident, police said. Misinformation makes emergency responses difficult, Senate inquiry hears The National Emergency Management Agency has warned misinformation and disinformation online makes emergency responses more difficult. The deputy coordinator general, Joel Buffone, told a Senate inquiry that the example of recent misinformation and disinformation spread about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) in the US in response to floods there \u201cput staff at risk\u201d and forced Fema staff to withdraw. He also pointed to the recent Crowdstrike outage, which took down millions of Windows computers worldwide and threw many services into chaos: Straight away there was effectively using platforms to effectively run scams, and there was a whole lot of misinformation. He said misinformation about the 2019 bushfires \u2013 where arsonists with a political motive were falsely blamed for causing fires \u2013 almost immediately had an impact on social cohesion. Blue banded bee wins ABC\u2019s first Insect of the Year poll The native blue banded bee has won the ABC\u2019s first Insect of the Year poll. Just over 50.1% of voters (6,815) chose the blue banded bee from six insect finalists. The common hoverfly received the second highest number of votes (13%), followed by the Bogong moth (11.4%). The blue banded bee was cited by environment minister Tanya Plibersek as one reason why the site of a proposed goldmine near Blayney should be issued an Aboriginal heritage protection order. As Calla Wahlquist reported, the basis of the protection declaration was a claim that the Belubula River, headwaters and springs were the site of pre-initiation ceremonies in Wiradyuri culture and that the river itself was the subject of the Blue Banded Bee dreaming. The Insect of the Year poll was conducted by the ABC for four weeks during October and November. Governor general begins Remembrance Day address The governor general, Sam Mostyn, has begun a commemorative address at the Remembrance Day service at the War Memorial in Canberra. Mostyn noted it was her first Remembrance Day as governor general and said she was honoured to address the crowd before the Stone of Remembrance as the daughter of an army officer. For more than a century, Australians have repeated this ritual of remembrance, just as we do gathering today. Each year, we render our tribute anew to the generations of servicemen and women who have died or suffered for Australia in conflicts far from home. And so it is, our Remembrance Days are born of all the days of commemoration that have gone before. Anti-slavery advocates welcome appointment of national commissioner Anti-slavery advocates have welcomed the appointment of former senator Chris Evans as Australia\u2019s first anti-slavery commissioner. Evans\u2019s appointment to a five-year term was announced by the attorney general. Alison Rahill, program manager of the Australian Catholic Anti-slavery Network, said Evans could draw on his \u201cformidable experience in government and the private sector to make a difference to the estimated 41,000 people experiencing modern slavery right here in Australia and 50 million people worldwide\u201d. This must include examining economic, migration, corporate governance, social and trade policies settings that currently undermine Australia\u2019s anti-slavery ambitions. As we flagged earlier, the NSW anti-slavery commissioner Dr James Cockayne said Evans\u2019s appointment was \u201cencouraging on several levels\u201d. Cockayne said the inaugural national anti-slavery commissioner had numerous challenges ahead: With regulators overseas increasingly ratcheting up expectations of Australian businesses\u2019 modern slavery and human rights due diligence, including in thorny cases like cotton and tomatoes coming from Xinjiang, it is crucial that government sets clear expectations for Australian business on what is expected of them to manage these risks. Otherwise, Australian business will find it increasingly hard to access overseas markets and capital, especially from Europe. Constitutional lawyer speaks on government\u2019s proposed misinformation and disinformation bill We brought you comments from constitutional lawyer Prof Anne Twomey earlier, who has been speaking at a senate inquiry into the government\u2019s misinformation and disinformation bill. Here is some of what she had to say: The opposition transport spokesperson Bridget McKenzie has said her history of criticising the lack of competition in Australian aviation is important to note in the aftermath of revelations she failed to declare 16 flight upgrades over the past nine years. McKenzie, speaking at the Australian Financial Review\u2019s infrastructure summit today, dodged a question about whether her declaration failure had made the public more cynical about politicians in general. However, she sought to make a distinction between her record and Anthony Albanese\u2019s, after recent reports he sought flight upgrades from Qantas when he was transport minister. McKenzie said: I don\u2019t think the public is aware that politicians, MPs, travel business class for work right around the country. Some MPs choose on short trips to fly economy because we see it as a waste of taxpayers money. If you\u2019re simply going from Melbourne to Canberra or Melbourne and Adelaide, why should the taxpayer pay for a business class trip? I think the key issue around this is what is the influence on decision making and I\u2019m very happy to stand by my public comments, my approach to the lack of competition in our aviation sector, the impact that\u2019s had on the Australian travelling public over the influence it may have had, or clearly has had, on other decision makers. I make no bones about the fact that I do believe the former transport minister, our now prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has been influenced by his personal and financial relationship with Qantas. Remembrance Day service begins in Canberra A national Remembrance Day service has just begun at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. It is beginning with a tri-service guard of honour, with Australia\u2019s Federation Guard marching on to the Parade Ground accompanied by the Band of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Governor general Sam Mostyn is set to deliver a commemorative address. First national anti-slavery commissioner welcomed: \u2018Encouraging on several levels\u2019 The New South Wales anti-slavery commissioner, Dr James Cockayne, has welcomed the appointment of Australia\u2019s first national anti-slavery commissioner, Chris Evans. Cockayne said the appointment was \u201cencouraging on several levels\u201d, with Evans having worked with business leaders, unions, faith leaders, civil society, and researchers. He will combine a deep humanity and care for people with an understanding of how to get things done in Canberra. And his selection is a sign of the seriousness of the Government\u2019s commitment to anti-slavery objectives \u2026 I wish him every success and look forward to working with him. Australian Jewish Association received death threat before appearing at misinformation inquiry, president says The Australian Jewish Association\u2019s president, Dr David Adler, has said his organisation received a death threat and was warned not to appear before the committee this morning reviewing the misinformation and disinformation bill. Adler said the AJA, which is opposed to the bill, received the threat over the weekend: I\u2019m not sure how often people who appear before Senate committees are warned not to, and that warning is accompanied by a death threat. But that happened over the weekend. We were sent an illustrated death threat with the hangman\u2019s noose, together with the words that if we appeared before the committee, we would die. And I just think it\u2019s a reflection of the spike in antisemitism that is now at crisis level in Australia. This committee is not about the Middle East conflicts, and there are now people who think that, at the threat of death, we should not participate in Australia\u2019s democratic processes. The committee chair, Labor senator Karen Grogan, said the committee had reported the threat to the Australian federal police and took that action extremely seriously: No one who appears before a committee should ever have to endure those threats, and we will pursue this. Labor and the Coalition are on a unity ticket in wanting under-16s off social media, with the opposition even demanding the government rush the bill through this month without any kind of Senate inquiry \u2013 but there\u2019s at least one Liberal senator not on board. Alex Antic, the South Australian conservative, tweeted this morning his claim that \u201cLabor knows that the next generation of young people are being red pilled by social media and are turning away from their bleak world view.\u201d Social media bans for minors and \u201cmisinformation\u201d laws will ensure that young Australians only get a corporate left wing message bricking in a new generation of Labor voters. After the government announced its plans to legislate a social media ban for children under 16, and to introduce those laws into parliament this year, the Coalition sought to one-up Labor by calling for the legislation to be passed almost immediately. Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who has backed a social media ban for some time, said today he wanted the changes in \u201cbefore kids go onto Christmas holidays and into the new year, when they\u2019re sitting around on their devices.\u201d Dutton said the laws didn\u2019t need parliamentary examination: We\u2019ve got two sitting weeks left, and I believe that we can pass this law by Christmas. It doesn\u2019t need to be the case that the government\u2019s delaying because they haven\u2019t had a Senate inquiry, or because they\u2019re worried about Meta running a campaign against the government. But Antic\u2019s tweet shows there is some opposition in the Coalition to ramming these laws through. Watch this space. Man\u2019s body found beside highway south of Taree New South Wales police are investigating after a man\u2019s body was found at Johns River, about 36km south of Taree. Police were called to the Pacific Highway at Johns River about 5pm yesterday where officers allegedly found a man deceased on a nature strip behind concrete barriers. He is yet to be formally identified, but is believed to be aged in his 30s. A report will be prepared for the coroner and a crime scene has been established. Police are appealing for witnesses to identify a man reportedly seen walking southbound on the M1 Pacific Motorway between Kew and Johns River on 7 and 10 November. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Melbourne convenience store set alight and rammed with car, police say Victorian detectives will investigate after a car was allegedly rammed into a Pascoe Vale South convenience store this morning and the premises set alight. Emergency services were called to the shop on Coonans Road to reports of the blaze about 3.15am. Police said a family who live in a residence attached to the store were not injured. The area has been cordoned off with a crime scene set up, and it\u2019s expected an arson chemist and detectives will attend the scene today. Police will investigate whether the damage and fire are linked to any other recent incidents. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts asked legal experts before the senate inquiry on the misinformation and disinformation bill: Who is the arbiter of truth? Constitutional law expert, Prof Anne Twomey says that is a peculiar aspect of the bill, and the platforms tend to outsource to fact checkers, who then turn to experts they can find to speak to an issue, but the responses are often misunderstood: Now I\u2019ve been on the expert side of this, I\u2019ve been asked for many fact checks, and here\u2019s my experience of it. The people that I\u2019m dealing with, they try hard and they\u2019re well meaning, but they are not experts themselves in the field. They\u2019ll ask me a question in a particular form of words. I\u2019ll give them an answer that\u2019s suited to the way they ask me that question, and then sometimes later on, I read what they write and discover that they have misinterpreted or themselves being misleading about it, because they thought the sort of words that they used for me when they asked me the question actually mean the same as another set of words which mean something quite different. The fact checkers often misunderstand the experts, she said, and that isn\u2019t subsequently checked: The impression I get is that these are just frequently, young kids out of university who don\u2019t really know and they\u2019re taking on this really important role of making a decision that will lead some Meta or Google or whatever to make decisions about what is true and what is false when the fact checker themselves hasn\u2019t properly understood what the experts have said, and it\u2019s also really dependent on what experts you choose. The Victorian Bar\u2019s James McCormish says it is the \u201cgaping hole at the heart of the bill\u201d. Almost all workplaces have sexual harassment policies, but many not monitoring prevalence More than 7,000 employers have reported new information to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, following the introduction of the positive duty to provide a safe workplace for all employees as part of the Respect@Work report. While nearly 99% of employers have a formal policy on work-related sexual harassment and discrimination, the new data shows more than one in four employers (28%) are not monitoring how prevalent it is. The WGEA CEO Mary Wooldridge said: While we are seeing comprehensive policy coverage, this is only a critical first step. Long-term culture change within organisations also requires employees and company leaders to know the policy, understand what\u2019s in it and the part they play in its implementation. One of the insights from the Respect@Work report is that proactive engagement by leadership is critical for long-term change. WGEA\u2019s new results show that most CEOs are highly engaged in reviewing, signing off on, and then communicating these policies (85%), however just over half (55%) of their Boards are similarly involved. The data also showed that while there are comprehensive processes to disclose sexual harassment to HR (98%), anonymous disclosure processes are less available (68%). Senate hearing under way into misinformation and disinformation bill A Senate committee is conducting a hearing today on the federal government\u2019s controversial misinformation and disinformation bill, hearing from legal experts, religious groups and federal departments. Constitutional law expert Prof Anne Twomey is up first and tells the committee she is concerned about the definition of disinformation in the bill, arguing that intent to deceive including that someone has been told something is false before is not sufficient: I would imagine in many circumstances, the person is not intending to deceive. In fact, they disagree with what the fact checkers have said and want to put their disagreement out in the public realm and deciding that is disinformation simply on the basis that some fact checker has decided on the basis of one or two experts that something is false, it\u2019s not necessarily false. Just because you\u2019ve checked with some experts, or even if there\u2019s an expert consensus that something is false doesn\u2019t actually mean it really is. People can still believe genuinely what they are saying is true, and I don\u2019t think one should necessarily assume that they are deliberately trying to deceive people, even if they keep disseminating material that other people say is false. Twomey\u2019s point was backed by the Victorian barrister James McCormish. NSW police investigating suspicious death NSW police have launched an investigation after a man\u2019s body was found in the Central West yesterday. About 1.40pm emergency services were called to Parkes after the discovery of the man\u2019s body in a home. He is yet to be formally identified, but is believes to be in his 70s. The death is being treated as suspicious, police said. Officers established a crime scene, a report will be prepared for the coroner and anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Dutton\u2019s Remembrance Day statement: \u2018May our memory of them hold us to the mark\u2019 The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has also issued a statement for Remembrance Day. In a video posted to X, he said: The reason why evil didn\u2019t prevail \u2013 why tyranny didn\u2019t crush freedom \u2013 is because everyday Australians chose to serve and sacrifice for a greater good. We remember our fallen, so we don\u2019t forget who we are. May our memory of them hold us to the mark. PM issues statement for Remembrance Day Anthony Albanese has released a statement to mark Remembrance Day. Posted to X, the prime minister said \u201cwe think of every Australian who has answered the call through the decades\u201d. We think of everywhere they have gone across the world to confront the unimaginable as it became reality .. We remember every name. Every face. Every future lost and every future changed forever. And we think of the many who were cast into the ranks of the unknown soldier as they were torn from life. Transurban CEO: we need to convince drivers of the value of tolls The chief of Transurban, Michelle Jablko, has said the tolling giant needs to do more work to convince drivers of the value they get from taking its paid roads, amid scrutiny on how the company\u2019s tolls affect the New South Wales economy and the cost of living. Jablko\u2019s comments come as her company finds itself in prolonged negotiations with the NSW government about overhauling the contracts for 11 of the state\u2019s 13 toll roads amid deep public dissatisfaction at the rising cost of tolls in Sydney and questions from the business community about how tolls in the city are adding to supply chain costs. Jablko told the Australian Financial Review\u2019s infrastructure summit in Sydney this morning that Transurban was exploring more rewards for customers such as discounts for fuel and car servicing. I hope when customers hear the beep, they go \u2018oh, that\u2019s extra value\u2019. A review into NSW\u2019s patchwork toll network commissioned by the Minns Labor government in July recommended a declining distance-based toll to simplify pricing and cheapen commutes to and from Western Sydney, to more equitably spread the city\u2019s estimated $195bn toll burden over the next 37 years. While the government is now hoping to negotiate an overhaul with Transurban, who hold long term contracts for 11 toll roads in Sydney, questions remain about whether the tolling giant will agree to changes that decrease its overall projected revenues, with the government potentially taking legal action to force the changes. Jablko today said that declining distance based tolling, recommended by the review, would actually bring negative effects for the city, because it promotes people to do longer trips and would add to congestion. She also claimed the company\u2019s data showed western Sydney drivers would be worse off, because more commuted locally as opposed to those who drive eastwards to the CBD. We\u2019re heard various warnings about the relative lack of new renewable energy investments in the past year or so \u2013 at least if we\u2019re to manage the exit of aging coal-fired power plants and meet our clean energy targets. The September quarter, it turns out, was one of the most promising quarters for some time, the Clean Energy Council reports today. In the July-September months, more than 1,400 megawatts of new wind and solar farms worth $3.3bn reached financial sign-off, the best since the end of 2022. CEC chief Kane Thornton said: If we sustain the level of investment for new wind and solar power plants which we have seen in the third quarter of this year, we can get back on track to achieving Australia\u2019s target of 82% renewable energy generation by 2030. Most of the new projects were either onshore wind (offshore not actually happening \u2013 yet) or big batteries. Rooftop solar has tended to make solar farms a bit less attractive. According to the council, there are 89 renewable electricity generation projects that have either reached financial commitment or are under construction, representing 13.9 gigawatts of capacity in the pipeline. There are also 49 storage projects working their way forward from financial commitment, equivalent to 9.7GW/ 24.3GW-hours in capacity/energy output. While that sounds good, it\u2019s notable that not a lot of capacity has lately come online. The council notes the September quarter saw just three renewable electricity generation projects, totalling 168MW of new capacity, were actually commissioned in Q3 2024. We\u2019ll get the summer readiness report soon from the Australian Energy Market Operator, and it won\u2019t be surprising to hear we may face a few tight spots particularly if there are extended heatwaves and coal-fired plants drop out for unscheduled reasons. Breaker Rachael Gunn, better known as Raygun, has said she is not retiring from breaking despite reports suggesting she would. Last week she told 2DayFm she was \u201cgoing to keep competing, for sure, but that seems a really difficult thing for me to do now, to approach a battle\u201d, due to the scrutiny she received after her performance at the Paris Olympics. Speaking on the Today Show this morning, Gunn said she never used the word retire and that her comments had been misinterpreted: I was talking on 2DayFm about how I\u2019m not going to do certain competitions anymore \u2013 which didn\u2019t seem like such a big deal because breaking is not going to be in the Olympics anyway. But you know, I\u2019m still going to be part of community jams \u2026 and still dance and still break. [I never used] the word retire, but, you know, it just caught on to the news cycle \u2026 I\u2019m not retiring. Her comments also come after she made a cameo appearance at Tones and I\u2019s show at Rod Laver Arena on Saturday, brought on stage to perform during Dance With Me. Full Story podcast: Students are drowning in debt. Will Labor\u2019s plan help them? Last week the prime minister delivered a pitch to young Australians: Labor will slash their student debt by 20% next financial year if the Albanese government is re-elected. The surprise announcement is part of a major federal government overhaul designed to boost access to education and address \u2018intergenerational unfairness\u2019. But while the move has been welcomed by many, it has also been widely criticised for not doing enough to help students as well as unfairly penalising all taxpayers. Chief economist at the Australia Institute and Guardian columnist Greg Jericho gives his take on why Labor\u2019s plan isn\u2019t perfect but why the feigned outrage over \u2018fairness\u2019 is wrong. You can have a listen below: Central Australia is set to face a concentration of showers and thunderstorms, with south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales facing \u201can almost daily thunderstorm risk at the moment\u201d. Senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology spoke with the Today show earlier and provided a forecast update: Today we\u2019re going to see the concentration of showers and thunderstorms through central parts of the country, largely impacting South Australia and southern parts of the Northern Territory, as well as southeast Queensland and northeast NSW, which are seeing an almost daily thunderstorm risk at the moment \u2026 [This could bring] heavy rainfall that could lead to flash flooding, large hail or damaging winds. She said in recent days, heatwave conditions had been contracting away from southern Queensland and is less extensive than it was over the weekend. Even where we don\u2019t have those heatwave warnings, we\u2019re continuing to see very hot weather across the northern parts of Australia, with temperatures 2 to 5 degrees above average \u2013 which for many areas, particularly inland, equates to temperatures in the high 30s at least, if not the low to mid 40s. Naplan scores remained stable amid Covid school closures: new study New research from UNSW and the University of Sydney suggests that Naplan scored remained stable during Covid-related school closures, while other countries reported learning losses. The research, published earlier this year, analysed Naplan test scores across Australian states \u2013 comparing differences in student performance based on varying periods of remote learning between 2020 and 2021, with school closures ranging from nine days to 157 days. Dr Nalini Prasad said students in schools that operated remotely for an extended time \u201cperformed similarly to students in schools which were closed for a relatively short period\u201d. Australia adopted a zero-Covid policy which used lockdowns \u2013 and other non-pharmaceutical interventions \u2013pre-emptively to eliminate the transmission of Covid-19. Per capita Covid case numbers and deaths were considerably lower in Australia. Low Covid case numbers meant that students did not have to miss school due to contracting the virus. Researchers used Naplan test scores from 2013-2019 as baseline data, comparing them with scores from 2021 and 2022. The data also suggested remote attendance rates were comparable to, and sometimes exceeded, typical in-person schooling levels. Matt Keogh on Aukus, second Trump presidency Matt Keogh was also questioned on what he thinks the challenges will be for the Australian government amid a second Trump presidency? He pointed to comments from treasurer Jim Chalmers and noted there would be \u201csome economic bumps on the road that will be effecting not just Australia but the globe.\u201d Keogh said the government is prepared to weather this \u201cthrough flexible interest rates\u201d, adding: We understand regardless of who is in charge of the White House or what is happening across the globe, what matters to Australians is being able to make ends meet themselves. He also expressed confidence in the Aukus deal under Trump, telling the program that legislation went through Congress recently with a \u201cbroad cross-section of support.\u201d We expect that to continue even under a Trump Presidency. Veteran\u2019s affairs minister on progress of oversight body The minister for veterans\u2019 affairs and defence personnel, Matt Keogh, was up on ABC News Breakfast earlier to mark Remembrance Day. Asked how soon an independent oversight body will be set up to examine government progress in implementing the recommendations of the royal commission into veteran suicides, he said: We only received that report in September. 122 recommendations are backed up by seven volumes and 3,100 pages of report. There is quite a bit of detail there, but we understand the importance and urgency of this work and that is why we have committed to responding by the end of the year. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Executives from the supermarket giant Aldi are set to be questioned on the state of the sector, AAP reports, as the consumer watchdog examines rising prices at the checkout. Aldi officials will be questioned by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over the next two days as part of its latest round of hearings into supermarkets. While Coles and Woolworths have come under fire for their market share and accusations of price gouging, Aldi is the next largest player in the grocery industry. Aldi holds just 9% of supermarket sales nationally, compared to the 67% market share of Coles and Woolworths. The consumer watchdog previously said it had taken two decades for Aldi to reach a 9% market share, indicating there were issues with competition in the supermarket industry. This demonstrates the level of difficulty entering and expanding in supermarket retailing, and the significant investment, time and differentiated offering required to expand. Officials for Coles, Woolworths and Metcash \u2013 the parent company of IGA \u2013 will also front the commission\u2019s inquiry in coming days. The hearings into supermarkets are being held ahead of a final report being delivered to the federal government in February. Conroy on tensions between the US and China Pat Conroy was also asked about increasing tensions between the US and China over a number of issues, including tariffs and Taiwan, under Trump \u2013 and what Australia is doing to prepare for this. He told ABC RN the government had been \u201cvery honest with the Australian public that we live in an era of geopolitical competition in Indo-Pacific\u201d. Prime minister [Anthony] Albanese made a series of announcements with President [Joe] Biden around critical minerals, and we would expect the United States to continue to focus on that area. Obviously, President [Donald] Trump and his administration will have their own approach, but it\u2019s been very clear that a lot of countries have been overly reliant on one supply source, and there\u2019s going to be a real focus on supply chain resilience and sovereignty across the world. That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in making missiles in this country, that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in a future made in Australia. Pat Conroy confident of Aukus deal\u2019s future amid Trump administration The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, is speaking with ABC RN about the Aukus agreement \u2013 and how safe he believes this is under a Donald Trump administration in the US. Conry said he was very confident, with the plan being \u201cin the strategic interests of all three countries involved\u201d and \u201cstrong bipartisan support in the United States.\u201d Conroy was also asked about news that former secretary of state Mike Pompeo won\u2019t be part of the administration. As the host noted, Pompeo was a strong supporter of Aukus, and Richard Marles and Penny Wong had met with him in recent months to discuss the future of the deal under a potential Trump administration. Asked if this is a blow to Aukus, Conroy responded: No, I don\u2019t believe so. Ministers of the Australian government have been engaging with Republican opinion leaders for a number of years, just as we engage with Democratic [leaders], so I\u2019m confident that the strong \u2026 United States [support] for Aukus will continue \u2026 because it\u2019s in the US interest. Conroy was also asked about calls from Labor luminaries, such as former premier Bob Carr, for the deal to be reconsidered amid the Trump victory. Conroy said he respects their opinions but \u201cthe will of the party was clearly expressed at the national conference, where a very strong majority supported Aukus\u201d. Media watchdog to call for new powers to fight misinformation on social media The Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) will today reiterate its call for more powers to combat misinformation and disinformation on social media. The communications watchdog believes a code of practice on misinformation and disinformation \u2013 which has been signed by Adobe, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Redbubble, TikTok, Twitch and Legitimate \u2013 lacks enforcement power. In a submission to a senate committee, Acma warned: There is no regulatory backstop to either compel digital platforms to become signatories or hold them accountable if they breach their obligations. Acma will appear before the parliamentary inquiry today and continue its call for tougher legislation: To be both effective and enforceable, the code must be supported by key performance indicators linked to code commitments and measurable through high-quality sets of Australian-relevant data. This is essential to hold signatories accountable to their commitments and provide transparency to Australians on the effectiveness of these measures. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has flagged his election campaign will focus on cost of living and migration, linking the latter to the release of 224 unlawful non-citizens who had been in indefinite detention. In a press conference yesterday, Dutton was asked if the Coalition would mirror Donald Trump\u2019s successful election campaign in the US. Dutton responded the opposition would run its \u201cown campaign\u201d but flagged some of the issues in the US, such as \u201cmigration\u201d, were a focus in Australia too. The opposition leader turned to the release of hundreds of immigration detainees, known as the NZYQ cohort, following a high court decision in November 2023 that indefinite detention is unlawful. Dutton inaccurately claimed the Albanese government had a choice in their release, and described the entire cohort as \u201chardened criminals\u201d. Certainly cost of living, certainly interest rates, certainly migration because the government has released over 200 hardened criminals from immigration detention when they didn\u2019t need to do so ... so our country is less safe as a result of the decisions that the Albanese government\u2019s made and we are poorer as a community as well. I think they\u2019re the issues that really will be front of mind for Australians at the next election. While a number of the non-citizens within the cohort have had serious criminal convictions, some have had their visas cancelled for fraud, \u201cother non-violent offences\u201d, or lower level offences, such as common assaults. In response to the high court\u2019s ruling last November, Labor and the Coalition passed changes imposing strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and curfews, to those released. Last week, the high court again ruled against the government\u2019s powers, saying it breached the separation of powers. The judges said the conditions were \u201ca form of extra-judicial collective punishment based on membership of the class\u201d. The following day, the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, made new regulations to regain the power to impose the conditions where someone \u201cposes a substantial risk of seriously harming any part of the Australian community by committing a serious offence\u201d. Australians will pause for a minute of silence at 11am to honour the thousands who died in military conflicts in commemoration services around the nation. As AAP reports, a national service will take place at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where the governor general, Sam Mostyn, will deliver a commemorative address. After the commemoration, Anthony Albanese and Mostyn will make an announcement about a military honour. In Sydney, a service at the Martin Place Cenotaph will begin at 10.30am, while the Opera House will be illuminated with images of poppies at dawn and dusk. RSL Queensland said more than 140 events would take place at sub-branches state-wide, with its official Queensland service taking place at Brisbane\u2019s Anzac Square from 10.15am. RSL Western Australia will use the occasion to call for DNA donations to try to help identify unnamed fallen soldiers from the 32nd Battalion that took part in one of World War I\u2019s most devastating battles in July 1916. RSL WA\u2019s official service will be held at the State War Memorial in Kings Park. The Greens will announce its $74bn plan to wipe all student debt as it looks to snatch a seat off Labor in inner-city Melbourne. The minor party will reveal the proposal in Wills, held by Labor\u2019s Peter Khalil, with their candidate, Samantha Ratnam, who led the party in Victoria for nearly seven years. Costings from the Parliamentary Budget Office show the policy to wipe all student debt would cost $55bn over the next four years and $74bn over the decade. The Greens estimate this will save someone with a debt of $27,600 about $5,500 a year. The Greens\u2019 education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, said the policy would make a \u201creal, tangible difference to so many people doing it tough\u201d. Student debt can\u2019t be fixed because student debt shouldn\u2019t exist. All student debt should be wiped. If Anthony Albanese can go to uni for free, so should everyone else. It comes as Labor announced last week it would slash Hecs debts by 20% if it wins at the next federal election. The Greens say they would pass any bill to reduce student debts in this term if Labor were to bring the proposal forward. Good morning and welcome back to a new week on the Australia news live blog. I\u2019m Emily Wind and I\u2019ll be taking you through our live coverage this Monday. Today, the Greens are set to announce its $74bn plan to wipe all student debt as it looks to snatch a seat off Labor in inner-city Melbourne. The minor party will reveal the proposal in Wills, held by Labor\u2019s Peter Khalil, with their candidate Samantha Ratnam, who led the party in Victoria for nearly seven years. Sarah Basford Canales will have all the details soon. Meanwhile, Australians will pause to honour the thousands who died in military conflicts in commemoration services around the nation. As AAP reports, a national service will take place at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where governor general Sam Mostyn will deliver a commemorative address. After the commemoration, Anthony Albanese and Mostyn will make an announcement about a military honour. We\u2019ll bring you more details soon.

A true scientist, she was never really alone, though. There were individual men \u2013 Pierre first among them \u2013 who recognised her brilliance and whose support for her never faltered. The physicist Paul Langevin, briefly her lover once she had been widowed, remained loyal long after the affair and accompanying scandal had fizzled out. That much we knew. What wasn\u2019t so well known, and which Sobel brings out in her new biography, is that Curie created her own school and that many of those she mentored and set on the path to prominence were women. Each of those women inspired many others, in a radioactive cascade that would have lit up one of Ir\u00e8ne\u2019s cherished cloud chambers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were women who passed through the Curie lab whose discoveries were feted around the world before they had obtained their baccalaureate, let alone a PhD</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These were, necessarily, unconventional careers \u2013 and all the more inspiring for that. It\u2019s hard to imagine a young woman arriving in France or any western country today, as Marie Sk\u0142odowska did in 1891, penniless, lacking a university&nbsp;degree, barely speaking the local lingo and going on to win a Nobel prize just over a decade later \u2013 and credit must go to the institutions and individuals who made that possible. There were women who passed through the Curie lab whose discoveries were feted around the world before they had obtained their baccalaureate, let alone a PhD. These&nbsp;\u201claboratory daughters\u201d were fiercely loyal to Curie, and when her real daughter showed intellectual promise, she assembled&nbsp;a version of the \u201cflying university\u201d that she had benefited from in her youth in Russian-occupied Warsaw to help realise that&nbsp;promise. Ir\u00e8ne was home schooled by some of the most respected thinkers of their generation. This is how scientific dynasties are born.</p> <p>There were enough holes in the periodic table in the early 20th century to keep Curie in the lab for several lifetimes, but she didn\u2019t hesitate to step outside it when the world called. The first world war having created a demand for mobile X-ray units, she built the units and learned to drive, then enlisted the ever-willing Ir\u00e8ne as her aide-de-camp. If the book has a fault, it\u2019s that the world doesn\u2019t get the same attention to detail as Dmitri Mendeleev\u2019s brilliant ordering of the&nbsp;elements. In the spring of 1919, the Curies\u2019 otherwise healthy second daughter, \u00c8ve, came down with double pneumonia, aged 14. Sobel doesn\u2019t mention that this happened against the backdrop of a flu pandemic \u2013 a disaster that claimed many more lives than the war.</p> <p>Overall, though, her short and well-paced book succeeds in dispelling the dust that clings to some accounts of this most famous&nbsp;of lives and makes it fresh again. Her&nbsp;explanations of the science allow the reader to grasp how one experiment led logically to the next in the search for radioactive&nbsp;elements and particles,&nbsp;and to puzzle or rejoice with the scientists as the results come in. Their thirst for knowledge might have come close to an addiction, because even after they knew how toxic their workspace was, they were&nbsp;drawn ineluctably back into it.</p> <p>They paid the price. We knew that too, but perhaps not to what extent. In an appendix entitled The Radioactivists, Sobel provides potted biographies of the dramatis personae. It\u2019s shocking how many died of the effects of radiation exposure \u2013 effects that were sometimes recognised at the time, sometimes only later \u2013 and of course they weren\u2019t the only ones. But then there were the countless others whose lives were saved or prolonged thanks to Curie\u2019s discoveries \u2013 as well as the discoveries of the many women (and some men) who, but for her, would never have seen the inside of a lab.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Elements of Marie Curie: How the Glow of Radium Lit a Path for Women in Science</em> by Dava Sobel is published by 4th Estate (\u00a322).

There were enough holes in the periodic table in the early 20th century to keep Curie in the lab for several lifetimes, but she didn\u2019t hesitate to step outside it when the world called. The first world war having created a demand for mobile X-ray units, she built the units and learned to drive, then enlisted the ever-willing Ir\u00e8ne as her aide-de-camp. If the book has a fault, it\u2019s that the world doesn\u2019t get the same attention to detail as Dmitri Mendeleev\u2019s brilliant ordering of the elements. In the spring of 1919, the Curies\u2019 otherwise healthy second daughter, \u00c8ve, came down with double pneumonia, aged 14. Sobel doesn\u2019t mention that this happened against the backdrop of a flu pandemic \u2013 a disaster that claimed many more lives than the war. Overall, though, her short and well-paced book succeeds in dispelling the dust that clings to some accounts of this most famous of lives and makes it fresh again. Her explanations of the science allow the reader to grasp how one experiment led logically to the next in the search for radioactive elements and particles, and to puzzle or rejoice with the scientists as the results come in. Their thirst for knowledge might have come close to an addiction, because even after they knew how toxic their workspace was, they were drawn ineluctably back into it. They paid the price. We knew that too, but perhaps not to what extent. In an appendix entitled The Radioactivists, Sobel provides potted biographies of the dramatis personae. It\u2019s shocking how many died of the effects of radiation exposure \u2013 effects that were sometimes recognised at the time, sometimes only later \u2013 and of course they weren\u2019t the only ones. But then there were the countless others whose lives were saved or prolonged thanks to Curie\u2019s discoveries \u2013 as well as the discoveries of the many women (and some men) who, but for her, would never have seen the inside of a lab. \u2022 The Elements of Marie Curie: How the Glow of Radium Lit a Path for Women in Science by Dava Sobel is published by 4th Estate (\u00a322).

The Scottish government abandoned plans to partner with the Luton-based Christian charity Azalea, which offers \u201cpractical, emotional and spiritual support to women sexually exploited through prostitution\u201d, after a backlash from the violence against women sector.

While humanitarian crises are unfolding in Palestine, Yemen, Afghanistan, Sudan, Congo, Kurdistan, Lebanon, Balochistan, Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh/Artsakh, and many, many other places, humanity is also breaching the 1.5C greenhouse gas emissions limit, with <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024\">no signs of real reductions</a> in sight. Instead, the opposite is taking place \u2013 last year, global emissions reached an all-time high. Heat records <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/07/this-year-virtually-certain-to-be-hottest-on-record-finds-eu-space-programme\">have been shattered</a>, and this year is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/07/this-year-virtually-certain-to-be-hottest-on-record-finds-eu-space-programme\">virtually certain</a>\u201d to be the hottest year ever recorded, with unprecedented extreme weather events pushing the planet further into uncharted territory. The destabilisation of the biosphere and the natural ecosystems we depend on to survive is leading to untold human suffering and further accelerating the mass extinction of flora and fauna.</p> <p>Azerbaijan\u2019s entire economy is built on fossil fuels, with the state-owned oil company Socar\u2019s oil and gas exports accounting for close to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/azerbaijan-energy-profile/overview\">90% of the country\u2019s exports</a>. Despite <a href=\"https://cop29.az/en/home\">what it might claim</a>, Azerbaijan has no ambition to take climate action. It is <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/10/azerbaijans-climate-leadership-challenge/03-azerbaijans-transition-and-climate-risks\">planning to expand</a> fossil fuel production, which is completely incompatible with the 1.5C limit and the goals of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/04/paris-climate-change-agreement-enters-into-force\">Paris agreement</a> on climate change.</p> <p>Many attenders of this year\u2019s Cop are scared to criticise the Azerbaijan government. Human Rights Watch recently <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/10/10/cop29-host-country-agreement-lacks-rights-protections\">published a statement</a> explaining how it couldn\u2019t be certain that attenders\u2019 rights to peacefully protest would be guaranteed. In addition, Azerbaijan land and sea borders <a href=\"https://oc-media.org/aliyev-claims-azerbaijans-land-border-remains-closed-due-to-security-concerns/\">will remain closed</a> during Cop29, making it only possible to travel in and out of the country by air, which causes pollution and which many Azerbaijan citizens can\u2019t afford. The reason given for closing borders at all Cops since the start of the Covid pandemic is to maintain \u201cnational security\u201d, but I\u2019ve heard many Azerbaijanis describe the situation as being \u201ckept in a prison\u201d.</p> <p>The Azerbaijan regime is guilty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/09/azerbaijani-ethnic-cleansing-armenians-nagorno-karabakh-children\">ethnic cleansing</a>, humanitarian blockades and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nagorno-karabakh-exodus-amounts-war-crime-legal-experts-say-2023-09-29/\">war crimes</a>, as well as repressing its own population and cracking down on the country\u2019s civil society. The independent watchdog <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan/freedom-world/2024\">Freedom House</a> ranks the country as the least democratic state in Europe, with the regime <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/10/cop29-azerbaijan-end-assault-on-civil-society/\">actively targeting</a> journalists, independent media outlets, political and civic activists, and human rights defenders. Azerbaijan also accounts for about 40% of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/azerbaijan-appoints-first-ever-ambassador-israel-amid-iran-row-2023-01-11/\">Israel\u2019s annual oil imports</a>, thus fuelling the Israeli war machine and being complicit in the genocide in Palestine and Israel\u2019s war crimes in Lebanon. The Azerbaijan-Israel ties are mutually beneficial as the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/04/middleeast/azerbaijan-israel-weapons-mime-intl/index.html\">majority of weapons</a> used by Azerbaijan during the second Nagorno-Karabakh war and likely those used in the September 2023 military operation into the Karabakh region were imported from Israel.</p> <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/05/cop29-summit-to-call-for-peace-between-warring-states-says-host-azerbaijan\">Cop of peace</a>\u201d is one theme chosen for this year\u2019s climate conference by the host, which wants to encourage states to observe a \u201cCop truce\u201d. It is gut-wrenching, to say the least, to talk of global peace after the terrible <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/02/azerbaijan-blockade-of-lachin-corridor-putting-thousands-of-lives-in-peril-must-be-immediately-lifted/\">human rights violations</a> committed by Azerbaijan\u2019s Aliyev regime against ethnic Armenians living in the Nagorno-Karabakh/Artsakh region. Furthermore, Azerbaijan is planning to greenwash its crimes against Armenians by building a \u201c<a href=\"https://crudeaccountability.org/azerbaijans-green-energy-development-serves-the-hydrocarbon-industry/\">Green Energy Zone</a>\u201d on territories where the population has been ethnically cleansed.</p> <p>How did this country get to host the climate summit? It was eastern Europe\u2019s turn. But Russia vetoed EU member states, so the options were either Armenia or Azerbaijan. Armenia lifted its veto against Azerbaijan and supported its bid in exchange for a <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/10/azerbaijans-climate-leadership-challenge/02-cop29-and-troika-opportunity-and-risk-global\">release of prisoners</a>, although a large number of Armenian <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/azerbaijans-mistreatment-armenian-powshuman-trophies-hostages-opinion-1945019\">political prisoners</a> are still being held. Last year, the regime critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/16/british-mps-appeal-azerbaijan-free-detained-academic-gubad-ibadoghlu\">Gubad Ibadoghlu was imprisoned</a> after criticising Azerbaijan\u2019s fossil fuel industry. Other political prisoners include peace activist Bahruz Samadov, ethnic minority researcher Iqbal Abilov, political activists Akif Gurbanov and Ruslan Izzatli and <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur55/8718/2024/en/\">journalists</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the EU continues to buy fossil fuels from Azerbaijan and plans to <a href=\"https://strategicperspectives.eu/eu-gas-insight/\">double its import</a> of fossil gas from the country by 2027.</p> <p>The climate crisis is just as much about protecting human rights as it is about protecting the climate and biodiversity. You cannot claim to care about climate justice if you ignore the sufferings of oppressed and colonised people today. We cannot pick and choose whose human rights to care for, and who to leave behind.

      "bodyText": "During rapidly escalating climate and humanitarian crises, another authoritarian petrostate with no respect for human rights is hosting Cop29 \u2013 the UN\u2019s latest annual climate summit that starts today and is being held after the re-election of a climate-denier US president. Cop meetings have proven to be greenwashing conferences that legitimise countries\u2019 failures to ensure a livable world and future and have also allowed authoritarian regimes like Azerbaijan and the two previous hosts \u2013 the United Arab Emirates and Egypt \u2013 to continue violating human rights. Genocides, ecocides, famines, wars, colonialism, rising inequalities and an escalating climate collapse are all interconnected crises that reinforce each other and lead to unimaginable suffering. While humanitarian crises are unfolding in Palestine, Yemen, Afghanistan, Sudan, Congo, Kurdistan, Lebanon, Balochistan, Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh/Artsakh, and many, many other places, humanity is also breaching the 1.5C greenhouse gas emissions limit, with no signs of real reductions in sight. Instead, the opposite is taking place \u2013 last year, global emissions reached an all-time high. Heat records have been shattered, and this year is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d to be the hottest year ever recorded, with unprecedented extreme weather events pushing the planet further into uncharted territory. The destabilisation of the biosphere and the natural ecosystems we depend on to survive is leading to untold human suffering and further accelerating the mass extinction of flora and fauna. Azerbaijan\u2019s entire economy is built on fossil fuels, with the state-owned oil company Socar\u2019s oil and gas exports accounting for close to 90% of the country\u2019s exports. Despite what it might claim, Azerbaijan has no ambition to take climate action. It is planning to expand fossil fuel production, which is completely incompatible with the 1.5C limit and the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change. Many attenders of this year\u2019s Cop are scared to criticise the Azerbaijan government. Human Rights Watch recently published a statement explaining how it couldn\u2019t be certain that attenders\u2019 rights to peacefully protest would be guaranteed. In addition, Azerbaijan land and sea borders will remain closed during Cop29, making it only possible to travel in and out of the country by air, which causes pollution and which many Azerbaijan citizens can\u2019t afford. The reason given for closing borders at all Cops since the start of the Covid pandemic is to maintain \u201cnational security\u201d, but I\u2019ve heard many Azerbaijanis describe the situation as being \u201ckept in a prison\u201d. The Azerbaijan regime is guilty of ethnic cleansing, humanitarian blockades and war crimes, as well as repressing its own population and cracking down on the country\u2019s civil society. The independent watchdog Freedom House ranks the country as the least democratic state in Europe, with the regime actively targeting journalists, independent media outlets, political and civic activists, and human rights defenders. Azerbaijan also accounts for about 40% of Israel\u2019s annual oil imports, thus fuelling the Israeli war machine and being complicit in the genocide in Palestine and Israel\u2019s war crimes in Lebanon. The Azerbaijan-Israel ties are mutually beneficial as the majority of weapons used by Azerbaijan during the second Nagorno-Karabakh war and likely those used in the September 2023 military operation into the Karabakh region were imported from Israel. The \u201cCop of peace\u201d is one theme chosen for this year\u2019s climate conference by the host, which wants to encourage states to observe a \u201cCop truce\u201d. It is gut-wrenching, to say the least, to talk of global peace after the terrible human rights violations committed by Azerbaijan\u2019s Aliyev regime against ethnic Armenians living in the Nagorno-Karabakh/Artsakh region. Furthermore, Azerbaijan is planning to greenwash its crimes against Armenians by building a \u201cGreen Energy Zone\u201d on territories where the population has been ethnically cleansed. How did this country get to host the climate summit? It was eastern Europe\u2019s turn. But Russia vetoed EU member states, so the options were either Armenia or Azerbaijan. Armenia lifted its veto against Azerbaijan and supported its bid in exchange for a release of prisoners, although a large number of Armenian political prisoners are still being held. Last year, the regime critic Gubad Ibadoghlu was imprisoned after criticising Azerbaijan\u2019s fossil fuel industry. Other political prisoners include peace activist Bahruz Samadov, ethnic minority researcher Iqbal Abilov, political activists Akif Gurbanov and Ruslan Izzatli and journalists. Meanwhile, the EU continues to buy fossil fuels from Azerbaijan and plans to double its import of fossil gas from the country by 2027. The climate crisis is just as much about protecting human rights as it is about protecting the climate and biodiversity. You cannot claim to care about climate justice if you ignore the sufferings of oppressed and colonised people today. We cannot pick and choose whose human rights to care for, and who to leave behind. Climate justice means justice, safety and freedom for everyone. During Cop29, the picture of Azerbaijan reported by the media will be a whitewashed and greenwashed version that the regime is desperate to portray. But make no mistake \u2013 it is a repressive state accused of ethnic cleansing. We need immediate sanctions targeted against the regime and a halt to the import of Azerbaijani fossil fuels. Diplomatic pressure must also be put on the regime to release its Armenian hostages and all political prisoners \u2013 and ensure the right to a safe return for Armenians.

This is because the 2015 Paris agreement requires signatories to establish a new climate finance target by 2025 to help poorer nations manage the impacts of the climate crisis and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>This renewed commitment is called the new collective quantified goal, and it aims to replace the previous pledge of $100bn a year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/17/us-copenhagen-100bn-climate-fund\">made at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit</a>. Wealthier nations only recently began to meet these climate finance goals, which has fuelled scepticism and distrust among countries in urgent need of funding. \u201cClimate finance is absolutely essential for developing countries to tackle the climate crisis,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cWithout substantial investment, significantly reducing global emissions will be impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Kyte, the UK\u2019s new climate envoy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-baku-climate-talks-odour-of-oil-return-of-trump-finance\">told Fiona in an interview</a> that the initial $100bn figure was \u201cplucked out of thin air\u201d \u2013 in sharp contrast to this year\u2019s target, which is based on rigorous research and analysis. The UN climate chief, Simon Stiell, stated that at least $2.4tn is needed annually by 2030 to help developing countries, excluding China, meet climate goals \u2013 about four times the current level of climate finance. \u201cIt\u2019s already blazingly obvious that finance is the make-or-break factor in the world\u2019s climate fight,\u201d he told an audience in February.</p> <p>While this $2.4tn may seem daunting, Fiona notes that nearly half is expected to come from countries\u2019 domestic budgets and private investment, leaving roughly $1tn for wealthier nations to provide.</p> <p>These figures are broadly accepted across developed and developing nations, but governments of wealthy countries are keenly aware of the domestic backlash that a large investment in climate finance could elicit. As a result, a gap will probably persist between the financial needs of developing countries and what wealthier countries are willing to contribute, even though, as Fiona says, evidence clearly shows that \u201cinvesting in emission reductions in developing countries is one of the best investments we can make for the planet, as it benefits us all\u201d. The status quo would be extremely costly anyway \u2013 a report commissioned by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/11/extreme-weather-cost-2tn-globally-over-past-decade-report-finds\">International Chamber of Commerce</a> found that violent weather events cost the world $2tn over the past decade.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Other routes to raise money</strong></p> <p>Developed countries are unlikely to propose much more than a tripling of the current $100bn by 2035 \u2013 less than a third of what developing nations say they need. Much of this funding is expected to flow through multilateral institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, though these organisations will require substantial reform to effectively support climate finance efforts.</p> <p>In addition, \u201cinnovative sources of finance\u201d could help bridge the gap. As Fiona notes, the money is out there, they\u2019ve just got to tap into it. Potential sources include taxes on fossil fuels, global shipping, wealth, levies on high-carbon activities like private jet travel and redirecting the hundreds of billions spent annually on harmful fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies. However, these mechanisms inevitably benefit some groups while disadvantaging others, and will be challenging to implement effectively.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Redefining the blocs</strong></p> <p>Another way of raising the money is opening up the pool of contributors. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which created the list of developed and developing countries, was signed in 1992 \u2013 the global economy has changed dramatically since then.</p> <p>China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are still classed by the US as developing countries. China is now the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world and has the second-largest economy, and many of the Gulf states are hugely oil rich countries. But under the existing rules they still do not have to contribute at all.</p> <p>This issue has long complicated international climate cooperation. The US wants China to leave the \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d bloc and contribute more to climate funding. China, for its part, has accused the US of not contributing its fair share \u2013 a concept that the US rejects.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The Trump effect</strong></p> <p>\u201cA Trump administration is undeniably a disaster for Cop and for global climate action,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cTrump is in the fossil fuel industry\u2019s pocket.\u201d (Earlier this year, the president-elect nakedly proposed that major US oil producers contribute $1bn to his campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/09/trump-oil-ceo-donation\">in exchange for repealing climate protection laws</a>).</p> <p>The pivot away from climate action is already under way. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/climate/trump-transition-epa-interior-energy.html\">The New York Times reported</a> on Friday that Trump\u2019s transition team has prepared a number of executive orders and proclamations that include scrapping every office in every agency working to end the pollution that disproportionately affects poor communities, and withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement.</p> <p>Though the global effort to tackle the climate crisis may be hampered by Trump in the White House, some things may not shift dramatically: for instance, the US was never the most generous contributor to climate finance and has often been reluctant to provide substantial funding. An environmentally hostile Trump administration may not make a huge difference on that front.</p> <p>\u201cThere is however a risk that other countries may now hide behind Trump\u2019s resistance \u2013 he could provide cover for countries that are not that keen on climate action,\u201d Fiona warns. The Biden administration, by contrast, spent years working to bridge divides with China on climate, fostering rare bipartisan cooperation. \u201cThat diplomatic effort won\u2019t survive under Trump.\u201d</p> <p><em>For more reporting from Cop29, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-down-to-earth-newsletter-our-free-environmental-email\">sign up to Down to Earth</a>, the Guardian\u2019s climate newsletter, which will be publishing newsletters twice a week live from Azerbaijan over the course of the conference</em></p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Plans to ban <strong>vaping</strong> have been hailed by campaigners, public health experts and the public.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. It is now \u201cvirtually certain\u201d that 2024 will be the warmest year in recorded history. And just like 2023, the past 12 months have been characterised by extreme weather events \u2013 from cyclones in Australia to wildfires in Brazil to last month\u2019s lethal floods in Spain \u2013 made more intense and more frequent by the climate crisis. Tens of thousands of delegates have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan for Cop29, the UN\u2019s annual climate conference, hoping to chart a course for limiting further damage. This year\u2019s conference opens just days after Donald Trump \u2013 who has dismissed global heating as a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cscam\u201d \u2013 won the US presidential election, casting a long shadow over the 10 days of negotiations ahead. This year\u2019s summit has been dubbed the \u201cfinance Cop\u201d, as the focus will primarily be on how much funding will be directed to developing nations to help them manage climate impacts, reduce emissions and transition to greener economies. Will the world pay up? For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke with Guardian environment editor Fiona Harvey (on her way to Baku) to explore what\u2019s in store at Cop29. But first, the headlines. Five big stories US election | Donald Trump has been declared the winner in Arizona, completing the Republicans\u2019 clean sweep of the so-called swing states and rubbing salt in Democrats\u2019 wounds as it was announced that the president-elect is scheduled to meet with Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the presidential handover. Trump reportedly spoke on the phone with Vladimir Putin on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine, telling the Russian ruler not to escalate the conflict and reminding him of \u201cWashington\u2019s sizeable military presence in Europe\u201d. House of Lords | The Liberal Democrats will try to hijack the government\u2019s bill to ban Lords from inheriting their seats in parliament this week in an attempt to force a vote on an entirely elected upper chamber. MPs are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of the Labour legislation but the Lib Dems want to go drastically further. Immigration and asylum| A Home Office artificial intelligence tool that proposes enforcement action against adult and child migrants could make it too easy for officials to rubberstamp automated life-changing decisions, campaigners have said. Health | The government is likely to offer a financial lifeline to the hospice sector amid fears end-of-life care providers are at risk of closure due to the double blow of the employers\u2019 national insurance rise and higher wage bills, the Guardian understands. Nursing | Increasing numbers of UK-trained nurses are set to leave the profession in England within a decade of registering, in a trend that could jeopardise the government\u2019s overhaul of healthcare, according to a union. In depth: \u2018Trump is in the fossil fuel industry\u2019s pocket\u2019 \u201cThis is the first Cop where finance takes centre stage,\u201d Fiona says. This is because the 2015 Paris agreement requires signatories to establish a new climate finance target by 2025 to help poorer nations manage the impacts of the climate crisis and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This renewed commitment is called the new collective quantified goal, and it aims to replace the previous pledge of $100bn a year made at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit. Wealthier nations only recently began to meet these climate finance goals, which has fuelled scepticism and distrust among countries in urgent need of funding. \u201cClimate finance is absolutely essential for developing countries to tackle the climate crisis,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cWithout substantial investment, significantly reducing global emissions will be impossible.\u201d Rachel Kyte, the UK\u2019s new climate envoy, told Fiona in an interview that the initial $100bn figure was \u201cplucked out of thin air\u201d \u2013 in sharp contrast to this year\u2019s target, which is based on rigorous research and analysis. The UN climate chief, Simon Stiell, stated that at least $2.4tn is needed annually by 2030 to help developing countries, excluding China, meet climate goals \u2013 about four times the current level of climate finance. \u201cIt\u2019s already blazingly obvious that finance is the make-or-break factor in the world\u2019s climate fight,\u201d he told an audience in February. While this $2.4tn may seem daunting, Fiona notes that nearly half is expected to come from countries\u2019 domestic budgets and private investment, leaving roughly $1tn for wealthier nations to provide. These figures are broadly accepted across developed and developing nations, but governments of wealthy countries are keenly aware of the domestic backlash that a large investment in climate finance could elicit. As a result, a gap will probably persist between the financial needs of developing countries and what wealthier countries are willing to contribute, even though, as Fiona says, evidence clearly shows that \u201cinvesting in emission reductions in developing countries is one of the best investments we can make for the planet, as it benefits us all\u201d. The status quo would be extremely costly anyway \u2013 a report commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce found that violent weather events cost the world $2tn over the past decade. *** Other routes to raise money Developed countries are unlikely to propose much more than a tripling of the current $100bn by 2035 \u2013 less than a third of what developing nations say they need. Much of this funding is expected to flow through multilateral institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, though these organisations will require substantial reform to effectively support climate finance efforts. In addition, \u201cinnovative sources of finance\u201d could help bridge the gap. As Fiona notes, the money is out there, they\u2019ve just got to tap into it. Potential sources include taxes on fossil fuels, global shipping, wealth, levies on high-carbon activities like private jet travel and redirecting the hundreds of billions spent annually on harmful fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies. However, these mechanisms inevitably benefit some groups while disadvantaging others, and will be challenging to implement effectively. *** Redefining the blocs Another way of raising the money is opening up the pool of contributors. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which created the list of developed and developing countries, was signed in 1992 \u2013 the global economy has changed dramatically since then. China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are still classed by the US as developing countries. China is now the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world and has the second-largest economy, and many of the Gulf states are hugely oil rich countries. But under the existing rules they still do not have to contribute at all. This issue has long complicated international climate cooperation. The US wants China to leave the \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d bloc and contribute more to climate funding. China, for its part, has accused the US of not contributing its fair share \u2013 a concept that the US rejects. *** The Trump effect \u201cA Trump administration is undeniably a disaster for Cop and for global climate action,\u201d says Fiona. \u201cTrump is in the fossil fuel industry\u2019s pocket.\u201d (Earlier this year, the president-elect nakedly proposed that major US oil producers contribute $1bn to his campaign in exchange for repealing climate protection laws). The pivot away from climate action is already under way. The New York Times reported on Friday that Trump\u2019s transition team has prepared a number of executive orders and proclamations that include scrapping every office in every agency working to end the pollution that disproportionately affects poor communities, and withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement. Though the global effort to tackle the climate crisis may be hampered by Trump in the White House, some things may not shift dramatically: for instance, the US was never the most generous contributor to climate finance and has often been reluctant to provide substantial funding. An environmentally hostile Trump administration may not make a huge difference on that front. \u201cThere is however a risk that other countries may now hide behind Trump\u2019s resistance \u2013 he could provide cover for countries that are not that keen on climate action,\u201d Fiona warns.

Although she had never worked with chocolate before, her husband encouraged her, and the challenge of blending fresh herbs into chocolates became a welcome distraction from her work.

But a government-ordered inquiry into the supermarket sector has provided some interesting insight into Aldi\u2019s profits and strategy as its executives endure hours-long questioning by the consumer watchdog. Here are three things we learned on Monday at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission hearing. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Aldi makes a lot of money Aldi generates about $12bn of annual revenue from its Australian operations, according to testimony at the hearing. While Aldi executives reminded the inquiry that its finances are confidential, the company\u2019s managing director of national buying, Jordan Lack, acknowledged that the $12bn figure was a fair approximation when asked directly by the ACCC\u2019s counsel, Naomi Sharp SC. The figure was provided to the ACCC by Woolworths in its submission to the inquiry. Aldi does disclose some of its financials in regulatory filings as well as tax data via the Australian Taxation Office, but it is rare for it to disclose an updated revenue figure. While revenues don\u2019t take into account costs, the figure still suggests the Australian market, where it now has about 600 stores, is a very profitable one for the discount German retailer. It has carved out a 10% niche in a groceries sector dominated by its more expensive rivals, Coles and Woolworths, which collectively control two-thirds of the market. \u2018Middle aisle\u2019 is a money maker Aldi\u2019s famed middle aisle, where shoppers can buy everything from a bike seat to a lemon tree, doesn\u2019t just create a point of difference from its rivals; it\u2019s also very profitable. The Aldi executive Oliver Bongardt told the hearing that its \u201creceiving margins\u201d for middle aisle items, also known as special buys, is higher than what it generates from other products. This may surprise some shoppers who assume it\u2019s hard to make money by selling air fryers at $59.99. The \u201creceiving margin\u201d reflects the difference between the price that Aldi pays the supplier and the price charged to shoppers. That margin doesn\u2019t, however, take into account any markdowns or unsold items, which means the profitability of middle aisle items is dependent on how many people buy their air fryers from Aldi. While Aldi publishes the price of items in its catalogue online, consumer advocates want it to display the cost of all its groceries to help shoppers conduct price comparisons with Coles and Woolworths before deciding where to shop. Aldi executives told the hearing there was currently a \u201ctechnical limitation\u201d in doing so, but it would aim for all prices to be published online \u201cwithin the next year\u201d. Aldi rejects online shopping Some of Aldi\u2019s cost-saving practices are self-evident, such as minimal shop floor staffing and its insistence that shoppers pack their own bags. Aldi generally has much smaller stores than Coles and Woolworths, with far fewer products, which reduces property and product handling costs. It also heavily relies on selling its own brands. This all helps Aldi charge cheaper prices than Coles and Woolworths, with Choice finding that an Aldi grocery bill is typically about 25% cheaper than an equivalent basket of items at the major chains. However, Aldi is facing challenges that may halt the growth of its market share. While Coles and Woolworths are expanding their online shopping portals to tap into a change in consumer behaviour, Aldi is sticking to in-store-only sales. \u201cWe did an assessment of online and understand that channel to be a costly channel to serve,\u201d Lack told the hearing. \u201cThat comes down to the fact that if you have employees picking the groceries instead of customers doing their own shopping, obviously that is a cost that is incurred.\u201d Aldi representatives also told the hearing it could not operate in all of the locations its rivals do, such as Tasmania and the Northern Territory, because of the \u201ccost to serve those markets\u201d. \u201cWe look at the catchment on the size of the market and what would be required to set up operation, and we made the decision not to enter those markets on that basis,\u201d Lack said. The ACCC is conducting a series of public hearings this month involving executives of all of the major supermarkets as part of its examination into grocery prices and competition in the sector. The regulator is scheduled to provide its final report to the government by the end of February. Separately, the ACCC is suing Coles and Woolworths over allegations they deceived customers with fake discounts.",

Victoria police said the man was working at Golden Plains windfarm on Bells Road in Rokewood, about 133km west of Melbourne and 69km north-west of Geelong. Vestas, the Danish company delivering the first stage of the project, said the 36-year-old man was an installation technician and was from regional Victoria. He was crushed by the blade shortly after 8am on Monday. Ambulance Victoria confirmed paramedics responded to the incident about 8.15am. \u201cFirst responders attempted to revive the man but he was declared deceased at the scene,\u201d police said in a statement. Aerial footage of the site showed three blades laid on the ground, adjacent to the turbine, which appeared to be under construction. At least two cranes could be seen at the site. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The rotor blades used in the project are more than 80 metres long, according to the organisation\u2019s website. Vestas confirmed a subcontractor died after a turbine blade that was on the ground was being prepared for installation. Danny Nielsen, the company\u2019s country head in Australia and New Zealand, said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d for the worker\u2019s family and their colleagues. Nielsen said the company would do \u201ceverything it can to support them during this terrible time as they grieve the loss of a cherished loved one and team member\u201d. \u201cWith workplace safety as our number one priority, the site has been closed and we are working closely with the authorities, including the police and Worksafe Victoria, to investigate what happened and work with the project partners to take steps to prevent it recurring in the future,\u201d he said in a statement. The Australian Workers\u2019 Union said it was \u201cextremely frustrated and angry\u201d after the incident. The union\u2019s Victorian state secretary, Ronnie Hayden, said it was a \u201cdevastating loss\u201d. Hayden said delegates from three unions had met with Vestas management to raise safety concerns two weeks ago. Speaking to reporters near the site on Monday, Nielsen said it was a \u201csad day for the wind community\u201d. He said Vestas met with unions \u201cevery single week\u201d and discussed a \u201cbroad range of matters\u201d. \u201cTo my knowledge, this particular incident had not been discussed in any meeting,\u201d he said. Blades were stored on the ground and there was work that needed to be done before they could be lifted, Nielsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s in that work stream the incident or accident happened.\u201d Nielsen said the site would remain closed over the coming days. The Golden Plains windfarm consists of two farms, East and West, owned by TagEnergy and Ingka Group. The accident appears to have occurred at the East site. Speaking at a press conference in Melbourne, Victoria\u2019s premier, Jacinta Allan, expressed her sympathies and noted the state had strong workplace safety regulations. \u201cAny accident in any workplace is indeed a deep concern and a tragedy,\u201d she said. The state\u2019s WorkSafe minister, Danny Pearson, said it was a \u201cheartbreaking tragedy.\u201d \u201cOur thoughts are with the family of the worker as well as their workmates,\u201d he said.

After October\u2019s budget confirmed above-inflation pay rises for public sector workers and higher taxes on employment, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said there was a growing divide in the outlook for jobs and wages. It said businesses were facing increased costs that could \u201cact as a barrier to growth and could lead to employers offering lower pay rises\u201d, just as the public sector started to benefit from stronger pay after years of restraint. \u201cThis should help support the NHS and the delivery of other key public services in the shorter term,\u201d said James Cockett, a senior labour market economist at the CIPD. \u201cIn contrast to the public sector, anticipated private sector pay awards have plateaued and are likely to face downward pressure following the increase to employer national insurance contributions and to the national minimum wage announced in the budget.\u201d Labour has faced a backlash from large employers after Rachel Reeves announced an increase in employer NICs as one of the largest tax-raising measures. The chancellor also announced that the national living wage would rise by 6.7% to \u00a312.21 an hour in April. Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s last week said the tax rise would cost them \u00a3100m and \u00a3140m respectively as they warned they could pass these costs on in the form of higher prices, while it was reported that Tesco faces a \u00a31bn increase in its NI bill this parliament. The Bank of England has said the budget would drive up inflation to a peak next year while also boosting economic growth. While it said the rise in employer NICs would play a role, it estimated the impact would be small. According to the CIPD, public sector pay expectations had gone from the lowest median annual growth rate (2.5%) to the highest (4%) in just one quarter, with even higher awards of 5% expected in the next three months. In contrast, overall and private sector pay awards over the next three months and 12 months are expected to be 3%. In one of Labour\u2019s first acts in power it accepted the independent public sector pay review bodies\u2019 recommendations of 4.75% to 6%. The Treasury said this was \u201cnot a decision the government took lightly\u201d, and that it was focused on boosting public sector productivity. It added: \u201cAt the budget we set a 2% productivity, efficiency and savings target to boost public sector productivity and are investing more than \u00a32bn in NHS technology and digital to run essential services and drive NHS productivity improvements.\u201d Public sector wage growth typically trails behind the private sector.

The system is being used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/22/uk-asylum-backlog-rose-before-election-despite-sunak-pledge#:~:text=The%20UK's%20asylum%20backlog%20has,at%20the%20end%20of%20March.\">amid</a> a rising caseload of asylum seekers who are subject to removal action, currently about 41,000 people.</p> <p>Migrant rights campaigners called for the Home Office to withdraw the system, claiming it was \u201ctechnology being used to make cruelty and harm more efficient\u201d.</p> <p>A glimpse into the workings of the largely opaque system has become possible after a year-long freedom of information battle, in which redacted manuals and impact assessments were released to the campaign group Privacy International. They also revealed that people whose cases are being processed by the algorithm are not specifically told that AI is involved.</p> <p>The system is one of several AI programmes UK public authorities are deploying as officials seek greater speed and efficiency. There are calls for greater transparency about government AI use in fields ranging from health to welfare.</p> <p>The secretary of state for science, Peter Kyle, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ensuring-trust-in-ai-to-unlock-65-billion-over-next-decade\">said</a> AI had \u201cincredible potential to improve our public services \u2026 but, in order to take full advantage, we need to build trust in these systems\u201d.</p> <p>The Home Office disclosures show the Identify and Prioritise Immigration Cases (IPIC) system is fed an array of personal information about people who are the subject of potential enforcement action, including biometric data, ethnicity and health markers and data about criminal convictions.</p> <p>The purpose is \u201cto create an easier, faster and more effective way for immigration enforcement to identify, prioritise and coordinate the services/interventions needed to manage its caseload\u201d, the documents state.</p> <p>But Privacy International said it feared the system was set up in a way that would lead to human officials \u201crubberstamping\u201d the algorithm\u2019s recommendations for action on a case \u201cbecause it\u2019s so much easier \u2026 than to look critically at a recommendation and reject it\u201d.</p> <p>For officials to reject a proposed decision on \u201creturns\u201d \u2013 sending people back to their home country \u2013 they must give a written explanation and tick boxes relating to the reasons. But to accept the computer\u2019s verdict, no explanation is required and the official clicks one button marked \u201caccept\u2019 and confirms the case has been updated on other Home Office systems, the training manuals show.</p> <p>Asked if this introduced a bias in favour of accepting the AI decision, the Home Office declined to comment.</p> <p>Officials describe IPIC as a rules-based workflow tool that delivers efficiencies for immigration enforcement by recommending to caseworkers the next case or action they should consider. They stressed that every recommendation made in the IPIC system was reviewed by a caseworker who was required to weigh it on its individual merits. The system is also being deployed on cases of EU nationals seeking to remain in the UK under the EU settlement scheme.</p> <p>Jonah Mendelsohn, a lawyer at Privacy International, said the Home Office tool could affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone going through the migration system currently has no way of knowing how the tool has been used in their case and if it is putting them at risk of wrongful enforcement action,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout changes to ensure algorithmic transparency and accountability, the Home Office\u2019s pledge to be \u2018digital by default\u2019 by 2025 will further encode injustices into the immigration system.\u201d</p> <p>Fizza Qureshi, the chief executive of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, called for the tool to be withdrawn and raised concerns the AI could lead to racial bias.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a huge amount of data that is input into IPIC that will mean increased data-sharing with other government departments to gather health information, and suggests this tool will also be surveilling and monitoring migrants, further invading their privacy,\u201d she said.</p> <p>IPIC has been in widespread operation since 2019-20.

      "bodyText": "A Home Office artificial intelligence tool which proposes enforcement action against adult and child migrants could make it too easy for officials to rubberstamp automated life-changing decisions, campaigners have said. As new details of the AI-powered immigration enforcement system emerged, critics called it a \u201crobo-caseworker\u201d that could \u201cencode injustices\u201d because an algorithm is involved in shaping decisions, including returning people to their home countries. The government describes it as a \u201crules-based\u201d rather than AI system, as it does not involve machine-learning from data, and insists it delivers efficiencies by prioritising work and that a human remains responsible for each decision. The system is being used amid a rising caseload of asylum seekers who are subject to removal action, currently about 41,000 people. Migrant rights campaigners called for the Home Office to withdraw the system, claiming it was \u201ctechnology being used to make cruelty and harm more efficient\u201d. A glimpse into the workings of the largely opaque system has become possible after a year-long freedom of information battle, in which redacted manuals and impact assessments were released to the campaign group Privacy International. They also revealed that people whose cases are being processed by the algorithm are not specifically told that AI is involved. The system is one of several AI programmes UK public authorities are deploying as officials seek greater speed and efficiency. There are calls for greater transparency about government AI use in fields ranging from health to welfare. The secretary of state for science, Peter Kyle, said AI had \u201cincredible potential to improve our public services \u2026 but, in order to take full advantage, we need to build trust in these systems\u201d. The Home Office disclosures show the Identify and Prioritise Immigration Cases (IPIC) system is fed an array of personal information about people who are the subject of potential enforcement action, including biometric data, ethnicity and health markers and data about criminal convictions. The purpose is \u201cto create an easier, faster and more effective way for immigration enforcement to identify, prioritise and coordinate the services/interventions needed to manage its caseload\u201d, the documents state. But Privacy International said it feared the system was set up in a way that would lead to human officials \u201crubberstamping\u201d the algorithm\u2019s recommendations for action on a case \u201cbecause it\u2019s so much easier \u2026 than to look critically at a recommendation and reject it\u201d. For officials to reject a proposed decision on \u201creturns\u201d \u2013 sending people back to their home country \u2013 they must give a written explanation and tick boxes relating to the reasons. But to accept the computer\u2019s verdict, no explanation is required and the official clicks one button marked \u201caccept\u2019 and confirms the case has been updated on other Home Office systems, the training manuals show. Asked if this introduced a bias in favour of accepting the AI decision, the Home Office declined to comment. Officials describe IPIC as a rules-based workflow tool that delivers efficiencies for immigration enforcement by recommending to caseworkers the next case or action they should consider. They stressed that every recommendation made in the IPIC system was reviewed by a caseworker who was required to weigh it on its individual merits. The system is also being deployed on cases of EU nationals seeking to remain in the UK under the EU settlement scheme. Jonah Mendelsohn, a lawyer at Privacy International, said the Home Office tool could affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. \u201cAnyone going through the migration system currently has no way of knowing how the tool has been used in their case and if it is putting them at risk of wrongful enforcement action,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout changes to ensure algorithmic transparency and accountability, the Home Office\u2019s pledge to be \u2018digital by default\u2019 by 2025 will further encode injustices into the immigration system.\u201d Fizza Qureshi, the chief executive of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, called for the tool to be withdrawn and raised concerns the AI could lead to racial bias. \u201cThere is a huge amount of data that is input into IPIC that will mean increased data-sharing with other government departments to gather health information, and suggests this tool will also be surveilling and monitoring migrants, further invading their privacy,\u201d she said. IPIC has been in widespread operation since 2019-20. The Home Office refused previous freedom of information inquiries because greater openness \u201ccould be used to circumvent immigration controls by providing insight into how work in the Home Office and immigration enforcement is triaged\u201d. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the use of AI in the immigration system was not inherently wrong, because in theory AI could improve human decision-making rather than replace it. She said: \u201cThe government might well be able to make the case AI is leading to better decision-making and reducing unnecessary detention but without greater transparency we can\u2019t know.\u201d For example if a country such as Iran is unlikely to accept deported nationals, pursuing such cases could be considered a waste of limited enforcement resources. Or if a person\u2019s argument to remain is underpinned by human rights law meaning they are unlikely to be quickly deported, it may be better to prioritise other removals and in doing so avoid taking people into indefinite detention. Home Office documents say the tool is used to \u201cassess the removability and level of harm posed by immigration offenders, automate the identification and prioritisation of cases, and to provide information on the length of time a barrier to removal has been in place\u201d. A new draft data bill was introduced for debate in the UK parliament last month that \u201cwould effectively permit automated decision-making in most circumstances\u201d, according to lawyers. This would be allowed as long as individuals affected can make representations, obtain meaningful human intervention and challenge automated decisions. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 November 2024 to reflect in the headline and through an addition to the third paragraph that the Home Office does not consider its IPIC system to be artificial intelligence because the tool does not learn from the data it receives; AI systems may, however, be described in terms of those that are rules-based and those that use machine-learning.",

Coppice hazel poles are tightly bound in honeysuckle vines. There are deer prints in the rivers-edge sand, and a buzzard takes off from Scots pines high on a cliff on the opposite bank.

We take the path that heads for Staward Gorge, where the ruins of a medieval pele, partly made from recycled Roman stones, stand on top a promontory. The way runs under a steep hillside of ancient semi-natural woodland; we spot indicator species such as sanicle, woodruff, dog violet and wood sage. Tumbled rocks and crashed trees show how frequently the land slips, the emerald green of mossy boulders accentuated by new-dropped russet leaves. The trees are a medley of colours. The pumpkin, lime, turmeric and saffron of beech leaves. Lemon yellow sycamore leaves on wine-red stems. With sunlight behind them, the beech branches are black silhouettes, their illuminated leaves suspended in organised patterns. With shortening days and light levels dropping, trees stop producing chlorophyll. As the green pigment fades and trees withdraw sugars from their leaves, all those reds, oranges, browns and yellows that were always there are suddenly revealed. You can know the science behind it, but still be wowed by the depth and exuberance of the colour. There\u2019s scent too: the earthy smell of decay and the sweet sandalwood of silver birch. Coppice hazel poles are tightly bound in honeysuckle vines. There are deer prints in the rivers-edge sand, and a buzzard takes off from Scots pines high on a cliff on the opposite bank. As we drive home up the twisting ravine, I look back to see fold after wooded fold blazing into the distance. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter/X at @gdncountrydiary \u2022 Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian\u2019s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount",

One senior congressional Democrat said the \u201cuniverse\u201d of the Biden administration\u2019s foreign policy achievements had \u201cgotten smaller\u201d in the last eight to nine months as US influence has waned in Ukraine and in the Middle East.</p> <p>Before the elections, some foreign diplomats stationed in Washington said they were frustrated with the Biden administration\u2019s hesitancy on Ukraine and its slow disbursement of support and lack of willingness to take risks under national security adviser Sullivan.</p> <p>David Kramer, the executive director of the George W Bush Institute and a former state department official who worked on Russia and Ukraine, said: \u201cThe Biden administration deserves credit for the sanctions regime and keeping allies united, providing assistance to Ukraine, but Ukrainians have been incredibly frustrated with the decision-making process and then the provision of assistance, the restrictions that have been imposed, particularly on these long-range weapon systems, and the failure to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join Nato.\u201d </p> <p>As Trump\u2019s uncertain policy on Ukraine comes into greater focus, it appears he is preparing to cut or severely limit aid to Ukraine. He has announced that neither the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley nor the former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, both former administration officials who had been strong advocates for Kyiv, would be part of his administration.

The White House is transferring weapons and up to $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) in remaining aid as quickly as possible to Ukraine while advocates for Kyiv are calling on the White House to repeal restrictions on long-range weaponry and find other sources of funding the war before Donald Trump enters office in January. Ahead of each presidential transition, administration officials repeat the mantra that they serve \u201cone president at a time\u201d and Biden remains in full control of US foreign policy until Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January. But the prospect of a sea change in Ukraine policy under Trump makes it unlikely that any serious changes by Biden will remain in place under the next administration. Biden is expected to host Trump this week at the White House for a high-stakes meeting where the sitting president is expected to urge Trump to continue providing funding to Ukraine, as well as discuss a broad foreign policy agenda on which the two rarely see eye-to-eye. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a television interview this week that Biden would use his final 70 days to tell Trump and Congress, which may see Republican control in both houses, that the \u201cUnited States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe\u201d. Sullivan declined to answer a question about say whether Biden would propose an additional funding bill for Ukraine. Meanwhile a frontrunner for a position in the Trump administration has added doubts that the Trump administration will continue funding for Ukraine. \u201cThe American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation,\u201d said Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered a top contender for secretary of state. It is unlikely the administration can push another aid supplemental promising more money through Congress, but there is still $6bn in outstanding aid that can be dispersed before Biden leaves office. After that, US officials have admitted that Ukraine will mainly have to focus on Europe for its support. The Pentagon has allowed a small number of US defence contractors to work inside Ukraine to maintain and repair F-16s and Patriot missile defence systems. And a new report by the Wall Street Journal says the Pentagon is speeding up delivery of more than 500 missile interceptors to Ukraine before the end of Biden\u2019s term amid concerns that Russia is saving up its own missiles for a massive barrage against Ukrainian cities or energy infrastructure during the winter. Senior US and European officials had made efforts to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d much of the support for Ukraine, moving the authority for deliveries of weapons to Kyiv to Nato in advance of a potential Trump presidency. \u201cIf Trump, in fact, cuts off military aid to Ukraine, the current assistance package only runs to the end of this calendar year exactly, and the Ukrainians can\u2019t fight adequately absent US military support,\u201d said Richard Fontaine, the chief executive of the Centre for a New American Security, a thinktank. \u201cAnd we saw this at the beginning of this year, during that interregnum between packages, the Europeans can\u2019t fill the gaps. The Ukrainians can\u2019t fill all the gaps. \u201cSo if he does do that, then that completely changes the dynamic on the ground, and therefore what the outcome might be,\u201d he said. On a host of questions, from the potential for further aid supplementals, to providing further arms, to presenting an invitation to Nato, to lifting restrictions on long-range strikes into Russia, there appears to be little the administration can do that will have staying power. Ivo Daalder, a former US permanent representative on the Nato council, said: \u201cYou know, whatever, whatever you do in terms of executive orders can be changed the next day.\u201d Pointing to the Biden administration\u2019s limited options on Ukraine, Israel\u2019s conflict in Gaza, and other options during the lame duck period, he added: \u201cSo they\u2019re basically going to tread water. I just really don\u2019t see what, you know, what last, lasting action they can take that Trump cannot reverse.\u201d A Biden administration that prided itself on its foreign policy bona fides now has few successes to point to as it enters its twilight. One senior congressional Democrat said the \u201cuniverse\u201d of the Biden administration\u2019s foreign policy achievements had \u201cgotten smaller\u201d in the last eight to nine months as US influence has waned in Ukraine and in the Middle East. Before the elections, some foreign diplomats stationed in Washington said they were frustrated with the Biden administration\u2019s hesitancy on Ukraine and its slow disbursement of support and lack of willingness to take risks under national security adviser Sullivan. David Kramer, the executive director of the George W Bush Institute and a former state department official who worked on Russia and Ukraine, said: \u201cThe Biden administration deserves credit for the sanctions regime and keeping allies united, providing assistance to Ukraine, but Ukrainians have been incredibly frustrated with the decision-making process and then the provision of assistance, the restrictions that have been imposed, particularly on these long-range weapon systems, and the failure to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join Nato.\u201d As Trump\u2019s uncertain policy on Ukraine comes into greater focus, it appears he is preparing to cut or severely limit aid to Ukraine. He has announced that neither the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley nor the former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, both former administration officials who had been strong advocates for Kyiv, would be part of his administration. And Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr tweeted a video of Volodymyr Zelenskyy with the caption: \u201cPOV: You\u2019re 38 Days from losing your allowance.\u201d With time running out, some advocates for Ukraine have urged more ambitious steps \u2013 in particular lifting the limits on long-range missiles that have prevented Ukraine from using guided missiles to strike targets in the Russian rear. Melinda Haring, a senior advisor at Razom, a nonprofit that sends aid to Ukraine and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty strong consensus that President Biden can ignore his fears of escalation, and that President Putin isn\u2019t going to start a nuclear war as the administrations change. So now is the opportunity to do it. \u201cThe other big opportunity for the Biden administration is to seize and transfer \u2026 $5bn in Russian central bank reserves, and it needs to be done now, in order to make sure that it\u2019s done correctly, and all eyes are on the Biden administration.\u201d As to any movement on a negotiated settlement, analysts and officials have said that any serious negotiations will have to take place under the next president \u2013 with Ukraine likely in a significantly weaker negotiating position. \u201cThe reality is, both Putin and Zelenskyy can no longer worry about what Biden might or might not like, or frankly, the entire administration, because they\u2019re going to be gone in two and a half months,\u201d said Daalder.",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats will attempt to hijack the government\u2019s bill to ban Lords from inheriting their seats in parliament this week in an attempt to force a vote on an entirely elected upper chamber. The government\u2019s hereditary peers bill, which is heading for its committee stage on Tuesday and is likely to clear the House of Commons the same day, will put an end to the tradition and ban the the current 92 lords who inherited their titles from sitting in the second chamber. MPs are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of the legislation but the Lib Dems want to amend the bill in favour of bringing in a totally elected second chamber. It would remove the power of patronage that the prime minister has to recommend new peers, call on the secretary of state to consult on an elected second chamber and commit to bringing forward a draft bill. The practice of appointing peers has led to associates, advisers and friends of prime ministers being sent to the House of Lords, in addition to crossbench peers chosen on merit by the House of Lords appointments commission. Labour said in 2022 it wanted to replaced the House of Lords with an elected second chamber, but by the time of its manifesto this year, its plan was first to abolish hereditary peers and bring in an age limit. The Lib Dems said they wanted to push their amendment to a vote in the Commons on Tuesday, subject to the Speaker deeming it in scope of the bill. Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem Cabinet Office spokesperson, said: \u201cIt is way past time for a proper democratic reform of the House of Lords.

But what are the perils when high-profile roles get recast? How do fans react to a character they love suddenly being played by a different actor? Do replacements ever end up being better? How can this potentially fraught process be done correctly? And what happens if it goes wrong?</p>    <p>Global phenomenon Friends did it swifter than most. In the second episode, Ross\u2019s lesbian ex-wife Carol was played by Anita Barone. She quit to pursue bigger parts and for the rest of the NBC hit\u2019s decade-long run, the recurring role was played by Jane Sibbett. Pregnant at the time, Sibbett screentested for the Rachel role that ultimately went to Jennifer Aniston.</p> <p>\u201cThey knew I was having a baby,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand it would be complicated, but they kept me in mind. When I came home from hospital after giving birth, I got a call asking me to come in the next day and read for Carol. Through my baby haze, I agreed. I said I wanted to play her as very loving \u2013 partly because of the hormones pumping around my body. They said, \u2018Great, go for it.\u2019 Within two days, we were shooting. I didn\u2019t see Anita\u2019s version until much later.\u201d</p> <p>Sibbett is something of a recasting veteran. \u201cI\u2019ve replaced people three times. In fact, I think I\u2019ve replaced Anita twice. I eventually met her at a party and thought, \u2018She\u2019s gonna kill me!\u2019 But we had a great chat. I thanked her for making the choices she did. She was nothing but gracious.\u201d Sibbett relishes taking over roles: \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting challenge. Reinvention is a fun part of being an actor, right? Your director and castmates have already been through it with someone else, so they help. Just leave your ego at the door.\u201d</p> <p>She initially signed up for two episodes. \u201cIt was meant to be a fortnight\u2019s job. I ended up coming back for seven years. Sure, I wasn\u2019t one of the main six but I\u2019m the extra Friend. Maybe the seventh or eighth wheel.\u201d The character made a big impression, not least when Carol married her partner Susan. \u201cSame-sex weddings were rare on TV in 1996. There was some hullabaloo. Two affiliate stations refused to air it. They still trim it out in China. Representation is so integral. To this day, people tell me it opened conversations about their sexuality.\u201d</p> <p>Game of Thrones recast multiple roles across its eight series, with very little fanfare. Changed characters included Daario Naharis, Dickon Tarly, Tommen Baratheon and Gregor \u201cthe Mountain\u201d Clegane \u2013 played by not one but three actors.</p>    <p>However, recasting can backfire. One of the first flops came on 60s supernatural sitcom Bewitched. Dick York played protagonist Samantha\u2019s husband Darrin for five series until deteriorating health forced his departure. He was replaced by Dick Sargent, but viewers struggled to accept him and thought the couple suddenly lacked chemistry. In 80s super-soap Dallas, Barbara Bel Geddes left her role as Miss Ellie Ewing for emergency heart surgery. Donna Reed took over for one season, much to the consternation of viewers, before Bel Geddes was brought back \u2013 a rare case of a performer relinquishing then regaining a role.</p> <p>On film, recasting killed the Flintstones franchise when John \u201cFred\u201d Goodman and Rick \u201cBarney\u201d Moranis were swapped out for the less starry duo of Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin. Rachel Weisz declined to return for The Mummy 3, so was replaced by Maria Bello doing a very dodgy British accent. Superheroes are also regularly refreshed. In Iron Man 2, Terrence Howard was ousted as War Machine in favour of Don Cheadle, due to a salary dispute with Marvel. Two years later, following a difference of vision, Edward Norton gave way to Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. </p> <p>Emmy-nominated casting director Kelly Valentine Hendry assembled the casts of Broadchurch and Fleabag. She says recasting usually happens for prosaic reasons: \u201cI\u2019ve had to recast on both Bridgerton and The Wheel of Time simply due to scheduling conflicts. Shows that do it tend to be massive international pieces where you can\u2019t hold all your performers. With in-demand actors, unavailability issues are inevitable. If you can\u2019t make it work, you might write them out, particularly in fantasy. Get them back for a few days \u2013 and give them a death on-screen!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s more of a minefield when someone problematic is axed. Domestic violence allegations (eventually rejected by a US court) led to Johnny Depp\u2019s exit from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, to the outrage of some fans. Controversy magnet Mel Gibson was ditched from the Chicken Run sequel, with Zachary Levi taking over as Rocky the rooster. On other occasions, it\u2019s the arrival who causes a kerfuffle. When Jessie Cave took over from Jennifer Smith as Lavender Brown for the later Harry Potter films, the franchise was accused of whitewashing, as she is white, while Smith is Black.</p>    <p>Hendry says news of a recasting is often sensationalised. \u201cIt gets reported as some spicy, gossipy situation but the change is never done lightly. If an actor is replaced, it could be for a private reason \u2013 health, mental health, family issues, behavioural problems. Like any job, things are complicated.\u201d</p> <p>Soap operas frequently recast as characters grow up on-screen. EastEnders has seen half a dozen different Ben Mitchells and seven Peter Beales. \u201cShows like The Crown have also made recasting more palatable to viewers,\u201d says Hendry. \u201cThey understand why the passing of time requires an older actor.\u201d</p> <p>Coronation Street stalwart Nick Tilsley was played by Adam Rickitt until Tilsley quit to pursue a pop career. Ben Price took over in 2009 and plays Nick to this day. \u201cYou can\u2019t replicate what\u2019s gone before but you also can\u2019t negate the fictional world you\u2019re entering,\u201d explains Price. \u201cIt\u2019s like Doctor Who. Each incarnation keeps the Whoniverse going but does something different within it. I thought, \u2018All I have to do is form a bond with the Tilsley family, then I\u2019ll be all right.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Audiences are very accepting. They want it to work, just like you do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He chose not to study Rickitt\u2019s version of the role. \u201cYou have to find your own way, one you believe in. Impersonation isn\u2019t acting. I\u2019m sure Robert Pattinson didn\u2019t pore over George Clooney\u2019s Batman. It helped that there was a five-year gap between Adam and me. We\u2019ve all left home, then gone back a few years later and been different.\u201d</p> <p>Recast actors are always prepared for a backlash. \u201cThere\u2019s pastoral care geared towards dealing with any social media onslaught,\u201d says Hendry, \u201cbut viewers usually get over the shock quickly. We recast Francesca Bridgerton when Ruby Stokes was offered a lead in another show. Hannah Dodd picked up the torch wonderfully. If it\u2019s done with respect on all sides, fans treat it likewise. It\u2019s like when someone wants out of a relationship. You\u2019ve got to let them go. Recasting is like good lighting design. You shouldn\u2019t notice it.\u201d Price agrees: \u201cAudiences are very accepting. They want it to work, just like you do. So far it has. Time is the test \u2013 and I\u2019m still here!\u201d</p> <p>Hendry adds: \u201cAnother way of looking at it is, \u2018Why don\u2019t we recast more?\u2019 Some actors are wary of being pigeonholed. They also have you over a barrel once cameras start rolling. Historically, performers have gotten away with bad behaviour because \u2013 what can you do? You\u2019re bound to them. Imagine if that wasn\u2019t the case and viewers just went, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a different actor. That\u2019s OK.\u2019 The public are smarter than we give them credit for.\u201d</p>",

Changed characters included Daario Naharis, Dickon Tarly, Tommen Baratheon and Gregor \u201cthe Mountain\u201d Clegane \u2013 played by not one but three actors. However, recasting can backfire. One of the first flops came on 60s supernatural sitcom Bewitched. Dick York played protagonist Samantha\u2019s husband Darrin for five series until deteriorating health forced his departure. He was replaced by Dick Sargent, but viewers struggled to accept him and thought the couple suddenly lacked chemistry. In 80s super-soap Dallas, Barbara Bel Geddes left her role as Miss Ellie Ewing for emergency heart surgery. Donna Reed took over for one season, much to the consternation of viewers, before Bel Geddes was brought back \u2013 a rare case of a performer relinquishing then regaining a role. On film, recasting killed the Flintstones franchise when John \u201cFred\u201d Goodman and Rick \u201cBarney\u201d Moranis were swapped out for the less starry duo of Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin. Rachel Weisz declined to return for The Mummy 3, so was replaced by Maria Bello doing a very dodgy British accent. Superheroes are also regularly refreshed. In Iron Man 2, Terrence Howard was ousted as War Machine in favour of Don Cheadle, due to a salary dispute with Marvel. Two years later, following a difference of vision, Edward Norton gave way to Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. Emmy-nominated casting director Kelly Valentine Hendry assembled the casts of Broadchurch and Fleabag. She says recasting usually happens for prosaic reasons: \u201cI\u2019ve had to recast on both Bridgerton and The Wheel of Time simply due to scheduling conflicts. Shows that do it tend to be massive international pieces where you can\u2019t hold all your performers. With in-demand actors, unavailability issues are inevitable. If you can\u2019t make it work, you might write them out, particularly in fantasy. Get them back for a few days \u2013 and give them a death on-screen!\u201d It\u2019s more of a minefield when someone problematic is axed. Domestic violence allegations (eventually rejected by a US court) led to Johnny Depp\u2019s exit from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, to the outrage of some fans. Controversy magnet Mel Gibson was ditched from the Chicken Run sequel, with Zachary Levi taking over as Rocky the rooster. On other occasions, it\u2019s the arrival who causes a kerfuffle. When Jessie Cave took over from Jennifer Smith as Lavender Brown for the later Harry Potter films, the franchise was accused of whitewashing, as she is white, while Smith is Black. Hendry says news of a recasting is often sensationalised. \u201cIt gets reported as some spicy, gossipy situation but the change is never done lightly. If an actor is replaced, it could be for a private reason \u2013 health, mental health, family issues, behavioural problems. Like any job, things are complicated.\u201d Soap operas frequently recast as characters grow up on-screen. EastEnders has seen half a dozen different Ben Mitchells and seven Peter Beales. \u201cShows like The Crown have also made recasting more palatable to viewers,\u201d says Hendry. \u201cThey understand why the passing of time requires an older actor.\u201d Coronation Street stalwart Nick Tilsley was played by Adam Rickitt until Tilsley quit to pursue a pop career. Ben Price took over in 2009 and plays Nick to this day. \u201cYou can\u2019t replicate what\u2019s gone before but you also can\u2019t negate the fictional world you\u2019re entering,\u201d explains Price. \u201cIt\u2019s like Doctor Who. Each incarnation keeps the Whoniverse going but does something different within it. I thought, \u2018All I have to do is form a bond with the Tilsley family, then I\u2019ll be all right.\u2019\u201d He chose not to study Rickitt\u2019s version of the role. \u201cYou have to find your own way, one you believe in. Impersonation isn\u2019t acting. I\u2019m sure Robert Pattinson didn\u2019t pore over George Clooney\u2019s Batman. It helped that there was a five-year gap between Adam and me. We\u2019ve all left home, then gone back a few years later and been different.\u201d Recast actors are always prepared for a backlash. \u201cThere\u2019s pastoral care geared towards dealing with any social media onslaught,\u201d says Hendry, \u201cbut viewers usually get over the shock quickly. We recast Francesca Bridgerton when Ruby Stokes was offered a lead in another show. Hannah Dodd picked up the torch wonderfully. If it\u2019s done with respect on all sides, fans treat it likewise. It\u2019s like when someone wants out of a relationship. You\u2019ve got to let them go. Recasting is like good lighting design. You shouldn\u2019t notice it.\u201d Price agrees: \u201cAudiences are very accepting. They want it to work, just like you do. So far it has. Time is the test \u2013 and I\u2019m still here!\u201d Hendry adds: \u201cAnother way of looking at it is, \u2018Why don\u2019t we recast more?\u2019 Some actors are wary of being pigeonholed. They also have you over a barrel once cameras start rolling. Historically, performers have gotten away with bad behaviour because \u2013 what can you do? You\u2019re bound to them. Imagine if that wasn\u2019t the case and viewers just went, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a different actor. That\u2019s OK.\u2019 The public are smarter than we give them credit for.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Cop</strong></h2> <p>Cop29 will be the 29th conference of the parties to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\">UN framework convention on climate change</a> (UNFCCC), the parent treaty to the 2015 Paris agreement. It takes place in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, on the shores of the Caspian Sea, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/29/worlds-first-oil-town-baku-fossil-fuel-legacy-cop29\">some of the world\u2019s first ever oil wells were dug in the mid-19th century</a>. Azerbaijan has a claim to be the world\u2019s first petrostate, and is still dependent on oil and gas for 90% of its export revenues.</p> <p>Delegates will be expected to debate the future of climate finance. Developing countries need large injections of cash, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. Developed countries argue that their taxpayers cannot shoulder the whole burden of providing such investment, and are seeking the recruitment of new donors \u2013 major economies and big emitters such as China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and others \u2013 as well as potential new sources of finance.</p> <h2><strong>NCQG</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/21/bonn-climate-conference-key-takeaways\">core issue for discussion at Cop29 is the NCQG</a>, the new collective quantified goal on climate finance. This refers to the requirement under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/08/the-paris-agreement-five-years-on-is-it-strong-enough-to-avert-climate-catastrophe\">2015 Paris climate agreement</a> for developed countries to provide climate finance to the poor world, to help countries cut their greenhouse gases and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis.</p> <p>Developing countries, excluding China, will need about $2.4tn (\u00a31.84tn) a year in climate finance by 2030, according to a <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/A-Climate-Finance-Framework-IHLEG-Report-2-SUMMARY.pdf\">landmark study by the economists Lord Stern and Vera Songwe</a>, in 2022. But close to half of this is likely to come from countries\u2019 existing budgets and domestic private sector investment, with the rest \u2013 roughly a trillion \u2013 needing to come from international climate finance.</p> <p>Those figures are widely accepted and form the basis of the demands of developing countries for an NCQG that delivers about $1tn to $1.4tn a year by 2035.</p> <p>However, developed countries are unlikely to agree that much more than half of such sums could come from their taxpayers. That leaves a gap of several hundred billion dollars a year needing to be filled from other sources, which could include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/10/world-bank-must-take-quantum-leap-to-tackle-climate-crisis-un-expert-says\">vastly expanded lending from the World Bank</a>, International Monetary Fund and other multilateral development banks; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/24/rich-countries-could-raise-5tn-of-climate-finance-a-year-study-says\">innovative forms of finance</a>, including taxes on wealth, fossil fuels and high-carbon activities. Private sector investment could also play a role.</p> <p>So instead of a single goal, there are likely to be at least two goals, with a narrative that explains how the gap between the two can be filled. Some parties are referring to this as a \u201clayered\u201d goal, with the \u201cquantum\u201d \u2013 the core amount that developed countries will pledge to meet by 2035 \u2013 surrounded by a variety of options that could be invoked to meet the much larger overall goal that is based on poor countries\u2019 actual needs.</p> <p>Another contentious issue is which countries should contribute to climate finance. At climate Cops, there is a stark division between the developed countries, which carry an obligation to provide climate finance, and developing countries, which do not. But since the UNFCCC \u2013 the treaty under which Cops take place \u2013 was signed in 1992, the global economy has undergone vast shifts. Many developing countries are now much richer and have much higher emissions \u2013 including China, now the biggest emitter globally, and India. Meanwhile petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, which have high per capita GDP and boast massive investments overseas, are treated as developing countries on a par with destitute and vulnerable nations such as South Sudan.</p> <p>Rich countries including the US and the EU want to recognise this shift by expanding the number of contributors to climate finance. They face strong resistance, but it is possible a compromise that retained some distinction between historically developed and developing countries could be found. Some countries could end up being both potential contributors, and potential recipients.</p> <h2><strong>$100bn</strong></h2> <p>The only existing climate finance commitment from the rich world to the poor is the totemic \u00a3100bn pledge, which dates back more than a decade. Developing countries were promised, at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fb70c48-ed9b-11de-ba12-00144feab49a\">Copenhagen Cop in 2009</a>, that they would receive at least $100bn a year in climate finance from 2020, from public and private sector sources, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. That promise was not met: at Cop26, it was found that about $80bn was provided in 2019.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/rich-countries-hit-climate-finance-goal-two-years-late-data\">Data from the OECD last year found that the target had finally been achieved</a>, but the delay left many countries with grievances and a lack of trust in the rich world. There are also severe distortions in how the money has been distributed: much of the finance has gone to mitigation efforts in middle-income countries that have relatively little difficulty in attracting private sector investment; little has gone to adaptation and resilience; some finance has been in the form of loans that add to countries\u2019 debt piles; and Africa and the least developed countries have received far less than they need.</p> <p>Developing countries will want the NCQG to avoid these pitfalls.</p> <h2><strong>Loss and damage</strong></h2>    <p>One of the most contentious issues in climate finance has long been known as \u201closs and damage\u201d. This refers to the most devastating ravages of extreme weather, so great that no amount of adaptation can help with them. Examples include hurricanes and typhoons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/05/a-year-on-the-devastating-long-term-effects-of-pakistans-floods-are-revealed\">the devastating floods that hit Pakistan</a> in summer 2022, or the droughts afflicting swathes of Africa.</p> <p>Recovery from such devastation can take years, if it is ever achieved, and the infrastructure of developing countries, services such as health and education, and their chances of improving people\u2019s circumstances can suffer permanent damage. The world\u2019s poorest countries, which have done least to cause the climate crisis, are most at risk.</p> <p>In the past, some experts characterised loss and damage as a form of compensation or reparations for poor countries. However, this was unacceptable to developed and large developing countries, which refused to sign legal agreements potentially leaving them liable for unlimited future costs. So the discussion moved on to loss and damage as a form of rescue and rehabilitation for the countries suffering most, addressing broader social and development issues as well as the immediate impacts of extreme weather.</p> <p>Funds for loss and damage would be included in the overall NCQG, but would have their own administration system, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/05/countries-agree-key-measures-to-fund-most-vulnerable-to-climate-breakdown\">currently being set up under the World Bank</a>, to allow them to be disbursed quickly to countries in need.</p> <h2><strong>Innovative forms of finance</strong></h2> <p>Developing countries need more than $1tn a year in climate finance; developed countries are unlikely to pledge to provide much more than half that. The shortfall could be made up from \u201cinnovative finance\u201d \u2013 new sources of cash that could be turned towards tackling the climate crisis.</p> <p>Some of these are obvious \u2013 for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/28/former-world-leaders-seek-25bn-levy-on-oil-states-revenues-to-pay-for-climate-damage\">taxing fossil fuels</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/07/carbon-pricing-would-raise-trillions-needed-to-tackle-climate-crisis-says-imf\">carbon emissions</a>. Some countries slapped windfall taxes on oil and gas during the bonanza for fossil fuel companies that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and even the staid and conservative International Energy Agency called for such measures.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jun/04/global-rich-pay-more-climate-crisis-architect-paris-deal\">wealth tax on billionaires also has widespread support from activists</a>, though many developed country treasuries are privately hesitant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/28/brazil-radical-plan-tax-global-super-rich-tackle-climate-crisis\">Brazil has proposed a wealth tax of 2% on billionaires</a> that it says would raise $250bn and only affect about 100 families globally.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/17/rich-countries-must-urgently-help-poor-nations-hit-by-climate-crisis-says-v20\">Levies on frequent flyers</a> could be designed to fall only on the rich, or the minority of the global population who make more than one return flight a year. Aviation accounts for about 3% of global emissions, and continues to grow. Imposing a small charge on shipping could also generate billions, could be easily collected, and is especially relevant as many ships are dirty and inefficient, and carry large quantities of fossil fuel around the world.</p> <p>Another idea is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/12/wto-chief-urges-countries-to-prioritise-subsidies-that-tackle-climate-crisis\">repurpose some of the hundreds of billions of subsidies</a> that each year go to harmful agricultural practices, encourage overfishing, or benefit the fossil fuel industries. Carbon trading could also generate useful contributions towards the NCQG, though this is more contentious.</p> <h2><strong>Mitigation</strong></h2> <p>Within the context of the UNFCCC, mitigation always means the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <h2><strong>Adaptation (also sometimes known as resilience)</strong></h2> <p>The world has already warmed by 1.1-1.3C above preindustrial levels, and some of the impacts of the current heating are irreversible, so even if we succeed in cutting emissions drastically, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/14/countries-adapting-too-slowly-to-climate-breakdown-un-warns\">we will still need to adapt to the impacts</a> of more extreme weather.</p> <p>Infrastructure, including transport, telecommunications networks, housing and rural areas will need to be adapted and protected, for instance by building railways less likely to buckle in the heat or roads less likely to melt, and building houses that will not overheat.</p> <p>However, climate finance for adaptation and resilience has lagged far behind that for mitigation, and in the NCQG developing countries will want to see recognition of the need for at least doubling the proportion that goes to meet their adaptation needs.</p> <h2><strong>UNFCCC</strong></h2>    <p>The UN framework convention on climate change, signed in 1992 at the Rio Earth summit, binds all of the world\u2019s countries \u2013 bar a handful of failed states \u2013 to \u201cavoid dangerous climate change\u201d. However, it did not set out in detail how to do so.</p> <h2><strong>Kyoto protocol</strong></h2> <p>The first attempt to turn the UNFCCC\u2019s resolution into action was the 1997 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/kyoto-protocol\">Kyoto protocol</a>, which set targets on emissions cuts for each developed country, stipulating a 5% cut in global greenhouse gases overall by 2012. Developing countries, including China, were allowed to increase their emissions. However, the protocol immediately ran into trouble when the US, which signed the treaty under Bill Clinton, could not ratify it owing to opposition in Congress.</p> <p>The protocol eventually came into force without US backing in 2005, but by then was largely irrelevant, so countries set out on the long journey to a new treaty that would fulfil the UNFCCC aims, resulting in the 2015 Paris accord.</p> <h2><strong>The Paris agreement</strong></h2>    <p>Forged at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">historic summit</a> in December 2015, this marked the first time developed and developing countries agreed to limit greenhouse gases in order to stay within set temperature limits. The main goal of the Paris agreement is to limit global heating to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C above preindustrial levels, while \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to stay within the lower, safer threshold of 1.5C. Countries set out targets to stay within those limits, in the form of nationally determined contributions (NDCs).</p> <h2><strong>NDCs</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/03/climate-change-what-is-the-uks-ndc-and-why-is-it-important\">Nationally determined contributions</a> are national plans containing targets on emissions cuts, usually pegged to 2030, and some details on how they will be met. They form the heart of the Paris agreement. In the negotiations leading up to the Paris summit, countries were reluctant to accept \u201ctop-down\u201d targets such as those contained in the Kyoto protocol, which set a global goal for emissions reduction then divided up the cuts needed among the developed countries. Instead, they opted for each government offering the emissions reductions it thought feasible.</p> <p>However, this resulted in a set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">NDCs submitted at Paris that would result in catastrophic heating</a> of more than 3C. So the Paris agreement contains a \u201cratchet\u201d mechanism by which every five years countries must return to the negotiating table with fresh commitments, to bring emissions in line with the overarching temperature targets.</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/15/ratchets-phase-downs-and-a-fragile-agreement-how-cop26-played-out\">Cop26 in Glasgow, countries agreed to hasten the ratchet</a>, asking for new pledges every year instead of just every five years. That has not really happened, however: the next round of NDCs will be expected next year, at Cop30 in Brazil.</p> <h2><strong>1.5C</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">Paris agreement</a> contains two key goals, of limiting global heating to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C, while \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. These temperature goals have their roots in reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The 2007 IPCC fourth assessment report suggested the world was likely to warm by at least 1.8C, even if measures were taken to limit emissions, and by 4C if emissions went untrammelled. Keeping warming to about 2C was regarded as the outer limit of safety, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown \u2013 heatwaves, droughts, floods, sea-level rises, fiercer storms and other extreme weather \u2013 would become catastrophic and irreversible.</p> <p>Some big emitters, including China, argued 2C was the only realistic limit and opting for a lower goal would be economically difficult. However, small island states pointed to science showing they were likely to be inundated by sea-level rises and storm surges at warming above 1.5C. The conflict was eventually resolved in the compromise of two goals at Paris. A further <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">IPCC report in 2018</a> found extreme weather and severe impacts from even a 1.5C rise, so for Cop26 the UK hosts made \u201ckeeping 1.5C alive\u201d the core aim of the conference.</p> <p>Temperatures have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/jan/04/is-2024-going-to-be-the-first-full-year-to-breach-15c-of-warming\">already breached the 1.5C limit</a>, though not for long. Most climate scientists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/08/world-scientists-climate-failure-survey-global-temperature\">surveyed by the Guardian this year</a>, believe that the 1.5C limit is already out of reach. However, many experts argue the target should be kept as the global aim, in order to try to ensure any overshoot is as small as possible.</p> <h2><strong>Net zero</strong></h2> <p>This basically means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and then offsetting any remaining irreducible emissions \u2013 for instance, from industrial processes that emit CO<sub>2</sub>, or sectors such as aviation where alternative technologies are not available \u2013 by fostering carbon sinks, such as forests. The concept has come under attack from campaigners who argue that some companies and governments are using net zero as a fig leaf by assuming they can offset emissions rather than reduce them.</p> <h2><strong>IPCC</strong></h2> <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, first convened by the UN and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988, has produced five comprehensive assessment reports since, each increasing in certainty and reinforcing the message that the climate crisis, caused by human actions that increase the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is accelerating.</p> <p>The latest IPCC report, the sixth, has been published: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/aug/09/humans-have-caused-unprecedented-and-irreversible-change-to-climate-scientists-warn\">first instalment</a>, on the physical science of the changing climate, was released in August 2021, delivering the starkest warning yet of the calamity we face. It found the climate crisis was \u201cunequivocally\u201d the result of human actions, was putting in changes that in some cases were already \u201cirreversible\u201d, and that some of those changes were \u201cunprecedented\u201d in hundreds of thousands of years. The second and third parts, published in 2022, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/ipcc-issues-bleakest-warning-yet-impacts-climate-breakdown\">warned that the 1.5C goal was slipping out of reach</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/ipcc-report-now-or-never-if-world-stave-off-climate-disaster\">that it was \u201cnow or never\u201d for climate action</a>.</p> <p>The IPCC has been criticised for giving too conservative a view of climate science \u2013 its key findings, in the \u201csummary for policymakers\u201d, are subject to approval and amendment by governments before publication, which some say means they are unduly weakened.</p> <h2><strong>Methane</strong></h2> <p>A powerful greenhouse gas, which can trap heat in the atmosphere about 80 times more effectively than CO<sub>2</sub>. Whereas CO<sub>2 </sub>lingers in the atmosphere for about a century once released, methane degrades in a couple of decades to CO<sub>2</sub>. It comes from leaking fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and shale gas wells, and from animal husbandry and other agriculture. Many countries are hoping for progress on methane at Cop29, and particularly new commitments from China, a major emitter of the gas.</p> <h2><strong>SLCPs</strong></h2> <p>Short-lived climate pollutants. These are compounds such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot.

      "bodyText": "Cop Cop29 will be the 29th conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), the parent treaty to the 2015 Paris agreement. It takes place in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, on the shores of the Caspian Sea, where some of the world\u2019s first ever oil wells were dug in the mid-19th century. Azerbaijan has a claim to be the world\u2019s first petrostate, and is still dependent on oil and gas for 90% of its export revenues. Delegates will be expected to debate the future of climate finance. Developing countries need large injections of cash, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. Developed countries argue that their taxpayers cannot shoulder the whole burden of providing such investment, and are seeking the recruitment of new donors \u2013 major economies and big emitters such as China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and others \u2013 as well as potential new sources of finance. NCQG The core issue for discussion at Cop29 is the NCQG, the new collective quantified goal on climate finance. This refers to the requirement under the 2015 Paris climate agreement for developed countries to provide climate finance to the poor world, to help countries cut their greenhouse gases and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis. Developing countries, excluding China, will need about $2.4tn (\u00a31.84tn) a year in climate finance by 2030, according to a landmark study by the economists Lord Stern and Vera Songwe, in 2022. But close to half of this is likely to come from countries\u2019 existing budgets and domestic private sector investment, with the rest \u2013 roughly a trillion \u2013 needing to come from international climate finance. Those figures are widely accepted and form the basis of the demands of developing countries for an NCQG that delivers about $1tn to $1.4tn a year by 2035. However, developed countries are unlikely to agree that much more than half of such sums could come from their taxpayers. That leaves a gap of several hundred billion dollars a year needing to be filled from other sources, which could include vastly expanded lending from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other multilateral development banks; and innovative forms of finance, including taxes on wealth, fossil fuels and high-carbon activities. Private sector investment could also play a role. So instead of a single goal, there are likely to be at least two goals, with a narrative that explains how the gap between the two can be filled. Some parties are referring to this as a \u201clayered\u201d goal, with the \u201cquantum\u201d \u2013 the core amount that developed countries will pledge to meet by 2035 \u2013 surrounded by a variety of options that could be invoked to meet the much larger overall goal that is based on poor countries\u2019 actual needs. Another contentious issue is which countries should contribute to climate finance. At climate Cops, there is a stark division between the developed countries, which carry an obligation to provide climate finance, and developing countries, which do not. But since the UNFCCC \u2013 the treaty under which Cops take place \u2013 was signed in 1992, the global economy has undergone vast shifts. Many developing countries are now much richer and have much higher emissions \u2013 including China, now the biggest emitter globally, and India. Meanwhile petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, which have high per capita GDP and boast massive investments overseas, are treated as developing countries on a par with destitute and vulnerable nations such as South Sudan. Rich countries including the US and the EU want to recognise this shift by expanding the number of contributors to climate finance. They face strong resistance, but it is possible a compromise that retained some distinction between historically developed and developing countries could be found. Some countries could end up being both potential contributors, and potential recipients. $100bn The only existing climate finance commitment from the rich world to the poor is the totemic \u00a3100bn pledge, which dates back more than a decade. Developing countries were promised, at the Copenhagen Cop in 2009, that they would receive at least $100bn a year in climate finance from 2020, from public and private sector sources, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. That promise was not met: at Cop26, it was found that about $80bn was provided in 2019. Data from the OECD last year found that the target had finally been achieved, but the delay left many countries with grievances and a lack of trust in the rich world. There are also severe distortions in how the money has been distributed: much of the finance has gone to mitigation efforts in middle-income countries that have relatively little difficulty in attracting private sector investment; little has gone to adaptation and resilience; some finance has been in the form of loans that add to countries\u2019 debt piles; and Africa and the least developed countries have received far less than they need. Developing countries will want the NCQG to avoid these pitfalls. Loss and damage One of the most contentious issues in climate finance has long been known as \u201closs and damage\u201d. This refers to the most devastating ravages of extreme weather, so great that no amount of adaptation can help with them. Examples include hurricanes and typhoons, the devastating floods that hit Pakistan in summer 2022, or the droughts afflicting swathes of Africa. Recovery from such devastation can take years, if it is ever achieved, and the infrastructure of developing countries, services such as health and education, and their chances of improving people\u2019s circumstances can suffer permanent damage. The world\u2019s poorest countries, which have done least to cause the climate crisis, are most at risk. In the past, some experts characterised loss and damage as a form of compensation or reparations for poor countries. However, this was unacceptable to developed and large developing countries, which refused to sign legal agreements potentially leaving them liable for unlimited future costs. So the discussion moved on to loss and damage as a form of rescue and rehabilitation for the countries suffering most, addressing broader social and development issues as well as the immediate impacts of extreme weather. Funds for loss and damage would be included in the overall NCQG, but would have their own administration system, currently being set up under the World Bank, to allow them to be disbursed quickly to countries in need. Innovative forms of finance Developing countries need more than $1tn a year in climate finance; developed countries are unlikely to pledge to provide much more than half that. The shortfall could be made up from \u201cinnovative finance\u201d \u2013 new sources of cash that could be turned towards tackling the climate crisis. Some of these are obvious \u2013 for instance, taxing fossil fuels, or carbon emissions. Some countries slapped windfall taxes on oil and gas during the bonanza for fossil fuel companies that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and even the staid and conservative International Energy Agency called for such measures. A wealth tax on billionaires also has widespread support from activists, though many developed country treasuries are privately hesitant. Brazil has proposed a wealth tax of 2% on billionaires that it says would raise $250bn and only affect about 100 families globally. Levies on frequent flyers could be designed to fall only on the rich, or the minority of the global population who make more than one return flight a year. Aviation accounts for about 3% of global emissions, and continues to grow. Imposing a small charge on shipping could also generate billions, could be easily collected, and is especially relevant as many ships are dirty and inefficient, and carry large quantities of fossil fuel around the world. Another idea is to repurpose some of the hundreds of billions of subsidies that each year go to harmful agricultural practices, encourage overfishing, or benefit the fossil fuel industries. Carbon trading could also generate useful contributions towards the NCQG, though this is more contentious. Mitigation Within the context of the UNFCCC, mitigation always means the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Adaptation (also sometimes known as resilience) The world has already warmed by 1.1-1.3C above preindustrial levels, and some of the impacts of the current heating are irreversible, so even if we succeed in cutting emissions drastically, we will still need to adapt to the impacts of more extreme weather. Infrastructure, including transport, telecommunications networks, housing and rural areas will need to be adapted and protected, for instance by building railways less likely to buckle in the heat or roads less likely to melt, and building houses that will not overheat. However, climate finance for adaptation and resilience has lagged far behind that for mitigation, and in the NCQG developing countries will want to see recognition of the need for at least doubling the proportion that goes to meet their adaptation needs. UNFCCC The UN framework convention on climate change, signed in 1992 at the Rio Earth summit, binds all of the world\u2019s countries \u2013 bar a handful of failed states \u2013 to \u201cavoid dangerous climate change\u201d. However, it did not set out in detail how to do so. Kyoto protocol The first attempt to turn the UNFCCC\u2019s resolution into action was the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which set targets on emissions cuts for each developed country, stipulating a 5% cut in global greenhouse gases overall by 2012. Developing countries, including China, were allowed to increase their emissions. However, the protocol immediately ran into trouble when the US, which signed the treaty under Bill Clinton, could not ratify it owing to opposition in Congress. The protocol eventually came into force without US backing in 2005, but by then was largely irrelevant, so countries set out on the long journey to a new treaty that would fulfil the UNFCCC aims, resulting in the 2015 Paris accord. The Paris agreement Forged at a historic summit in December 2015, this marked the first time developed and developing countries agreed to limit greenhouse gases in order to stay within set temperature limits. The main goal of the Paris agreement is to limit global heating to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C above preindustrial levels, while \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to stay within the lower, safer threshold of 1.5C. Countries set out targets to stay within those limits, in the form of nationally determined contributions (NDCs). NDCs Nationally determined contributions are national plans containing targets on emissions cuts, usually pegged to 2030, and some details on how they will be met. They form the heart of the Paris agreement. In the negotiations leading up to the Paris summit, countries were reluctant to accept \u201ctop-down\u201d targets such as those contained in the Kyoto protocol, which set a global goal for emissions reduction then divided up the cuts needed among the developed countries. Instead, they opted for each government offering the emissions reductions it thought feasible. However, this resulted in a set of NDCs submitted at Paris that would result in catastrophic heating of more than 3C. So the Paris agreement contains a \u201cratchet\u201d mechanism by which every five years countries must return to the negotiating table with fresh commitments, to bring emissions in line with the overarching temperature targets. At Cop26 in Glasgow, countries agreed to hasten the ratchet, asking for new pledges every year instead of just every five years. That has not really happened, however: the next round of NDCs will be expected next year, at Cop30 in Brazil. 1.5C The Paris agreement contains two key goals, of limiting global heating to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C, while \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. These temperature goals have their roots in reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The 2007 IPCC fourth assessment report suggested the world was likely to warm by at least 1.8C, even if measures were taken to limit emissions, and by 4C if emissions went untrammelled. Keeping warming to about 2C was regarded as the outer limit of safety, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown \u2013 heatwaves, droughts, floods, sea-level rises, fiercer storms and other extreme weather \u2013 would become catastrophic and irreversible. Some big emitters, including China, argued 2C was the only realistic limit and opting for a lower goal would be economically difficult. However, small island states pointed to science showing they were likely to be inundated by sea-level rises and storm surges at warming above 1.5C. The conflict was eventually resolved in the compromise of two goals at Paris. A further IPCC report in 2018 found extreme weather and severe impacts from even a 1.5C rise, so for Cop26 the UK hosts made \u201ckeeping 1.5C alive\u201d the core aim of the conference. Temperatures have already breached the 1.5C limit, though not for long. Most climate scientists, surveyed by the Guardian this year, believe that the 1.5C limit is already out of reach. However, many experts argue the target should be kept as the global aim, in order to try to ensure any overshoot is as small as possible. Net zero This basically means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and then offsetting any remaining irreducible emissions \u2013 for instance, from industrial processes that emit CO2, or sectors such as aviation where alternative technologies are not available \u2013 by fostering carbon sinks, such as forests. The concept has come under attack from campaigners who argue that some companies and governments are using net zero as a fig leaf by assuming they can offset emissions rather than reduce them. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, first convened by the UN and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988, has produced five comprehensive assessment reports since, each increasing in certainty and reinforcing the message that the climate crisis, caused by human actions that increase the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is accelerating. The latest IPCC report, the sixth, has been published: the first instalment, on the physical science of the changing climate, was released in August 2021, delivering the starkest warning yet of the calamity we face. It found the climate crisis was \u201cunequivocally\u201d the result of human actions, was putting in changes that in some cases were already \u201cirreversible\u201d, and that some of those changes were \u201cunprecedented\u201d in hundreds of thousands of years. The second and third parts, published in 2022, warned that the 1.5C goal was slipping out of reach, and that it was \u201cnow or never\u201d for climate action. The IPCC has been criticised for giving too conservative a view of climate science \u2013 its key findings, in the \u201csummary for policymakers\u201d, are subject to approval and amendment by governments before publication, which some say means they are unduly weakened. Methane A powerful greenhouse gas, which can trap heat in the atmosphere about 80 times more effectively than CO2. Whereas CO2 lingers in the atmosphere for about a century once released, methane degrades in a couple of decades to CO2. It comes from leaking fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and shale gas wells, and from animal husbandry and other agriculture. Many countries are hoping for progress on methane at Cop29, and particularly new commitments from China, a major emitter of the gas. SLCPs Short-lived climate pollutants. These are compounds such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot. They degrade or fall out of the atmosphere more quickly than CO2, but while they are active can play a major role in heating the atmosphere, so actions to reduce them could buy humanity some time in cutting warming sooner. For example, moves to drastically limit methane could reduce warming by as much as 0.2C, according to some estimates. Soot stains white snow and ice, and the dark surfaces absorb more heat, in a feedback loop. Hydrofluorocarbons are substitutes for the ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, but they have a high warming potential, with some capable of trapping more than 11,000 times as much heat as CO2. Carbon offsetting CO2 has the same impact on the climate no matter where it is emitted and what the source, so if a tonne of CO2 can be absorbed from the atmosphere in one part of the world it should cancel out a tonne of the gas emitted in another. So, in theory, companies, governments and individuals can cancel out the impact of some of their emissions by investing in projects that reduce or store carbon \u2013 forest preservation and tree planting are among them, but carbon credits are also awarded for projects that reduce fossil fuels in other ways, such as windfarms, solar cookstoves or better farming methods. The practice has been controversial. At Cop29, countries will discuss article 6 of the Paris agreement, which allows for carbon trading among signatories, and which could be one of the sources of innovative finance under discussion for the NCQG. UAE Consensus and paragraph 28 Cop28 in Dubai in 2023 made a historic commitment to \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels. Though this may seem a weak formulation, and carries no deadline for its achievement, the resolution points towards the need for an eventual phase-out of fossil fuels, and was the first time that such a commitment has been made by all countries. Some governments, including Saudi Arabia and other members of the \u201clike-minded developing countries\u201d grouping, have since tried to unpick or row back from this commitment, and it may come under attack at Cop29. The \u201ctransition away\u201d wording came in paragraph 28 of the Cop28 decision (of decision 1/CMA.5, to give its full technical location), and is a key part of the \u201cUAE Consensus\u201d, the name given to the outcome of last year\u2019s Cop. Other key elements to the consensus are resolutions on tripling renewable energy and doubling of energy efficiency by 2030. Troika One innovation for Cop29 is the formation of the \u201ctroika\u201d, made up of the current presidency, Azerbaijan; the last presidency, UAE; and the next presidency, Brazil. The troika is supposed to provide continuity and consistency among presidencies, and help countries hosting the conference to learn from each other. Some have whispered that relations between UAE and Azerbaijan have been strained at times, with suggestions that UAE is seeking to hog the limelight for its own ends, and that the pair may be rivals as much as partners; and though there have been periodic public announcements from the three, it is difficult to discern how much the new structure has achieved in substance. However, Brazil has taken advantage of the troika to keep hammering home its own message: that next year\u2019s Cop30 must produce the emissions cuts needed to stave off the worst of the climate catastrophe. Cop30 Nations will meet next November in Bel\u00e9m, a city near the mouth of the Amazon in Brazil, for the next iteration of the 30 years of UN climate negotiations. Brazil hosted the Rio conference in 1992 at which the UNFCCC, the UN Convention on Biodiversity and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification were signed. At Cop30, the key task will be a new round of NDCs that measure up to the globally agreed goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. It will represent humanity\u2019s last chance of staying within that crucial threshold.",

      "body": "<p>All is not well with the waters of Lake Kariba, the world\u2019s largest human-made lake. A punishing drought has drained the huge reservoir close to record lows, raising the prospect that the Kariba Dam, which powers the economies of Zambia and Zimbabwe, may have to shut down for the first time in its 65-year history.</p> <p>Under the heat of the dry-season sun, the lake looks vast, serene. But, earlier this year, a severe effect of El Ni\u00f1o caused the worst mid-rainy season dry spell in southern Africa in a century.</p> <p>That has led to authorities rationing the water allowed to flow through the dam and, in recent months, power cuts of up to 21 hours a day in Zambia on the lake\u2019s northern side and 17 hours in Zimbabwe to the south.</p> <p>The load shedding is devastating livelihoods and hitting the countries\u2019 already weak economies \u2013 Zambia is still recovering from a drawn-out debt restructuring and Zimbabwe is throttled by chronically high inflation. Average temperatures have already been rising in recent decades in both countries as climate breakdown takes hold.</p>    <p>\u201cThis is the worst [it\u2019s ever been],\u201d said Cephas Museba, the manager of the hydropower plant on Zambia\u2019s side of the lake, who has worked for the country\u2019s national power company, Zesco, since 2005.</p> <p>He pointed out concrete beams that were usually under the reservoir\u2019s surface. On the other side of the dam, below its 128-metre high concrete wall, were dark brown rocks rising in an island from the Zambezi River, which forms the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. \u201cEverything brown there, down there, is supposed to be under water,\u201d Museba said. \u201cAll the year.\u201d</p> <p>The Kariba Dam was built between 1955 and 1959, when Zimbabwe and Zambia were still under British colonial rule. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother presided over its official opening in 1960, after an estimated 80 to 100 workers were killed during its construction.</p> <p>The flooding of the land behind the dam, creating the roughly 150 mile-long lake, displaced about 57,000 people. About 6,000 large animals were rescued from the rising waters, an effort known as Operation Noah.</p>    <p>Now, the Zambezi River Authority splits the allocation of the water flowing into the 180bn cubic metre reservoir between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe\u2019s 1,050MW power station accounts for about 38% of the country\u2019s generating capacity.

      "bodyText": "All is not well with the waters of Lake Kariba, the world\u2019s largest human-made lake. A punishing drought has drained the huge reservoir close to record lows, raising the prospect that the Kariba Dam, which powers the economies of Zambia and Zimbabwe, may have to shut down for the first time in its 65-year history. Under the heat of the dry-season sun, the lake looks vast, serene. But, earlier this year, a severe effect of El Ni\u00f1o caused the worst mid-rainy season dry spell in southern Africa in a century. That has led to authorities rationing the water allowed to flow through the dam and, in recent months, power cuts of up to 21 hours a day in Zambia on the lake\u2019s northern side and 17 hours in Zimbabwe to the south. The load shedding is devastating livelihoods and hitting the countries\u2019 already weak economies \u2013 Zambia is still recovering from a drawn-out debt restructuring and Zimbabwe is throttled by chronically high inflation. Average temperatures have already been rising in recent decades in both countries as climate breakdown takes hold. \u201cThis is the worst [it\u2019s ever been],\u201d said Cephas Museba, the manager of the hydropower plant on Zambia\u2019s side of the lake, who has worked for the country\u2019s national power company, Zesco, since 2005. He pointed out concrete beams that were usually under the reservoir\u2019s surface. On the other side of the dam, below its 128-metre high concrete wall, were dark brown rocks rising in an island from the Zambezi River, which forms the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. \u201cEverything brown there, down there, is supposed to be under water,\u201d Museba said. \u201cAll the year.\u201d The Kariba Dam was built between 1955 and 1959, when Zimbabwe and Zambia were still under British colonial rule. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother presided over its official opening in 1960, after an estimated 80 to 100 workers were killed during its construction. The flooding of the land behind the dam, creating the roughly 150 mile-long lake, displaced about 57,000 people. About 6,000 large animals were rescued from the rising waters, an effort known as Operation Noah. Now, the Zambezi River Authority splits the allocation of the water flowing into the 180bn cubic metre reservoir between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe\u2019s 1,050MW power station accounts for about 38% of the country\u2019s generating capacity. Zambia\u2019s 1,080MW counterpart represents about a third. In Zambia\u2019s underground power station, Museba pointed out six big metal cylinders hosting the power station\u2019s turbines. But only one turbine was being run at partial capacity to conserve water. \u201cMy preference is to run two units, because if you\u2019re running one and it trips because of a fault, then you risk going into a blackout,\u201d Museba said, his steady manner not quite masking the concern. \u201cThe other years when we were hit with drought, we were remaining with at least two machines.\u201d The drought has also wiped out crops, with hunger stalking much of southern Africa. Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have declared a national disaster and parts of Angola and Mozambique are also affected. In Zimbabwe, small businesses are struggling to survive without a regular power supply. \u201cSometimes I fail to meet orders because of the lack of electricity,\u201d said Handsome Maurukira, who owns a small metalworking business on the outskirts of Harare. He said he was spending about $400 a month on diesel and only just staying afloat. On Lake Kariba\u2019s Zimbabwe shoreline, fishers said they were lucky to catch even one 25kg crate of kapenta, a slim silver fish smaller than a finger. Before, they would pull in a tonne every night. \u201cThe situation is getting worse. The water levels are dropping. Sometimes you see an island where you normally should not see an island,\u201d said Peter Mashonga, a 64-year-old boat captain. \u201cThis is not the first time for the lake to drop. But, the way it has dropped now, it is worse than in 1996, when it last happened.\u201d \u201cWe ask God to give us rain this year because things are not looking well for the future of fishing,\u201d said Pride Dzomba, a fisher. Zimbabwe\u2019s economic growth is expected to slump this year to 2% from 5.3% in 2023. In October, the International Monetary Fund cut its 2024 forecast for Zambia\u2019s growth from 2.3% to 1.2%. Blame has been flying around Zambia, with disgruntled citizens and opposition politicians claiming that Zesco, which started power cuts in March, could have done more to conserve power earlier in the year. The rainy season was even worse than the company forecast, said Wesley Lwiindi, Zesco\u2019s director of power generation. There was an agreement, though, that more diverse power sources were needed \u2013 and that this was a lesson that should have been learned from droughts in 2015 and 2019. New coal and solar plants are now being built in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Zambia\u2019s government also wants to add hydroelectric dams to rivers in its wetter north-west. Jito Kayumba, a special adviser to Zambia\u2019s president, said: \u201cThis is not particularly good news for promoters of sustainability and matters of climate, but we are doubling down on coal \u2026 because we do have an abundance of coal. \u201c[Coal] will still represent a minor piece of our energy mix. We still want to enhance more renewable sources of electricity. But we also realise that we do need energy security.\u201d Back at Kariba Dam, on 18 October Museba said the reservoir\u2019s depth \u2013 then 77cm away from requiring the power station to be closed down completely \u2013 was falling at a rate of 1cm a day. The Zambezi River\u2019s catchment area usually starts to get rain around October and November, taking two to three months to reach the dam downriver. This year, thankfully, Zambia\u2019s November-to-April rainy season is forecast to be normal, Museba said.

Rosie, 25, said she had been walking a forested route near the Portuguese town of Tomar earlier this year when she spotted a man with no trousers on.

She fled as quickly as she could, her pace slowed by her 10kg (22lb) backpack.</p> <p>She tried to call the police but the signal was too weak to get through. She dialled again, her voice panic-struck as she explained in English that she was worried that the man might be following her.

Portuguese police told the Guardian that since 2023 they had received five reports from pilgrims, all of them related to incidents of exhibitionism. None of the suspects were identified and no arrests were made, but patrols had been stepped up.</p> <p>After her experience, other pilgrims opened up to her. \u201cIt was just happening everywhere around us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s being looked at like an isolated incident, whereas I just know so many other people that things had happened to \u2013 it\u2019s not an isolated issue.\u201d</p>    <p>In May of last year, Martine Bergeron, a Canadian, was slowly making her way from the Spanish town of Lezama to Bilbao when she glanced up to the path ahead of her. \u201cAnd what do I see?

She started walking with other people whenever possible, but the sense of insecurity lingered. While the incident would not deter her from returning to the Camino, she said next time she would steel herself for the kinds of situations that could arise.</p> <p>When 27-year-old Yasmina set off to do the pilgrimage trail by herself last year, she was already anxious about being alone in remote areas. As her trip approached, she sought to talk herself out of her fears. \u201cI was like, so many women have done this before and I can do this alone as well.\u201d</p> <p>Her fears proved to be well founded, however. While walking towards the Spanish town of Astorga, Yasmina came across a man, his face hidden by a tree, who started to masturbate as she passed by.</p> <p>Hours later in her hostel, she replayed the scene over in her head, worried that the man she had seen was a fellow pilgrim. \u201cIs this someone who is going to sleep at the same hostel as me tonight? Or were they still walking the trail?\u201d</p> <p>The next morning she knew she did not feel safe enough to get back on the trail. Instead, with two weeks and 125 miles (200km) of route left to walk, she flew home. \u201cI felt foolish for thinking I could do this alone, but also very angry that the world is like this,\u201d she said.</p>    <p>Incidents such as masturbating in public are considered a form of sexual aggression in Spain. Most of the women who spoke to the Guardian described Spanish police as being swift to respond, though often the aggressors were nowhere to be found.</p> <p>One pilgrim, however, said police did nothing to help after she came across a man who was masturbating as she walked along the outskirts of the Spanish city of Logro\u00f1o last year.</p> <p>\u201cI had these walking sticks, and I remember holding them in my hands and so I could protect myself,\u201d said Jolien Denyayer, 27. \u201cI did call the cops and, well, actually they were of no help \u2026 they were really dismissive. I called them three times and nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Dhooma, after her ordeal of being chased in northern Spain, took the rare step of pressing charges, resulting in a Spanish court levying a fine of more than \u00a32,510 (\u20ac3,000) against her aggressor as well as a 16-month restraining order.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s only been a few select times in my life that I was afraid that this was it, that I was going to die \u2013 and that was one of those moments,\u201d she said. \u201cThat fear that I had, I just didn\u2019t want it to happen to anyone else. Because if I had let it go, I\u2019m sure history would have repeated itself.\u201d</p> <p>Dhooma has since returned to the Camino, completing about 18 routes. The 2019 incident was not the first time her experience had been marred by harassment; in 2014, as she embarked on her first pilgrimage, a man exposed himself in front of her and another pilgrim.</p> <p>\u201cUp to that point, the Camino to me was this kind of magical journey I was taking. Everything was new; beautiful surroundings, wonderful people, and there wasn\u2019t anything dark or unsettling,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was then I realised, OK, the Camino can be a dangerous place too.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Last year a record 446,000 people walked the Camino, 53% of them women, according to Pedro Blanco, the Spanish central government\u2019s representative in Galicia. \u201cMore than 230,000 women did it last year, and many of them didn\u2019t hesitate to do it on their own,\u201d he recently told reporters.</p> <p>Marie Albert, a journalist, self-described adventurer and feminist writer, said there was insufficient discussion of the risks that female pilgrims faced. \u201cThese routes are said to be safe for women and there\u2019s a taboo around saying anything different,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In 2019, as Albert walked 435 miles (700km) across northern Spain to reach Santiago de Compostela, she <a href=\"https://www.wedemain.fr/partager/harcelement-sexuel-sur-le-chemin-de-compostelle/\">documented</a> a number of aggressions. One man tried to kiss her, and another masturbated in front of her, she said. One man harassed her by text message, and another followed her in the street. At times her aggressors were pilgrims who were walking the same route as her, leaving her panicked that she would again cross paths with them.</p> <p>Of the nine women who spoke to the Guardian, six reported the incidents to police.

      "bodyText": "Lone female pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago have spoken of being subjected to \u201cterrifying\u201d sexual harassment in near-deserted areas of rural Spain, Portugal and France. In interviews with the Guardian, nine women alleged they had experienced harassment while attempting the pilgrimage route over the past five years, with several saying they had feared for their lives. Seven of the women said they had encountered men in Spain and Portugal who were masturbating or touching themselves, one of whom went on to chase the pilgrim through the countryside. Another woman said she had fended off unwanted touching and lewd comments from several men, while the ninth woman said a man had pulled up in a van as she walked and urged her to get in. The incidents usually took place as the women were walking alone along remote stretches of the Camino. Lorena Gaibor, the founder of Camigas, an online forum that has been connecting female pilgrims since 2015, said the reports were shocking but not surprising. \u201cSexual harassment is endemic on the Camino. It feels very common. Every freaking year we get reports of women experiencing the same things,\u201d she said. Rosie, 25, said she was walking through a forested route in Portugal earlier this summer when she came across a man with no trousers on who was masturbating as he watched her. The local police did not pick up when she tried to call them. \u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d said Rosie, who asked that her full name not be published. \u201cI just felt completely alone at that point.\u201d The incident had left her feeling unsafe, making her realise her unique vulnerability as a lone female pilgrim. \u201cThe Camino is so amazing, because it\u2019s so difficult, so physically challenging and so mentally challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is this extra element that female hikers face, this extra huge safety issue, which completely affects your whole ability to face those other challenges or enjoy it in the way that other people do.\u201d In recent years the popularity of the various pilgrimage routes collectively known as the Camino de Santiago has soared, particularly among women. Last year a record 446,000 people walked the Camino, 53% of them women, according to Pedro Blanco, the Spanish central government\u2019s representative in Galicia. \u201cMore than 230,000 women did it last year, and many of them didn\u2019t hesitate to do it on their own,\u201d he recently told reporters. Marie Albert, a journalist, self-described adventurer and feminist writer, said there was insufficient discussion of the risks that female pilgrims faced. \u201cThese routes are said to be safe for women and there\u2019s a taboo around saying anything different,\u201d she said. In 2019, as Albert walked 435 miles (700km) across northern Spain to reach Santiago de Compostela, she documented a number of aggressions. One man tried to kiss her, and another masturbated in front of her, she said. One man harassed her by text message, and another followed her in the street. At times her aggressors were pilgrims who were walking the same route as her, leaving her panicked that she would again cross paths with them. Of the nine women who spoke to the Guardian, six reported the incidents to police. In only one case was the perpetrator located and prosecuted. A handful of incidents along the route have made headlines in recent years. Last year Spanish police arrested a 48-year-old man accused of holding a 24-year-old German pilgrim against her will in his home and sexually assaulting her. In 2019, police in Portugal arrested a 78-year-old man who was accused of kidnapping and attempting to rape a pilgrim from Germany. Concerns over female pilgrims\u2019 safety burst into public view in 2015 after the American pilgrim Denise Thiem went missing in a rural area of Le\u00f3n province, Spain. Her disappearance prompted several pilgrims to come forward with their own stories of being threatened or harassed, before a court sentenced a Spanish man in 2017 to 23 years in prison for Thiem\u2019s murder. In 2021 the Spanish government launched a safety campaign that has since expanded to 1,600 points across Galicia where female pilgrims can access information in several languages on how to contact emergency services. Johnnie Walker, one of the admins behind the Camino de Santiago All Routes Group, a social media forum that counts more than 450,000 members, said there had long been frustration over the lack of statistics, even as efforts to combat these incidents had been stepped up. \u201cAs the number of pilgrims has grown, so have reports of men exposing themselves to pilgrims,\u201d he said. \u201cIn response the Guardia Civil has stepped up patrols on a number of routes.\u201d His forum has long advised pilgrims in Spain to download the AlertCops app, which allows pilgrims to contact police directly. \u201cThere\u2019s always the balance to be struck between warning women and causing alarm,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, a few of us feel that this issue now needs to be addressed more forcibly and coherently across the country.\u201d Police in Portugal said that since 2023 they had received five reports from pilgrims, all of them related to incidents of exhibitionism. None of the suspects were identified and no arrests were made. Between May and October, police had stepped up patrols along various routes in Portugal in order to better protect pilgrims, they added in a statement. Police in Spain and France, as well as the interior ministries of those countries, were also approached for comment but did not respond. When asked whether there was an official tally of pilgrims who had reported incidents of harassment in the past five years, the Spanish central government\u2019s delegation in Galicia said in a statement that it was not aware of any cases of sexual aggression involving female pilgrims. It pointed to a series of initiatives aimed at protecting pilgrims, including specific police patrols along routes and an established protocol that requires security forces to be dispatched each time a call comes in from a pilgrim. \u2022 Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

While the details of the reforms are yet to be released, the Humanitix co-chief executive officer, Joshua Ross, said the government and ticketing companies could do more to prevent people and online sites from buying tickets for the sole purpose of reselling them at huge markups. \u201cThey need to create examples of it with proper prosecution,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAnd if they can clean up the scalping world by making the disincentive strong enough, then it makes sense to ban dynamic pricing.\u201d Anti-scalping laws vary from state to state.

In the UK the Competition and Markets Authority is examining whether Ticketmaster engaged in \u201cunfair commercial practices\u201d in selling tickets for the Oasis reunion concert. Some people waited for hours in the online queue only to find the price had jumped by more than \u00a3200 by the time it came to pay. Ticketmaster \u2013 owned by Live Nation \u2013 and its main competitor Ticketek, have defended dynamic pricing by saying demand-driven pricing mitigates the problem of ticket scalping. Humanitix, which Ross founded with Adam McCurdie, donates all profits from booking fees to charity. Ross said the ticketing giants could do more to prevent scalping by not releasing purchased tickets until an hour before a concert, or facilitating their resale for people who could no longer attend. \u201cThe question is, do they make a lot of money from dynamic pricing?

Australia\u2019s consumer protections lag the US, UK and EU when it comes to banning unfair trade practices, according to consumer advocates. The proposed changes to dynamic pricing target those companies that change prices during a transaction, as opposed to more acceptable practices such as lifting the price of short-stay accommodation during peak periods, which customers are aware of when they start the booking process. The chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, Erin Turner, said dynamic pricing became a problem when businesses charged wildly different prices for factors outside the customer\u2019s control. \u201cDynamic pricing isn\u2019t fair when prices change while you\u2019re trying to purchase a ticket,\u201d Turner said. \u201cSo you go in with one price, you get to the end of the process, and it\u2019s suddenly much higher. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of examples where someone will start with one price and they\u2019re lucky enough to be allocated a ticket and suddenly it costs hundreds of dollars more than what they were expecting. \u201cThat bait and switch is deeply unfair in a high-demand situation.

His cast throw themselves into the plot with liveliness and flair, doubling as musicians or puppeteers, tossing around accents and asides with abandon. It comes dangerously close to pantomime at times, but its energy rarely sags.</p>   <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/24/stc-australia-wharf-revue-final-year-25th-anniversary\">After 25 years of piss-taking Australia\u2019s politicians, the \u2018disturbingly accurate\u2019 Wharf Revue bows out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the eponymous boy who refuses to grow up, Dhanji brings bright magnetism and vulnerability to the role; he has a knockabout quality that recalls matinee screen idols by way of the Artful Dodger. In key ways, Peter has been stripped of complexity and ambivalence, but he remains a likeable protagonist. Deeble is excellent as Molly, acrobatic and swashbuckling, bursting with pride and panache. Lane hilariously hams his evil pirate schtick, constantly breaking the fourth wall to cajole or berate the audience. Paul Capsis is memorable as a dastardly seafarer and John Batchelor is terrific in a number of roles, not least the mermaid who bestows Peter with his name.</p> <p>While much of the stagecraft is effective \u2013 the addition of shanty-style musical interludes gives a sense of ritual to proceedings \u2013 it\u2019s also highly reminiscent of the Old Vic production of A Christmas Carol (returning soon to the Comedy Theatre). If it isn\u2019t particularly innovative, it does manage to convey some of the wide-eyed wonder of the original, that sense of a grand mythology emerging.</p> <p>Just what Peter himself means \u2013 the boy who refuses to grow into adulthood \u2013 is harder to fathom in this iteration. His arrested development is played as a kind of whim rather than any rift in the natural order, so there\u2019s little hint of the tragic impulse that sits just under the surface of Barrie\u2019s creation. At the conclusion, Peter is safely ensconced in Neverland and Molly heads back to England, the flying boy neatly confined to the world of imagination. It feels like a loss.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Peter and the Starcatcher is on at the Art Centre Melbourne\u2019s Playhouse until 1 December, then Adelaide Festival Centre from 9 January 2025, Sydney\u2019s Capitol theatre from 31 January, and Brisbane\u2019s QPAC from 14 March. <a href=\"https://peterandthestarcatcher.com.au/tickets/\">See here for tickets</a>.</em></p></li> </ul>",

Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Director and designer David Morton (creative director of Queensland-based company Dead Puppet Society) mounts a production that cleaves to the particular charms of rough theatre, leaning on modest puppetry and stage effects, astute use of physical movement and some rich lighting design rather than blockbuster coups de theatre. His cast throw themselves into the plot with liveliness and flair, doubling as musicians or puppeteers, tossing around accents and asides with abandon. It comes dangerously close to pantomime at times, but its energy rarely sags. As the eponymous boy who refuses to grow up, Dhanji brings bright magnetism and vulnerability to the role; he has a knockabout quality that recalls matinee screen idols by way of the Artful Dodger. In key ways, Peter has been stripped of complexity and ambivalence, but he remains a likeable protagonist. Deeble is excellent as Molly, acrobatic and swashbuckling, bursting with pride and panache. Lane hilariously hams his evil pirate schtick, constantly breaking the fourth wall to cajole or berate the audience. Paul Capsis is memorable as a dastardly seafarer and John Batchelor is terrific in a number of roles, not least the mermaid who bestows Peter with his name. While much of the stagecraft is effective \u2013 the addition of shanty-style musical interludes gives a sense of ritual to proceedings \u2013 it\u2019s also highly reminiscent of the Old Vic production of A Christmas Carol (returning soon to the Comedy Theatre). If it isn\u2019t particularly innovative, it does manage to convey some of the wide-eyed wonder of the original, that sense of a grand mythology emerging. Just what Peter himself means \u2013 the boy who refuses to grow into adulthood \u2013 is harder to fathom in this iteration. His arrested development is played as a kind of whim rather than any rift in the natural order, so there\u2019s little hint of the tragic impulse that sits just under the surface of Barrie\u2019s creation. At the conclusion, Peter is safely ensconced in Neverland and Molly heads back to England, the flying boy neatly confined to the world of imagination. It feels like a loss. Peter and the Starcatcher is on at the Art Centre Melbourne\u2019s Playhouse until 1 December, then Adelaide Festival Centre from 9 January 2025, Sydney\u2019s Capitol theatre from 31 January, and Brisbane\u2019s QPAC from 14 March.

Sullivan said the White House aims \u201cto put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table\u201d. Blasts were heard in Kyiv and parts of the city were left without power early on Monday after Ukraine\u2019s air force put the whole country under air raid alerts following the launch of Russian missile attacks. \u201cThe air alert is related to the launch of cruise missiles from Tu-95MS strategic bombers,\u201d the air force said on social media. Reuters witnesses reported blasts in Kyiv in what sounded like air defence systems in operation. Parts of Kyiv were also without power, witnesses said, after Ukrainian media reports of emergency blackouts in several regions. Russian air strikes killed at least six people in southern Ukraine, authorities said on Monday. Five people were killed in the southern city of Mykolaiv, according to the regional governor, while a sixth died in Zaporizhzhia in an attack that authorities said wounded more than a dozen. Ukraine earlier launched its biggest ever drone attack on Moscow, Luke Harding reports, while Russia targeted Ukraine with more Shahed suicide UAVs than it has ever used in one night. \u201cLast night, Russia launched a record 145 Shaheds and other strike drones against Ukraine,\u201d said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Sunday. Russia said 34 Ukrainian attack drones targeted Moscow on Sunday, in the largest such attack on the capital since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Andrei Vorobyov, the Moscow region governor, called it a \u201cmassive\u201d attack. It forced the temporary closure of three airports, wounded a 52-year-old woman and set two homes on fire in the village of Stanovoye in the Moscow region, officials said. Russia said that in all its air defences shot down 70 drones, nearly half of them in the skies above Moscow and the rest in western Russia. The general staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces said it successfully targeted an ammunition dump near the Russian city of Bryansk. Video showed multiple explosions coming from warehouses on the military site. Fires could be seen burning in the night sky. A report in the Washington Post said Donald Trump, the next US president, had a phone call with Vladimir Putin where he told the Russian president not to escalate his war against Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry said it was not informed in advance of the call between Trump and Putin and subsequently could neither endorse nor object to it. Trump has boasted that he can broker a quick end to the war. Ukrainian politicians are expressing tentative hopes that the return of Trump will not necessarily lead to a rapid and humiliating forced peace, Dan Sabbagh writes from Kyiv. Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian opposition MP, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that Trump\u2019s victory is a catastrophe. Ukraine is now his business and if negotiations lead to a disaster it will be his, like Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. This is a person who loves to win.\u201d The UK is examining all possible options when it comes to Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, the chief secretary to the Treasury has said, Jessica Elgot writes. Darren Jones told Sky News: \u201cWe don\u2019t want any countenance of the idea that we\u2019re stepping back from that [British commitments to Ukraine]. That\u2019s why we\u2019re offering them \u00a33bn a year, which you know, in the fiscal context here in the UK, is difficult but the right decision for us.\u201d Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, the UK\u2019s chief of the defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said Russia was paying an \u201cextraordinary price\u201d for Putin\u2019s war, and October was its worst month for losses since the conflict began in February 2022. \u201cRussia is about to suffer 700,000 people killed or wounded \u2013 the enormous pain and suffering that the Russian nation is having to bear because of Putin\u2019s ambition,\u201d he said, adding that the only gains were \u201ctiny increments of land\u201d. The cost of the war, which he put at more than 40% of public expenditure on defence and security, was also \u201can enormous drain\u201d on Russia. Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, will join the French president, Emmanual Macron, in Paris for the French Armistice Day service in a pointed show of European solidarity after Trump\u2019s re-election, with Ukraine and defence on the agenda for private talks between the two leaders, writes Jessica Elgot.",

Biden pledged a smooth transfer of power to Trump and expressed faith in the endurance of the American experiment.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSetbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\u201d Biden said. \u201cA defeat does not mean we are defeated.

Not only did Trump win the White House, but he is on track to win the popular vote, making him the first Republican to do so since 2004.

Since the movement formed last winter, its leaders have urged the Democratic party to heed their demands of a permanent ceasefire in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\">Gaza</a> and to adopt an arms embargo on Israel, or risk losing their votes.</p> \n  <p>While a full picture of how Arab and Muslim Americans voted in the presidential election is still being captured, this election showed a shift among communities that had long formed the Democratic base. A majority of Muslim Americans voted for the Green party candidate <strong>Jill Stein</strong> at 53%, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-exit-poll-of-muslim-voters-reveals-surge-in-support-for-jill-stein-and-donald-trump-steep-decline-for-harris/\">nationwide exit poll </a>of more than 1,500 Muslim Americans by the civil rights group Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), followed by 21% for Trump and 20% for vice-president <strong>Kamala Harris</strong>.</p> \n  <p>In Michigan, which has one of the nation\u2019s highest Arab American and Muslim populations, 59% of Muslim Americans voted for Stein, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CAIR_2024_MI_Exit_Poll.jpg\">CAIR poll</a>, while 22% cast ballots for Trump and 14% supported Harris. While exit poll data on Arab American voters is not yet available, a <a href=\"https://www.aaiusa.org/library/the-arab-american-vote-2024\">September</a> poll for the non-profit group Arab American Institute found that they were evenly split between their support of Trump and Harris at 42% and 41% respectively.</p> \n  <p>Now, Uncommitted\u2019s founders and supporters say that the election results reveal that the Democratic party has lost touch with its working class and anti-war voters. Their message for the Biden-Harris administration and Trump is clear, said Uncommitted leader and Palestinian American activist <strong>Lexis Zeidan</strong>: the movement is not over.

      "bodyText": "This live blog is closing now, but we will return if there is any breaking news to bring you. If you want to read more about Donald Trump\u2019s reported phone call with Vladimir Putin, you can see our full report here. Some companies have been moving factories from China to Southeast Asia, anticipating Donald Trump would slap high tariffs on Beijing if he regained the White House, a move set to accelerate with his election win, industrial park developers in the region say. Trump, who won a resounding victory on Tuesday, has threatened 60% tariffs on goods coming into the US from China, much higher than the levies of 7.5% to 25% he imposed in his first term, a major risk for the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Southeast Asia - which has auto and electronics factories from Thailand to Vietnam and Malaysia - will likely benefit at China\u2019s expense, said two executives, two business groups, a lawyer and an analyst in the region, speaking to Reuters. Developers of industrial parks are adding Chinese speakers and preparing land tracts for factories, a sign of how Trump, who takes office in January, could reshuffle global supply chains. As Trump geared up his campaign to retake the presidency earlier this year, calls from Chinese customers flooded WHA Group, one of Thailand\u2019s largest industrial estate developers, said CEO Jareeporn Jarukornsakul. \u201cThere was [already] a relocation to Southeast Asia, but this round is going to be more intense,\u201d she said, referring to Trump\u2018s 2017-2021 first term. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and president-elect Donald Trump spoke on Sunday evening to exchange views on bilateral relations and geopolitical challenges, a German government spokesperson said. \u201cThe chancellor emphasised the German government\u2019s willingness to continue the decades of successful cooperation between the two countries\u2019 governments. They also agreed to work together towards a return to peace in Europe,\u201d he said. Joe Biden has invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said earlier today. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that Biden\u2019s top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and he will also talk to Trump about what\u2019s happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East. \u201cPresident Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,\u201d Sullivan told CBS. When asked if Biden would ask Congress to pass legislation to authorise more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred. \u201cI\u2019m not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term,\u201d Sullivan said. Trump will take office on 20 January. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry has said reports Kyiv was informed in advance of a phone call between president-elect Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin are false. The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Trump and Putin spoke by phone on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine. It said Kyiv was informed of the call and did not object to the conversation taking place. \u201cReports that the Ukrainian side was informed in advance of the alleged call are false. Subsequently, Ukraine could not have endorsed or opposed the call,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi told Reuters. In an interview on Fox News, Republican Senator Rick Scott said that the Senate needs to implement real change. Scott is running to fill the influential post of Senate majority leader, after the party won control of the chamber. We can\u2019t keep doing what we\u2019re doing \u2026 That\u2019s what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change.\u201d Trump campaigned on promises, among other things, to deport immigrants who are in the United States illegally, cut taxes, impose tariffs on international trading partners and loosen fiscal policy. Scott has the backing of several Republican senators, but it remains whether he can bring Republican moderates to his side. Each party votes on their leader in the Senate in January, after senators have been sworn in to the new Congress. Whoever wins the Republican leadership will succeed Democrat Chuck Schumer as majority leader. Scott has already garnered an endorsement from Elon Musk. Donald Trump had a call with Vladimir Putin on Thursday, according to a report from the Washington Post, telling the Russian president that he shouldn\u2019t escalate the war with Ukraine. Trump reportedly floated support for a deal where Russia ends its offense in exchange for territory. The race for a new Senate majority leader is heating up, with three Republicans vying for the spot. Senator Rick Scott of Florida has so far won the support from Trump\u2019s Maga camp, including from RFK Jr, Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk. Trump has yet to announce an endorsement himself, though he said on Sunday that he would want a new leader to conduct \u201crecess appointments\u201d, a controversial method of getting cabinet members into office quickly while temporarily sidestepping a lengthy Senate confirmation process. Multiple Democrats have spent the weekend on the talk show circuit speculating on where the party went wrong this election. A vocal critic has emerged in the form of Bernie Sanders, who doubled down on his comments that Democrats lost working class voters to Trump after failing to be strong advocates against corporate power. Bitcoin soared to a new record high on Sunday, as the cryptocurrency continues to rise after Trump\u2019s presidential election win. The digital currency passed $80,000 for the first time in its history shortly after 12am GMT, according to AFP. Yadira Caraveo, a Democrat representative for Colorado, announced she is conceding in her race against Republican Gabe Evans. The AP has yet to call the race. The chance for Democrats to take a House majority grows slimmer with each race that is won by a Republican candidate. House Republicans have 213 seats, with Caraveo conceding her race. That means Republicans need five more seats to maintain their majority, while House Democrats need at least 15 wins \u2013 what may be hard with many closely contested races yet to be called. The election is still tense in Arizona as the AP has yet to call a closely watched race between Democrat Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake, polls for which have shown Gallego in a slight lead over Lake. Republicans in Arizona are countering American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) efforts to extend a ballot curing deadline set for 5pm on Sunday. Thousands of votes are still left to be verified, or \u201ccured\u201d, as election officials attempt to contact voters about ballots with issues, like signatures that don\u2019t match voter records. Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer for the Arizona GOP, said the party filed papers in an attempt to block an extension. On Saturday, Warren Petersen, a Republican state senator and president of the Arizona senate, said on Twitter/X that he authorized the state senate to intervene and \u201cdefend existing law so we can determine the outcome as soon as possible. It has already taken too much time!\u201d Seems like the term \u201crecess appointments\u201d is going to be heard a lot over the next few days, as Senate Republicans vote in a new majority leader this week. Donald Trump on Sunday, while avoiding an endorsement of any of the three senators who are running to be leader \u2013 John Cornyn of Texas, Rick Scott of Florida and John Thune of South Dakota \u2013 called on the new leader to get his cabinet appointments through quickly through \u201crecess appointments\u201d. \u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWithout which we will not be able to get confirmed in a timely manner. Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again.\u201d Recess appointments are made when the Senate is in recess and are seen as temporary appointments, but are used to quickly get nominees into office without a lengthy Senate confirmation process \u2013 which includes hearings and votes. Essentially, a recess appointment is a way Trump could quickly get his cabinet seated, while temporarily sidestepping the confirmation process. It\u2019s a controversial move, and the candidates for Senate majority leader are already weighing in support. Thune, in a statement, said: \u201cWe must act quickly and decisively to get the president\u2019s cabinet and other nominees in place as soon as possible to start delivering on the mandate we\u2019ve been sent to execute, and all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.\u201d Scott simply replied to Trump saying: \u201cI will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.\u201d \u2022 This post was amended on 11 November 2024 to correct the spelling of John Cornyn\u2019s last name. Donald Trump was declared the winner in Arizona early on Sunday, completing the Republicans\u2019 clean sweep of the so-called swing states and rubbing salt in Democrats\u2019 wounds as it was announced that the president-elect is scheduled to meet with Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the presidential handover. In a national campaign that was projected as being extremely close but he ended up winning handily, the result in Arizona gives Trump 312 electoral college votes, compared with Kamala Harris\u2019s 226. The state joins the other Sun belt swing states \u2013 Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina \u2013 and the three Rust belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in voting Republican. All were expected to be extremely competitive but all went for Trump, though by fairly close margins. Republicans also regained control of the Senate \u2013 they hold 53 seats to the Democrats\u2019 46 \u2013 and look likely to keep control of the House of Representatives, where 21 races remain uncalled but Republicans currently have a 212-202 advantage, giving them a \u201ctrifecta\u201d \u2013 both houses of Congress as well as the presidency \u2013 that will allow them to govern largely unfettered for at least the next two years. The political realignment comes after a bruising election that has set the stage for the Democratic party to re-evaluate a platform that appeared to have been rejected by a majority of US voters. Trump also won the popular vote, the first time a Republican has done so since George W Bush in 2004 following the 9/11 attacks a few years before. Elon Musk is weighing in on the three-way race for Senate majority leader among Republicans, endorsing Florida senator Rick Scott for the leadership position. Scott is running against Senators John Cornyn of Texas and minority whip John Thune of South Dakota. In an earlier tweet on Sunday, Musk called Thune \u201cthe top choice of Democrats\u201d. Donald Trump has not weighed in on the leader race, though he said in a new statement that said the new leader should usher in his nominees as quickly as possible. \u201cSometimes the votes can take two years or more,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThis is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\u201d In reply, Scott said: \u201cI will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.\u201d Donald Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin on Thursday and told the Russian president he should not escalate the war in Ukraine, according to a new report from the Washington Post. On the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine on his first day in office, though he hasn\u2019t offered specifics on how he would accomplish that. Trump told Putin that a possible deal could allow Russia to gain some territory, the Post reported. Days after the election, Trump said that he spoke with 70 world leaders after his victory, including Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a call that included Elon Musk. US representative Seth Moulton, a Democrat from Massachusetts, told MSNBC that he stands by comments he made to the New York Times about trans athletes in sports. Moulton told the New York Times: \u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about challenges many Americans face,\u201d he said. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat, I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d On MSNBC Sunday, Moulton said he was \u201cspeaking authentically as a dad on one of many issues where I think we are out of touch with the majority of voters and I stand by my position. Maybe I didn\u2019t get all the words right, but the point is that the backlash I received proves my point that we can\u2019t even have these discussions as a party.\u201d Moulton added that the chair of the Massachusetts Democratic Party \u201cwouldn\u2019t even return my phone call\u201d. Some of Moulton\u2019s former staff and interns are circulating a letter to the congressman saying that his remarks come \u201cat the cost of others\u2019 safety and success\u201d. \u201cThe way these concerns were presented risks reinforcing a harmful narrative about trans youth, who already face disproportionate discrimination and challenges,\u201d the letter said. Bernie Sanders said he opposes any move to force Sonia Sotomayor, the senior liberal justice on the US supreme court, to step down so that Joe Biden could nominate a younger liberal replacement before he finishes his term as president. Sotomayor, 70, is known to suffer from health issues, and some Democrats fear a repeat of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died during Donald Trump\u2019s first term \u2013 giving him a third opportunity to nominate a new justice and further shore up the top court\u2019s conservative bent. In his first term, Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch to replace Antonin Scalia, Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Anthony Kennedy, and Amy Coney Barrett to take the place of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died less than two months before the 2020 election \u2013 leaving six largely conservative judges to just three liberals. Trump\u2019s first-term appointees to the court were critical to overturning abortion rights and a series of other rulings that delighted conservative activists. In an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Sanders, a progressive senator who identifies as an independent but usually votes with Democrats, said it would not be \u201csensible\u201d to ask Sotomayor to step down while Biden is still in office. He added he had heard \u201ca little bit\u201d of talk from Democratic senators about asking Sotomayor, who is serving a lifetime appointment to the supreme court, to step aside. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s sensible,\u201d Sanders said, without elaborating further. Read the full story here: Senator Marco Rubio just endorsed his Florida colleague to be the next Senate majority leader. Scott is seen largely as the \u201cMagaAGA\u201d choice, compared with Republican senators John Thune and John Cornyn, who are seen as more of part of the Republican establishment, having been in office for more than a decade. Scott, meanwhile, is the former governor of Florida and was elected to the Senate in 2018. The race is set to be a test of whether Senate Republicans want to lean more toward the Trumpian edges of the party, or more toward its establishment center. Scott first announced himself as a candidate for the leadership race on Wednesday. The vote for a new majority leader will take place later this week. Democratic senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut has an interesting thread on X on what happened to Democrats this election. Murphy argues that the \u201ctent is too small\u201d. \u201cThe left has never fully grappled with the wreckage of fifty years of neoliberalism, which has left legions of Americans adrift as local places are hollowed out, rapacious profit seeking cannibalizes the common good and unchecked new technology separates and isolates,\u201d he wrote. Murphy defended colleague Bernie Sanders\u2019 statement saying that Democrats have \u201cabandoned working class people\u201d. \u201cWhen progressives like Bernie aggressively go after the elites that hold people down, they are shunned as dangerous populists. Why? Maybe because true economic populism is bad for our high-income base,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe cannot be afraid of fights \u2013 especially with the economic elites who have profited off neoliberalism. The right regularly picks fights with elites \u2013 Hollywood, higher ed, etc. Democrats (eg the Harris campaign) are tepid in our fights with billionaires and corporations.\u201d Florida senator Rick Scott is picking up momentum from Donald Trump\u2019s circle as a possible front-runner to be the Senate majority leader. Multiple conservatives, including Tucker Carlson, Glenn Beck and Robert Kennedy Jr have endorsed Scott as the next leader. The majority leader race appears to be down to three Senate Republicans: John Cornyn, a senator from Texas, Senate minority whip John Thune, of South Dakota and Scott. In a post on X, Carlson described Cornyn as \u201can angry liberal whose politics are indistinguishable from Liz Cheney\u2019s\u201d. Meanwhile, Kennedy said that without Scott, \u201cthe entire Trump reform agenda [is] wobbly\u201d. Republican senators will vote for their new leader this week. Trump has not weighed in on the race, and some Republicans, including Thune, have asked Trump to stay out of the race. Whoever is chosen to succeed the current majority leader Mitch McConnell, who has been the top Senate Republican since 2015, will have a large sway over how Trump\u2019s agenda can be carried out in Congress. Senator Bernie Sanders is on the Sunday talk show circuit today defending his statement saying that Democrats have \u201cabandoned working class people\u201d and have instead \u201cdefend[ed] the status quo\u201d. Democrats like Nancy Pelosi slammed Sanders for his statement, telling the New York Times, \u201cI don\u2019t respect him [for] saying that that.\u201d Talking to CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Sanders said the working class is angry and they have a reason to be angry. Harris lost supporters to Donald Trump, who \u201cwent around providing an explanation\u201d to voters about why they were feeling about the economy, largely placing the blame on undocumented immigrants. \u201cThat is obviously not the reason,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe reason in my view is we have an unprecedented level of corporate greed today, more income and wealth inequality and people on top want it all.\u201d \u201cWe need an agenda that says to the working class we are going to take on this powerful working class and take on an agenda that works for you,\u201d he said. Here is a summary of the latest developments so far on today\u2019s US politics blog: Donald Trump won the presidential election in Arizona, the Associated Press (AP) declared on Saturday, completing a clean sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive electoral college victory over the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris. Trump, who had secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House by early Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris\u2019s 226. Republican US representative Eli Crane won reelection to a US House seat representing Arizona\u2019s second congressional district. The freshman lawmaker defeated former Navajo Nation president, Jonathan Nez, who was vying to become the state\u2019s first Native American representative. In a statement late on Saturday, Crane commended Nez for entering the race and thanked voters. The AP reported that three other US House races in Arizona were too early to call on Saturday, most notably the first and sixth congressional districts. Biden and Trump will meet on Wednesday in the Oval Office, the White House announced on Saturday. \u201cAt President Biden\u2019s invitation, President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday,\u201d the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in a statement. Republicans on Saturday appeared close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for Trump to advance his agenda when the president-elect returns to the White House in January. Trump\u2019s second administration has begun to take shape amid fears over extremist appointments and how far right the US will go while Republicans control the White House and probably both chambers of Congress. The range of names being put forward varies from members of Trump\u2019s inner circle to the world\u2019s richest man, tech mogul Elon Musk. Trump said on Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. \u201cI will not be inviting former ambassador Nikki Haley, or former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump administration, which is currently in formation,\u201d Trump posted on social media. \u201cI very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our country.\u201d A New York judge is to decide this week whether Trump\u2019s criminal conviction on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star should be overturned in light of the US supreme court\u2019s July ruling on presidential immunity. Justice Juan Merchan has said he will make his decision by Tuesday. It is the first of two pivotal choices that the judge must make after Trump\u2019s 5 November election victory. Merchan also must decide whether to go ahead with sentencing Trump on 26 November as currently scheduled. The Kremlin said on Sunday that it saw \u201cpositive signals\u201d from Trump\u2019s position on Ukraine, while warning it was hard to predict how he would behave in office. \u201cThe signals are positive. Trump during his election talked about how he perceives everything through deals, that he can make a deal that can lead to peace,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with state media published on Sunday. Protests against Trump erupted in the US on Saturday as people on both coasts took to the streets in frustration about his re-election. Thousands of people in major cities including New York City and Seattle demonstrated against the former president and now president-elect amid his threats against reproductive rights and pledges to carry out mass deportations at the start of his upcoming presidency. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday he had spoken with Trump three times in the past few days aimed at tightening the strong alliance between Israel and the US. \u201cThese were good and very important conversations,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he will not seek to join the president-elect\u2019s new administration but is ready to offer advice to his successor, including on how to strengthen sanctions on Iran and Russia and contain the growth of US debt. In an interview, Mnuchin told Reuters it was important for the Treasury to work towards strengthening US trade policy. This includes holding Beijing to its US goods purchase commitments in Trump\u2019s January 2020 Phase One deal to rebalance US-China trade, which he said \u201cthey\u2019re not living up to.\u201d The president-elect has charged Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, and one of the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse his campaign, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his agenda. The CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, has made no secret of his plan to stack the new White House with loyalists \u2013 and keep out anyone who threatens to derail his pledges. A senior adviser to Trump said that the incoming US administration\u2019s priority for Ukraine will be achieving peace rather than helping it regain territory captured by Russia in the almost three years of the war. In an interview with the BBC, broadcast on Saturday, Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser to Trump since his 2016 presidential campaign, said: \u201cWhen Zelenskyy says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace, once Crimea is returned, we\u2019ve got news for President Zelenskyy: Crimea is gone.\u201d The governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, said he thinks Trump may look favourably on the UK choosing to leave the \u201cbureaucratic blob\u201d of the EU. The Democratic politician told the Sky News Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips program that his \u201cgut\u201d suggested Trump could not pursue tariffs \u201cagainst allies like the UK\u201d. Australia\u2019s economy will not be immune from escalating trade tensions, Jim Chalmers has warned, as the Albanese government prepares itself for an incoming Trump administration. In a speech to be delivered on Monday, the treasurer will outline the risks of an \u201cuncertain world characterised by economic vulnerability and volatility\u201d but will say the Australian government is \u201cwell-placed and well-prepared\u201d. A British minister said on Sunday that the government is unlikely to ask the Reform party leader Nigel Farage to act as an intermediary to deal with Trump. The UK Treasury minister, Darren Jones, said on Sunday that the government would probably reject that offer. Farage had said at the weekend he would be willing to act as an intermediary for the UK government because it is in the national interest. Jones also said that the UK is examining all possible options when it comes Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine. An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has been fired from her job and is being investigated because she told a disaster relief team she was directing in Florida after Hurricane Milton to avoid homes displaying election campaign signs supporting Trump, conduct that the agency head on Saturday called \u201creprehensible\u201d. Bitcoin soared to a new record high on Sunday, as the cryptocurrency continues to rise after Trump\u2019s presidential election win. The digital currency passed $80,000 for the first time in its history shortly after 12am GMT, according to AFP. Joe Biden stood before the American people, millions of whom were still reeling from the news of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race, and reassured them: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d In his first remarks since his vice-president and chosen successor, Kamala Harris, lost the presidential election, Biden delivered a pep talk from the White House Rose Garden on a sunny Thursday that clashed with Democrats\u2019 black mood in the wake of their devastating electoral losses. Biden pledged a smooth transfer of power to Trump and expressed faith in the endurance of the American experiment. \u201cSetbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\u201d Biden said. \u201cA defeat does not mean we are defeated. We lost this battle. The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up. That\u2019s the story of America for over 240 years and counting.\u201d The message severely clashed with the dire warnings that many Democrats, including Biden, have issued about the dangers of a second Trump term. They have predicted that Trump\u2019s return to power would jeopardize the very foundation of American democracy. They assured voters that Trump would make good on his promise to deport millions of undocumented people. And they raised serious doubts about Trump\u2019s pledge to veto a nationwide abortion ban. Now as they stare down four more years of Trump\u2019s presidency, Democrats must reckon with the reality that those warnings were for naught. Not only did Trump win the White House, but he is on track to win the popular vote, making him the first Republican to do so since 2004. Senate Republicans have regained their majority, and they appear confident in their chances of holding the House of Representatives, with several key races still too close to call on Friday morning. Donald Trump could have an easier time limiting press freedom in his second term in the White House after a campaign marked by virulent rhetoric towards journalists and calls for punishing television networks and prosecuting journalists and their sources, legal scholars and journalism advocacy groups warn. Aside from worries about Trump\u2019s demonization of the press inciting violence against journalists, free press advocates appear to be most alarmed by Trump\u2019s call for the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to revoke TV networks\u2019 broadcast licenses and talk of jailing journalists who refuse to reveal anonymous sources. Still, despite a conservative majority on the supreme court and likely Republican control of the House and Senate, those same people also say that America\u2019s robust first amendment protections and a legislative proposal and technology to protect sources mean that a diminished press under Trump is not a certainty. \u201cMy big-picture concern is that Trump is going to do exactly what he has been telling us that he wants to do, which is that he is going to punish his critics,\u201d said Heidi Kitrosser, a Northwestern University law professor. Kitrosser added: He is going to punish people who dissent from his approach to things, people who criticize him and also, perhaps more importantly, investigative journalists and their sources who are not offering opinions but are exposing facts that he finds embarrassing or inconvenient.\u201d Trump has long said journalists deliver \u201cfake news\u201d and are the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, but since leaving office in 2021 he has used more violent language. At a 2022 rally in Texas, Trump suggested that the threat of rape in prison could compel a journalist to reveal their sources. Australia\u2019s economy will not be immune from escalating trade tensions, Jim Chalmers has warned, as the Albanese government prepares itself for an incoming Donald Trump administration. In a speech to be delivered on Monday, the treasurer will outline the risks of an \u201cuncertain world characterised by economic vulnerability and volatility\u201d but will say the Australian government is \u201cwell-placed and well-prepared\u201d. There is speculation Trump\u2019s second term in the White House may drive up inflation in the US again if he moves ahead with plans to raise tariffs on imported goods and slash taxes. \u201cOf course we expect the incoming US administration to bring a different suite of policies. And we are confident in our ability to navigate that change, as partners,\u201d he will say at the Australian Institute of International Affairs. Modelling undertaken by the Treasury department on different trade and tariff policy scenarios indicated there would be a \u201csmall\u201d reduction in Australia\u2019s output and additional price pressures in the short term. Bitcoin soared to a new record high on Sunday, as the cryptocurrency continues to rise after Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), The digital currency passed $80,000 for the first time in its history shortly after 12am GMT. It has been rising since Trump won last Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election over sentiment that he will ease regulations on digital currencies. Bitcoin reached $75,000 on Wednesday, topping its previous all-time peak of $73,797.98 achieved in March, reports AFP. Trump was seen as the pro-crypto candidate in his battle with the Democratic party\u2019s candidate Kamala Harris. During his first presidency Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam, but has since radically changed his position, even launching his own platform for the unit. He has pledged to make the US the \u201cbitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world,\u201d and to put tech billionaire and rightwing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste. The previous Trump term saw corporate tax cuts that brought more liquidity to markets, encouraging investment into high-growth assets such as cryptocurrency. According to AFP, in the run-up to the election, Trump apparently became the first former president to use bitcoin in a purchase, as he bought burgers at a New York City restaurant, which hailed it as a \u201chistoric transaction\u201d. From gold-high top sneakers to Women-for-Trump tank tops, iron-on \u201cFight, Fight, Fight\u201d patches to a poster depicting a 19th-century cowboy outlaw, sales of Trump merchandise at the Trump store in Scranton, Pennsylvania, tripled in sales in the days after the once and future president\u2019s landslide second-term win in the US election last week. In a hard week for Democrats, the goods flying off the shelves added insult to injury as Scranton has long been intimately linked to Joe Biden, lauded as his home town and symbol of his affinity with America\u2019s working class. Store manager Thomas Rankin said he never believed polls predicting a tight race. Trump voters, he believed, had simply kept quiet because they didn\u2019t want an argument. \u201cA whole lot of the Democrat party, as soon as they got in the booth, went boom! They could see through the whole Democrat propaganda,\u201d he said. And then there were the rallies \u2013 Rankin, a former deadhead, said he used to go to a lot of concerts \u2013 and Trump had held hundreds with his trademark weave of folk tales, policy and political rhetoric. \u201cPeople travelled to them like they travelled for the Grateful Dead,\u201d he said, and that\u2019s what I did. He drew people in, just like the Dead. People had fun, but they also had an interest in what he is saying.\u201d Bitter truths were plentiful in Scranton, last week, as voters in \u201cScranton Joe\u201d Biden\u2019s home town broadly rejected Democrats\u2019 proposition for a continuation under Kamala Harris. Lackawanna county, which incorporates Scranton, lies at the top end of the Pennsylvania\u2019s populous Route 222 voter corridor. It was once a Democratic stronghold but last week it swung five points toward Donald Trump compared with 2020. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday he has spoken with US president-elect Donald Trump three times in the past few days aimed at tightening the strong alliance between Israel and the US. \u201cThese were good and very important conversations,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement, according to Reuters. \u201cWe see eye to eye on the Iranian threat in all its components, and the danger posed by it. We also see the great opportunities before Israel, in the field of peace and its expansion, and in other fields.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s second administration has begun to take shape amid fears over extremist appointments and how far right the US will go while Republicans control the White House and probably both chambers of Congress. The range of names being put forward varies from members of Trump\u2019s inner circle to the world\u2019s richest man, tech mogul Elon Musk. Alongside plutocrats and technocrats are hardline ideologues on immigration and foreign policy and the controversial figure of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a leading vaccine conspiracy theorist. On Thursday, Trump made his first appointment, naming Susie Wiles, a co-campaign chair, White House chief of staff. Hailing Wiles, 67, as \u201ctough, smart, innovative \u2026 universally admired and respected\u201d, Trump reveled in naming \u201cthe first-ever female chief of staff in United States history\u201d. The daughter of an NFL legend, Pat Summerall, Wiles has worked on Republican campaigns since the days of Ronald Reagan. But she faces a thankless task. Chief of staff is a hugely demanding role, both gatekeeper and adviser. Trump\u2019s first four-year term featured four: Reince Priebus, John Kelly, Mick Mulvaney and Mark Meadows. None flourished. Before this year\u2019s election, Kelly went so far as to say on record that Trump praised Adolf Hitler and met \u201cthe general definition of a fascist\u201d. Publicly, Wiles is a woman of fewer words. On election night, in his victory speech, Trump called her \u201cthe ice baby\u201d. The Trump transition team is co-chaired by Howard Lutnick, chief executive of the finance giant Cantor Fitzgerald, and Linda McMahon, the World Wrestling Entertainment impresario who led the Small Business Administration in Trump\u2019s first term. As ever, speculation is rife about top jobs. Given campaign promises including mass deportations of undocumented migrants and pardons for January 6 rioters, the role of attorney general is perhaps attracting most attention. The UK is examining all possible options when it comes to the US president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, the chief secretary to the Treasury has said, as the UK\u2019s chief of the defence staff said approximately 1,500 Russian troops were being killed and injured every day. Whitehall officials are \u201cconsidering and planning lots of different scenarios\u201d, Darren Jones told Sky News on Sunday. During the US election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war \u201cwithin a day\u201d, but did not explain how he would do so. His vice-president nominee, JD Vance, has been vociferously opposed to providing more funds to support Ukraine. Jones said the UK would not be stepping back from its own commitments. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any countenance of the idea that we\u2019re stepping back from that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re offering them \u00a33bn a year, which you know, in the fiscal context here in the UK, is difficult but the right decision for us,\u201d he said. \u201cOfficials will be considering and planning lots of different scenarios \u2013 as they would do under any administration \u2013 to make sure that the UK is in the strongest possible position.\u201d However, Jones said he would not commit to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the current parliament, saying that security and defence were a priority but that meant \u201ctrade-offs\u201d in other areas. Jones was also scathing about the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage\u2019s offer to help the Labour government work with Donald Trump, saying: The counterfactual here is that we do not have influence and we do not have relationships. That\u2019s just not true. I think [Mr Farage] should focus on working with his constituents in Clacton who deserve a bit of a full-time MP as opposed to a transatlantic commentator.\u201d Following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in this week\u2019s presidential election, leaders of the anti-war group Uncommitted National Movement expressed their disappointment over the results, highlighting the Democratic party\u2019s failure to listen to its base and prioritize progressive policies. Since the movement formed last winter, its leaders have urged the Democratic party to heed their demands of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and to adopt an arms embargo on Israel, or risk losing their votes. While a full picture of how Arab and Muslim Americans voted in the presidential election is still being captured, this election showed a shift among communities that had long formed the Democratic base. A majority of Muslim Americans voted for the Green party candidate Jill Stein at 53%, according to a nationwide exit poll of more than 1,500 Muslim Americans by the civil rights group Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), followed by 21% for Trump and 20% for vice-president Kamala Harris. In Michigan, which has one of the nation\u2019s highest Arab American and Muslim populations, 59% of Muslim Americans voted for Stein, according to the CAIR poll, while 22% cast ballots for Trump and 14% supported Harris. While exit poll data on Arab American voters is not yet available, a September poll for the non-profit group Arab American Institute found that they were evenly split between their support of Trump and Harris at 42% and 41% respectively. Now, Uncommitted\u2019s founders and supporters say that the election results reveal that the Democratic party has lost touch with its working class and anti-war voters. Their message for the Biden-Harris administration and Trump is clear, said Uncommitted leader and Palestinian American activist Lexis Zeidan: the movement is not over. While organizing for Palestinian rights under a Trump presidency will be an uphill battle, leaders said, they plan to continue mobilizing activists to apply pressure on the US government until it ends its support of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, where more than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since last October. \u201cThe results of the election are really unfortunate because, with Trump taking office, there\u2019s a reality that domestically, policies are going to get worse, and people\u2019s rights are at stake. And we know also for Palestine and the Middle East, it\u2019s not going to get any better. It definitely didn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d said Zeidan. \u201cDems could have been much smarter, much more strategic and they chose to stick with the status quo rather than listening to their base of voters.\u201d A New York judge is set to decide this week whether president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s criminal conviction on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star should be overturned in light of the US supreme court\u2019s July ruling on presidential immunity. Justice Juan Merchan has said he will make his decision by Tuesday. It is the first of two pivotal choices that the judge must make after Trump\u2019s 5 November election victory. Merchan also must decide whether to go ahead with sentencing Trump on 26 November as currently scheduled. Legal experts have said sentencing now is unlikely to happen ahead of Trump\u2019s 20 January inauguration. A favourable ruling by Merchan for Trump on the immunity question or a sentencing delay would pave the way for him to return to the White House largely unencumbered by any of the four criminal cases that once appeared to threaten his ambitions. The Kremlin said on Sunday that it saw \u201cpositive signals\u201d from US president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s position on Ukraine, while warning it was hard to predict how he would behave in office, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe signals are positive. Trump during his election talked about how he perceives everything through deals, that he can make a deal that can lead to peace,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with state media published on Sunday. But Peskov said it was hard to predict \u201cto what extent he\u2019s going to stick to statements that he made on the campaign trail\u201d. An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has been fired from her job and is being investigated because she told a disaster relief team she was directing in Florida after Hurricane Milton to avoid homes displaying election campaign signs supporting Donald Trump, conduct that the agency head on Saturday called \u201creprehensible\u201d. Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the federal agency, posted on X: More than 22,000 Fema employees every day adhere to Fema\u2019s core values and are dedicated to helping people before, during and after disasters, often sacrificing time with their own families to help disaster survivors.\u201d She continued: Recently, a Fema employee departed from these values to advise her survivor assistance team not go to homes with yard signs supporting president-elect Trump. This is a clear violation of Fema\u2019s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation.\u201d Hurricane Milton roared across the Gulf of Mexico and hit Florida last month, crossing the state before reaching the Atlantic Ocean, just two weeks after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida and then curved inland on a lethal path through Georgia and the Carolinas before dissipating in Tennessee. It killed 35 people. The Fema employee has not yet been officially identified, but Criswell said of the actions: This was reprehensible. I want to be clear to all of my employees and the American people, this type of behavior and action will not be tolerated at Fema and we will hold people accountable if they violate these standards of conduct.\u201d The agency has said it understood the conduct to be an isolated incident. The Daily Wire was the first to report on the actions of the employee, a supervisor, which it said it uncovered from internal correspondence. Donald Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he will not seek to join the president-elect\u2019s new administration but is ready to offer advice to his successor, including on how to strengthen sanctions on Iran and Russia and contain the growth of US debt, reports Reuters. In an interview, Mnuchin told Reuters it was important for the Treasury to work towards strengthening US trade policy. This includes holding Beijing to its US goods purchase commitments in Trump\u2019s January 2020 Phase One deal to rebalance US-China trade, which he said \u201cthey\u2019re not living up to.\u201d Serving as Treasury chief during Trump\u2019s first term \u201cwas the experience of a lifetime, and I\u2019m happy to advise on the outside,\u201d Mnuchin said on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have a lot of great choices.\u201d He declined to name any favourites. Reuters reported on Friday that two prominent hedge fund investors, Scott Bessent, founder of Key Square Group, and John Paulson had emerged as the top contenders for Treasury secretary, and that Bessent had met Trump. Mnuchin founded Liberty Strategic Capital, a private equity firm, after leaving office with investments from Softbank Group and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala sovereign wealth fund. A senior adviser to Donald Trump said that the incoming US administration\u2019s priority for Ukraine will be achieving peace rather than helping it regain territory captured by Russia in the almost three years of the war. In an interview with the BBC, broadcast on Saturday, Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser to Trump since his 2016 presidential campaign, began to elaborate on the strong signals the now president-elect had been sending to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the campaign trail. Lanza said: When Zelenskyy says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace, once Crimea is returned, we\u2019ve got news for President Zelenskyy: Crimea is gone.\u201d A spokesperson for Trump\u2019s presidential transition effort said later on Saturday that Lanza had not been speaking on behalf of the president-elect. Trump\u2019s transition effort is currently vetting personnel and drafting the policies that Trump could adopt during his second term. \u201cBryan Lanza was a contractor for the campaign. He does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him,\u201d said the spokesperson, who declined to be named. During the election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war \u201cwithin a day\u201d, but did not explain how he would do so. Russia is open to hearing Donald Trump\u2019s proposals on ending the war, an official said on Saturday. Sergei Ryabkov, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said Moscow and Washington were \u201cexchanging signals\u201d on Ukraine via \u201cclosed channels\u201d, according to the AP. He did not specify whether the communication was with the current administration or Trump and members of his incoming administration. A British minister said on Sunday that the government is unlikely to ask the Reform party leader Nigel Farage to act as an intermediary to deal with US president-elect Donald Trump. Farage is a friend of Trump and was at his election victory party in Florida. He has offered to act as an interlocutor between the UK government and the Trump administration, which takes power in January. The Treasury minister, Darren Jones, said on Sunday that the government would probably reject that offer, reports the PA news agency. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably unlikely,\u201d he told Sky News, saying Farage, who is a member of the UK parliament, should probably spend his time with his constituents rather than in the US. Farage said at the weekend he has \u201ca great relationship\u201d with Trump and would be willing to act as an intermediary for the government because it is in the national interest. Governments around the world are trying to figure out how to deal with Trump, who has promised to increase tariffs and whose first four-year term was characterized by a protectionist trade policy and isolationist rhetoric, including threats to withdraw from Nato. UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, delayed starting a recruitment process for a new ambassador to Washington until the result of the US election was known. The role will be crucial in the coming years in navigating the UK\u2019s relationship with the Trump administration. Here is a video report on the protests against Donald Trump in New York and Washington DC mentioned earlier: Protests against Donald Trump erupted in the US on Saturday as people on both coasts took to the streets in frustration about his re-election. Thousands of people in major cities including New York City and Seattle demonstrated against the former president and now president-elect amid his threats against reproductive rights and pledges to carry out mass deportations at the start of his upcoming presidency. In New York City on Saturday, demonstrators from advocacy groups focused on workers\u2019 rights and immigrant justice crowded outside Trump International Hotel and Tower on 5th Avenue holding signs that read: \u201cWe protect us\u201d and \u201cMr President, how long must women wait for liberty?\u201d Others held signs that read: \u201cWe won\u2019t back down\u201d while chanting: \u201cHere we are and we\u2019re not leaving!\u201d Similar protests took place in Washington DC, where Women\u2019s March participants demonstrated outside the Heritage Foundation, the rightwing thinktank behind Project 2025. Pictures posted on social media on Saturday showed demonstrators holding signs that read: \u201cWell-behaved women don\u2019t make history\u201d and \u201cYou are never alone\u201d. Demonstrators also chanted: \u201cWe believe that we will win!\u201d and held other signs that read: \u201cWhere\u2019s my liberty when I have no choice?\u201d Crowds of demonstrators also gathered outside Seattle\u2019s Space Needle on Saturday. \u201cMarch and rally to protest Trump and the two-party war machine,\u201d posters for the protests said, adding: \u201cBuild the people\u2019s movement and fight war, repression and genocide!\u201d Speaking to a crowd of demonstrators, some of whom dressed in raincoats while others wore keffiyehs in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel\u2019s deadly war on Gaza, one demonstrator said: \u201cAny president that has come to power has also let workers down.\u201d More on Murphy\u2019s comments today. The governor of New Jersey suggests his \u201cgut\u201d is telling him Trump could not pursue tariffs \u201cagainst allies like the UK\u201d. According to the PA news agency, Murphy told Sky News Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: Do I believe it? I\u2019m not sure. I think if you and I were sitting and speaking about the People\u2019s Republic of China, I\u2019d believe it.\u201d He added: I don\u2019t know that that makes sense \u2013 or even that he would pursue it against allies like the UK. My gut tells me no, but if I\u2019m China, I\u2019m fastening my seatbelt right now.\u201d The governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, said he thinks president-elect Donald Trump may look favourably on the UK choosing to leave the \u201cbureaucratic blob\u201d of the EU, reports the Press Association (PA). Asked about trade, the Democratic politician told the Sky News Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips program: I have a gut feeling that he looks at the UK\u2019s move out of the European Union which, by the way, I have to say was a huge mistake from my perspective. But from his perspective, I think it\u2019s, \u2018you know what? These guys had the courage to pull out of this big bureaucratic blob. And I, Donald Trump, have some sympathy with the renegade who has courage\u2019. I think there\u2019s some of that. I think that\u2019s a card that can be played, and we\u2019ll see.\u201d Scrambling to construct an administration in the wake of his shock victory eight years ago, Donald Trump looked far beyond his inner circle, and those who ardently embraced his agenda. Not this time. The president-elect has charged Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, and one of the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse his campaign, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his agenda. The CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, has made no secret of his plan to stack the new White House with loyalists \u2013 and keep out anyone who threatens to derail his pledges. Last time around, Trump \u201cpicked unfortunately\u201d, Lutnick told NewsNation last month, describing the hires he made in his first term as \u201cfreshman\u201d mistakes. \u201cHe\u2019s the CEO. Why would you pick someone who\u2019s going to try to go the other direction? That would be silly.\u201d Lutnick, who says he talks to Trump every day, was on the sidelines in 2016 and 2020 when his friend won and lost the presidency. In 2024, he went all in \u2013 raising millions of dollars and loudly making the case for his ally\u2019s political comeback Trump \u201cis going to build the greatest team to ever walk into government\u201d, Lutnick declared to a triumphant crowd at Madison Square Garden last month, with nine days left of the campaign. As transition co-chair, he is in charge of that construction. President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration, reports Reuters. \u201cI will not be inviting former ambassador Nikki Haley, or former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump administration, which is currently in formation,\u201d Trump posted on social media. \u201cI very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our country.\u201d Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his 20 January inauguration as president. Reuters reported on Friday that Trump met prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential US Treasury secretary nominee. Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries, reports Reuters. \u201cI was proud to work with President Trump defending America at the United Nations,\u201d Haley wrote on X. \u201cI wish him, and all who serve, great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America over the next four years.\u201d Pompeo, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under Trump, had been mentioned in some media reports as a possible defense secretary and was also seen as a potential Republican presidential candidate, before he announced in April 2023 he would not run. Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday, according to Reuters. Separately, Trump said the 2025 presidential inauguration will be co-chaired by real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff and former Senator Kelly Loeffler.

It has breakdowns of votes by state here: And the House, Senate and governor elections map and results can be found here: The Associated Press (AP) reports that three other US House races in Arizona were too early to call on Saturday, most notably the first and sixth congressional districts. Republican David Schweikert is seeking an eighth term in the affluent first congressional district that includes north Phoenix, Scottsdale, Fountain Hills and Paradise Valley. His challenger is Democratic former state representative Amish Shah. The sixth congressional district race pits Republican Juan Ciscomani against Democrat Kirsten Engel, whom he narrowly beat two years ago. The district runs from Tucson east to the New Mexico state line and includes a stretch of the Arizona-Mexico border. The US Senate race in Arizona between Democratic Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War veteran, and Republican Kari Lake, a well-known former television news anchor and staunch Donald Trump ally, also remained too early to call on Saturday according to AP. Republican US representative Eli Crane won reelection in a Republican-leaning congressional district covering vast swaths of rural Arizona, reports the Associated Press (AP). Crane faced Democrat Jonathan Nez, the former Navajo Nation president, in the second district race. Nez was vying to become the first Native American to represent Arizona in Congress. In a statement late Saturday, Crane commended Nez for entering the race and thanked voters. Crane wrote: I will continue using every tool in my arsenal to fight against the corruption and selfish interests of the DC elites to put rural Arizonans FIRST. I\u2019m laser-focused on working with President Trump to lower inflation, secure the border and return to peace through strength.\u201d The district covers much of north-eastern Arizona and dips south to the northern Tucson suburbs. Nez said in a statement late on Saturday that he called Crane to congratulate him on a hard-fought victory. \u201cAlthough we didn\u2019t get the outcome we hoped for, the work we began together is not over,\u201d Nez wrote. Crane, a former Navy Seal who served in the military for 13 years, is a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and a staunch ally of president-elect Donald Trump, who won Arizona. Crane was among eight US House Republicans nationally who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as House speaker in 2023. Donald Trump won the presidential election in Arizona, the Associated Press (AP) declared on Saturday, completing a clean sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive electoral college victory over the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris. Trump, who had secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House by early Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris\u2019s 226. The win returned the state to the Republican column after Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory and marked Trump\u2019s second victory in Arizona since 2016. Trump had campaigned on border security and the economy, tying Harris to inflation and record illegal border crossings during Biden\u2019s administration. Trump has also won the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump by winning six of the seven swing states \u2013 he narrowly lost North Carolina \u2013 and won 306 electoral college votes to Trump\u2019s 232. Trump also won 306 in his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton. The Ap said Trump has won 74.6m votes nationwide, or 50.5%, to Harris\u2019 70.9m, or 48%. Meanwhile, Republican US representative Eli Crane won reelection to a US House seat representing Arizona\u2019s second congressional district. The freshman lawmaker defeated former Navajo Nation president, Jonathan Nez, who was vying to become the state\u2019s first Native American representative. In a statement late on Saturday, Crane commended Nez for entering the race and thanked voters. More on that in a moment, but first, here are the latest developments in US politics: Protests against Trump erupted in the US on Saturday as people on both coasts took to the streets in frustration about his re-election. Thousands of people in major cities including New York City and Seattle demonstrated against the former president and now president-elect amid his threats against reproductive rights and pledges to carry out mass deportations at the start of his upcoming presidency. Biden and Trump will meet on Wednesday in the Oval Office, the White House announced on Saturday. \u201cAt President Biden\u2019s invitation, President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday,\u201d the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in a statement. Republicans on Saturday appeared close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for Trump to advance his agenda when the president-elect returns to the White House in January. The AP reported that three US House races in Arizona were too early to call on Saturday, most notably the first and sixth congressional districts. The president-elect has charged Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, and one of the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse his campaign, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his agenda. The CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, has made no secret of his plan to stack the new White House with loyalists \u2013 and keep out anyone who threatens to derail his pledges. A senior adviser to Trump said that the incoming US administration\u2019s priority for Ukraine will be achieving peace rather than helping it regain territory captured by Russia in the almost three years of the war. In an interview with the BBC, broadcast on Saturday, Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser to Trump since his 2016 presidential campaign, said: \u201cWhen Zelenskyy says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace, once Crimea is returned, we\u2019ve got news for President Zelenskyy: Crimea is gone.\u201d An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has been fired from her job and is being investigated because she told a disaster relief team she was directing in Florida after Hurricane Milton to avoid homes displaying election campaign signs supporting Trump, conduct that the agency head on Saturday called \u201creprehensible\u201d.",

The US president-elect advised the Russian president not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of \u201cWashington\u2019s sizeable military presence in Europe\u201d, the Post reported. It added that Trump expressed interest in follow-up conversations on \u201cthe resolution of Ukraine\u2019s war soon\u201d. During the election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war \u201cwithin a day\u201d, but did not explain how he would do so. According to one former US official who was familiar with the call and spoke to the Washington Post, Trump probably does not want to begin his second presidential term with an escalation in the Ukraine war, \u201cgiving him incentive to want to keep the war from worsening\u201d.

Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of US military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticised and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry disputed a claim in the Washington Post article that Kyiv was informed of the call and did not object to the conversation taking place. \u201cReports that the Ukrainian side was informed in advance of the alleged call are false. Subsequently, Ukraine could not have endorsed or opposed the call,\u201d a foreign ministry spokesperson, Heorhii Tykhyi, told Reuters. On Friday, the Kremlin said Putin was ready to discuss Ukraine with Trump but that it did not mean that he was willing to alter Moscow\u2019s demands. On 14 June, Putin set out his terms for an end to the war: Ukraine would have to drop its Nato ambitions and withdraw all its troops from all the territory of four regions claimed by Russia. Ukraine rejected that, saying it would be tantamount to capitulation, and that Zelenskyy had put forward a \u201cvictory plan\u201d that includes requests for additional military support from the west.

The revised forecast from Hamptons came days after Halifax and Nationwide banks said the annual rate of property price growth had slowed, with the former saying it was likely to be \u201cmodest \u2026 for the rest of this year and into next\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Red wine was once heralded as a boon for health that could protect the heart and even extend life expectancy. But while scientists have debunked this claim, they believe that at least one red wine ingredient \u2013 a compound called resveratrol \u2013 may hold genuine health benefits.</p> <p>A trial launched this week will assess whether a low dose of the chemical, also found in red grapes, blueberries and peanuts, could help keep bowel cancer at bay. The study, one of the largest to date testing drugs for cancer prevention, will recruit patients who are at risk of the disease.</p> <p>\u201cWith the Colo-Prevent trial, we are embarking on a unique experiment to see how drugs could stop bowel polyps from growing,\u201d said Prof Karen Brown, a cancer researcher at the University of Leicester and the trial\u2019s lead investigator. \u201cThis trial could have big implications for how we prevent bowel cancer in people who are most likely to develop the disease as they get older.\u201d</p> <p>The trial builds on more than a decade of work by Brown\u2019s lab, which previously found that purified resveratrol can slow tumour growth in mice and can reach the bowel undigested.</p> <p>The trial is recruiting people aged between 50 and 73 who have taken part in the NHS bowel screening programme and been found to have bowel polyps, small growths that are usually not serious but can develop into cancer if left untreated. Patients will have their polyps removed and will be given either aspirin by itself or a combination of aspirin and metformin (a diabetes drug) daily for three years, for the main trial.</p> <p>Others will take purified resveratrol or a placebo for one year as part of a sub-study. Drinking red wine does not prevent cancer and alcohol is a known cause of cancer.</p> <p>All patients will then be given a colonoscopy to determine if the polyps have started growing again. If the trial is successful, any of the treatments tested could be offered to people eligible for the NHS bowel screening programme to reduce the risk of bowel polyps forming, and with that reduce the risk of bowel cancer in the future.</p> <p>David Trusler, 66, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire is one of the first patients to take part in the Colo-Prevent trial and said he was participating for his father, who died with bowel cancer when Trusler was a teenager.</p> <p>Trusler was successfully treated for prostate cancer 11 years ago and has since been taking part in the bowel cancer monitoring programme. In June, he had an abnormal result.</p> <p>\u201cMy first thought was \u2018Oh no, not again,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was really nervous about what they might find.\u201d</p> <p>Doctors did not find cancer but discovered two polyps, which could become cancer in the future. \u201cI\u2019m taking part in this trial for my dad, to give future generations the kind of treatments he never had,\u201d said Trusler.</p> <p>Brown said there were effective ways to reduce bowel cancer by changes to lifestyle, including stopping smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol consumption and reducing red and processed meat consumption. She added: \u201cScreening has made huge progress in picking up bowel cancers in those most at risk. But to improve outcomes further, we need to prevent more bowel cancers emerging in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with an estimated 44,000 people each year receiving the diagnosis, and it is the second most common cause of cancer death.</p> <p>Dr Iain Foulkes, the executive director of research and innovation at Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cThis trial opens the door to a new era of cancer research, where cancer becomes much more preventable through cutting-edge science. The insights gained from the trial will change how we think about cancer prevention and give more people the chance of longer, better lives, free from the fear of cancer.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Red wine was once heralded as a boon for health that could protect the heart and even extend life expectancy. But while scientists have debunked this claim, they believe that at least one red wine ingredient \u2013 a compound called resveratrol \u2013 may hold genuine health benefits. A trial launched this week will assess whether a low dose of the chemical, also found in red grapes, blueberries and peanuts, could help keep bowel cancer at bay. The study, one of the largest to date testing drugs for cancer prevention, will recruit patients who are at risk of the disease. \u201cWith the Colo-Prevent trial, we are embarking on a unique experiment to see how drugs could stop bowel polyps from growing,\u201d said Prof Karen Brown, a cancer researcher at the University of Leicester and the trial\u2019s lead investigator. \u201cThis trial could have big implications for how we prevent bowel cancer in people who are most likely to develop the disease as they get older.\u201d The trial builds on more than a decade of work by Brown\u2019s lab, which previously found that purified resveratrol can slow tumour growth in mice and can reach the bowel undigested. The trial is recruiting people aged between 50 and 73 who have taken part in the NHS bowel screening programme and been found to have bowel polyps, small growths that are usually not serious but can develop into cancer if left untreated. Patients will have their polyps removed and will be given either aspirin by itself or a combination of aspirin and metformin (a diabetes drug) daily for three years, for the main trial. Others will take purified resveratrol or a placebo for one year as part of a sub-study. Drinking red wine does not prevent cancer and alcohol is a known cause of cancer. All patients will then be given a colonoscopy to determine if the polyps have started growing again. If the trial is successful, any of the treatments tested could be offered to people eligible for the NHS bowel screening programme to reduce the risk of bowel polyps forming, and with that reduce the risk of bowel cancer in the future. David Trusler, 66, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire is one of the first patients to take part in the Colo-Prevent trial and said he was participating for his father, who died with bowel cancer when Trusler was a teenager. Trusler was successfully treated for prostate cancer 11 years ago and has since been taking part in the bowel cancer monitoring programme. In June, he had an abnormal result. \u201cMy first thought was \u2018Oh no, not again,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was really nervous about what they might find.\u201d Doctors did not find cancer but discovered two polyps, which could become cancer in the future. \u201cI\u2019m taking part in this trial for my dad, to give future generations the kind of treatments he never had,\u201d said Trusler. Brown said there were effective ways to reduce bowel cancer by changes to lifestyle, including stopping smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol consumption and reducing red and processed meat consumption. She added: \u201cScreening has made huge progress in picking up bowel cancers in those most at risk. But to improve outcomes further, we need to prevent more bowel cancers emerging in the first place.\u201d Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with an estimated 44,000 people each year receiving the diagnosis, and it is the second most common cause of cancer death. Dr Iain Foulkes, the executive director of research and innovation at Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cThis trial opens the door to a new era of cancer research, where cancer becomes much more preventable through cutting-edge science. The insights gained from the trial will change how we think about cancer prevention and give more people the chance of longer, better lives, free from the fear of cancer.\u201d",

They were also more than five times higher than the 151,581 recorded for pregnancy and childbirth-related problems and 143,624 recorded for cancer. Asthma + Lung UK claims the number of unplanned stays in hospital for breathing problems is so high because of a \u201ccollapse in care for people with lung conditions\u201d in recent years. A record low number of people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (bronchitis or emphysema) (COPD) are getting the five aspects of lung care needed to keep them healthy, such as vaccination against winter flu or help to stop smoking, the charity said.

      "bodyText": "Increasing numbers of UK-trained nurses are set to leave the profession in England within a decade of registering, in a trend that could jeopardise the government\u2019s overhaul of healthcare, according to a union. More than 11,000 will have quit the register within their first 10 years on it, according to analysis by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) of the latest official figures. Low staffing levels, increasing patient need and poor morale were among the factors cited by the largest nursing union, which examined data kept by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), the regulator for nurses and midwives in the UK, and nursing associates in England. Prof Nicola Ranger, the RCN\u2019s general secretary and chief executive, said: \u201cNursing is an incredible career, and it should be one for life, but thousands are quitting early because they are burnt out, underpaid and demoralised. \u201cIt is a perfect storm for ministers as thousands leave the profession early and student recruitment collapses. It\u2019s also a heartbreaking state of affairs for those who want to spend their lives caring for others.\u201d Ranger said the health secretary, Wes Streeting, needed to give nurses \u201ca reason to stay\u201d and she called for new investment in nursing, better pay and waiving the loans of whose who commit to the career in the NHS and public sector. The number of nurses leaving within 10 years of registering increased by 43% between 2021 and 2024, according to the union\u2019s analysis. Those leaving within five years was found to have risen by 67%. Those leaving nursing are a combination of newly qualified nursing staff and experienced staff who had returned from retirement during the pandemic. The RCN\u2019s own survey of those departing found that nurses cited poor physical and mental health, burnout or exhaustion and changes in personal circumstances as key reasons for leaving the profession outside retirement. The concerns were raised after the government last month launched a consultation on its 10-year plan to transform the NHS, which includes a long-term workforce plan intended to increase the number of nurses from about 350,000 to 550,000 in 2036-37. The plan, which is to be published next year, is intended to be underpinned by three big themes: a shift from \u201chospital to community with new neighbourhood health centres, digitisation and sickness prevention. Separately, the government has been targeting the hospital backlog in England, with plans to increase the number of appointments and operations each week by 40,000. Labour made a pledge before the general election that a target to start treatment within 18 weeks for most NHS patients in England would be hit within five years. Streeting, also pledged while in opposition that Labour would oversee \u201cthe biggest expansion of NHS staff in history\u201d and that they would be told to work on evenings and weekends to help cut back waiting times. The government faces other winds aside from nurses leaving the workforce. In September, nurses in England rejected the 5.5% pay rise they were given for this year. The RCN says the value of experienced nurses\u2019 pay dropped by 25% under the various Conservative governments between 2010 and 2024.
