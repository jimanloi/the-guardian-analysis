      "body": "<p>Fashion\u2019s longstanding love of heritage and dressing up in the style of those attending country-house weekends has dominated the runways this season, from Chlo\u00e9\u2019s cape silhouette plaid coat to Wales Bonner\u2019s check barn jacket styled over a dark tweed two piece. Meanwhile labels such as Margaret Howell and Stefan Cooke have adopted hardwearing tweed, styled with denim or paired with a knit, and heavy-duty wool trousers in a palette of autumn hues, from mustard, olive green and russet to rich chestnut brown. It\u2019s a look suitable for long walks in the countryside, with textured wool coats layered over quilted and canvas barn jackets, such as Mango\u2019s contrasting collar version (6, below) or Sezane\u2019s flap pocket design in camel, \u00a3285.</p> <p>Knitwear is the foundation to this look, an argyle cardigan or jumper that\u2019s reminiscent of Brideshead Revisited, the Mitford sisters and off-duty royals at Balmoral.

      "bodyText": "For decades, visitors have flocked to Collingwood Children\u2019s Farm on the banks of Melbourne\u2019s Yarra River. The not-for-profit community farm, founded in 1979, is renowned for providing a serene slice of country life in the city for children, school students, people with disabilities and families. Nestled between a tree-lined bend of the Yarra and the suburban streets of Abbotsford, sheep graze in paddocks and peacocks roam around the site. For Lucille Le Meledo, 24, who has autism, the farm became a safe haven as she volunteered weekly at CCF with her NDIS-funded support worker from 2022. But that ended abruptly in June, when the CCF\u2019s volunteer schemes for NDIS participants and specialist schools \u2013 known as the Seeding Skills and Beyond Books programs \u2013 ground to a halt, with the farm citing \u201cfinancial constraints\u201d. \u201cAs an autistic person with severe mental health issues, studying or working full-time in my current state is near impossible,\u201d Le Meledo says. \u201cMy experiences volunteering at the farm were immensely healing and productive. It is the perfect opportunity for someone who struggles with social anxiety and overstimulating environments to work at their own pace.\u201d She is now hoping to reinstate the program. Le Meledo and her mother, the Australian performer Debra Byrne, this week secured two seats on the farm\u2019s 12-person committee of management that governs the not-for-profit. Their new roles come more than five months after the CCF\u2019s chief executive, Bert Ferro, wrote to people involved in the Seeding Skills program to say it would be \u201cpaused\u201d. Guardian Australia has confirmed a similar letter was sent to specialist schools. \u201cUnfortunately, due to financial constraints we have had to make the difficult decision to pause the program with effect from 17 June,\u201d Ferro said in the 27 May letter. \u201cThe decision was not made lightly, but it is a necessary one to ensure the long-term sustainability of our community programs.\u201d The letter said the farm would develop a \u201ccomprehensive business plan\u201d to ensure the programs were sustainable and \u201cbetter equipped to serve our community\u201d during the pause. Ferro told Guardian Australia CCF had been a \u201ccornerstone of community engagement for decades\u201d by \u201coffering a welcoming space where people of all ages and backgrounds can connect with nature, animals, and each other\u201d. \u201cJust like the community we serve, we are continuously changing and evolving to meet the changing needs of our participants and the community. While some activities may shift, our commitment to fostering connection, skill development, and inclusivity remains at the heart of everything we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a not-for-profit dedicated to social inclusion, our programs have long supported children, families, and individuals experiencing adversity through hands-on learning and community connection.\u201d Ferro pointed to the existing volunteer programs \u2013 the Young Farmer Program \u2013 funded by Yarra city council \u2013 and the farm\u2019s \u201cvibrant volunteer program\u201d, which he said included \u201cseveral long-term volunteers of varying ability\u201d. \u2018Sole excuse to leave my house\u2019 The Seeding Skills program for NDIS participants, along with the scheme for specialist schools, provided hands-on farm experience to participants, including caring for animals, cleaning pens, creating bird houses to sell to the public and gardening. Chloe Paul, founder of Having a Yarn \u2013 a company that offers support work and counselling for people with disabilities \u2013 says finding long-term volunteering opportunities for her clients that allow for some flexibility of hours was difficult. \u201cWhat the farm was doing is the only of its kind,\u201d Paul says. Byrne says her daughter \u201cthrived\u201d at the farm. \u201cIt is a unique place,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect place for people with sensory issues to be included and grow their confidence.\u201d Le Meledo has described the farm as her \u201csole excuse to leave my house and socialise\u201d for a year and a half. The farm says its primary aim is to \u201cimprove the lives of children, the disadvantaged, disabled, unemployed and marginalised persons\u201d. It hosts events and is mainly funded via entry fees and wedding bookings. Other revenue streams include memberships, donations and sales of produce, according to its website and information lodged with the charities regulator. Covid threatened the farm\u2019s financial viability, with lockdowns forcing the farm to close its gate to its 15,000 monthly visitors and rehome some animals. The CCF\u2019s latest annual report reported deficits of $256,457 in 2022-23 and $478,836 in the previous year. A former employee, who requested anonymity to discuss the farm\u2019s operations, says the CCF introduced a modest fee for some organisations involved in its community volunteer programs last year. \u201cWe were attempting to make the community programs more financially sustainable,\u201d they say. The farm\u2019s continuing volunteer program is open to the general public. But the former employee says it was not tailored to people with a disability. The programs for NDIS participants and specialist schools saw staff meet with support workers and organisations to better understand the needs and aims of participants, and ensure there was appropriate staff supervision, the former employee says. Byrne says she wants to use her new role to encourage the farm to revive its community program that is \u201cinclusive for all people\u201d. \u201c[Le Meledo] would come home happy. She would come home feeling like she\u2019d done something that was of a purpose.\u201d",

Since getting a whiff of that stinky Proustian nappy, Hodge has been hard at work on bringing the musical adaptation of his favourite childhood show to life. Round the Twist: The Musical finally premiered in Brisbane this week.</p> <p>It has been a long road to get here. To make it happen, Hodge had to convince the Australian Children\u2019s Television Foundation, which holds the rights to Round the Twist, to give him the green light. But it was important to him to also get the approval of Jennings himself \u2013 so Hodge flew to Melbourne to meet both the author and the foundation and passionately sell them on his vision.</p> <p>It worked. The ACTF, which had turned down other hopeful playwrights in the past, was swayed by Hodge\u2019s understanding of what made Jennings\u2019 work special. Jennings says he found the script \u201cclever and funny\u201d and has continued to get together with Hodge once or twice a year since their first meeting.</p>    <p>Once the rights were secured and the pandemic waited out, the seasoned theatre director Simon Phillips came on board. For him, Round the Twist: The Musical is a rare chance to excite millennials about a musical \u2013 and bring in a different crowd to the curious mix of teenage girls and well-heeled boomers who usually make up his audiences.</p> <p>\u201cI was so thrilled to find something that [millennials] went, \u2018Yay, that\u2019s the thing I wanted to see turned into a musical,\u2019\u201d Phillips says down the phone from Brisbane, during a break from rehearsals. \u201cI\u2019d been looking for a project that got that reaction from people of that generation \u2013 not all the grizzly old people I meet.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips, who is in his 60s and thus firmly outside the original Round the Twist target market, \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about\u201d the show before taking the project on. Instead of diving into the show\u2019s back catalogue, Phillips initially avoided watching any episodes, aware that the production needed to work for those who had never seen the show as much as it did for fans. That distance allowed him to be a \u201cfresh pair of eyes\u201d to ensure the musical had a coherent narrative as well as the nostalgia factor.</p> <p>He and Hodge, the Round the Twist superfan, were the perfect odd couple to make the musical sing. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d say, but why is this here? I just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cAnd Paul would say, \u2018Well you couldn\u2019t do Round the Twist if that wasn\u2019t there \u2013 it\u2019s one of the bits that everyone loves.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>The team does not want to give away too much detail of the musical\u2019s plot but Hodge will say that the story is \u201cincredibly true to the TV show\u201d, particularly the first two seasons.</p> <p>Of course, not every moment can make it into a two and a half-hour stage production. Hodge trawled the internet to determine what the most popular Round the Twist episodes were, and landed on three: Smelly Feat, where \u201cUp the pong!\u201d came from; Nails, an episode about a boy growing fingernails under his skin and turning slowly into a merman; and Without My Pants, in which Pete suffers a verbal tic where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTaCIAIczfw&amp;ab_channel=TwistedLunchbox-Australia%E2%80%99sBestKidsTV\">every sentence he utters is followed by the words \u201cwithout my pants\u201d</a> \u2013 the sort of silly but undeniable premise Round the Twist so often hit for six.</p>    <p>Adapting the show into a musical was the easy bit, Hodge says, thanks in no small part to its unforgettable theme song. (Unsurprisingly, \u201ca very, very important part of the musical\u201d.) It is his hope that the musical will travel \u2013 perhaps to the UK, where Round the Twist was phenomenally popular.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise when I started writing it how well known it is outside of Australia,\u201d Hodge says. \u201cIt was probably even bigger in the UK than it is in Australia. It premiered on the BBC first, because Channel Seven was dragging their feet about airing it \u2013 so the BBC had already aired it, and was already asking for a second season, before Australia had even seen it.\u201d</p> <p>After years of work, Hodge is excited to unveil the musical \u2013 and hopes it will be as beloved by today\u2019s kids as the show was by 90s kids such as himself.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a story of a kid coming up to Paul Jennings at a book signing, saying, \u2018How do you know what it\u2019s like to be me?\u2019 And I think that is just who Paul is,\u201d Hodge says.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very good at doing the funny, silly and bizarre things. He really understands the not-so-fun part of being a kid, the times when you feel embarrassed or anxious or scared or are dealing with things like your first kiss. His work has a lot of authenticity to it \u2013 I think that\u2019s why it stays with people.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://queenslandtheatre.com.au/plays/round-the-twist-the-musical\">Round the Twist: the Musical</a> is at the Playhouse Theatre, Qpac, in Brisbane until 8 December</em></p></li> </ul>",

For him, Round the Twist: The Musical is a rare chance to excite millennials about a musical \u2013 and bring in a different crowd to the curious mix of teenage girls and well-heeled boomers who usually make up his audiences. \u201cI was so thrilled to find something that [millennials] went, \u2018Yay, that\u2019s the thing I wanted to see turned into a musical,\u2019\u201d Phillips says down the phone from Brisbane, during a break from rehearsals. \u201cI\u2019d been looking for a project that got that reaction from people of that generation \u2013 not all the grizzly old people I meet.\u201d Phillips, who is in his 60s and thus firmly outside the original Round the Twist target market, \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about\u201d the show before taking the project on. Instead of diving into the show\u2019s back catalogue, Phillips initially avoided watching any episodes, aware that the production needed to work for those who had never seen the show as much as it did for fans. That distance allowed him to be a \u201cfresh pair of eyes\u201d to ensure the musical had a coherent narrative as well as the nostalgia factor. He and Hodge, the Round the Twist superfan, were the perfect odd couple to make the musical sing. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d say, but why is this here? I just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cAnd Paul would say, \u2018Well you couldn\u2019t do Round the Twist if that wasn\u2019t there \u2013 it\u2019s one of the bits that everyone loves.\u2019\u201d The team does not want to give away too much detail of the musical\u2019s plot but Hodge will say that the story is \u201cincredibly true to the TV show\u201d, particularly the first two seasons. Of course, not every moment can make it into a two and a half-hour stage production. Hodge trawled the internet to determine what the most popular Round the Twist episodes were, and landed on three: Smelly Feat, where \u201cUp the pong!\u201d came from; Nails, an episode about a boy growing fingernails under his skin and turning slowly into a merman; and Without My Pants, in which Pete suffers a verbal tic where every sentence he utters is followed by the words \u201cwithout my pants\u201d \u2013 the sort of silly but undeniable premise Round the Twist so often hit for six. Adapting the show into a musical was the easy bit, Hodge says, thanks in no small part to its unforgettable theme song. (Unsurprisingly, \u201ca very, very important part of the musical\u201d.) It is his hope that the musical will travel \u2013 perhaps to the UK, where Round the Twist was phenomenally popular. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise when I started writing it how well known it is outside of Australia,\u201d Hodge says. \u201cIt was probably even bigger in the UK than it is in Australia. It premiered on the BBC first, because Channel Seven was dragging their feet about airing it \u2013 so the BBC had already aired it, and was already asking for a second season, before Australia had even seen it.\u201d After years of work, Hodge is excited to unveil the musical \u2013 and hopes it will be as beloved by today\u2019s kids as the show was by 90s kids such as himself. \u201cThere\u2019s a story of a kid coming up to Paul Jennings at a book signing, saying, \u2018How do you know what it\u2019s like to be me?\u2019 And I think that is just who Paul is,\u201d Hodge says. \u201cHe\u2019s very good at doing the funny, silly and bizarre things. He really understands the not-so-fun part of being a kid, the times when you feel embarrassed or anxious or scared or are dealing with things like your first kiss. His work has a lot of authenticity to it \u2013 I think that\u2019s why it stays with people.\u201d Round the Twist: the Musical is at the Playhouse Theatre, Qpac, in Brisbane until 8 December",

The converted former lingerie factory in a cul de sac off Lygon Street in the inner-north suburb of Brunswick has been a not-for-profit artist and activist space since 2001 but is now facing an uncertain future as urban gentrification and council regulations close in. The not-for-profit collective-run warehouse now provides affordable rent to about 30 artists working in an array of mediums including sculpture, circus, puppetry, film and dance. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads But like many other noncommercial creative workplaces in inner Melbourne, Irene warehouse is facing what its co-caretaker Jordan Brown describes as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d. After a visit from council building inspectors in February the tenants received a building notice in March informing them of an extensive list of building upgrades including repairing fire extinguishers and hydrants, installing exit lighting, servicing all stairways and fixing roof leaks. They now have until 25 November to comply to avoid hefty fines and a building order to demolish all internal structures \u2013 basically to gut the place. \u201cIt makes us feel precarious here \u2013 if we don\u2019t meet the requirements we are out,\u201d says Brown, stressing that they have been working constructively with the council and their landlord to try to comply thus far. \u201cOur problem is that much of the studio infrastructure was built in such a haphazard way that it\u2019s hard now to bring it up to modern standards. It does feel like an existential threat.\u201d In response to questions from Guardian Australia, a spokesperson for Merri-Bek city council said it was \u201ccommitted to ensuring the safety of all building occupants and the public\u201d. \u201cCouncil supports the provision of arts and civic spaces for our community to use and enjoy, and we have a responsibility to ensure that buildings are safe for people,\u201d a statement said. The warehouse has set up a fundraising page to try to meet the requirements, but for Alex Kelly, one of 25 people who co-founded Irene in 2001, such places remain a vital and precious part of Melbourne\u2019s cultural and political landscape that must be retained. She speaks of the early days of the warehouse as a time when a number of independent media publications including the Paper and Indymedia were established, along with groups including a bike co-op, Food not Bombs, Barricade books and innumerable art projects \u2013 as well as staging of wild warehouse parties. \u201cAffordable and creative spaces where artists and organisers can experiment, collaborate and learn from each other are essential,\u201d she says. Today, the walls of Irene reveal layer upon layer of artists having worked here \u2013 including stencil art and more detailed paintings, painted slogans include \u201cLook up \u2013 our sky is sick\u201d and \u201cPoliticians are not shamans\u201d amid remnants of its former industrial past. Iona Julian-Walters is an interdisciplinary artist who shares a small studio here with her former RMIT art school friend, Alison Newman. They had to relocate to this studio after the building inspectors insisted the mezzanine studios upstairs be discontinued. Like other artists, Julian-Walters says she moved to Irene after her previous studio in another building was bought by a developer and they all had to find new digs. \u201cI feel so lucky to be here \u2013 there\u2019s something about this place where you can really feel the history here \u2013 it feels really special to be connected to a long line of people that have been here making really anti-establishment art in Melbourne,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat kind of society are we living in if we can\u2019t provide spaces for artists to make art?\u201d The film-maker and animator Lukas Schrank, who works from a well-designed, sparsely decorated ground floor studio, shares a similar story of having moved to Irene when his Collingwood studio made way for upmarket apartments. \u201cWhen I first moved in here during Covid I was sharing this studio with a family of possums who had burrowed into the wall through the broken windows \u2013 so the first thing I had to do was move them out and perspex the windows,\u201d he says, adding that he likes the grunginess and diversity of Irene as opposed to \u201cnicer\u201d commercial studios that charge six times the rent. \u201cMany of us share that lived experience of coming from other studio spaces that have been squeezed out because of gentrification,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that the rent is affordable means I can focus on doing pro-bono community work rather than having to take work just to pay the bills.\u201d Alex Kelly believes the loss of Irene would reverberate far beyond the warehouse\u2019s walls. \u201cEvery city around the world that has gentrified and closed its squats and warehouses ends up regretting it and trying to design back in the innovation and dynamism that these kinds of places bring,\u201d she says. \u201cIrene is a rare gem that so many people have used for myriad low-budget projects, recordings and political organising \u2013 it\u2019s precious.\u201d",

But Bogemann, the president of the National Union of Students and entering her final year of her arts degree at the University of Melbourne, says the election promise is a \u201cband-aid solution\u201d to a deeply flawed system. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThey\u2019re acknowledging [student debts] are a burden but not introducing measures to alleviate the problem long term \u2013 they\u2019re not going far enough,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are almost confused by it \u2026 we know it\u2019s not going to be a meaningful change.\u201d The bigger issue, Bogemann says, is Morrison\u2019s widely criticised job ready graduates (JRG) scheme and the inequitable pricing of degrees \u2013 which means she pays $2,000 for a politics subject and just $500 for her second major, French. The scheme reduced the overall government contribution to degrees from 58% to 52%, raising student contributions to 48%. It also increased fees for some courses, including humanities, to fund cuts incentivising students to study teaching, nursing, maths, science and engineering. \u201cJRG has been an egregious, massive failure,\u201d Bogemann says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t change what I wanted to study, but I see black and white how it\u2019s impacting me. There\u2019s a lot of anxiety among young people, and a lack of student voices driving these changes.\u201d The minister for education, Jason Clare, has hinted further reforms to the costing of degrees will be announced before parliament concludes this year, cementing student debt as a key election issue. He told Guardian Australia Labor was working to reduce student loan burdens while acknowledging there was \u201cmore work to do\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will establish the Australian Tertiary Education Commission to steer further reform here, including providing advice around the setting of course fees,\u201d he says. Students \u2018actively discouraged\u2019 from arts Peak bodies have welcomed the promised slashing of debt and the raising of the minimum repayment threshold, but questioned why the government has sat a full term in office without touching a scheme that has received universal condemnation from universities, students, academics, its own party and policy experts. Last December the Australian Universities Accord panel handed its final report to Clare, which made a series of recommendations to improve the structure of course fees \u2013 including abolishing JRG as \u201csoon as possible\u201d. In its place, it recommended a new higher education funding model that would tie student contributions to \u201cfuture earnings potential\u201d of each field of study. The greater the anticipated future income, the greater the fee. Instead of enacting the changes, Labor has tasked the yet-to-be-established ATEC with overhauling JRG, a body recommended in the accord to be a steward of the tertiary system. The vice-chancellor of Western Sydney University, Prof George Williams, says students couldn\u2019t wait for a \u201cyet to be established ATEC to potentially deal with the high cost of arts and humanities courses\u201d. \u201cWe need to fix this unfinished business now \u2026 to fix Australia\u2019s broken higher education system,\u201d he says. \u201cWe continue to call for immediate action to deal with the root of the debt spiral problem. The system for setting student fees in the first place is broken and deeply unfair. The fact that a three-year arts degree now costs $50,000 is actively discouraging some students from considering or staying at university.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s not enough\u2019 Fourth year arts student at the University of Sydney, Zeina Khochaiche, pays between $1,800 and $2,100 a subject. Her debt is already in excess of $50,000, with a further $16,992 expected to come with honours. She says the 20% cut to debt is helpful in theory \u2013 but feels like a \u201clast-ditch effort\u201d to appeal to university students, and comes with the caveat Labor has to win the election. \u201cNewly enrolled students aren\u2019t assisted, and arts degrees are still $8,000 a semester,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d The chief executive of Universities Australia, Luke Sheehy, says JRG has reduced university funding by about $800m a year, placing institutions under \u201chuge financial strain\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re calling on the government to consider the overall cost of degrees as a matter of priority,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need a funding system that both incentivises more Australians to study and recognises the benefits that a university education brings, regardless of the discipline.\u201d \u2018No evidence\u2019 applicants changed preferences The president of the Australian Historical Association, Michelle Arrow, says cutting student debt does nothing to grapple with underlying problems that \u201cengulf\u201d higher education. \u201cOver the past 20 years, the average debt for a graduate in their 20s has doubled \u2026 [and] the largest share of that collective debt burden falls most heavily on those who are poorly placed to pay it off,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil the JRG package has been abolished \u2026 the Hecs Help system will remain manifestly unfair.\u201d A 2022 Productivity Commission report found there was \u201cno evidence\u201d making degrees cheaper encouraged students to enrol or complete them, because loans were tied to future income and didn\u2019t need to be paid off immediately. Similarly, a University of Melbourne study released this week revealed only 1.5% of university applicants chose their fields as a result of the scheme \u2013 moving from humanities, arts, law and business to Stem and teaching. The Greens deputy leader and higher education spokesperson, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, has promised to wipe student debt entirely, estimated to cost $74bn over the decade. When the federal government\u2019s student support bill is debated on Monday, Faruqi will push Labor to legislate its pledge to cut 20% of student debt immediately and not wait until after the next election. The measures, announced in the federal budget, would cut about $3bn in student debt by capping the indexation rate for Hecs and Help loans \u2013 tying them to whichever is the lower of the consumer price index or wage price index. Amendments put forward by Faruqi will challenge Labor to also legislate the 20% debt relief in the bill. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason to wait to legislate these changes until after the next election,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly irresponsible and cruel to be dangling student debt relief to win votes \u2026 when Labor is in government and we have the opportunity and the numbers to do this now.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For Harry Kane, it has been a time for straight-talking. The England captain did row back slightly on his comments from Wednesday \u2013 the bombshell ones when he wondered whether the unprecedented number of withdrawals from the squad for this window was the result of players \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of a tough period in the season.</p> <p>At one point, as Kane took a break from the preparations for Sunday\u2019s Nations League tie against Republic of Ireland at Wembley \u2013 the final game of Lee Carsley\u2019s interim tenure \u2013 he expressed a surprise at the wall-to-wall coverage his words had driven. Memo to Harry: Seriously?</p> <p>Kane said that the autumn camps after a tournament summer could sometimes be overlooked and he had merely wanted to remind everyone \u2013 namely the players \u2013 that this cannot happen, partly because the culture and togetherness for the next campaign is sown during these get-togethers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/16/bold-and-bright-curtis-jones-quick-to-make-his-mark-in-england-shirt\">Bold and bright Curtis Jones stakes claim for place in new England side | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kane almost walked into trouble because he was asked whether it was a problem that Thomas Tuchel, the next permanent England manager, who does not begin work until January, had not been here to influence that. Well, it\u2019s not all about these camps, the culture does build after them, too \u2013 was the gist of Kane\u2019s recovery.</p> <p>In essence, though, Kane did not budge too far from his original sentiments, which had dominated the buildup to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/14/greece-england-nations-league-match-report\">Thursday\u2019s 3-0 win over Greece</a> in Athens, the result that has left Carsley\u2019s team needing victory against Ireland to ensure they top their Nations League group and are promoted back to the competition\u2019s A section.</p> <p>Kane repeated his line about how Gareth Southgate had worked so hard to create a more inclusive environment which the players wanted to be a part of. It was the basis for the runs deep into four tournaments under the previous manager. But was it a fragile thing? \u201cI think so,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIt takes a long time to build and maybe not so long to lose if you\u2019re not careful. It\u2019s something that you don\u2019t want to lose as you start to get more younger players into the team.\u201d</p> <p>Tuchel has signed an 18-month contract. It will be a one-ticket gig \u2013 the 2026 World Cup \u2013 and he has not disagreed with the notion that it will be win or bust for him. Tuchel will not have long to build but slow and steady has never really been him; rather quick and explosive. The idea is Tuchel will hit the ground running and build irresistible momentum. It normally ends in tears with him after two or three years. The Football Association hope the glory can come first.</p> <p>Kane was brought to Bayern Munich by Tuchel in the summer of 2023 and the way that he tells it, the plan feels sound. Tuchel enjoys working with English players, as he showed at Chelsea; he likes the English mentality, Kane explained. It is clear that Tuchel has the tactical smarts but it is his energy and motivational skills that Kane believes can make the difference.</p> <p>\u201cThomas will experience only having 10-day camps and then not seeing us for a while but in those 10 days he\u2019s going to want to bring as much energy as possible \u2013 and I think that will be good to see,\u201d Kane said. \u201cFor international football, having that energy in short bursts is really important. He will understand the assignment and that a big part of it will be him bringing energy to the squad. I\u2019m hoping that come March [and his first camp] it will be a real injection of energy to lead us up to the World Cup.\u201d</p>    <p>It did not work for Tuchel at Bayern last season. After 11 straight Bundesliga titles, the 11th that he got over the line after joining in March 2023, his team finished third, 18 points behind the champions, Bayer Leverkusen, leaving him out of work. \u201cI think he found it difficult from the moment he got to Bayern,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThere were some bigger issues that I don\u2019t know too much about that didn\u2019t quite work out.\u201d</p> <p>It was widely reported that Tuchel fell out with key members of the squad but if Kane has seen the value in home truths this week, then Tuchel has long embraced them. Kane believes that a player ought to be able to handle them, although not all do.</p> <p>\u201cThomas is pretty straight in how he talks and maybe there were some players who didn\u2019t like that or agree with that,\u201d Kane said. \u201cEach coach has their own way of trying to talk to players, to criticise them, to try and motivate them and not every player is going to love the manager. Probably come March there will be [England] players who might disagree with some things. But I think ultimately the way he wants to get us playing will be exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Kane did not agree with Carsley earlier in the week \u2013 specifically when the manager dropped him for Greece; he preferred to give Ollie Watkins a taste from the start of a high-stakes England encounter. Nobody could remember the last time Kane had been left out for a big game, not even Kane himself.</p> <p>Was it a shock? \u201cProbably a little bit,\u201d Kane replied. \u201cWhen he told me, it was like: \u2018OK\u2019 \u2026 getting my head around it. I wasn\u2019t down about it or worried. I understood where he was coming from. Part and parcel of being a captain and a leader is you sometimes have to take things in your stride.\u201d</p> <p>When Carsley broke the news to Kane, he said he would return him to the lineup against Ireland. Kane knows what he has to do. To him, the fundamentals have always been everything.</p>",

At one point, as Kane took a break from the preparations for Sunday\u2019s Nations League tie against Republic of Ireland at Wembley \u2013 the final game of Lee Carsley\u2019s interim tenure \u2013 he expressed a surprise at the wall-to-wall coverage his words had driven. Memo to Harry: Seriously? Kane said that the autumn camps after a tournament summer could sometimes be overlooked and he had merely wanted to remind everyone \u2013 namely the players \u2013 that this cannot happen, partly because the culture and togetherness for the next campaign is sown during these get-togethers. Kane almost walked into trouble because he was asked whether it was a problem that Thomas Tuchel, the next permanent England manager, who does not begin work until January, had not been here to influence that. Well, it\u2019s not all about these camps, the culture does build after them, too \u2013 was the gist of Kane\u2019s recovery. In essence, though, Kane did not budge too far from his original sentiments, which had dominated the buildup to Thursday\u2019s 3-0 win over Greece in Athens, the result that has left Carsley\u2019s team needing victory against Ireland to ensure they top their Nations League group and are promoted back to the competition\u2019s A section. Kane repeated his line about how Gareth Southgate had worked so hard to create a more inclusive environment which the players wanted to be a part of. It was the basis for the runs deep into four tournaments under the previous manager. But was it a fragile thing? \u201cI think so,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIt takes a long time to build and maybe not so long to lose if you\u2019re not careful. It\u2019s something that you don\u2019t want to lose as you start to get more younger players into the team.\u201d Tuchel has signed an 18-month contract. It will be a one-ticket gig \u2013 the 2026 World Cup \u2013 and he has not disagreed with the notion that it will be win or bust for him. Tuchel will not have long to build but slow and steady has never really been him; rather quick and explosive. The idea is Tuchel will hit the ground running and build irresistible momentum. It normally ends in tears with him after two or three years. The Football Association hope the glory can come first. Kane was brought to Bayern Munich by Tuchel in the summer of 2023 and the way that he tells it, the plan feels sound. Tuchel enjoys working with English players, as he showed at Chelsea; he likes the English mentality, Kane explained. It is clear that Tuchel has the tactical smarts but it is his energy and motivational skills that Kane believes can make the difference. \u201cThomas will experience only having 10-day camps and then not seeing us for a while but in those 10 days he\u2019s going to want to bring as much energy as possible \u2013 and I think that will be good to see,\u201d Kane said. \u201cFor international football, having that energy in short bursts is really important. He will understand the assignment and that a big part of it will be him bringing energy to the squad. I\u2019m hoping that come March [and his first camp] it will be a real injection of energy to lead us up to the World Cup.\u201d It did not work for Tuchel at Bayern last season. After 11 straight Bundesliga titles, the 11th that he got over the line after joining in March 2023, his team finished third, 18 points behind the champions, Bayer Leverkusen, leaving him out of work. \u201cI think he found it difficult from the moment he got to Bayern,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThere were some bigger issues that I don\u2019t know too much about that didn\u2019t quite work out.\u201d It was widely reported that Tuchel fell out with key members of the squad but if Kane has seen the value in home truths this week, then Tuchel has long embraced them. Kane believes that a player ought to be able to handle them, although not all do. \u201cThomas is pretty straight in how he talks and maybe there were some players who didn\u2019t like that or agree with that,\u201d Kane said. \u201cEach coach has their own way of trying to talk to players, to criticise them, to try and motivate them and not every player is going to love the manager. Probably come March there will be [England] players who might disagree with some things. But I think ultimately the way he wants to get us playing will be exciting.\u201d Kane did not agree with Carsley earlier in the week \u2013 specifically when the manager dropped him for Greece; he preferred to give Ollie Watkins a taste from the start of a high-stakes England encounter. Nobody could remember the last time Kane had been left out for a big game, not even Kane himself. Was it a shock? \u201cProbably a little bit,\u201d Kane replied. \u201cWhen he told me, it was like: \u2018OK\u2019 \u2026 getting my head around it. I wasn\u2019t down about it or worried. I understood where he was coming from. Part and parcel of being a captain and a leader is you sometimes have to take things in your stride.\u201d When Carsley broke the news to Kane, he said he would return him to the lineup against Ireland. Kane knows what he has to do. To him, the fundamentals have always been everything.",

It\u2019s not happening now [but] I\u2019m very confident we\u2019re on the right path. I think this team has an incredibly exciting future. When we move the ball you can see the talent and pace we have.\u201d Borthwick also insisted he still retained the full support of the Rugby Football Union despite England\u2019s barren run. \u201cThe feeling I get from the RFU is one of absolute support and absolute belief from everybody that this team is going in the right direction. These are painful experiences we\u2019re going through but I think this adversity will be good for the team in the long term. \u201cThe most impatient people are us. We want everything to happen now. But it\u2019s important to recognise how good South Africa are. They\u2019re world champions and the consistency they have means you have to be on the money for every second of the Test match. Small lapses can end up being hugely significant. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working through with the players to ensure we go to where I think this team can go in the next few years.\u201d England\u2019s captain, Jamie George, felt similarly. \u201cWe wanted to give the fans three wins from three, of course we did. I think we created a lot of opportunities against a world class team. What we need to do is make sure we find the fixes to close out these games. I have every confidence in the players and the staff.\u201d The full-back Freddie Steward, however, suggested England\u2019s discipline \u201chad cost us\u201d and also that his side had not been sufficiently consistent at the breakdown. South Africa\u2019s head coach Rassie Erasmus, however, saluted England\u2019s endeavour and said the match had been \u201cas competitive as hell\u201d. He also singled out his two-try winger Cheslin Kolbe for special praise. \u201cI keep saying he\u2019s a special player but it doesn\u2019t seem to go to his head,\u201d said Erasmus. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a title that he hasn\u2019t won. We\u2019re fortunate we\u2019ve got such a good crop of wingers.\u201d",

That\u2019s all the action from Turin today, thanks for your company and comments, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the big finale as Sinner takes on Taylor Fritz, Katy Murrells will be your scribe for that. Time for me to tap out, goodbye. Jannik Sinner Speaks: I returned well, I raised my level and I\u2019m very happy about the performance. I\u2019ll just try to play the best I can tomorrow, I\u2019ve grown as a player since last year and it\u2019s been a very positive year for me\u201d Not quotes to set the world alight and the big man doesn\u2019t crack a smile but that isn\u2019t his job is it. His job is tennis and he\u2019s pretty darn good at that. Done and Dusted! Sinner serves it out in a blinking and in just over an hour he has booked his place in tomorrow\u2019s final to take on Taylor Fritz, the man he conquered in this year\u2019s US Open final. Energy conserved for that and job done in brutal fashion tonight in Turin. Sinner was simply too good in all departments for Casper Ruud, chalking up his 69th win of the year in the process. Second set: Sinner 6-1, 5-2 Ruud* \u201cA set, 2-4 and love thirdy\u201d drawls Henman in his best Dave Clifton* Sinner is relentless, chasing everything down and making Ruud work incredibly hard just to stay in the points off his own serve. DOUBLE BREAK. Sinner is overpowering his opponent from the back of the court and he\u2019s now just one game away from wrapping this up. The in house DJ pumps up the volume, Dave Clifton is that you. Ear splidding stuff. *Go on then. Second set: Sinner 6-1, 4-2 Ruud* Sinner sends down some bazooka serves including an ACE down the T. His sixth of the evening. An easy hold and the pressure lobbed right back onto Casper Ruud. Second set: Sinner 6-1, 3-2 Ruud* Sinner moves so well at the back of the court, (cliche alert!) especially for such a big guy, he steps up to Ruud\u2019s serve and manufacturers two BREAK POINTS. Ruud saves the first with a good serve out wide. Top serving! Ruud saves the second to make it Deuce. The match on the line right here. Sinner gets his fourth break point on the Ruud serve and the pressure looks to be telling, a violent forehand from Sinner sees Ruud scrambling and there is THE BREAK for Sinner. Sinner\u2019s camp are up on their feet and cheering their man, they want to get this job done and book their spot in tomorrow\u2019s final without too much toil this evening. Things going to plan at the moment. Second set: *Sinner 6-1, 2-2 Ruud Now then, Ruud hits his way to 0-30 with a little help from a couple of mishits from his opponent. It\u2019s the first bit of pressure on the Sinner serve this evening\u2026 Ice veined response from Sinner who recovers with four points in a row including a step in and crunching forehand that flew off like a tracer bullet. Impressive stuff from both men and we\u2019re still on serve in the second. Second set: Sinner 6-1, 1-2 Ruud* Better from Ruud who skips to his chair after a solid hold. This was decent: Second set: *Sinner 6-1, 1-1 Ruud \u201cStand in and give it a whack\u201d says Ray Winstone, sorry - Tim Henman.

The crowd clearly think so too and start to get behind Ruud more, they don\u2019t want to be heading home before they\u2019ve got their Euros worth. Second set: Sinner 6-1, 0-1 Ruud* Ruud finds his first serve and goes to 40-15. Sinner goes too wide on a cross court forehand and the Norwegian gets on the board at the start of the second set. He needed that BIG TIME. There was some hugely entertaining stuff in that set but Sinner was a runaway train, he takes it in bang on thirty minutes. Ruud needs to find another level or four to make a fist of it in the next.

That could be the first set decided in that one game. First set: Sinner 3-1 Ruud* Well played Casper Ruud, the Norwegian settles into his game and looks sprightly, getting on the board with his serve at the second time of asking. Sinner not going to have it all his own way in Turin this evening. First set: *Sinner 3-0 Ruud (*Denotes server) Sinner is in a hurry. He follows up the break with a warp speed service game. Ruud looks a bit startled as he heads for his chair. First set: Sinner 2-0 Ruud* (*Denotes server) Ruud approaches the net early doors, settling the nerves with a well executed forehand. What a rally! We might not see a better one all night y\u2019know. Both players toying with the other, backhand, forehand, slice, power and precisiom. After a high octane exchange, Sinner elects for the drop shot, Ruud chases it up and makes it but Sinner plays a delicious volleyed lob that landed perfectly in the back corner.

Is still looking for Williams, though. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>14) Tommy Freeman</strong> Effective in the kicking contest but not really in many other areas, which has been the tale of his month to date. Needs to involve himself more. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>13) Ollie Lawrence</strong> Made a few dents in the South Africa defence in the opening stages but on the whole got very little change out of De Allende or Kriel. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>12) Henry Slade</strong> Delicate pass to release Sleightholme. As defensive leader, England weren\u2019t perfect again but were improved. Off after head collision that George was not happy about. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>11) Ollie Sleightholme</strong> Did not take long to score again on his first start \u2013 he is clearly a fine finisher \u2013 but Kolbe will give him a few sleepless nights. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>10) Marcus Smith</strong> Shaped for a drop goal before darting away to tee up first try, picking up from where he left off, but charge-down seemed to unnerve him. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>9) Jack van Poortvliet</strong> Tormented by Etzebeth, charged down twice and always under pressure. Kicking was, on the whole, decent but a match to forget. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>1) Ellis Genge</strong> Hasn\u2019t had the best autumn all in all and came off second best.

Is still looking for Williams, though. 7/10 14) Tommy Freeman Effective in the kicking contest but not really in many other areas, which has been the tale of his month to date. Needs to involve himself more. 5 13) Ollie Lawrence Made a few dents in the South Africa defence in the opening stages but on the whole got very little change out of De Allende or Kriel. 6 12) Henry Slade Delicate pass to release Sleightholme. As defensive leader, England weren\u2019t perfect again but were improved. Off after head collision that George was not happy about. 6 11) Ollie Sleightholme Did not take long to score again on his first start \u2013 he is clearly a fine finisher \u2013 but Kolbe will give him a few sleepless nights. 7 10) Marcus Smith Shaped for a drop goal before darting away to tee up first try, picking up from where he left off, but charge-down seemed to unnerve him. 7 9) Jack van Poortvliet Tormented by Etzebeth, charged down twice and always under pressure. Kicking was, on the whole, decent but a match to forget. 5 1) Ellis Genge Hasn\u2019t had the best autumn all in all and came off second best. Carries hard, though, and always offers himself. 5 2) Jamie George Got through 11 tackles during his 50 minutes and whatever he said to his side beforehand clearly worked.

I hope you enjoyed the comms. Congrats Boks (again). Hard luck England (again). Them\u2019s the breaks at the elite level. England a Nation of Losers That\u2019s the very punchy heading on Martin Leggett\u2019s email: \u201cHow can we create a national sports team to be proud of when we can\u2019t even watch them playing on our national broadcaster and help them generate revenue for investing in the sport? Not even the sponsor of the RFU is a British Company! I\u2019m English but live in Australia where people are honest and open about our failures if our national teams don\u2019t win! Get rid of Borthwick and find someone who knows how to win!\u201d \u201cAs Springbok fan I feel pretty good about that one,\u201d adds Jonah Sack. \u201cWe really click every \u2014 what \u2014 3 or 4 games? But that\u2019s our game, seemingly. The rest of them are hard yakka punctuated by moments of brilliance. I can live with that.\u201d Playing below par and still winning just about every game. How every other team in the world would love to have this problem. All the chat in the media room as we wait for the coaches and captains is saying largely the same thing along these lines: Mike and/or Sue Richards, have found what they/she/he thinks is the reason for this result: \u201cThe Springboks kept Marcus out of the game in the last quarter and England fell apart once again. With him running the show, there is always hope. A few changes needed for the 6 Nations.\u201d True enough. Smith seemingly ran out of puff. Fair play to him. I thought he was outstanding. Freddie Steward speaks to the BBC: \u201cFrustration. We had a lot of opportunities to get points on the board and come back into that game. \u201cWe were close again but we didn\u2019t get over the line and we have to get the results. You cannot fault the effort but we didn\u2019t have enough today and credit to South Africa, they shut the game out well. \u201cOur discipline cost us. We talked about keeping our penalty count down in the week. We gave too many away and it cost us. \u201cSouth Africa bring physicality everywhere on the pitch and particularly at the breakdown. We were a bit lethargic there at times and it cost us. \u201cWe showed to ourselves and hopefully the fans that we are not far away, it was a solid performance but we just didn\u2019t have enough to get back in the game. Their tries came from our errors but we will regroup and come back stronger.\u201d Is Borthwick in trouble? YES! says Brendan Mcconnell: \u201cThat\u2019s 5 losses in a row for England, with a few baffling decisions from Borthwick. Is it fair to ask if it\u2019s just not working with him in charge? He\u2019s been there a while so can\u2019t say it\u2019s bedding in issues\u201d As the rain falls over Twickenham, Andre Thomas sees a silver lining: \u201cStill Japan next to save us from total embarrassment. An opportunity to paper over the cracks\u201d Keep the comments coming. I\u2019m off to make the pressers. Will pick them up when in about 10 mins once I find my place. \u201cIt was agonising for a Bok fan,\u201d says Martin Rollo. \u201cHow do they keep winning when they\u2019re outplayed like that? And so many penalties.\u201d Honestly, I don\u2019t know. Is that a sign of a great team or a lucky one? Is there a difference? \u201cA lack of cohesion,\u201d says Courtney Lawes. Perhaps, but that was actually a decent show from England. They just couldn\u2019t get over the line when on top. But that\u2019s five losses in a row for England, their worst run for six years. \u201cPoor judgement lack of skills in critical areas and killer instinct\u201d That\u2019s the damning report from reader Andrew Thomas. I genuinely can\u2019t believe England lost this by 9 points. South Africa win it! England can\u2019t stitch a final move together and the Boks claim a nine point victory that does not tell the story of this match. 80th min: England win another penalty on the ground. No matter the result, they have bossed the breakdown. Smith kicks it out. But they won\u2019t have time to win it. Still, they can leave with pride if they score from this line-out. 79th min: Smith takes a high Reinach box and chooses to run it back before he is hammered by Kwagga Smith. England on the back foot have to kick from their own 22 and Marx will throw from English territory. 78th min: Pollard goes into the pocket but misses the drop-goal. They won\u2019t mind. After absorbing pressure from that line-out inside England\u2019s 22, they just want to play the rest of the game this side of the park. 76th min: England don\u2019t roll away after making a tackle and South Africa have a chance to put this game to bed. Oh no, but they don\u2019t point to poles within range. Pollard kicks to the corner. Interesting\u2026 Five minutes to go. This has been breathless. England have \u2013 by far \u2013 been the better team. But South Africa\u2019s defence, Pollard\u2019s composure and moments of magic means South Africa are nine up. They\u2019ll get us going again with a line-out in England\u2019s half. 75th min: England win it back from South Africa\u2019s line-out. They come again. Reinach makes a read and then Koch makes a steal. My word, these South Africans are so ruthless on defence. How have England not scored? Pollard clears over half-way. 73rd min: England win the line-out and get the maul rumbling. Now down the hands but Am, on for de Allende, makes a perfect read in midfield and then a firm hit on Lawrence who is isolated and then turned over. penalty for South Africa so Pollard can clear to half-way. 72nd min: South Africa can\u2019t win clean ball off the scrum and England win another penalty on the ground after a ball carrier is isolated. Smith to the corner again. 71st min: Cowan-Dickie dummy throws at the line-out so it\u2019s a free kick for South Africa! What a let off! Pollard clears. England ball but Randall drops it off the back of the line-out! Another let off! England just couldn\u2019t make that pressure count. 71st min: England get so close after their maul wins the arm wrestle. Another penalty against South Africa. That\u2019s 10 in this half alone. Short carries from England take them close. Dombrandt then Cole. How much closer can they get? They can\u2019t keep the move alive but have the penalty advantage so Smith nudges to the corner. Another shot from the line-out, this time five out/ The prop is the unlucky man after no more warnings at the breakdown and line-out. England have the line-out on the 22 and just HAVE TO leave here with points on the board. 68th min: South Africa steal the ball after an England spill in contact and Kolbe\u2019 raking kick takes it over half-way. England looking a little rushed now. South Africa\u2019s defence is growing. 67th min: Another penalty against South Africa and they\u2019ll get a team warning for repeated infringements. Collapsing the maul this time. Smith kicks to touch. England get the line-out inside the Boks\u2019 22. They have to score here you feel. 65th min: England have a line-out inside their own half after Kolbe causes trouble for Smith under a high ball and then toes ahead a grubber that bobbles out. Has momentum swing? Well, England have a penalty and now a line-out on half-way. That is MAGIC! Cheslin Kolbe, take a bow! It started with a clean line out and a busty charge over the gainline from de Allende that opened the space. But Kolbe, after collecting a floated pass, put on hios dancing shoes and beat Sleightholme as if he wasn\u2019t there. Pollard kicks the extras. A flash of brilliance from South Africa. 62nd min: Marx with a monster steal inside his own 22. England kept it narrow after clean line-out ball but the Boks defence held. Pollard clears to touch just inside his own half. 61st min: This is so incredibly tight. Both teams going to the skies, seeking territory and a kind bounce. Steward is taken out in the air by Kolbe who always had his eyes on the ball. So it\u2019s a penalty, not a card. Kwagga Smith is on for Wiese. Reinach on for Williams.. Randall replaces van Poortvliet. Slade will kick to touch. That is an excellent boot. England with the line-out about 10 m out. Off the cross-bar and over! That was a monster hit! Boks back in front. 58th min: South Africa win a penalty on the ground. This has morphed into a really niggly affair. Pollard, on the half-way line and with an angle adding a bit more, asks to take a shot at goal. 57th min: Kick tennis ends with Pollard claiming a high ball under pressure. But England are bossing the territory battle. Smith has it on a string. 55th min: Etzebeth gets high to disrupt England\u2019s line-out and forces a knock-on. But he played the man in the air so it\u2019s actually an England penalty. They go march into SA\u2019s half with another raking nudge from Smith. 54th min: England win the scrum penalty! Everything is going their way! What a massive win that is inside their own 22. Smith clears to touch. South Africa need to find an extra gear. It\u2019s all England right now. 53rd min: England lead 20-19 (for the reader who just asked). 53rd min: England spill the ball after the restart so South Africa have a scrum inside the 22. It\u2019s not quite the elite front row. Can they eke a penalty or at least get go-forward? England take the lead once again! They\u2019re full value. After that South African try was scrapped, England have been the better side. 50th min: South Africa lose their line-out and England are winning the contact now. Lawrence bounces Etzebeth, no easy feat! Then Smith kicks high and Pollard catches but doesn\u2019t mark it. Why didn\u2019t he mark it!? Soon after England get a penalty after an obstruction from Boks as they blocked the chasers. Both teams have had tries scratched off for marginal calls. 49th min: Itoje neck rolled Marx as he went to clear him out so it\u2019s no try! So many twists in this narrative. SA get the penalty on their own line. Wow, what a let off for the Springboks! Boos ring out but that is the right decision. Oh but hang on! They\u2019re looking at something. Will this be chalked off? England are in front! From having a try scrapped against them to scoring one of their own in a matter of minutes. That was brilliantly worked. After Freeman won the ball from a high kick, they kept it narrow until winnin the penalty. Then, with a free hit, Smith spiralled it wide. Then Lawrence then Steward til Slade got it without any pressure and he slid over. BUT IT\u2019S CHALKED OFF!! 48th min: England\u2019s maul makes ground but soon stalls. They\u2019re pushed back beyond the 22 so Smith lifts a high kick that Freeman claims. They\u2019re five from the line now\u2026 46th min: Another penalty won on the ground by England after Kolbe gathered a high box. Sleightholme this time. Smith chooses to kick to the corner rather than at poles as Swing Low rings out. Libbok and Mbonambi are replaced by Pollard and Marx. 45th min: Earl makes a big steal inside his 22 after South Africa\u2019s line-out was secured. England win the penalty and Smith can hoof a relieving kick into touch. 42nd min: NO TRY! They feel that Fassi\u2019s pass to Arendse, who ran in about 40 metres before sliding in the corner, had drifted forward. That was close. Still, they had the advantage so Libbok kicks to the corner. Well, not the corner, that was a poor nudge. They\u2019re on the 22. They\u2019re checking. Fassi\u2019s final pass to Arendse was marginal. Arendse scores! But is this forward? 42nd min: SA win the restart and Wiese and then Mbonambi charge over the gainline. They have a penalty advantage so de Allende kicks a nothing chip that is easily marked. But the advantage was over. Much to his surprise. So England get the ball back cheaply and can hoof it clear. Libbok to get us going again\u2026. As the players run out Jeremy Boyce clears his lungs: Hi Daniel England \u2018til I die and all that, but you have to suffer for your beliefs, eh ? We are suffering badly at the moment (but, ho-ho, not as much as the Welsh, all things are relative), and the weight of expectation is heavy. We have all the means and more at our disposal but somehow find ways of making the least of them rather than the most. Over-loaded with previous failure baggage ? Over-thinking ? Over-reliance on Stat-ball ? Overlooked the fact that other people are quite good at rugby too ? Didn\u2019t rugby happen because of an over-enthusiastic gesture by a football player, freeing his mind and seeing a possibility ? Rugby seems to be over-complicated now, and every rule-tweek makes it worse. For me, the rot set in when they allowed lifting at line outs. What was wrong with \u201csee who can jump highest.\u201d ? If rugby is suffering it is because it has over-complicated itself and is almost impossible to understand now for players, referees, and spectators alike. Keep It Simple Stupid. As for the rush defence, it\u2019s a great tactic but you have to be perfect every time. We owe that to USA Football, Joe Montana, Dan Marino and all the others constantly rushed, but if they got their pass away it was worth it for the TD. High risk. Good TV. I agree. Underhill makes my England team every time: Steward has been a beast in the backfield. He\u2019s looked so assured under the high ball. \u201cGood man Freddie. Norfolk\u2019s finest,\u201d says Tom Mc. \u201cEver backwards under Borthwick,\u201d says Andrew Thomas. \u201cI guess when you have only one world class player ie Smith he can only play with what he has with the rest journey men only I\u2019m afraid. Southern Hemisphere gap is as wide as it ever was kind regards.\u201d Well, the gap right now is only two points. And England have every reason to believe that they could win this. Marcus Smith is having a blinder. Yet again. What a player he is. David Hilmy (a Scot, as far as I can tell) says that the Quins 10 is the key to England\u2019s chances of a win: If England are to be successful, it will be dependent upon Marcus Smith, he needs to stay in the game- of course everyone likes to blame the coaches when their team loses (or in Scotland\u2019s case this morning, win yet still have detractors who behave like England football supporters!) but for England\u2019s sake I hope Borthwick doesn\u2019t go with what appears to be a pre-meditated sub policy for the fly-half around the 60-70 minute mark instead of making that and other subs based upon what is actually happening on the pitch. Etzebeth drops the ball and seconds later van Poortvliet kicks it into the stands to bring the half to a close. A proper arm wrestle peppered by moments of brilliance. I\u2019ve enjoyed that. Both sides well in this. 40th min: Libbok has the distance but drifts it wide. Still, they\u2019ll have the line-out after a clearing kick from England finds touch. 38th min: Snyman wins the line-out and Libbok then dinks a kick over the onrushing defence. Freeman wins it but Wiese is in quick to make the steal. Libbok will attempt a shot at goal from the halfway. 37th min: Another scrum penalty for South Africa. Libbok clears and Sa will have the throw 10 m inside their own half. 36th min: More kick tennis but this time Steward takes it clean and charges ahead. It\u2019s a great counter. he toes a grubber forward and gives Freeman something to chase. He almost gets there but Libbok is covering. Freeman times his run perfectly but spills itn under pressure. Good gain for England though. South Africa have to scrum without the Ox five metres from their own line. 34th min: A bit of kick tennis ends with Kolbe launching a bomb over half-way. England win the line-out and van Poortvliet boxes. This time it lands for South Africa and Mbonambi takes it into contact before Fassi hoists one high that Steward claims. 33rd min: Smith is some player. Once again he\u2019s running everything and England look dangerous when they have the ball. There are some big hits but England\u2019s centres now have go forward ball. Earl carrying well. Lawrence kicks but it\u2019s too long. England will at least get the goal line drop out back at them. Nche is limping off. he doesn\u2019t look in good shape. 32nd min: Williams snipes and finds space through the forwards clustered for the line-out. He has support on his inside but can\u2019t get the off-load away. England swarm the breakdown and come up with the steal from Underhill after a bit hit from Freeman. Fassi drops a high ball but rather than a scrum it\u2019s an England line-out on half-way. 30th min: South Africa win the scrum penalty. In other news, water is wet. Libbok hoofs it clear of half-way. 29th min: England\u2019s attack looks good. Smith keeps finding Underhill against the grain. But Lawrence is drilled by the much smaller Arendse on SA\u2019s 22 and spills in contact. Scrum to the Boks. Both teams take a breather. They deserve it. This has been breathless. 28th min: Van Poortvliet is charged down again by Etzebeth. The big lock is giving him nightmares at the base of the ruck. But Smith launches a counter and England are away. A deep kick finds space but dribbles over the line and Fassie dots down. England fire back! Outstanding from the home side. Itoje claimed the line-out and they kept running hard at the line. Eventually South Africa\u2019s wall was breached with a brilliant blind charge from Underhill against the grain. He rode three tacklers to force the ball down and get his team back in the contest. Smith\u2019s extras reduce the deficit. What a game this has been! 24th min: Etzebeth wins the ball in the air and now the Boks can mount an attack. Libbok fires it flat and Kriel takes the contact. But England\u2019s defence is well organised and they win a penalty on the ground. Fassi with an illegal clear. Or Wiese. Or both. Either way, Slade kicks to the corner and England have the line-out inside SA\u2019s 22. Another belter! The Boks are purring! After the maul failed to gain ground, they chanced their arm with a cross-field kick. Libbok was pinpoint and found Kolbe who gathered, rounded the Steward who came cantering across, and dotted down. Libbok converts and suddenly there\u2019s daylight. 21st min: SA win the line-out and keep it narrow. Snyman, again, finds a half gap. They almost knock-on but keep it. Another penalty is conceded by an Englishman, Stuart on the floor. So Lobbok will nudge to the corner for a driving maul. 19th min: Snyman charges through a half gap after the restart and makes a lot of ground. Then Kolisi. Then Williams. They\u2019re flooding through. Wiese takes it into contact. They have the penalty advantage so Libbok attempts a cross-field kick that can\u2019t find a man. Rather than point to the poles they\u2019ll set up a line-out in the corner. Two consecutive charge downs and South Africa hit the front! First the towering Etzebeth charged down van Poortvliet\u2019s box kick. Then after Smith cleaned up, du Toit charged his kick down before diving on the ball over the line. Libbok hits the posts, but that is a gimme for the Boks. Smith makes no mistake with a slight angle to the left of the sticks. England back in front. 15th min: Steward makes amends for earlier with a strong counter run from deep. He beats the first tackle and gives his team go forward ball. A strong counter ruck from the Boks looks to have won the ball back but du Toit infringes illegally on the deck, so Smith will get a shot at the poles between the 22 and half-way. 13th min: England get the ball back after the restart and a clever kick in behind finds open ground in the corner. Mbonambi will have to throw five out from his own line. Stunner! That is sublime from Williams. The scrum-half picked the ball up after receiving a short pass, found a half-gap and then screamed into England\u2019s territory. Then, with a wriggle of his hips and the lightning quick step, he rounded the last defender and slid under the poles. Libbok kicks the extras and we\u2019re all square. Steward was caught out there. 10th min: SA steal the line-out but can\u2019t set set themselves. Libbok attempts a cross-field kick with his weaker left foot and it actually goes sideways rather than forward. England knock on so the Boks\u2019 have the scrum on their 22. Another kick upfield isn\u2019t monstrous but they win the penalty after Steward took a player out off the ball. Libbok hoofs it into touch for Springboks throw. 8th min: Again England\u2019s scrum works and Earl runs at Libbok. Van Poortvliet kicks high and England win it back after a bobble. Smith rakes a kick into Bok territory and another skewed kick from Kolbe means England win the territory battle. They\u2019re winning everything at the minute. 6th min: SA win a scrappy restart but Williams knock-on at the base of the ruck. England have the scrum feed in their own half. What a start for England! They kept hammering the line until Smith shifted the point of attack down the short side. He beat two defenders before popping to Slade who then popped for his winger in waiting. Smith kicks the extras and England are off to a flyer! 4th min: The scrum holds and Smith cross-kicks and finds an edge. That forces Kolbe fields but his kick skews off his boot so England have the throw inside SA\u2019s 22. They win it before Kolisi unfurls a monster tackle. SA\u2019s defence is immense but England still have it inside the 22\u2026. 2nd min: Kolbe knocks on on half-way after van Poortvliet box kicks. I think this is a sign of things to come. But how will England\u2019s scrum hold? 1st min: Smith kicks off and du Toit gathers. Swing Low rings out and Steward takes his first high kick of the night. England set up inside their half after van Poortvliet fumbles backwards. The anthems are done. They\u2019re stripping the banners and flags off the park. The players are getting into position after one final huddle. We\u2019re almost there. My word, I\u2019m buzzing for this! Should be a belter! Habana and Lawes are both backing England! I\u2019m staggered. There\u2019s every chance I\u2019ll have to eat my words but I think South Africa win this by a full length. We\u2019ll find out shortly. Just as they did last night, TNT tee us up with a Theodore Roosevelt speech: It\u2019s not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or when the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worth cause; who at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who at the worst if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat. There are fireworks, there are lasers, a house version of Seal\u2019s Kiss From a Rose is belting around the ground! They\u2019ve spared no expense tonight! Twickenham is rocking! Courtney Lawes, Bryan Habana and Ugo Monye \u2013 just the 250 Test caps between them \u2013 are chewing the fat over England\u2019s rush defence. Australia found too many holes in the midfield last week and the edge too frequently. They have to be tighter today. Aphelele Fassi is fielding a lot of high balls in the warm-up. His battle with Freddie Steward for control of the skies could be decisive. Ugo Monye is backing England\u2019s full-back to come good and argues that his inclusion improve\u2019s the team\u2019s attack and defence. It\u2019s no Bomb Squad, as Erasmus has selected a bench with the standard five forwards and three backs, but it\u2019s still a 23 that can go nuclear. Siya Kolisi returns to skipper the side alongside a glut of superstar names who were rested for the win over Scotland. Cheslin Kolbe on the wing, Pieter-Steph du Toit in the back row, Manie Libbok running the show at 10. It\u2019s an impressive cohort and England will need to be at their best to beat these Bokke. South Africa: Fassi; Kolbe, Kriel, De Allende, Arendse; Libbok, Williams; Nche, Mbonambi, W Louw, Etzebeth, Snyman, Kolisi (capt), Du Toit, Wiese. Replacements: Marx, Steenekamp, Koch, E Louw, Smith, Reinach, Pollard, Am. Four changes from the side that lost in the dying seconds a week ago. Freddie Steward returns from the cold to marshal the backfield, perhaps a sign of England\u2019s intent to kick the leather off the ball. Entrusted with those box-kicking duties will be Jack van Poortvliet as Ben Spencer drops out of the 23 entirely. Sam Underhill comes in for for Tom Curry, who is recovering from a concussion. Northampton\u2019s try-machine Ollie Sleightholme wins his first start. England: Steward; Freeman, Lawrence, Slade, Sleightholme; M Smith, Van Poortvliet; Genge, George (capt), Stuart, Itoje, Martin, Cunningham-South, Underhill, Earl. Replacements: Cowan-Dickie, Baxter, Cole, Isiekwe, Dombrandt, Randall, Ford, Roebuck. South Africa have been on the charm offensive this Autumn. Rassie Erasmus told Gerard Meager that his \u201cSpringboks aren\u2019t the bad guys\u201d of world rugby. But, before their comofrtable win over Scotland, Michael Aylwin wasn\u2019t buying it. But who needs a strategy to win hearts and minds when you have the most likable prop in your ranks. I said back in October that Ox Nche should at least get a look in for World Rugby\u2019s player of the year award. Gerard agrees with me. \u201cGood luck South Africa!\u201d Says Ruth Edwards, proudly of Welsh stock. Guess the anybody-but-England mantra still resonates. All signs point to a blowout by the Boks. The double World Cup champions saunter into south-west London having claimed the Rugby Championship earlier in the year and a week after spanking Scotland by 17 points without leaving second gear. England, by contrast, have developed a knack of losing tight games with six of their last eight fixtures going the way of the opposition. Steve Borthwick says he\u2019s not under pressure, but he unquestionably is. A drubbing, as most expect, will compound matters. But funny things happen when these teams meet each other. At the World Cup last year, England played a near perfect game and almost pulled off an almighty upset. Four years earlier, South Africa defied the bookies to lift the Webb Ellis Cup. The point is that form goes out the window and the \u2018favourites\u2019 tag can weigh heavy in these titanic encounters rich with history and dripping with narrative. Ignore conventional wisdom, throw logic out this window. This is a Test between two proud nations at one of the sport\u2019s grandest arenas. Epic is a word used often. It\u2019s appropriate here. Kick-off at 5:40pm. Teams and more updates to follow.",

Their elimination is deserved. They went into their final pair of games needing to win both and hope Sudan lost both of theirs. The likelihood was that it would all be over on Thursday, when Sudan, managed by the former Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah, which has added a whole other tier of complication, went to Niger.

After 18 minutes, Jordan Ayew whipped a 35-yard free-kick into the top corner, the sort of goal that belongs in legends, that the gods surely wouldn\u2019t waste on a tame exit. Then Abdul Manaf Nurudeen saved M\u2019Bala Nzola\u2019s penalty with an outstretched foot.

When&nbsp;Zini, in the middle of the goalmouth, eight yards out, headed in Fel\u00edcio Milson\u2019s cross to equalise after 64 minutes, the closest player to him was his teammate Antonio Hossi. Ghana barely threatened after&nbsp;that, their Cup of Nations campaign ending, anticlimactically, more than a year before the finals&nbsp;begin.

      "bodyText": "What made it especially painful was that, just briefly, it seemed they might get away with it. But they did not. Ghana did not get the win they needed in Angola on Friday and so Mohammed Kudus, Thomas Partey and Antoine Semenyo will not be at the next Cup of Nations, which begins in Morocco in December 2025. Ghana have been terrible in the qualifiers. Their elimination is deserved. They went into their final pair of games needing to win both and hope Sudan lost both of theirs. The likelihood was that it would all be over on Thursday, when Sudan, managed by the former Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah, which has added a whole other tier of complication, went to Niger. But Niger won, 4-0. Nobody had expected that. For Ghana there was a glimmer of hope. But it meant winning in Angola. After 18 minutes, Jordan Ayew whipped a 35-yard free-kick into the top corner, the sort of goal that belongs in legends, that the gods surely wouldn\u2019t waste on a tame exit. Then Abdul Manaf Nurudeen saved M\u2019Bala Nzola\u2019s penalty with an outstretched foot. Add in the fact that the coach, Otto Addo, and his two assistants, the former West Ham defender John Paintsil and the former goalkeeper Fatau Dauda, suffered only minor injuries in a car crash in September when a pick-up swerved into their lane, and it all seemed ordained. At half-time the myths were already being written about a famous night in Luanda after a turbulent qualifying campaign leading to who knows what glory in Morocco. The truth, though, is that there is a fecklessness to this Ghana. They are not missing out on the finals because of misfortune or a tough draw.

      "bodyText": "Thank you so much for joining me for this top of the table clash. Chelsea have leapfrogged Manchester City with their 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge. You can recap all of the action in the report below. We will be back tomorrow with coverage of the last three games of the weekend, see you then! Player of the match Erin Cuthbert told Sky: \u201cI think it is fair to say I need recovery after that. It doesn\u2019t matter how tired your legs are when you get a result like that.\u201d And on the new manager: \u201cI see a lot of similarities between Emma and Sonia. Emma left a good foundations for Sonia to build on.\u201d I think another thing we have learned today is don\u2019t rely on my match predictions. I really thought Shaw would find the winner today. This is the aftermath of the foul that could have ruled out the first goal. I think if the referee saw it again it may have been ruled out, it looked like a shove. When Emma Hayes departed Chelsea there were a few whispers that their silverware run may come to an end with such an icon leaving. But under Sonia Bompastor the team have seemed to find another gear. This is also a team that has Kerr, Fishel, Ingle, Charles and James to welcome back from injury. Ramirez broke the deadlock and Reiten doubled Chelsea\u2019s lead to go top of the Women\u2019s Super League with a momentous 2-0 win over their title rivals. This most definitely lays down a marker as the defending champions keep their winning run going. 90 + 5 min: Kaneryd plays with the City defence like a cat and a mouse but eventually they win duel with Kaneryd playing it out of play. 90 + 3 min: Cuthbert has been named player of the match and just as she is Kaneryd takes aim at goal but Yamashita collects. 90 + 1 min: Beever-Jones comes on for Ramirez and Stamford Bridge erupts in applause. She is such an asset to this team. It is crazy to think Chelsea still have Kerr and Fishel to come back, Ramirez will be keeping them out of a shirt if she continues like this. There will be six minutes added. 90 min: Fujino makes a great run and she lays it off to Coombs, she whallops it goalward but Hampton collects. 88 min: That was bold from Hampton, Shaw was running after a ball and the keeper came out to take it. She did get to it first but had she not it was an open goal. 87 min: I would love to hear the tactics and the motivational talks Bompastor has because if this result stays as it is she would have won every single game in charge. I think it\u2019s 11 games across all competitions. Crazy. 85 min: Chelsea have a corner and the delivery is good but nothing comes of it. I thought Bronze had hit that out but the officials give Chelsea another corner. Baltimore takes it and Nusken gets a header but it\u2019s wide. 83 min: City\u2019s defence looks slightly shaky since the second goal but their attacking options are still deadly, if they can find Shaw or Kelly who knows what could happen. The defence doesn\u2019t hold up and Kaneryd has acres of space but Greenwood put in a phenomenal effort to block it. What a player Greenwood is. Lawrence is on for Reiten. 81 min: Kelly and Coombs are now on for City. I was surprised Kelly didn\u2019t start the match with Hemp out. Ramirez almost makes it three but City do enough to stop her. The delivery from the corner was good but it was blocked, it fell to Reiten who had so much space and she slotted home. That\u2019s surely the game. Huge. Wow. 79 min: Ramirez picks up a ball that was loose from the City defence, she lays it off to Kaneryd but it\u2019s deflected out by Greenwood. Corner to come. 78 min: I think City can feel slightly aggrieved with that foul not being blown up, if VAR was in play I think it would have been reviewed. City look to strike back straight away and Shaw has a shot straight at Hampton. Chelsea counter and Reiten goes just wide. My word I am typing so fast to keep up with this action. Hamano found Ramirez, she was crowded by two defenders and City think Ramirez had fouled Kennedy. Referree didn\u2019t blow so Ramirez kept running and it was a clinical finish. What a player. What a goal. What a goal. 75 min: There isn\u2019t a lot to report from the past few minutes, Chelsea are still pressing really high. 73 min: A lot of possession based football but no chances created, I think we are heading for a stalemate. 71 min: Shaw is now back on the pitch, great to see. 71 min: There isn\u2019t VAR for this game and so the referee can\u2019t review this. I think the challenge from Ramirez is debatable but the pain for Shaw came as her arm was stood on when she was on the ground. It looks like a jumping player has landed on her arm. She is back to her feet but it is unclear if she will continue. 69 min: The corner delivery came in but Shaw was tackled by Ramirez and the City fans want a penalty but it hasn\u2019t been given. Shaw has stayed down and Hampton has signalled to the referee that she needs treatment. She looks in a lot of pain. 68 min: It looked like a promising move by Ramirez but the offside flag is up. City counter and oh my word Baltimore has just executed one of the best recovery tackles I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I was sure Fujino was going to score but it\u2019s out for a corner instead. 66 min: Batlimore makes a great challenge on Fujino but then she does it right back, that battle between them has been so entertaining. Chelsea do manage to clear. 64 min: The high press pays off there for Chelsea. Ramirez pressures Yamashita which forces a poor pass and it\u2019s out for a throw. The Blues have a good platform but they just can\u2019t do anything with it and end up back with Hampton. 62 min: The crowd want a Chelsea free kick as Ramirez is fouled on the halfway line but it isn\u2019t given and City are on the charge. Fujino and Baltimore battle in the box and the Chelsea player comes out on top to relieve pressure. 61 min: Chelsea\u2019s area is like an arcade full of pinball machines at the moment. Chelsea get it in the box and they keep having chances with City unable to clear. It ends with Nusken\u2019s effort going wide. 60 min: Cuthbert tries to pick a pass to the wing but it deflects to Ramirez, she squares it back to the Scotland international but her shot rolls across the face of goal. 58 min: It is starting to feel like this match could end 0-0. The two teams are going toe-to-toe and there really is not a lot to separate them. 56 min: Greenwood and Park are both stood over the ball, it is Greenwood who takes it and she picks out Shaw at the far corner but it\u2019s wide. 55 min: Park tries to cross in but Nusken blocks and concedes a corner. The delivery was great to pick out Shaw, a lovely run, but it bounces into Hampton\u2019s hands. A few moments later Shaw wins a free kick in a great position. 53 min: It\u2019s taken short and it\u2019s put into the area, Bronze pops it in but Ramirez can\u2019t turn it in. The ball comes back to Bjorn but her effort is wide. A lot more open play. 51 min: The play itself is largely the same from the first half though Chelsea\u2019s press seems less intense. Hampton has a rogue pass, Bright deals with it but City then have a lot of time on the ball in a dangerous area. Chelsea clear and counter and Ramirez makes an amazing run but Greenwood times her tackle to perfection, she concedes a corner. 49 min: Ramirez looked to go clear there but Greenwood pulled her shirt back, absolutely a foul worth taking but she has got a yellow card for it. Chelsea have a free kick and they take it short, it feels like the wrong idea. Bronze eventually pelts it in but Cuthbert is offside. 47 min: No half-time changes for either side. I have been made aware that Usain Bolt is at Stamford Bridge to watch this match. So will the top two share the points? Or can someone find a winner? All to come. I have to stick to my prediction, which was a 1-0 City win, but so far Chelsea look the more likely to score. That half went by so quickly, a cracking game so far. Kaneryd and Hamano impressive so far, as is Greenwood. There have been chances for both teams but they have not been clinical enough to break the deadlock yet. The top two cannot be separated. 45 + 1 min: Bjorn gets a yellow card for pulling Shaw\u2019s shirt, so City will play out the final parts of this half. 45 + 1 min: Chelsea are next to have a chance with Kaneryd in a good spot, she tries to switch feet and Kennedy sees it out for a corner. Hamano takes it but the resulting shots are blocked. There will be two minutes added. 45 min: Fowler takes the corner and Shaw meets it but it\u2019s wide, she puts her head in her hands afterwards knowing what a chance that was. 44 min: City have a really long build-up and Roord plays a delightful ball to Casparji who shoots and Hampton\u2019s save pushes it out for a corner. 42 min: Greenwood puts in a long ball and tries to find Shaw but Hampton reads it and she collects. 40 min: Ramirez is okay to continue, much to the delight to the crowd who cheer when she gets back to her feet. 39 min: Greenwood is the taker and the delivery is good but it\u2019s cleared and Ramirez is down after being hit in the face. She\u2019ll need some treatment and so there\u2019s a break in play. 38 min: Shaw picks up the ball from outside the box and turns and shoots but it is deflected out for City\u2019s first corner of the game. 37 min: The football on display outside of both areas has been beautiful but as soon as there is a chance the mistakes creep in. Chelsea have the upperhand on the balance of things but no one really close to scoring yet. Fowler crosses in but Cuthbert is there to block before it finds Shaw. 35 min: Baltimore plays a ball to Reiten but she is judged offside. 33 min: Hamano makes a great recovery run to pick up a ball but Park does sensationally well to win it. Every opportunity every player has there is just a touch too much or a heavy pass, it will take one moment to break this deadlock. 31 min: City are really coming to life with their long ball plays, they have not come off yet but it\u2019s seen their most exciting moments in this match. They are being outmuscled in the midfield at the moment so the long ball tactic makes sense. 29 min: Yamashita plays a peach of a ball to unlock City\u2019s attack, it comes to Park but she takes a touch too many and Hampton is able to collect. Hamano then plays an awful ball and Shaw pounces again but some superb defence in the box clears the chance. 27 min: Reiten does really well in a duel with Casparji, who steals the ball but the Chelsea player wins it back. The Norway international squares it but Nusken absolutely skies the chance. 25 min: I was just about to write about how Chelsea\u2019s execution isn\u2019t quite there at the moment and then Baltimore played that pass. A few things have gone awry for the hosts but they are on the front foot now with Ramirez who takes a long range effort but the keeper saves. 23 min: Oh my word Baltimore\u2019s blushes were saved there. The Chelsea player plays an awful pass and it rolls in the path of Shaw, she makes a great run but her shot it wide. Wow. 21 min: Kaneryd is away here, she makes a great run into the box and she lays it off to Hamano whose shot is just over the bar. That is the closest chance of the game so far. 20 min: City lose out high up the pitch as Chelsea hike up the pressure but the hosts\u2019 passing accuracy lets them down in the resulting attack with Bright coughing up the ball. 18 min: The midfield battles have been so interesting. If someone loses the ball it looks exactly like a pinball machine. 16 min: For all of their possession so far, City are yet to trouble Hampton at all. Yamashita is the goalkeeper who has been the busier. 14 min: Here come Chelsea, Kaneryd has a good run but she seems to scuff her shot and it is an easy save. Maybe she should have squared that to a teammate, two were waiting. 12 min: Bright chuckles to herself as she thinks she has fairly won the ball but Shaw wins a free kick. City build from deep and they struggle to get the ball forward. Eventually Nusken wins it and clear the danger. 11 min: How good is Greenwood? A perfectly weighted ball was about to find Kaneryd but she came sprinting across and did enough to disrupt the play. She\u2019s so, so valuable. 9 min: Kennedy loses possession and Cuthbert tries to cross it but it\u2019s well blocked. Then moments later up the other end Shaw almost pounces on a loose ball from Bright. Both sides level at the moment. 8 min: Chelsea players are not letting City any space whatsoever, it\u2019s making them force passes. There has not been any errors yet from City because of it but if they keep it up it could cause issues. 6 min: Chelsea have their first sustained possession and it was a lovely cross from Kaneryd but Casaparji puts it behind for a corner. The delivery is good and Bright has a header but Yamashita collects. 4 min: Shaw wins a free kick with Ramirez fouling her. They take the set piece short and the chance is snuffed out with Chelsea\u2019s defence disturbing the play. 3 min: City have had the lionshare of early possession but they are being put under huge pressure from Chelsea\u2019s high press. They are being pinned in their final third at the moment. 2 min: This is going to be such a tasty match-up. If City play as they did against Barcelona then Chelsea may be in for a long evening. But the Blues have won ever single game across all competitions so far. Two titans. Here we go. This is your five minute warning to grab snacks and a drink because once this game gets underway you won\u2019t want to miss a second. The players will be out on the Stamford Bridge pitch soon in front of what is expected to be a good crowd. Can City get one over on Chelsea? Or will the defending champions keep marching? All to come. Do you have any predictions for this one? I don\u2019t know why but I have a feeling Manchester City will come away with the win, I\u2019m thinking 1-0 and Bunny Shaw will score. Get in touch and let me know your thoughts. The North London derby has already taken place today with Arsenal winning 3-0, you can catch up with the report below. Brighton have also already played today and they beat West Ham 3-2. Manchester City boss Gareth Taylor said: \u201cIt is more than just another game, of course. We have proven so far that we can play good stuff and have got good results along the way. We have been difficult to play against. There is no denying, these games are really important. For us, it is a good game and the fact it is Stamford Bridge gives us something different.

Of course, it will be an important game, but, as I said, not decisive. We are heading into this game with a lot of confidence even if we know Man City are a good squad and have good players, individually and collectively.\u201d Those with eagle eyes will note there is no Lauren Hemp in the squad for Man City at all. Gareth Taylor had said in the week he was positive she would be a part of the game after a knee knock but it seems the game has come too soon. The team news is in. Chelsea have made seven changes from the side who beat Celtic midweek. Musovic, Perisset, Mpome, Lawrence, Keptein, Jena-Francios and Beever-Jones all drop out of the starting team. Chelsea: Hampton, Bronze, Bright, Bjorn, Baltimore, Nusken, Cuthbert, Reiten, Hamano, Kaneryd, Ramirez Manchester City, meanwhile, only make one change from their win over Hammarby in the week. Blindkilde Brown drops out for Roord. Man City: Yamashita, Greenwood (C), Fowler, Roord, Kennedy, Ouahabi, Park, Casparij, Fujino, Shaw, Hasegawa Hello and welcome to the top of the WSL table clash between Chelsea and Manchester City. The Blues are hosting their rivals at Stamford Bridge in what is set to be one of the games of the season.

A relieved but satisfied Karl Darlow talks to S4C. \u201cI thought it was a big shame \u2026 it looked like the challenge was a fair one \u2026 we would have been hard done by to lose by that goal \u2026 the way we defended, the grit and determination, we deserved a point here \u2026 we\u2019re hard to beat \u2026 you can go a long way being hard to beat \u2026 we\u2019re unbeaten \u2026 that speaks to our commitment \u2026 the lads and the staff \u2026 the effort everyone puts in \u2026 I\u2019m loving it \u2026 this is why I\u2019ve come to play international football \u2026 to come away with a clean sheet, I\u2019m delighted!\u201d That was great prime-time Saturday-evening televised entertainment in the grand tradition of the Generation Game, Big Night and Strictly. Craig Bellamy the Brucie de nos jours? Both sides had plenty of chances to win; all that was missing tonight was the final ball. A draw seems only fair and right, especially as that penalty decision was on the soft side. It\u2019s going to be one hell of a night on Tuesday. Let\u2019s get the network together! Straight down to brass tacks, then. Turkey still look likely to win the group and automatic promotion to League A, as they just need to win in Montenegro on Tuesday. But Wales can pip them if they beat Iceland in Cardiff, and events in Montenegro don\u2019t go Turkey\u2019s way. However Iceland\u2019s win this evening keeps their hopes of a place in the promotion play-offs alive; should they triumph in Cardiff on Tuesday, they\u2019ll condemn Wales to the relegation play-offs. The automatic relegation place aside \u2013 it\u2019s all yours, Montenegro \u2013 everything is still up for grabs!

The ball pinballs around the Wales box. Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu tries to make good by forcing a shot goalwards, but he can\u2019t do it. Wales are so close now to keeping their hopes of automatic promotion alive. 90 min +3: Justice might have been served by that penalty miss, because Williams looked to have got a nick on the ball while making his challenge. Either way, here we are. 90 min +2: There\u2019s barely a sound in the stadium right now. The small pocket of Wales fans making all the noise. It\u2019s finished 2-0 to Iceland in Montenegro, by the way. 90 min: The Turkish fans are utterly stunned. Victory was so close. But Wales breathe again! Lewis Koumas comes on for Brennan Johnson. There will be five additional minutes. 89 min: Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu misses the spot kick! He gives Darlow the eyes, sending the keeper the wrong way \u2026 but in aiming for the empty right-hand side of the goal, can only ping the ball off the base of the post and out for a goal kick! 87 min: \u00dcnal plays a ball down the inside-right channel and into the Wales box. Akg\u00fcn takes up possession and looks to cut inside for a shot. He\u2019s upended by Williams. The referee points to the spot. Rodon is booked for complaining. 87 min: Nothing comes of the Turkey corner. But \u2026 86 min: K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc drives a shot goalwards from the edge of the box. Roberts blocks. But Wales can\u2019t stop the ball going out for a corner on the left. Before it can be taken, Kaan Ayhan replaces the disappointing Arda G\u00fcler. 85 min: \u00cdsak Bergmann J\u00f3hannesson has scored a second goal for Iceland in Montenegro. That game\u2019s already gone into stoppage time. 83 min: A lot of whistling as Wales do the patient thing. A reminder that a draw keeps their hopes of automatic promotion alive. 81 min: Iceland are leading in Montenegro, incidentally. Orri \u00d3skarsson with the game\u2019s only goal after 74 minutes. Just a couple of minutes left on the clock there. A win for Iceland will keep their hopes of promotion alive, and make Tuesday\u2019s match in Cardiff very interesting indeed. Unless Wales can find a winner here, of course. 79 min: G\u00fcler wears the look of someone who knows that could, possibly should, have secured Turkey\u2019s passage to League A. The hosts get on with it, though, and Akg\u00fcn has a dig from distance. This one flies over too. 77 min: Williams carelessly ships possession on the Turkey right. \u00c7elik pulls the ball back to G\u00fcler, with time and space on the edge of the Wales box. He\u2019s got to work Darlow at the very least \u2026 in fact, there\u2019s anticipation of a goal \u2026 but the young man leans back and launches a dreadful effort miles over the bar. What A Chance (pt. XXXVIII in a continuing series). 76 min: Space for Johnson down the right. He crosses low and hard. Brooks, coming in at the far stick, doesn\u2019t expect the ball to reach him. But it does. He clanks wide of goal. A shame for Wales the roles weren\u2019t reversed there. 75 min: Zeki \u00c7elik replaces Eren Elmal\u0131. 73 min: The two subs are immediately in the thick of it, Cullen teeing up Brooks on the right-hand edge of the Turkey D. Brooks carves a wild shot high and wide left. On the touchline, Craig Bellamy holds his head in his hands as a decent chance flies into the night sky. 72 min: David Brooks and Liam Cullen come on for Jordan James and Sorba Thomas. 70 min: Elmal\u0131 crosses from the left. Akg\u00fcn cushions a header down for \u00dcnal, who attempts a scissor kick from ten yards. It\u2019s heading in, but Davies gets in the road to deflect over for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. It\u2019s still 0-0! Somehow. 68 min: \u2026 and it\u2019s a big chance for Wilson, who scampers clear down the inside-right channel, only to get the ball stuck between his legs upon feeling Bardakc\u0131 closing in from behind. Instead of shooting, which he surely should do after reaching the box, he attempts to flick infield for Johnson. It\u2019s a weak pass, and flopped on by G\u00fcnok. These teams are doing everything but score. 67 min: Akg\u00fcn dribbles gracefully down the right, burning past Williams and cutting back dangerously from the byline. \u00dcnal, not yet up to speed, clanks carelessly wide right. A huge chance. 65 min: Y\u0131lmaz crosses from the left. Thomas leaps to block and sticks out an arm. He\u2019s penalised for that. Before the free kick can be taken, Y\u0131lmaz is replaced by \u00dcnal \u2026 and then K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc shanks the set piece out for a goal kick. 63 min: Y\u0131lmaz is penalised for sticking a strong arm in Roberts\u2019 face. For some reason, Bardakc\u0131 gets involved in a discussion with the officials, and goes into the book. He\u2019ll miss Turkey\u2019s final game, in Montenegro. 61 min: The other game in this group between Montenegro and Iceland remains 0-0 as well, by the way. It can\u2019t be as good as this one. It just can\u2019t be. 59 min: Wilson chases a long bouncing ball. G\u00fcnok claims. Turkey look the more likely, but Wales are still carrying a threat. 57 min: Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu lurks behind Rodon and Darlow, as the keeper prepares to bowl out. Is he planning on doing a Gary Crosby? Darlow is no Andy Dibble style patsy, and turns around, wise to the potential of a grift. Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu gives the keeper a cheeky wink and the beginning of a smile plays on the edge of his mouth. All good fun. 55 min: Akg\u00fcn sends K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc into space down the right with a clever backheel. K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc whips a cross to the near post, where Darlow claims without fuss. No idea how this 101mph game hasn\u2019t produced a goal yet. It\u2019s great fun nonetheless. 54 min: Wilson attempts to release Roberts into the Turkey box with a cute roll down the inside-right channel, but the pair lose communication somewhere down the line. Turkey mop up. 53 min: Y\u0131lmaz drives hard down the left and finds Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu on the edge of the box. Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu tries to return the pass but Roberts and Rodon aren\u2019t having any of it, shutting the door just in time. Turkey are beginning to relocate their straps, if not fully hitting them yet. 51 min: Wilson plays a daft blind pass across the face of his own box, left to right, allowing Akg\u00fcn to intercept and slap a shot wide right. Akg\u00fcn should have done better. So should Wilson, who has got away with one there. 50 min: Y\u0131lmaz crosses from the right. Some real whip on that. But there\u2019s nobody in the middle to take advantage. Darlow comes out and flaps at the ball anyway. 49 min: G\u00fcler has the opportunity to release Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu down the inside-left channel, but inexplicably faffs around with a drag-back on the edge of the box, presumably in the hope of finding Y\u0131lmaz to his right. Not the correct decision. Wales breathe again. 48 min: Wales are gifted a corner, which Thomas swings in from the right. Davies wins a header on the left-hand edge of the six-yard box, but it\u2019s all downwards direction and no power, and the hosts clear their lines. 47 min: Joe Rodon is still in the game, by the way, and now sports what looks like a very secure black headband. Turkey get the second half started. They\u2019ve replaced their captain Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu with \u0130smail Y\u00fcksek, while Dan James has come on for Mark Harris. Half-time reading. Other entertainment-infused Welsh football stories are available. That was such good fun. Who needs goals? 45 min +8: A ball swung into the Wales box from the left. G\u00fcler guides a header straight at Darlow. It\u2019s hardly stopped. 45 min +6: Wales hit the post! Harris advances down the left and crosses low for Wilson, who swivels and crashes a low drive off the base of the right-hand post! G\u00fcnok was beaten all ends up. The rebound does not favour Wales. Well, it didn\u2019t take long for things to pick up again, did it? 45 min +5: The game restarts but for the first time this evening, the pace has dropped. Understandable after the long stoppage while Rodon was getting patched up. 45 min +3: In other naked-eye-misinformation news, Rodon wasn\u2019t whacked on the nose. Like Harris, he\u2019s taken a bash to the brow, though blood has been drawn. Thankfully he\u2019s good to continue, having presumably passed concussion checks, but he\u2019s now wearing a very large bandage around his head. 45 min +1: Harris is back up, sporting quite the shiner. 45 min: Harris was only just offside in the build-up to that disallowed goal. The gap looked much bigger to the naked eye, so that\u2019s the power of VAR for you. There will be five additional first-half minutes. Probably more, because Rodon is still receiving treatment. 43 min: Harris and Rodon stick the nut on each other while competing for a high ball. Ooyah, oof, that looked super-painful, and poor Rodon looks to have come off significantly worse. Think his team-mate caught him on the bridge of the nose there. Some of the red stuff already seeping through his fingers. On come the medical folk. 41 min: Harris is sent scampering down the right. He cuts back for James, who sweeps into the net from 12 yards! But it\u2019s not going to be a goal, because the assistant referee has put her flag up. The end of the move wasn\u2019t initially televised, either, because the Turkish director stayed on the official rather than following the action, just so everyone knew what was what. Everyone doing their bit. Replays showed, etc., and so on. 39 min: There\u2019s a VAR check over the Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu incident, but it\u2019s not a penalty. 37 min: Akg\u00fcn is sent scampering into acres down the right by G\u00fcler\u2019s sprayed pass. He looks for Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu in the middle. Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu is barged by Davies and clanks into Darlow. He wants a penalty as Wales clear their lines and counter. He\u2019s not getting one. Up the other end, Wilson nearly gets on the end of Johnson\u2019s clever pass down the right, but G\u00fcnok races out of his box to bash away from danger. 35 min: This is a greased piglet of a match. \u00c7alhano\u011flu crosses from the left. Y\u0131lmaz wins a header but can\u2019t get any power on it. Darlow claims. Williams goes down in search of breath. A brief pause. 33 min: Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu splits the Welsh back line in two with a simple pass down the middle. Akg\u00fcn is clear, one on one with Darlow! He has to score \u2026 but Darlow spreads himself large, and smothers the shot! What a save. Turkey redouble their efforts, \u00c7alhano\u011flu winning a corner down the left. Nothing comes of that. 31 min: In totally contradictory news, Thomas bombs down the left at warp speed. He reaches the edge of the Turkey box, thinks about shooting, tries to slip Wilson in on the overlap instead, and gets it all wrong. A fine opportunity wasted. A shame after such a blistering run. 30 min: James attempts to take a quick throw. His manager tells him in no uncertain terms to slow things down so his team-mates can take a breather. There\u2019s gung-ho, and there\u2019s looking for trouble. 29 min: Demiral tries to spring Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu clear down the inside-left channel with a long pass, but overhits it. Just as well for Wales, who were wide open there. 27 min: This game is fair flying by. Now Wales faff about at the back, gifting \u00c7alhano\u011flu the opportunity to shoot from distance. His effort is deflected, and nothing comes of the corner that results. 26 min: \u2026 so having said that, Wilson romps down the left and crosses long for Johnson, who can\u2019t control at the far stick. Had he managed to do so, he\u2019s have been shooting at goal from six yards, unopposed, with just the keeper to beat. 25 min: The corner from the left is worked long. Akg\u00fcn shoots from a tight angle on the right. Another corner. This one\u2019s laid off to G\u00fcler, who can\u2019t find anyone with a cutback from the right. Wales hanging on a bit here. 24 min: G\u00fcler has a bash from distance. The shot\u2019s deflected wide right, where M\u00fcld\u00fcr picks up possession. He crosses low and hard, forcing Roberts to slide in and hook behind with red shirts lurking. Another corner, and Turkey are really cranking up the pressure here. 23 min: Nothing comes from the set piece. But once again Turkey barely draw breath before launching another attack, snaffling the ball from a Wales throw, Y\u0131lmaz then running slap-bang into Roberts, 30 yards from goal. Free kick. 22 min: Y\u0131lmaz, tight on the left touchline and spotting Darlow out of position, takes an outrageous shy at goal. The shot nearly creeps into the bottom-left corner from a tight angle, as well. Darlow does pretty well to spot the danger, adjust, and turn the ball out for a corner. 20 min: Some broad-brush comedy as K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc cuts in from the left and drives a low shot goalwards, only for it to ping off the heel of his own player Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu and out for a goal kick. Turkey come again, and Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu, clearly frustrated, opens his body and sends a shot into the top-left corner of the stand behind the goal. That was wild. 18 min: G\u00fcler tries to release Y\u0131lmaz down the inside-right channel with an ambitious raking pass; Y\u0131lmaz nearly reaches it as well, but Davies sticks out a leg to intercept. That was a crucial intervention. Wales counter, and Williams crosses from the left; by the far stick, Demiral calmly chests back to his keeper. More end-to-end fun. 16 min: \u2026 and now Demiral has a whack from long range. That one goes over the bar as well. Possibly an even wilder attempt. Good work by G\u00fcler down the right to set it up. 14 min: Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu blazes a shot over the bar from distance. Turkey are beginning to find their rhythm now; they just need to locate their range. 13 min: That wasn\u2019t a million miles away from the challenge Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer got away with on Mikel Merino in the Champions League the other week. Just as well Mikel Arteta doesn\u2019t manage Turkey in his spare time. 11 min: Y\u0131lmaz is down again, flattened by Darlow who was busy punching clear a ball bouncing on the edge of his six-yard box. Turkey want a penalty but the referee shows no interest whatsoever. \u201cCan\u2019t help thinking Bellamy has missed a trick by playing Harry Wilson from the start,\u201d opines Richard Hirst. \u201cAs any fule kno, even us Fulham supporters, he\u2019s best left till the end.\u201d 9 min: Johnson goes into the book for a fairly brazen kick at Y\u0131lmaz. No real need for that, and now he\u2019s on the disciplinary tightrope for the next hour and 20 minutes. 7 min: Akg\u00fcn twists the blood of Williams as he advances down the right. He nearly bursts clear into the Wales box but Davies comes over to get in the way and usher the ball out of play for a goal kick. This game is rattling along nicely. 6 min: Wales are definitely up for this. It\u2019s all a bit frantic. Wilson dribbles down the middle and draws a foul from M\u00fcld\u00fcr. Johnson and Roberts combine down the right in the hope of earning a corner. Not quite, but full marks for full-throttle ambition. Turkey counter through the prodigy G\u00fcler, who glides in from the right and takes the evening\u2019s first shot in anger. Darlow behind it all the way. The crowd are whistling quite a lot. 4 min: Wales, every atom their manager\u2019s creation, continue to pile forward with determination. It nearly costs them, though, as Akg\u00fcn breaks clear down the right on the counter. The visitors are fortunate his attempt to find Y\u0131lmaz in the centre with a low cross is no good. 2 min: \u2026 but then Thomas comes again down the left and goes over having brushed Y\u0131lmaz. There doesn\u2019t look to be a great deal in it, and Y\u0131lmaz is livid, so it\u2019s probably for the best that nothing comes of the resulting free kick. 1 min: \u2026 but nothing comes of it \u2026 33 secs: A fast start by Wales, with Thomas barrelling down the left wing at speed to win the first corner of the match \u2026 Wales get the ball rolling. \u201cWales will be lucky to escape without a roasting this afternoon,\u201d predicts Jeremy Boyce. \u201cThe crowd and atmosphere will be cranked up to ten, it will be hot despite the fact that it\u2019s nearly winter. I used to play a bit on Hackney Marshes, back in the day before they demolished the tower blocks, and if you were up against a T\u00fcrkiye Spor Kul\u00fcb\u00fc team, there were plenty in northeast London, you knew you were in for a tough match and should have maybe said no to the last pint the night before. I\u2019m sure nothing has changed.\u201d The teams are out! Turkey in red, Wales in second-choice [squints, adjusts pince-nez, holds press release at different angle to catch light] pearl citrine. A fine atmosphere in Kayseri, the city hosting the national team for the first time since 2013. Turkey beat Andorra 5-0 that day, it\u2019s probably worth pointing that out. Anyway, we\u2019ll be off in a minute! Craig Bellamy talks to S4C with the atmosphere in the Kadir Has Stadium in Kayseri already bubbling up nicely. \u201cMark Harris is a dangerous profile \u2026 speed, looking to stretch the game \u2026 definitely a player for this type of game \u2026 the first 15-20 minutes will be massive but it will settle down \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of scenarios that could arise \u2026 you have to embrace it \u2026 we\u2019ve done enough meetings \u2026 hopefully we\u2019ll be able to find solutions when they occur \u2026 adapt to situations \u2026 that\u2019s really the test for tonight \u2026 this is football, it\u2019s why it\u2019s the greatest game in the world \u2026 I have full trust in the players, I believe they\u2019re a lot better than I was \u2026 these moments \u2026 you have to take a step back .. this is why, to come here in an atmosphere like this \u2026 it\u2019s going to be a test of course \u2026 but life\u2019s about that, surely \u2026 whatever the outcome, I\u2019m looking forward to what happens!\u201d Turkey \u2013 or T\u00fcrkiye, to give them their Fifa-recognised name; the FAW haven\u2019t pushed the button on Cymru yet \u2013 are much changed from the team sent out for the 0-0 draw in Cardiff back in early September. Merih Demiral, Kerem Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu, Eren Elmal\u0131, Yunus Akg\u00fcn and captain Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu all start, replacing that day\u2019s selection of Zeki \u00c7elik, \u0130smail Y\u00fcksek and Kaan Ayhan, who are on the bench, and \u00c7a\u011flar S\u00f6y\u00fcnc\u00fc and Kenan Y\u0131ld\u0131z, who are not in the squad. Craig Bellamy makes four changes to the team that started the 1-0 win over Montenegro last month. Connor Roberts, Sorba Thomas, Jordan James and Brennan Johnson are in, taking the places of Ben Cabango, Liam Cullen and David Brooks, who are on the bench, and the absent Wes Burns. Turkey: G\u00fcnok, M\u00fcld\u00fcr, Demiral, Bardakci, Elmali, K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc, \u00c7alhanoglu, Akg\u00fcn, G\u00fcler, Akt\u00fcrkoglu, Yilmaz. Subs: Akaydin, Ayhan, Bay\u0131nd\u0131r, Haspolatm K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7soy, Top\u00e7u, Yoku\u015flu, Y\u00fcksek, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, \u00c7ak\u0131r, \u00c7elik, \u00dcnal. Wales: Darlow, N Williams, Roberts, Rodon, B Davies, Thomas, J James, Sheehan, Wilson, Johnson, Harris. Subs: Ward, King, Mepham, Norrington-Davies, Allen, Koumas, Brooks, Colwill, Cullen, Cabango, D James, Dasilva. With a win in Kayseri tonight, Wales can take a big step towards automatic promotion to League A. Defeat however would rule that opportunity out, while potentially bringing a relegation play-off into the equation. Plenty for Craig Bellamy\u2019s ever-entertaining side to play for in Kayseri tonight, then! Kick-off is at 5pm GMT. It\u2019s on!

      "body": "<p>Late drama and justice featured in a breathless finish to this riveting encounter. When Neco Williams challenged Yunus Akgun and Connor Roberts tackled Kerem Akturkoglu in the Wales area, each seemed clean yet the referee, Juan Mart\u00ednez Munuera, awarded a penalty.</p> <p>It was unclear for which player\u2019s (apparent) misdemeanour and the VAR did not intervene but when Akturkoglu stepped up his spot kick shaved Karl Darlow\u2019s left post and missed, which felt correct.</p> <p>As the Wales No 1 said: \u201cI thought the challenge was fair [for the penalty]. With the way we defended and the determination we showed, I thought we deserved a point.</p> <p>\u201cWe showed we are hard to beat. That speaks a lot for the commitment and effort the lads put in.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/nov/16/turkey-wales-uefa-nations-league-live\">Turkey 0-0 Wales: Nations League \u2013 live reaction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So after Craig Bellamy spoke of a trip to Turkey being a marker regarding Wales\u2019s World Cup qualification campaign, departing with a draw is a fillip.</p> <p>His men were unbeaten in four Nations League games under him and in the cauldron of Kayseri\u2019s RHG Enert\u00fcrk Enerji Stadium showed a hunger for a fifth. Sorba Thomas claimed an early corner. Darlow took the ball, and then Baris Alper Yilmaz, as the No 11 challenged for a high delivery near the Welsh goal. Vincenzo Montella\u2019s players wanted a penalty but the referee, rightly, was not interested.</p> <p>They did, though, exert a control that pleased the raucous crowd. Patient play manoeuvered Arda Guler, the Real Madrid wunderkind, into position down the right, he chipped over, Joe Rodon headed away but only to Merih Demiral, who blasted over.</p> <p>Any possession Wales enjoyed petered out almost instantly, as when Thomas marauded down the left and lost the ball. Akturkoglu, the home No 7, was allowed two sighters by the passive Wales midfield: each missed and served as a warning. So, too, a Hakan Calhanoglu corner from the left, plus interplay between Guler and Calhanoglu that featured the latter crossing and Darlow collecting.</p>    <p>Closer was a slicing Mert Muldur delivery that slid before Darlow and needed Roberts\u2019s sliding intervention. Worse was Josh Sheehan ceding possession as Wales tried to move out from the back in a scare that required Turkey indecision and Calhanoglu\u2019s unsuccessful long-range effort to allow the escape.</p> <p>Hemmed in, Wales had to be lethal with any chance. So when Thomas raced along the left he rued landing the ball behind Johnson, who, running over from the right, was in plum position to score.</p> <p>One of Turkey\u2019s more dangerous attempts featured Akgun unloading in Wales\u2019s area and Darlow, advancing, repelling with his legs. Another had Ben Davies scrambling as Akturkoglu threatened to nip in behind before a Mark Harris and Rodon head clash caused a delay and left Harris with a shiner over his right eye and Rodon bandaged.</p> <p>Wales went mighty close when Harry Wilson, fed by Harris, shot from distance and hit the right post, the following-up Johnson unlucky that the rebound evaded him.</p> <p>To try to stymie the Turkish flow Bellamy called on the pace of Dan James, for Harris, while Montella replaced his captain, Calhanoglu, with Ismail Yuksek for the second half.</p> <p>A Thomas corner was bright but Turkey were soon in familiar ball-hogging mode, a flighted pass chested by Yilmaz as he looked to get in behind before Guler took over but failed to prosper.</p> <p>Wales could not put their foot on the ball and slow this Nations League encounter, which meant they were living dangerously. Akgun, striding forward and shooting barely wide, gave them another fright. Turkey could fill a compendium of these. Yilmaz, before being taken off, claimed a free-kick and the bearded Orkun Kokcu fired too high. If Turkey had discovered ruthlessness \u2013 Enes Unal missed an open goal \u2013 Wales would have been downed.</p> <p>After the excitement of the penalty that should not have been, with a single Group B4 match remaining Turkey lead with 11 points. Wales, on nine, host Iceland, who have seven, on Tuesday, so all is to play for.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Late drama and justice featured in a breathless finish to this riveting encounter. When Neco Williams challenged Yunus Akgun and Connor Roberts tackled Kerem Akturkoglu in the Wales area, each seemed clean yet the referee, Juan Mart\u00ednez Munuera, awarded a penalty. It was unclear for which player\u2019s (apparent) misdemeanour and the VAR did not intervene but when Akturkoglu stepped up his spot kick shaved Karl Darlow\u2019s left post and missed, which felt correct. As the Wales No 1 said: \u201cI thought the challenge was fair [for the penalty]. With the way we defended and the determination we showed, I thought we deserved a point. \u201cWe showed we are hard to beat. That speaks a lot for the commitment and effort the lads put in.\u201d So after Craig Bellamy spoke of a trip to Turkey being a marker regarding Wales\u2019s World Cup qualification campaign, departing with a draw is a fillip. His men were unbeaten in four Nations League games under him and in the cauldron of Kayseri\u2019s RHG Enert\u00fcrk Enerji Stadium showed a hunger for a fifth. Sorba Thomas claimed an early corner. Darlow took the ball, and then Baris Alper Yilmaz, as the No 11 challenged for a high delivery near the Welsh goal. Vincenzo Montella\u2019s players wanted a penalty but the referee, rightly, was not interested. They did, though, exert a control that pleased the raucous crowd. Patient play manoeuvered Arda Guler, the Real Madrid wunderkind, into position down the right, he chipped over, Joe Rodon headed away but only to Merih Demiral, who blasted over. Any possession Wales enjoyed petered out almost instantly, as when Thomas marauded down the left and lost the ball. Akturkoglu, the home No 7, was allowed two sighters by the passive Wales midfield: each missed and served as a warning. So, too, a Hakan Calhanoglu corner from the left, plus interplay between Guler and Calhanoglu that featured the latter crossing and Darlow collecting. Closer was a slicing Mert Muldur delivery that slid before Darlow and needed Roberts\u2019s sliding intervention. Worse was Josh Sheehan ceding possession as Wales tried to move out from the back in a scare that required Turkey indecision and Calhanoglu\u2019s unsuccessful long-range effort to allow the escape. Hemmed in, Wales had to be lethal with any chance. So when Thomas raced along the left he rued landing the ball behind Johnson, who, running over from the right, was in plum position to score. One of Turkey\u2019s more dangerous attempts featured Akgun unloading in Wales\u2019s area and Darlow, advancing, repelling with his legs. Another had Ben Davies scrambling as Akturkoglu threatened to nip in behind before a Mark Harris and Rodon head clash caused a delay and left Harris with a shiner over his right eye and Rodon bandaged. Wales went mighty close when Harry Wilson, fed by Harris, shot from distance and hit the right post, the following-up Johnson unlucky that the rebound evaded him. To try to stymie the Turkish flow Bellamy called on the pace of Dan James, for Harris, while Montella replaced his captain, Calhanoglu, with Ismail Yuksek for the second half. A Thomas corner was bright but Turkey were soon in familiar ball-hogging mode, a flighted pass chested by Yilmaz as he looked to get in behind before Guler took over but failed to prosper. Wales could not put their foot on the ball and slow this Nations League encounter, which meant they were living dangerously. Akgun, striding forward and shooting barely wide, gave them another fright. Turkey could fill a compendium of these. Yilmaz, before being taken off, claimed a free-kick and the bearded Orkun Kokcu fired too high. If Turkey had discovered ruthlessness \u2013 Enes Unal missed an open goal \u2013 Wales would have been downed. After the excitement of the penalty that should not have been, with a single Group B4 match remaining Turkey lead with 11 points. Wales, on nine, host Iceland, who have seven, on Tuesday, so all is to play for.",

      "bodyText": "A Northern Territory police officer who faced criminal charges after an inquest found his partner died amid a \u201chistory of family violence\u201d has returned to work after the case against him was dropped. A coroner found the officer\u2019s partner, who was herself a former police officer in her late 30s, died in 2020 after 17 complaints were made to NT police about violence and \u201cdomestic disturbances\u201d in the five years before her death. Judge Greg Cavanagh reported the officer to police and the director of public prosecutions in 2021, finding that offences may have been committed in connection with the woman\u2019s death. He found the death was caused by an untreated head injury that \u201cwould not happen spontaneously\u201d and \u201crequired some form of trauma, likely a hit to the head, either due to falling or from another person\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The officer, who with his former partner cannot be named, was subsequently charged with failure to rescue, as it was alleged he had not sought medical treatment for his partner. But Guardian Australia can reveal the case has been dropped and the officer has returned to active duty. The DPP said that \u201cafter review of all of the evidence it was determined that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction of [the officer] for any offence\u201d. The NT police did not comment on whether he was subject to an internal investigation, but officers who are under investigation do not typically continue active duty during this time. The force confirmed the officer had been suspended with pay for more than four years before returning to work. The case comes as a force already riven with issues faces a reckoning on its broader police accountability measures and how it deals with family violence, including abusers within its own ranks. There are concerns, however, that those pressing issues may not be addressed. The force, spurred on by a new Country Liberal party government which says it has a mandate for change, is instead expected to prioritise sweeping changes to its handling of youth offenders. The force is also expected to have to respond imminently to broad recommendations arising from inquests into the family violence-related deaths of four Indigenous women and the death of Kumanjayi Walker. The family violence-related inquest will deliver its findings this month, with findings from the long-running Walker inquest expected early next year. \u201cDomestic violence \u2026 is the true crime and safety crisis we are facing here in the NT,\u201d Justine Davis, the independent MP for Johnston, told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is imperative that we take immediate action to protect women and children from harm. \u201cThere must also be zero tolerance for coercive control, domestic violence and insufficient investigations.\u201d The inquest into the death of the former police officer made four recommendations, which the force say it has implemented, including that an assistant commissioner oversees all \u201cdomestic violence\u201d complaints relating to police, and that all police officers have training in the identification of \u201cred flags\u201d for coercive control. Cavanagh, the coroner, said in his findings into her death that \u201cdomestic violence perpetrated by serving police officers is considered to be a significant issue and police appear to struggle with investigating their own members\u201d. He found that the reasons why a victim might not wish to report family violence are magnified when the perpetrator is a police officer. These included fears that disclosing could result in further and escalated violence, that the offender had access to \u201cinside information and [could] manipulate the system\u201d, and that other police would minimise the reports and protect the perpetrator. \u201cThose fears were from time to time expressed by [her],\u201d Cavanagh said. \u201cShe said there was \u2018no point\u2019, she \u2018knew how the system works\u2019, that her partner was a police officer and \u2018he would be informed of the complaint\u2019 and she would have to \u2018deal with the consequences\u2019 \u2026 [and] she had spoken to the police and \u2018nothing was done\u2019. \u201cThose fears appear to have been realised \u2026 [an] assistant commissioner was of the view that there were a number of failures in the way police dealt with the complaints, [and] the head of the Domestic Violence Unit at the time provided the opinion that \u2018throughout these incidents, we have failed\u2019.\u201d The 17 reports outlined in the inquest involve allegations of violence, including reports made by friends of the partner and members of the public, and that applications were made for court orders protecting the partner and the officer at various times. But Cavanagh found that many of the incidents were not identified by the force as involving domestic violence. Many of the reports include references to alcohol, with Cavanagh finding the partner suffered chronic alcoholism due to post-traumatic stress disorder. She was dismissed from the police force in relation to incidents related to her alcoholism. Report 10 outlines that the officer received a formal caution from the force after an incident in December 2016. Police received a report from a serviced apartment provider that the officer had come looking for the woman and identified himself as a police officer, Cavanagh said. \u201cHe took a room near hers and jumped from his balcony on to hers and escorted her from the building. Police attended at their residence. \u201cHer partner told police that she had been intoxicated and he believed she might self-harm. \u201cThey did not investigate as to whether [she] needed protection.\u201d Neighbours called police about a year later, after seeing a man chase a woman and drag her back into the house. Cavanagh said the couple confirmed the report when police attended the house later that day, with the partner saying the argument started because the officer thought she was leaving to get alcohol. Police did not identify the incident as involving family violence. As part of report 15, Cavanagh found the woman wrote in her diary in August 2019 that the officer \u201cabsolutely lost his shit\u201d, hitting her about the head and shoulders and trying to drag her out of the house. \u201cShe said he knocked her contact lens out and caused bruising to her neck, shoulders, arms and jaw. She did not call the police,\u201d Cavanagh found. The inquest heard that in 2019, the woman wrote an email to her mother stating: \u201ctoday when he hit me I yelled for him to stop \u2026 so they knew I wasn\u2019t making shit up \u2026 I have been hit about 4-5 times today \u2026 threatened me with a broom.\u201d In January 2020, Cavanagh found, she was planning on leaving the officer. She died two months later. Cavanagh said there were \u201cquestions about what happened during those last five days [of her life] that needed answers\u201d. \u201cHowever, when Counsel Assisting called upon the partner to provide evidence, his lawyer sought that he not be compelled to do so on the grounds that it might incriminate him in an offence or offences in relation to her death. \u201cIn my 25 years as the Territory Coroner, that is the only occasion that a serving police officer has refused to answer questions because the answers might incriminate him or her in an offence relating to the death.\u201d Cavanagh was critical of a decision not to establish a crime scene at the couple\u2019s house after the death, saying this was likely \u201caffected by similar considerations to the failure to protect [the woman] after complaints were made\u201d. \u201cIn effect, the word of a fellow police officer weighed more heavily than it should, and her death was believed to be an overdose,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case there was also the history of domestic violence including the recent reports that were at that very time being investigated. \u201cThe Assistant Commissioner indicated that a crime scene should have been declared, saying all unexpected deaths should be treated as suspicious until proven otherwise.\u201d Cavanagh said that in 2015 a police superintendent wrote \u201cfrom time to time, when he is under stress, he has acted aggressively and abusively towards others at work where he has lost control\u201d. A mental health nurse who was treating the woman told the inquest that they had been told the officer was easily angered and would say degrading things in the presence of their children. Cavanagh said that after the woman\u2019s death, the officer went to the nurse\u2019s rooms and showed a video on his mobile phone. The video was of the woman marching on the spot as she explained that she thought she was trying to turn on the shower. \u201c[The nurse] said: \u2018I think that video more or less reflected the type of person [the partner] was that I did not see \u2026 he almost laughed and smiled while showing me the video \u2026 you could hear laughter in the background [on the video] as well\u2019,\u201d Cavanagh said. \u201cAt the time the video was taken the deceased was sober and her confusion was likely the result of the haemorrhaging blood in the subdural space of her skull.\u201d The officer\u2019s lawyer was contacted for comment. \u2022 In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

The minor party on Friday watered down its demands again, dropping the negative gearing and CGT demands and instead assembling a new list of requests including immediate funding for 25,000 new social and affordable homes, boosting the number of homes available under the separate Build to Rent program, and tweaks to how Help to Buy repayments are made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2024/nov/17/clare-oneil-on-labors-plan-to-fix-the-housing-crisis-full-story-podcast\">Clare O\u2019Neil on Labor\u2019s plan to fix the housing crisis - podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government wants to take the Greens down a peg after their housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, won Labor-held Griffith at the last election.

The Coalition is against it, as is One Nation, while the rest of the crossbench is still mostly mulling its position. David Pocock, usually a key target of government lobbying, said on Wednesday \u201cin its current form, I don\u2019t believe it strikes the right balance and I will be opposing the bill\u201d \u2013 perhaps indicating potential support with some changes.</p>    <p>Guardian Australia understands that the former Labor senator Fatima Payman is still considering her position, as are the Greens.

The special minister of state, Don Farrell, has repeatedly briefed out over many months that the electoral changes were imminent, and they will finally be introduced into parliament this fortnight.

      "bodyText": "With two final parliamentary sitting weeks left in the year, large parts of the Labor government\u2019s legislative agenda remain stuck in the Senate quagmire. There are more than 30 pieces of legislation scheduled to be considered in the November sitting fortnight. Some further key promises, such as the long-awaited gambling advertising restrictions, are yet to be seen. Others, like the electoral reform proposals, are still awaiting formal introduction by the government. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Senate sources expect a flurry of last-minute compromise and negotiation from the government to pass their stalled bills, even though Anthony Albanese has declared \u201cour position is final\u201d on key legislation. Just months from the next election, this is the state of the Albanese government\u2019s remaining legislative agenda. What\u2019s now in the Senate? Asked last week about the government\u2019s backlog of legislation in the Senate and what it would do to clear it, Albanese said the government\u2019s position \u201cis final\u201d. \u201cWe want the Senate to pass our legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I find astonishing is that things are blocked in the Senate.\u201d HOUSING LEGISLATION The Help to Buy bill is one the government would like to have passed, especially just months before an election expected to be fought furiously on housing issues \u2013 but having it remain stalled in the Senate, as it has been for months, might not be a bad second option. Labor has pointed to the Greens\u2019 disapproval of the bill as evidence the progressive minor party is in a \u201cNo-alition\u201d with the Liberals and Nationals, painting the Greens (and opposition) as blocking the government\u2019s housing plans. The Greens had said they wanted to make a deal with the government on Help to Buy, with hopes of securing changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax, but the government didn\u2019t jump at that. The minor party on Friday watered down its demands again, dropping the negative gearing and CGT demands and instead assembling a new list of requests including immediate funding for 25,000 new social and affordable homes, boosting the number of homes available under the separate Build to Rent program, and tweaks to how Help to Buy repayments are made. The government wants to take the Greens down a peg after their housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, won Labor-held Griffith at the last election. With the Greens targeting several Labor seats in 2025 and campaigning hard on housing issues in inner-city spots such as Wills, Cooper and Moreton, the government will keep highlighting Greens obstructionism in the Senate. And despite government denials, there\u2019s a theory the government is using this bill as a double-dissolution trigger. MIS- AND DISINFORMATION The government\u2019s second attempt at passing the bill restricting misinformation has few friends in the upper house. The Coalition is against it, as is One Nation, while the rest of the crossbench is still mostly mulling its position. David Pocock, usually a key target of government lobbying, said on Wednesday \u201cin its current form, I don\u2019t believe it strikes the right balance and I will be opposing the bill\u201d \u2013 perhaps indicating potential support with some changes. Guardian Australia understands that the former Labor senator Fatima Payman is still considering her position, as are the Greens. With the Coalition strongly opposed, the government needs the Greens plus several other crossbenchers to back it. FUTURE MADE IN AUSTRALIA It arrived with a flourish and a major PR campaign, but we haven\u2019t heard much about the $23bn manufacturing and energy transition bill lately. The Coalition has major concerns about government subsidies going to businesses and claims it could lead to \u201cpork barrelling\u201d, planning to oppose the legislation. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has criticised the plan as an \u201celection slush fund for more coal and gas\u201d, demanding the government rule out any public money going to subsidise fossil fuels \u2013 but hasn\u2019t entirely ruled out the Greens backing the bill in another form. The government has strongly backed FMIA, with Albanese mentioning the term regularly in public appearances and even appointing a dedicated minister, Tim Ayres. Labor sold FMIA as its answer to the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 but with Donald Trump\u2019s election win, and the potential for the IRA to be pulled apart by the new Republican president, it\u2019s unclear how the government will play this going forward. AGED CARE REFORMS The government\u2019s plan to make wealthier Australians pay more for some of their aged care costs is supported by the Coalition, and likely to pass this fortnight without much consternation. NATURE POSITIVE Another stalled piece of legislation, and another instance of the government being torn between the Greens wanting stronger laws and the Coalition wanting less restrictions. The mining sector is strongly unhappy about the plan to make a new environmental watchdog, and the government is struggling to find friends for it. The Greens say they want any such body to have stronger powers, believing the current proposal would be \u201ctokenistic\u201d. Unless they can win the Coalition or Greens, the nature positive laws seem doomed. Still to come The prime minister flagged the government would also be \u201cintroducing a range of legislation\u201d in parliament\u2019s final two weeks, signalling some of it would be pushed through by the end of the year. \u201cBut some of that, of course, will be debated next year,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cParliament\u2019s coming back in February, so we expect that to happen.\u201d The much-delayed electoral reform changes surrounding political donations and campaign funding have finally been detailed, after much anticipation about the government\u2019s plan. The special minister of state, Don Farrell, has repeatedly briefed out over many months that the electoral changes were imminent, and they will finally be introduced into parliament this fortnight. They are likely to easily pass through parliament, due to the rules already being negotiated with the Coalition, though the independents will put up a major fight. Several key promises, and long-awaited reforms, have not yet been seen. Those include: Media reform, including the future of the news media bargaining code, and how to compensate news outlets for the loss of funds under that code after Meta\u2019s refusal to participate. A response to Peta Murphy\u2019s gambling report, calling for a full ban on online wagering advertising. The social media ban for children under 16. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, had committed to \u201cto have a comprehensive response in this term\u201d of parliament to the Murphy gambling report, with some Senate sources expressing faint expectations the government\u2019s response may finally arrive in this sitting fortnight \u2013 now nearly 17 months after the report was delivered. The media reform proposals are similarly thorny issues. Media outlets are particularly keen to hear how the government will update or replace the news media bargaining code, which delivered major windfalls to some publications. With bipartisan support from the Coalition, the social media ban should sail through the parliament whenever the government introduces it \u2013 even if there are concerns from some senators about the potential that the bill would be rushed through without proper scrutiny, a Senate inquiry, or the age assurance trial even having begun.",

      "body": "<p>In 1996 I was working at the Illawarra Community Development Program in New South Wales teaching print-making and establishing a gallery there. One spring day I wandered into the office and saw this tall guy in goofy glasses and a green Hard Yakka uniform standing behind a desk. I\u2019d never seen him before but something about him was instantly magnetic to me.</p> <p>When I found out we were workmates I was shocked at how excited I was. Even though he wasn\u2019t my usual type, I was drawn to him in a way I hadn\u2019t experienced before. I made a point of befriending him but it wasn\u2019t long before cups of tea in the staffroom weren\u2019t cutting it, so I bit the bullet and asked him out on a date.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t my usual style. While I\u2019m an outgoing person, romantically I\u2019d usually gone with the flow \u2013 I didn\u2019t pursue people. But Ulan was different. I had this overwhelming sense that I needed to get close to him.</p>    <p>We arranged to meet at the uni bar in Wollongong. We\u2019d both been students there a few years earlier but had never crossed paths. I\u2019d just left a long-term relationship and had moved into an empty house literally that day. After a few drinks we wound up at my place, sitting by a fire in the yard.</p> <p>The conversation flowed easily towards life\u2019s big questions: what did we really want? What was important to us? How open were we to adventure? It quickly became apparent we were on the same page.</p> <p>We were both 28 and shared this fluid concept of what a good life could and should look like. We agreed we could uproot ourselves at any moment and live anywhere. In that instant, I could envision a life with him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/21/the-moment-i-knew-he-gave-the-homeless-man-his-number-in-case-he-needed-someone-to-talk-to\">The moment I knew: he gave the homeless man his number in case he needed someone to talk to</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I knew I had found someone who matched my energy and imagination and was open to anything. I called my mother the next day and told her I\u2019d met the man I was going to marry.</p> <p>Things developed quickly and within a few months we were living together. He just had this amazing spirit to make things happen rather than being overly practical. With him I felt this sense that anything was possible, that we could make whatever life we wanted, rather than doing it by the book. By autumn 1997 we\u2019d bought an old Volkswagen van for $1,500 and were setting off together for Cape York. I had another community development position; Ulan was more than happy to come along for the ride and found work there himself.</p>    <p>A year later, on the anniversary of our first date, we were married on his sister\u2019s property in Mudgee. We were so starry-eyed we hardly noticed what a massive undertaking we\u2019d thrust upon her and her husband. Everything seemed possible to us \u2013 nothing was too hard.</p> <p>In some regards we are different people but we complement each other so well.

      "bodyText": "In 1996 I was working at the Illawarra Community Development Program in New South Wales teaching print-making and establishing a gallery there. One spring day I wandered into the office and saw this tall guy in goofy glasses and a green Hard Yakka uniform standing behind a desk. I\u2019d never seen him before but something about him was instantly magnetic to me. When I found out we were workmates I was shocked at how excited I was. Even though he wasn\u2019t my usual type, I was drawn to him in a way I hadn\u2019t experienced before. I made a point of befriending him but it wasn\u2019t long before cups of tea in the staffroom weren\u2019t cutting it, so I bit the bullet and asked him out on a date. This wasn\u2019t my usual style. While I\u2019m an outgoing person, romantically I\u2019d usually gone with the flow \u2013 I didn\u2019t pursue people. But Ulan was different. I had this overwhelming sense that I needed to get close to him. We arranged to meet at the uni bar in Wollongong. We\u2019d both been students there a few years earlier but had never crossed paths. I\u2019d just left a long-term relationship and had moved into an empty house literally that day. After a few drinks we wound up at my place, sitting by a fire in the yard. The conversation flowed easily towards life\u2019s big questions: what did we really want? What was important to us? How open were we to adventure? It quickly became apparent we were on the same page. We were both 28 and shared this fluid concept of what a good life could and should look like. We agreed we could uproot ourselves at any moment and live anywhere. In that instant, I could envision a life with him. I knew I had found someone who matched my energy and imagination and was open to anything. I called my mother the next day and told her I\u2019d met the man I was going to marry. Things developed quickly and within a few months we were living together. He just had this amazing spirit to make things happen rather than being overly practical. With him I felt this sense that anything was possible, that we could make whatever life we wanted, rather than doing it by the book. By autumn 1997 we\u2019d bought an old Volkswagen van for $1,500 and were setting off together for Cape York. I had another community development position; Ulan was more than happy to come along for the ride and found work there himself. A year later, on the anniversary of our first date, we were married on his sister\u2019s property in Mudgee. We were so starry-eyed we hardly noticed what a massive undertaking we\u2019d thrust upon her and her husband. Everything seemed possible to us \u2013 nothing was too hard. In some regards we are different people but we complement each other so well. Ulan has always been so happy to jump onboard with whatever wild scheme we hatched \u2013 he is almost like my \u201cyes guy.\u201d The past 26 years have been a rollercoaster of ideas and adventures that we could never have pulled off if we didn\u2019t have the dynamic that we do. We share all the wins and take equal responsibility when things don\u2019t go to plan.

He was made responsible for the 2020 women\u2019s T20 World Cup in which 86,174 watched the final, a breakthrough moment for women\u2019s sport and a precursor to the Matildas buzz that accompanied the 2023 Fifa World Cup.</p> <p>Then he was thrust into the chief executive role just as Covid took hold, replacing Kevin Roberts who was ousted after just 20 months. Cricket in Australia was still reeling from 2018\u2019s sandpaper controversy, head office had made 40 staff redundant and the pandemic was about to demolish the peak of the game\u2019s revenue cycle involving local men\u2019s Test tours by India and England.</p>    <p>Hockley has managed to stabilise the game, signing significant broadcast and player pay deals that set up Australian cricket for the next so-called strategic cycle, all while largely staying out of the spotlight. \u201cIt\u2019s been the privilege of my life to hold this office and I\u2019ve still got a lot to do,\u201d he says. \u201cTo get to work on something that so many people care about \u2013 I believe that any business, even going back to my corporate finance work \u2013 it\u2019s all about relationships.\u201d</p> <p>While financial concerns have been rarely absent, Hockey\u2019s biggest challenges came from elsewhere.

The former, we\u2019ve had to make some tough decisions, but then the latter, where someone that you\u2019ve worked really, really closely with is having a difficult time, that\u2019s been the hardest part.\u201d</p> <p>Paine\u2019s 2022 book was critical of Hockley\u2019s handling of the saga and the captain\u2019s ultimate resignation, and the Tasmanian retired from first class cricket soon after. He has returned to elite cricket in the past year, and was last week named head coach of the Prime Minister\u2019s XI team.</p>    <p>Hockley says he stays in contact. \u201cBehind the scenes, we\u2019ve really tried our best to support him, and I couldn\u2019t be happier that he\u2019s making great strides in coaching, and he\u2019s in and around the game. He\u2019s got so much to offer, and I really enjoy his company.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI feel a bit uncomfortable about this, because \u2026 it\u2019s not about me,\u201d Nick Hockley says. The outgoing Cricket Australia chief executive has just five months left in the sport\u2019s most demanding role yet he continues to avoid the limelight. \u201cI know I\u2019m nearing the end but I\u2019ve still got quite a lot to do.\u201d The Birmingham-born son of a doctor father and optometrist mother turned 50 three weeks ago. By the time he leaves CA in March, it will be almost five years since he was the somewhat surprising appointment as interim, then permanent, CEO. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do a big party,\u201d he says of his birthday. \u201cMaybe in March, or an end-of-season celebration.\u201d There will probably be much to celebrate after a highly anticipated summer which involves a men\u2019s series against India and a women\u2019s Ashes against England \u2013 Australian cricket\u2019s traditional enemy and its emerging challenger. The absurdity that an Englishman was handed responsibility for Australia\u2019s favourite pastime \u2013 in a period of great need \u2013 is not lost on Hockley, or his friends. \u201cMy mates in England just take the piss out of me all the time,\u201d he says. Yet Hockley\u2019s ties to Australia run deep. While studying at Oxford University, he lived with three Australians and two of them remain close friends. The other, Ian Tucker, died after a brain injury on the rugby field in 1996. Within 12 months of that tragedy Hockley was working in London with the corporate finance practice at PWC and soon sought a temporary transfer to Sydney.

Industry sources and academics have also raised concerns about alias betting accounts \u2013 sometimes referred to as \u201cbowler accounts\u201d \u2013 undermining anti-money laundering compliance systems. But the gamblers maintain no laws have been broken and that the transfer of accounts enables them to continue legitimate betting with bookmakers who have restricted them, sometimes to just $1 bets, due to their record of success. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The transfer of sensitive personal data \u2013 which could be misused to access bank accounts and MyGov records \u2013 has led government agencies and privacy experts to urge people not to sell their ID documents online. One group, which advertises on Facebook, promises to hand back control of accounts after six months, when inducements from betting agencies like deposit matching and free bets have been exhausted. These offers are not made to established gamblers. \u201cWe use a strategy called arbitrage betting, where we exploit market inefficiencies and mispriced odds created by competition among bookmakers,\u201d the group said in social media posts. \u201cSince bookmakers frown upon this practice and limit accounts, we always need access to new accounts to continue operating effectively.\u201d A Services Australia spokesperson, Hank Jongen, urged people to \u201cnever share your Medicare details with anyone over social media\u201d. So too did ID Care, Australia and New Zealand\u2019s national identity and cyber support service, which said this information could lead to identity theft if misused. \u201cWe will never use or share your ID for any purpose beyond betting-related activities,\u201d one group of gamblers said. \u201cYou can count on us to keep your data safe and provide the payment you\u2019re promised.\u201d There is no suggestion any of the syndicates highlighted in this story have broken any laws. Another syndicate claimed online that the accounts would be used to engage in matched batting. This practice involves using a free bet to gamble on one sporting outcome, while bets are placed with other bookmakers to hedge all possible outcomes. The gamblers, who acknowledge the transfer of accounts to another person is a breach of bookmaker terms and conditions, have claimed they need the ID documents to ensure they can comply with \u201cknow your customer\u201d regulations imposed on bookmakers, which are a key part of anti-money laundering laws. Multiple Australian bookmakers are facing investigations by the Australian Transactional Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac), for alleged breaches of these laws, which also require them to report suspicious gambling activities, which may include the use of concealed identities. Industry sources, not authorised to speak publicly, told Guardian Australia that such accounts were often picked up by compliance teams who observe unusual activity, including when different devices are used interstate. They described compliance efforts as a game of \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d, and acknowledged bets could be placed before the true controller of the account was revealed. They also said the gamblers were not interested in controlling accounts owned by women as, due to their smaller number of accounts, suspicious bets were easily detected by compliance teams. While Austrac has previously described some bets placed by bowler accounts as legitimate, it has also raised concerns about their potential misuse for money laundering. In its latest risk assessment for money laundering, Austrac revealed a separate unnamed gambling syndicate had recently controlled more than 100 accounts with multiple bookmakers. \u201cThe bowler accounts were opened under the name of third parties in order to conceal the true identity of the individual responsible for placing the bets,\u201d Austrac said. \u201cThe reporting entity [bookmaker] submitted an suspicious matter report as the true source of funds was unclear, raising concerns that the syndicate could be laundering illicit funds through gambling platforms on behalf of others.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on 1800 858 858. The National Debt Helpline is at 1800 007 007. In the UK, support for problem gambling can be found via the NHS National Problem Gambling Clinic on 020 7381 7722, or GamCare on 0808 8020 133.

One Nation\u2019s decision not to direct preferences to Andrew was \u201cthe most treacherous, incompetent act that I am yet to witness in Queensland politics,\u201d posted Rhys Bosley, a recreational shooters\u2019 advocate and an independent candidate. Andrew shared the post on his Facebook page. Succession plan For Jeff Knuth, it was his anger at gun control, the sale of public assets and what he saw as the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the old Country party that rallied him behind Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation banner. Knuth had been among the 11 One Nation candidates who swept into Queensland parliament in 1998 when Hanson\u2019s party secured 22.7% of first preference votes statewide \u2013 the second highest of any party \u2013 at its maiden election.

Ashby \u2013 who never really did his job from the shadows \u2013 stepped to the forefront and became One Nation\u2019s de facto state leader, even while the two-term MP Andrew was sitting in parliament. Ashby raised more money for his own campaign in Keppel \u2013 including with backing from Australia\u2019s richest person, Gina Rinehart \u2013 than One Nation\u2019s Queensland division has banked in donations for more than two years. In the end, Ashby fell short. Despite a marginal increase to the One Nation vote across Queensland, about 8% of all first-preference votes statewide, the party is without a representative in the state parliament for the first time in more than seven years. Andrew\u2019s loss has rankled with many, particularly in the recreational and professional shooting community which looked upon him as a key advocate. \u201cStephen was the only One Nation member to take a seat from a major party in the Queensland parliament since 1998, he is clearly a far better retail politician than Ashby is,\u201d Bosley wrote in his post. \u201cJames Ashby could have asked Stephen for lessons and worked with him. Stephen was already helping other local candidates, he was their best asset in that region and it was crazy to get rid of him.\u201d Savage says that after Andrew was elected in 2017, it took Hanson more than three months to reach out to him. He now joins the long list of people who have risen to prominence under the One Nation standard but fallen foul of the matriarch. \u201cPauline does have an X factor, but that\u2019s waning now,\u201d Savage says. \u201cI can\u2019t see the party going anywhere now. No one else will get elected.\u201d \u2018It was highly predictable\u2019 Others who weren\u2019t surprised by One Nation\u2019s 2024 Queensland election result include one of the state\u2019s leading political pundits \u2013 the Griffith University associate professor of politics Paul Williams \u2013 and One Nation\u2019s arch-rival on the political right in Queensland: Robbie Katter. \u201cIt was highly predictable,\u201d the newly re-elected member for the sprawling seat of Traeger in the far-flung north-west says. Katter, the third big-hatted bloke of his name in a political dynasty going back to 1966, says minor party success in such a geographically distinctive state with a unicameral parliament requires a consolidation of resources. \u201cTo get bums on seats you need to concentrate your effort,\u201d Katter says. \u201cYou can\u2019t concentrate your effort when you are trying to run 93 candidates at once. The two can\u2019t coexist.\u201d While the eponymous party he leads scored less than a third of One Nation\u2019s primary vote statewide in 2024 and didn\u2019t live up to expectations of being kingmakers, the Katters \u2013 who ran in only 11 electorates, all in the state\u2019s centre and north \u2013 still held three seats and will dominate a crossbench otherwise comprising only one Green and one independent. Williams, meanwhile, writing for Guardian Australia in January, predicted that Ashby was unlikely to win Keppel but flagged he might, possibly as soon as next year, succeed Hanson as the federal senator for Queensland. Hanson hung on to her Senate seat by the \u201cskin of her teeth\u201d in 2022, he says, is likely to have her only federally elected colleague lose his seat at the next election and will be in her mid-70s when her term expires. \u201cWhen Pauline retires, she\u2019s got a certain charm about her,\u201d Williams says. \u201cHas James Ashby got the same sort of charm? I\u2019d say not. He\u2019s not going to be the same magnet for votes.\u201d Katter, too, imagines One Nation will have \u201cenormous trouble trying to maintain the party beyond Pauline\u201d. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m not too sure how they can exist beyond Pauline\u2019s retirement,\u201d he says. \u201cI think she\u2019s developed a really strong following out there nationally \u2013 and I know full well that doesn\u2019t translate to Johnny-on-the-spot next to you. \u201cWe\u2019re probably privileged, on our side, that I share the same last [and first] name with Dad.\u201d Guardian Australia tried to speak to senior One Nation figures but was told the only person who could talk about the future of One Nation was Hanson. She declined an interview.",

      "body": "<p>Achieving the fastest sustainable growth in the G7 was the Labour party\u2019s highest-profile pledge going into the general election last July. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that boosting growth is \u201cat the heart of everything she does\u201d. But there was concerning news last week with new figures showing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/15/uk-economy-third-quarter-2024-ons-labour\">economy grew by just 0.1%</a> in the three months to the end of September, falling significantly short of expectations.</p> <p>Some business leaders have linked this anaemic growth to uncertainty in the run-up to last month\u2019s budget. But it will largely still be a product of factors outside the new chancellor\u2019s control, including the decisions of the last Conservative government.</p> <p>It is nevertheless disturbing news for Labour as well as for the country. The Resolution Foundation forecasts disposable household income per person is <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/autumn-budget-delivers-short-term-living-standards-pain/\">forecast to rise</a> by just 0.5% a year on average over the course of this parliament. The results of the US election sound an important alarm bell about the extent to which voters are willing to punish incumbent centre-left governments for failing to deliver noticeable increases in living standards.</p> <p>Ministers will be hoping that the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s growth predictions \u2013 it last month <a href=\"https://obr.uk/economic-and-fiscal-outlooks/\">revised its forecasts</a> down for the last three years of this parliament \u2013 are too pessimistic and that the government\u2019s combination of borrowing more to invest in public infrastructure, and supply-side reform in areas like planning, will deliver a bigger hit to growth in the moderate term. But they also need to be pulling every lever available to them to drive up growth and living standards in the next few years.</p> <p>The lever that Starmer and Reeves have said too little about is closer alignment with the EU. For any country experiencing the sluggish productivity growth and low levels of business investment the British economy has seen in recent decades, reducing trading barriers with close and friendly neighbours would be an easy win.</p> <p>The UK has done precisely the opposite to this with its decision to leave not just the political institutions of the EU, but the single market and customs union. Brexit has significantly depressed British exports and GDP, a cost the UK could ill afford. Last Thursday, the governor of the Bank of England highlighted the long-term impact of Brexit and urged ministers to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/14/bank-of-england-governor-urges-ministers-to-rebuild-relations-with-eu\">rebuild relations</a>\u201d with&nbsp;the EU.</p> <p>The government is quietly taking measures that could help it do just that; most notably in the product regulation and metrology bill currently making its way through parliament that will allow ministers to <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/the-brexit-bill-no-ones-talking-about/\">unilaterally align</a> with EU product regulations relating to environmental impact. But ministers appear held back by their fear of being attacked by the right for being too close to the EU. There is little other explanation for <a href=\"https://www.bestforbritain.org/youth_mobility_much_ado_about_bluffing\">Starmer rejecting</a> the EU\u2019s sensible and popular proposal for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/eu-pushes-keir-starmer-to-open-door-to-youth-mobility-scheme-as-pm-heads-to-brussels\">youth mobility scheme</a> with the UK, for example.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Starmer must start meaningful negotiations with the EU and an honest conversation with voters about what\u2019s required now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the Commission on UK-EU Relations argues, both the EU and the UK could benefit from closer cooperation in a range of areas, from defence, to climate, to higher education, to travel for work purposes. The UK could <a href=\"https://trade.ec.europa.eu/access-to-markets/en/content/pan-euro-mediterranean-convention-pem\">also benefit</a> from joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention, which covers EU trade with countries such as Algeria, Morocco and Lebanon, and which would <a href=\"https://citp.ac.uk/publications/should-the-uk-join-pem\">potentially increase</a> the amount of goods UK companies could export to the EU tariff-free.

      "bodyText": "Achieving the fastest sustainable growth in the G7 was the Labour party\u2019s highest-profile pledge going into the general election last July. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that boosting growth is \u201cat the heart of everything she does\u201d. But there was concerning news last week with new figures showing the economy grew by just 0.1% in the three months to the end of September, falling significantly short of expectations. Some business leaders have linked this anaemic growth to uncertainty in the run-up to last month\u2019s budget. But it will largely still be a product of factors outside the new chancellor\u2019s control, including the decisions of the last Conservative government. It is nevertheless disturbing news for Labour as well as for the country. The Resolution Foundation forecasts disposable household income per person is forecast to rise by just 0.5% a year on average over the course of this parliament. The results of the US election sound an important alarm bell about the extent to which voters are willing to punish incumbent centre-left governments for failing to deliver noticeable increases in living standards. Ministers will be hoping that the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s growth predictions \u2013 it last month revised its forecasts down for the last three years of this parliament \u2013 are too pessimistic and that the government\u2019s combination of borrowing more to invest in public infrastructure, and supply-side reform in areas like planning, will deliver a bigger hit to growth in the moderate term. But they also need to be pulling every lever available to them to drive up growth and living standards in the next few years. The lever that Starmer and Reeves have said too little about is closer alignment with the EU. For any country experiencing the sluggish productivity growth and low levels of business investment the British economy has seen in recent decades, reducing trading barriers with close and friendly neighbours would be an easy win. The UK has done precisely the opposite to this with its decision to leave not just the political institutions of the EU, but the single market and customs union. Brexit has significantly depressed British exports and GDP, a cost the UK could ill afford. Last Thursday, the governor of the Bank of England highlighted the long-term impact of Brexit and urged ministers to \u201crebuild relations\u201d with the EU. The government is quietly taking measures that could help it do just that; most notably in the product regulation and metrology bill currently making its way through parliament that will allow ministers to unilaterally align with EU product regulations relating to environmental impact. But ministers appear held back by their fear of being attacked by the right for being too close to the EU. There is little other explanation for Starmer rejecting the EU\u2019s sensible and popular proposal for a youth mobility scheme with the UK, for example. As the Commission on UK-EU Relations argues, both the EU and the UK could benefit from closer cooperation in a range of areas, from defence, to climate, to higher education, to travel for work purposes. The UK could also benefit from joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention, which covers EU trade with countries such as Algeria, Morocco and Lebanon, and which would potentially increase the amount of goods UK companies could export to the EU tariff-free. Bespoke agreements in these areas might only have a marginal impact on GDP; but they would be a helpful signal of UK-EU willingness to cooperate and in doing so could be a bridge to the UK ultimately rejoining the single market and customs union. To enable this requires a shift in approach from both the EU and the UK. On the EU side, there are welcome signs that for at least some, improving the relationship with the UK is a growing priority, but this will need to be accompanied by a more flexible approach to alignment, on the understanding the UK is committed to moving closer still over the medium term. On the UK side, ministers still scarred by Brexit\u2019s impact on Labour\u2019s dismal electoral performance in 2019 need to be braver in publicly making the case that a closer relationship with the EU could help deliver the improvement in living standards voters quite rightly want to see. There is no time to waste: achieving sufficient alignment to have a meaningful impact on GDP could take years. Starmer must start both negotiations with the EU and an honest conversation with voters about what\u2019s required now. There are far bigger political risks for Labour in the years ahead: most notably that President Donald Trump instigates a global trade war that drives higher inflation and even poorer growth prospects for the UK than predicted by the OBR last month. It would be madness for the government to bet on him offering the UK favourable trade terms given our greater volume of trade with the EU and the closer political affinity to its approach to regulation. Labour is entirely correct that the economic inheritance bequeathed to it by the last government is profoundly unenviable. And the global insecurity and economic headwinds that a Trump presidency could unleash might make things worse yet. These uncertain times only make it more important that the UK pulls closer \u2013 diplomatically and economically \u2013 to our partners and allies in the EU.",

      "body": "<p>Richard Flanagan, 63, lives in Tasmania, his birthplace. His sixth novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/22/the-narrow-road-to-the-deep-north-review-richard-flanagan\">The Narrow Road to the Deep North</a></em>, which drew on his father\u2019s experience as a Japanese prisoner of war, won the 2014 Booker prize and is about to become a TV series starring <em>Saltburn</em>\u2019s Jacob Elordi. His latest book, <em>Question 7</em>, is on the shortlist of this year\u2019s Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction (to be awarded on 19 November), having also been shortlisted for France\u2019s Prix Femina \u00c9tranger, a prize for novels. For the <em>Spectator</em>, it \u201cuses an eccentric toolkit \u2013 part memoir, part history, part fictional imagining \u2013 to produce a book quite unlike anything else\u201d; for Peter Carey, it \u201cmay just be the most significant work of Australian art in the last 100 years\u201d.<br><br><strong>How do you feel about </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/question-7-9781784745677/\">Question 7</a></strong></em><strong> being up for a fiction prize as well as a nonfiction prize?</strong><br>Delighted. Labels are for jam jars.<br><br><strong>What led you to write it?</strong><br>A mistaken diagnosis of early onset dementia in 2022. I was given at best 12 months before it would begin in earnest. In those 12 months I wrote the book. When done, I asked my editor if it showed any signs of cognitive collapse; if it did, I didn\u2019t wish to see it published. She began laughing. The neurologist subsequently confirmed her opinion.<br><br><strong>Which of the book\u2019s many threads came first?</strong><br>Once I had the idea of writing the book as a chain reaction that begins with Rebecca West kissing HG Wells and leads to 100,000 people dying in Hiroshima, my father living and me being born \u2013 once I understood that without that kiss, there would be no bomb and no me \u2013 then disparate things that had haunted me for so long fell into place. I thought much about my parents who, in a world they knew to be meaningless, nevertheless asserted an idea of love as their answer to the horrors out of which my island home is torn.<br><br><strong>Wells\u2019s novel </strong><em><strong>The War of the Worlds</strong></em><strong> is pivotal to the narrative. Do you remember the first time you read it?</strong><br>I thought I knew the story \u2013 yet when I first read it, perhaps 20 years ago, I was staggered to learn in Wells\u2019s introduction that it was inspired by the extermination of Aboriginal Tasmanians. It isn\u2019t a hokey Edwardian set piece. It\u2019s an indictment of English imperialism.<br><br><strong>Are you a restless writer? Your books are similar to </strong><strong>one another mainly in their difference \u2026</strong><br>I\u2019m easily bored. And then there\u2019s age. I seek forms that account not just for what\u2019s lost but reflect what\u2019s gained.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine Sally Rooney with a sulphur-crested cockatoo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Were you inspired this time by the discursive turn that English-language fiction has taken since</strong><strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/may/13/wg-sebald-legacy\">WG Sebald</a></strong><strong>?</strong><br>Fashions come and go. With this book, what mattered above all wasn\u2019t literature, but life. During Covid, life for us all seemed on hold. The question I was left with was: do we wish to live, or are we content just to exist? And I think that question haunted many.<br></p> <p><strong>Do you think you\u2019ll go back to writing novels of plot and character?</strong><br>I am not sure if I will write again. Whatever impelled me for so long has left, for now at least. Perhaps I\u2019m just happy to be in the company of friends and family.<br><br><strong>What\u2019s your role in the forthcoming TV adaptation of </strong><em><strong>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>Executive producer. I\u2019m not interested in a literal act of fidelity to my novel. I wanted to get a director I respected [Justin Kurzel] and let him make his own work inspired by whatever he found in mine. I saw my job as supporting Justin.<br><br><strong>The lead is </strong><strong>Jacob Elordi</strong><strong>.

I wasn\u2019t so enamoured of Oxford [where Flanagan was a Rhodes scholar in the 80s] as to be fascinated by its fictional representations.<br><br><strong>That period in your life comes up in </strong><em><strong>Question 7</strong></em><strong>, where you encounter a thinly veiled Boris Johnson \u2026</strong><br>Few things exemplify the vacuity of 1980s Oxford better.<br><br><em><strong>Question 7</strong></em><strong> also mentions that </strong><em><strong>The Wind in the Willows</strong></em><strong> was one of your favourite books as a boy. Why?</strong><br>I think because of my mother reading it to me. She loved it and I loved her. We lived in a very remote, small mining village full of postwar refugees in the middle of a great rainforest, rain and rivers everywhere. The idea of a river joining very different people, of people having homes in the wild woods\u2026 it all seemed somehow familiar. She didn\u2019t skimp the more difficult language or chapters \u2013 the mystery of it seemed the mystery of the world beyond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/27/question-7-by-richard-flanagan-review-the-booker-winners-beautiful-unclassifiable-memoir-cum-novel\">Question 7 by Richard Flanagan review \u2013 the Booker winner\u2019s beautiful, unclassifiable memoir-cum-novel</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Name the first novel that made an impact once you were reading yourself.</strong><br>Camus\u2019s <em>The Outsider</em>, at the age of 11 or 12.

      "bodyText": "Richard Flanagan, 63, lives in Tasmania, his birthplace. His sixth novel, The Narrow Road to the Deep North, which drew on his father\u2019s experience as a Japanese prisoner of war, won the 2014 Booker prize and is about to become a TV series starring Saltburn\u2019s Jacob Elordi. His latest book, Question 7, is on the shortlist of this year\u2019s Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction (to be awarded on 19 November), having also been shortlisted for France\u2019s Prix Femina \u00c9tranger, a prize for novels. For the Spectator, it \u201cuses an eccentric toolkit \u2013 part memoir, part history, part fictional imagining \u2013 to produce a book quite unlike anything else\u201d; for Peter Carey, it \u201cmay just be the most significant work of Australian art in the last 100 years\u201d. How do you feel about Question 7 being up for a fiction prize as well as a nonfiction prize? Delighted. Labels are for jam jars. What led you to write it? A mistaken diagnosis of early onset dementia in 2022. I was given at best 12 months before it would begin in earnest. In those 12 months I wrote the book. When done, I asked my editor if it showed any signs of cognitive collapse; if it did, I didn\u2019t wish to see it published. She began laughing. The neurologist subsequently confirmed her opinion. Which of the book\u2019s many threads came first? Once I had the idea of writing the book as a chain reaction that begins with Rebecca West kissing HG Wells and leads to 100,000 people dying in Hiroshima, my father living and me being born \u2013 once I understood that without that kiss, there would be no bomb and no me \u2013 then disparate things that had haunted me for so long fell into place. I thought much about my parents who, in a world they knew to be meaningless, nevertheless asserted an idea of love as their answer to the horrors out of which my island home is torn. Wells\u2019s novel The War of the Worlds is pivotal to the narrative. Do you remember the first time you read it? I thought I knew the story \u2013 yet when I first read it, perhaps 20 years ago, I was staggered to learn in Wells\u2019s introduction that it was inspired by the extermination of Aboriginal Tasmanians. It isn\u2019t a hokey Edwardian set piece. It\u2019s an indictment of English imperialism. Are you a restless writer? Your books are similar to one another mainly in their difference \u2026 I\u2019m easily bored. And then there\u2019s age. I seek forms that account not just for what\u2019s lost but reflect what\u2019s gained. Were you inspired this time by the discursive turn that English-language fiction has taken since WG Sebald? Fashions come and go. With this book, what mattered above all wasn\u2019t literature, but life. During Covid, life for us all seemed on hold. The question I was left with was: do we wish to live, or are we content just to exist? And I think that question haunted many. Do you think you\u2019ll go back to writing novels of plot and character? I am not sure if I will write again. Whatever impelled me for so long has left, for now at least. Perhaps I\u2019m just happy to be in the company of friends and family. What\u2019s your role in the forthcoming TV adaptation of The Narrow Road to the Deep North? Executive producer. I\u2019m not interested in a literal act of fidelity to my novel. I wanted to get a director I respected [Justin Kurzel] and let him make his own work inspired by whatever he found in mine. I saw my job as supporting Justin. The lead is Jacob Elordi. What did you make of Saltburn? Saltburn is the one film of Jacob\u2019s I haven\u2019t watched. I wasn\u2019t so enamoured of Oxford [where Flanagan was a Rhodes scholar in the 80s] as to be fascinated by its fictional representations. That period in your life comes up in Question 7, where you encounter a thinly veiled Boris Johnson \u2026 Few things exemplify the vacuity of 1980s Oxford better. Question 7 also mentions that The Wind in the Willows was one of your favourite books as a boy. Why? I think because of my mother reading it to me. She loved it and I loved her. We lived in a very remote, small mining village full of postwar refugees in the middle of a great rainforest, rain and rivers everywhere. The idea of a river joining very different people, of people having homes in the wild woods\u2026 it all seemed somehow familiar. She didn\u2019t skimp the more difficult language or chapters \u2013 the mystery of it seemed the mystery of the world beyond. Name the first novel that made an impact once you were reading yourself. Camus\u2019s The Outsider, at the age of 11 or 12. It was on a spinner of books at the state high school where I had just started. I picked it because it was skinny. I understood almost none of it. But the heat, the beach, the abrupt violence, a world that demanded your hypocrisy\u2026 all that, I knew with a shock of recognition, to be true. What are you reading right now? Erotic Vagrancy, Roger Lewis\u2019s addictive account of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Will we be so enchanted by Tay Tay and Kelce 60 years hence? Australia\u2019s National Portrait Gallery holds a 2018 painting of you with your parrot, Herb, who was previously seen perching at your desk in a short film that the New Yorker made about you. Is he still there? It\u2019s hard to imagine Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd with a macaw or Sally Rooney with a sulphur-crested cockatoo, but every writer needs a Herb, a marvellous companion of inestimable humour, who to get my attention once flew on to my keyboard and beating his wings deleted a chapter; who danced and strutted while screaming \u201cget fucked\u201d every time the phone rang; who shredded my books and furniture and would fly on to my chest to be hugged. Now he\u2019s gone. I still grieve. \u2022 Question 7 by Richard Flanagan is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "The editor in chief of Scientific American, the US\u2019s oldest magazine, has announced her resignation after a series of online posts in which she called some Donald Trump supporters \u201cfascists\u201d and \u201cbigoted\u201d. In a post on Bluesky on Thursday, Laura Helmuth, who was originally appointed as the magazine\u2019s editor in chief in 2020, said: \u201cI\u2019ve decided to leave Scientific American after an exciting 4.5 years as editor in chief. I\u2019m going to take some time to think about what comes next (and go birdwatching).\u201d Helmuth\u2019s resignation comes after a series of expletive-filled posts on 5 November \u2013 election night \u2013 in which she criticized those who voted for Trump. In her since-deleted posts on Bluesky, Helmuth wrote: \u201cEvery four years I remember why I left Indiana (where I grew up) and remember why I respect the people who stayed and are trying to make it less racist and sexist. The moral arc of the universe isn\u2019t going to bend itself.\u201d She went on to add: \u201cSolidarity to everybody whose meanest, dumbest, most bigoted high-school classmates are celebrating early results because fuck them to the moon and back.\u201d \u201cI apologize to younger voters that my Gen X is so full of fucking fascists,\u201d Helmuth continued. Following her posts, Helmuth issued a public apology, writing on Bluesky: \u201cI made a series of offensive and inappropriate posts on my personal Bluesky account on election night, and I am sorry. I respect and value people across the political spectrum. \u201cThese posts, which I have deleted, do not reflect my beliefs; they were a mistaken expression of shock and confusion about the election results. These posts of course do not reflect the position of Scientific American or my colleagues. I am committed to civil communication and editorial objectivity,\u201d she added. Despite her apology, Helmuth\u2019s posts gained traction among conservative voters online, with staunch Trump ally and X owner Elon Musk accusing her of being a political activist who has taken over a scientific institution. A week after her apology, Helmuth announced her resignation. In a statement to multiple outlets, Kimberly Lau, the president of the magazine, said: \u201cWe thank Laura for her four years leading Scientific American during which time the magazine won major science communications awards and saw the establishment of a reimagined digital newsroom.\u201d During Helmuth\u2019s time as editor in chief and for the first time in 175 years, Scientific American decided to endorse a presidential candidate \u2013 Joe Biden \u2013 in 2020.

His father, a modernist architect, influenced his design and architectural fidelity and, despite spending a large chunk of the 1990s on TV screens as the go-to designer in the Kiwi version of <em>Changing Rooms</em>, today Neil works with clients all over the world transforming houses and hotels.</p>    <p>For 50 years, the building was a home for men with learning difficulties before Raymond and Neil bought it. The rooms had been chopped up into dormitories, bedrooms and bathrooms, the kitchen a commercial behemoth, fire doors and alarms cluttered the woodchip and carpet-tile d\u00e9cor. The institutionalised edifice would have caused sleepless nights for the average house buyer but, for Neil, it was an exhilarating project. \u201cWe had such immense fun putting this house together,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It took them three years to transform the building, with a painter employed every day for 18 months. The entrance gives way to a wide hallway with black-painted floorboards layered with colourful Persian rugs \u2013 a feature used throughout the house \u2013 directly into a&nbsp;glamorous dining room where a grand piano awaits. The pair are ardent entertainers who regularly throw dinner parties into the small hours. Neil, an accomplished pianist, has a second grand piano in the sitting room upstairs, ensuring access to the ivories in all social situations.As the only willing and able volunteer for miles around, he is also deployed as the village organist.</p> <p>Neil\u2019s design calling card might be wallpaper. Almost every room boasts a different style, including Parrots of Brazil, a jungle print by Mind the Gap, which flourishes in the dining room. The starting point for Neil and Raymond was the grand tour, a historical rite of passage taken by Georgian aristocrats touring Europe and beyond, sending home purchases of exotic art, textiles and furniture to lavish their homes, with a particular penchant for chinoiserie. \u201cPineapples and palms were very popular,\u201d explains Neil. \u201cThey were considered extremely grand, a decorative status symbol, nobody ate them.\u201d</p>    <p>These motifs are reflected all over the house: a palm wallpaper decorates the master bedroom, while pineapples are papered in the dressing room, chinoiserie print cushions decorate armchairs and a Ming fabric from Pierre Frey is used for the kitchen blinds.</p> <p>\u201cThe references of palm trees and pineapples tie it back to the grand tour. Wallpaper is such a marvellous tool as a backdrop,\u201d says Neil. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to take centre stage, but it can highlight architectural detailing and provide a&nbsp;visual rigour that can be toyed with.\u201d</p> <p>This visual rigour is key to Neil\u2019s interior toying, despite a cacophony of textiles, papers, furniture and art, the house does not feel cluttered. Instead, it feels layered, as if Raymond and Neil have lived there for decades.The key to creating this is balance, says Neil.</p>    <p>\u201cThe house is busy, yet you feel calm walking through it. We have so much stuff, making it all hang together is a skill. You must curate, curate, curate,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Few structural changes were made, but the kitchen was a boot room and they had to fight with the planning authority to move a wall. Neil\u2019s choice of a restrained sunshine-yellow paint articulates the 19th-century architectural arches in the renovated kitchen, while a light fixture for the ceiling was built with traditional plaster moulding to display a series of glass decanters repurposed as pendants over the island. Behind, a pair of giant reclaimed corbels invite you through the new opening into the snug.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s important to have fun in life... and houses must have fun, too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Upstairs, the sitting room reveals wallpaper, a&nbsp;faux-panelling design on the ceiling rather than the walls, which are painted in Dilkusha blue, notes of russet dance in the textiles and a Hollywood, regency chandelier glitters atop. Gilded antique lamps, once owned by the Austrian royal family, guard a&nbsp;contemporary painting by Ross Lewis on the mantel. \u201cWe wanted a calm palette for this room, which feels suspended in the trees,\u201d says Neil. \u201cThe blue paint offsets the landscape and the orange adds zing and warmth. It\u2019s in the rug, the blinds and the Japanese imari plates on the wall. Even for pattern lovers there needs to be careful punctuation of calmer and often transitional areas. Wallpaper can be joyous and sophisticated, but like many things it is often best in moderation.\u201d</p> <p>Mahogany furniture and the family silver soup tureens have been on their own grand tour, having been shipped to New Zealand in 1879 by Neil\u2019s great-grandparents and almost 150 years later they have returned to the UK after Neil shipped them back. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to have fun in life and houses must have fun, too,\u201d says Neil. \u201cEvery new owner must go forwards, not backwards, we don\u2019t want to live in a&nbsp;museum. We wanted to take the old girl on a different trip.\u201d</p>",

For 50 years, the building was a home for men with learning difficulties before Raymond and Neil bought it. The rooms had been chopped up into dormitories, bedrooms and bathrooms, the kitchen a commercial behemoth, fire doors and alarms cluttered the woodchip and carpet-tile d\u00e9cor. The institutionalised edifice would have caused sleepless nights for the average house buyer but, for Neil, it was an exhilarating project. \u201cWe had such immense fun putting this house together,\u201d he says. It took them three years to transform the building, with a painter employed every day for 18 months. The entrance gives way to a wide hallway with black-painted floorboards layered with colourful Persian rugs \u2013 a feature used throughout the house \u2013 directly into a glamorous dining room where a grand piano awaits. The pair are ardent entertainers who regularly throw dinner parties into the small hours. Neil, an accomplished pianist, has a second grand piano in the sitting room upstairs, ensuring access to the ivories in all social situations.As the only willing and able volunteer for miles around, he is also deployed as the village organist. Neil\u2019s design calling card might be wallpaper. Almost every room boasts a different style, including Parrots of Brazil, a jungle print by Mind the Gap, which flourishes in the dining room. The starting point for Neil and Raymond was the grand tour, a historical rite of passage taken by Georgian aristocrats touring Europe and beyond, sending home purchases of exotic art, textiles and furniture to lavish their homes, with a particular penchant for chinoiserie. \u201cPineapples and palms were very popular,\u201d explains Neil. \u201cThey were considered extremely grand, a decorative status symbol, nobody ate them.\u201d These motifs are reflected all over the house: a palm wallpaper decorates the master bedroom, while pineapples are papered in the dressing room, chinoiserie print cushions decorate armchairs and a Ming fabric from Pierre Frey is used for the kitchen blinds. \u201cThe references of palm trees and pineapples tie it back to the grand tour. Wallpaper is such a marvellous tool as a backdrop,\u201d says Neil. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to take centre stage, but it can highlight architectural detailing and provide a visual rigour that can be toyed with.\u201d This visual rigour is key to Neil\u2019s interior toying, despite a cacophony of textiles, papers, furniture and art, the house does not feel cluttered. Instead, it feels layered, as if Raymond and Neil have lived there for decades.The key to creating this is balance, says Neil. \u201cThe house is busy, yet you feel calm walking through it. We have so much stuff, making it all hang together is a skill. You must curate, curate, curate,\u201d he says. Few structural changes were made, but the kitchen was a boot room and they had to fight with the planning authority to move a wall. Neil\u2019s choice of a restrained sunshine-yellow paint articulates the 19th-century architectural arches in the renovated kitchen, while a light fixture for the ceiling was built with traditional plaster moulding to display a series of glass decanters repurposed as pendants over the island. Behind, a pair of giant reclaimed corbels invite you through the new opening into the snug. Upstairs, the sitting room reveals wallpaper, a faux-panelling design on the ceiling rather than the walls, which are painted in Dilkusha blue, notes of russet dance in the textiles and a Hollywood, regency chandelier glitters atop. Gilded antique lamps, once owned by the Austrian royal family, guard a contemporary painting by Ross Lewis on the mantel. \u201cWe wanted a calm palette for this room, which feels suspended in the trees,\u201d says Neil. \u201cThe blue paint offsets the landscape and the orange adds zing and warmth. It\u2019s in the rug, the blinds and the Japanese imari plates on the wall. Even for pattern lovers there needs to be careful punctuation of calmer and often transitional areas. Wallpaper can be joyous and sophisticated, but like many things it is often best in moderation.\u201d Mahogany furniture and the family silver soup tureens have been on their own grand tour, having been shipped to New Zealand in 1879 by Neil\u2019s great-grandparents and almost 150 years later they have returned to the UK after Neil shipped them back. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to have fun in life and houses must have fun, too,\u201d says Neil. \u201cEvery new owner must go forwards, not backwards, we don\u2019t want to live in a museum. We wanted to take the old girl on a different trip.\u201d",

As humans converted native grasslands to farms, they also waged a highly successful campaign to shoot, poison and drive away animals like grizzlies, wolves, coyotes and mountain lions. But in the last 50 or so years, that has changed. Thanks to laws like the Endangered Species Act and a growing awareness of predators\u2019 important roles in the ecosystem, predator populations have regrown.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe really good news is that we\u2019ve done a good job of recovering some of our large carnivores,\u201d said Julie Young, a wildlife biologist at Utah State University studying how to reduce human-wildlife conflict. \u201cAt the same time, the human population increased when carnivores\u2019 were at their lowest. We didn\u2019t think about how to live with them because we didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p> \n<p>As returning predators find their former habitats occupied, conflicts are increasing. Between 2013 and 2021, cattle lost to grizzly depredation in Montana increased from roughly 20 a year to more than 140 a year, according to the most recent statistics available from MFWP. Grizzly populations are growing in Idaho, Wyoming and parts of Washington state. </p> \n<h2>Seeing what sticks</h2> \n<p>MFWP hired Sarmento in 2017 to help deal with these growing conflicts. Locals in the agricultural hub of Conrad were told to call the grizzly management specialist if a bear entered their property to scare the animal away. In his early years on the job, Sarmento focused on using his truck to scare bears off, driving toward the animals and honking his horn, as well as firing non-lethal firearms like rubber bullets, loud cracker shells and paintballs. He also persuaded the US Fish and Wildlife Service \u2013 which manages grizzly conservation, due to their endangered status \u2013 to give residents permission to use paintball guns and their own vehicles to scare bears away themselves if his team couldn\u2019t be there in time.</p> \n<p>Sarmento found that these techniques had their limits. Projectiles usually drove bears off but required getting close to the animals; rubber bullets also posed a risk of injuring, and even killing, bears if not used correctly. Cracker shells were a mixed bag; some bears seemed unfazed by them, perhaps from becoming habituated to the sound of gunshots. Vehicles were consistently effective at hazing bears but could only drive so far. Sarmento\u2019s team often received calls about bears bayed up \u2013 wildlife ranger parlance for taking shelter \u2013 in the windbreaks planted around people\u2019s houses. And even if they were able to follow a bear into a nearby field, they would need to stop if he hit a creek or a patch of trees, or the sticky morass of \u201cgumbo\u201d left in Montana\u2019s clayey soils after rainfall.</p> \n<p>In 2019, Sarmento added two new members to the bear management team: Huckleberry and Gum, a pair of redline Airedale terriers. Large and curly-haired, with scruffy steel wool-like coats, they came from a line known for chasing off wildlife, and had been trained on feral hogs. But the dogs were inconsistent at bear hazing. \u201cBasically, they just chase the first thing they see,\u201d Sarmento said. Both dogs visited the vet multiple times to remove hundreds of quills after focusing on a porcupine rather than a bear. Another time, Sarmento released the dogs on a grizzly only about 150ft (45 metres) away, and both dogs decided to chase a feral cat that was nearer.</p> \n<h2>\u2018They flee pretty quickly\u2019</h2> \n<p>The MFWP approved the purchase of a drone, Sarmento obtained his Federal Aviation Administration remote pilot certification, and he started flying out in 2021. It was a bright orange Autel EVO II, equipped with a high-definition camera and, at only 2.5lb (1.13kg), lightweight enough to fly for a full 40 minutes. Drones first rose in popularity in wildlife management for hazing birds, particularly around airports and in agricultural fields. And as decreasing prices made these aircraft more accessible \u2013 the cost of an EVO II starts at just over $2,000 \u2013 researchers like Sarmento began wondering whether they might have an effect on larger animals.</p> \n<p>\u201cImmediately, it became clear that it was the best thing,\u201d Sarmento says. He\u2019s still not sure why bears so dislike drones; he\u2019s theorized that the loud buzz of the rotors could sound like an approaching swarm of bees, or remind bears of being dive-bombed by birds when they raid nests for eggs. Conversely, it could be that bears have no experience to compare a drone to.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like, if we were to see a UFO, we would probably get pretty scared,\u201d Sarmento said. \u201cBut immediately, they get vigilant. And then as you approach the bears, they flee pretty quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>Data corroborated the responses he and his team were seeing: over the course of 163 encounters between the management team and bears \u2013 35 with the drone, 52 with a vehicle, 30 with dogs and 46 with projectiles \u2013 Sarmento\u2019s drone successfully hazed bears away from human habitations 91% of the time. Dogs succeeded only 57% of the time. (Huck and Gum had a happy ending, though. After they retired from bear-chasing, Sarmento adopted them as pets.)</p> \n<p>The drones\u2019 success rate was within the margin of error for vehicles (85%) and projectiles (74%), meaning that in a statistical sense, the quadcopters may not be significantly better at hazing bears. But in a qualitative sense, the drone was the clear winner. It allowed Sarmento to chase a bear across topographical barriers, such as roads or streams, as well as legal ones; while flying, he didn\u2019t need landowners\u2019 permission to bodily enter their property.</p> \n<p>\u201cI could precisely run a bear exactly where I wanted it to go. It\u2019s just so maneuverable,\u201d he says.</p> \n<h2>Drone deterrence with other predators</h2> \n<p>Wildlife managers are seeing a similar effect when drones are used on wolves, a major source of conflict as their populations <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10713\">recover and spread across the American west</a>. Young, the Utah State biologist, is supervising a master\u2019s student studying how drones can reduce livestock depredation by wolves in Oregon, which had promising results during its first field season this summer.</p> \n<p>Dustin Ranglack, the predator project leader and Utah field station leader for the National Wildlife Research Center, was a collaborator on a 2022 project that showed drones projecting the sounds of human voices reduced the number of cows killed by wolves in Oregon from one almost every other night to only two over 85 nights \u2013 a decrease of 95%.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really effective, but we still have a lot of questions as to how well it is going to work, what makes it effective, and how quickly will wolves habituate \u2013 because with most non-lethal tools, they do habituate,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Habituation is one of Young\u2019s concerns, too. Unlike with bears, researchers have found that wolves aren\u2019t as scared of drones on their own; some have even shown play behavior when a drone approaches. This lack of fear could mean that wolves could grow accustomed to drones more quickly. </p> \n<p>Back in Montana, Sarmento didn\u2019t see signs that grizzlies were getting used to his drone. In fact, it appeared that drones could potentially teach bears to stay away from humans long-term. Sarmento usually needed to haze the highest number of bears in the spring, soon after they woke from hibernation and sought food; typically, those calls would drop off by July as the bears turned to wild berries rather than farms. But even in drought years, with poor berry crops, Sarmento found that bears he had hazed didn\u2019t tend to return to human food sources. In September, after frost killed most berries, hazed bears likewise didn\u2019t return even while bulking up for winter hibernation. Young bears, which had not yet learned to avoid humans and their flying toys, tended to be involved in the most hazing interactions.</p> \n<p>Hazing would be less necessary, researchers say, if people utilized practices that prevent conflict like removing spilled grain and carcasses that attract predators. Even as the team in Conrad continues to use drones for hazing, the bear management team spends as much time on bear safety education, building electric fences, cleaning up bear attractants, and giving out airhorns, bear spray and bear-proof garbage cans, acknowledging that they can\u2019t be everywhere at once.</p> \n<h2>Limitations and drawbacks</h2> \n<p>The researchers emphasized that drones aren\u2019t a silver bullet. They can\u2019t fly in high winds or inclement weather, and there\u2019s currently no system available outside of the military that can automate drone flights; a trained human pilot always needs to always be on the other side of the controller, making drones a time-consuming strategy. Researchers are actively working on algorithms that can do this, including recognizing the shape of approaching predators, but these programs are still in development.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/07/scaling-up-the-app-thats-transforming-lives-in-south-african-fishing-communities\">Scaling up: the app that\u2019s transforming lives in South African fishing communities</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Additionally, because wolves and grizzlies are still on the endangered species list in most places in the US, only researchers with special permits are allowed to harass them. Locals are still asking about the technology, though; Montana recently changed its licensing system to allow ranchers to use drones to haze non-endangered species such as elk out of their fields. Drones are now part of an existing FAA license that previously covered hazing with helicopters.</p> \n<p>Researchers regard these drawbacks to drones as real but surmountable, especially as enthusiasm for the aircrafts\u2019 new uses spreads and more people try them.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems like every other week I\u2019m getting a different phone call or email from somebody who has heard what we\u2019re doing with drones,\u201d said Ranglack in Utah. He noted that even conservation groups, which often clash with federal wildlife services due to predator policies, have gotten in touch to express their support. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those unique tools that\u2019s really uniting people around this purpose, because it can be so effective.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>This story was made possible in part by a grant from the Institute for Journalism and Natural Resources.</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2024.

Young, the Utah State biologist, is supervising a master\u2019s student studying how drones can reduce livestock depredation by wolves in Oregon, which had promising results during its first field season this summer. Dustin Ranglack, the predator project leader and Utah field station leader for the National Wildlife Research Center, was a collaborator on a 2022 project that showed drones projecting the sounds of human voices reduced the number of cows killed by wolves in Oregon from one almost every other night to only two over 85 nights \u2013 a decrease of 95%. \u201cIt\u2019s really effective, but we still have a lot of questions as to how well it is going to work, what makes it effective, and how quickly will wolves habituate \u2013 because with most non-lethal tools, they do habituate,\u201d he says.

Sarmento usually needed to haze the highest number of bears in the spring, soon after they woke from hibernation and sought food; typically, those calls would drop off by July as the bears turned to wild berries rather than farms. But even in drought years, with poor berry crops, Sarmento found that bears he had hazed didn\u2019t tend to return to human food sources. In September, after frost killed most berries, hazed bears likewise didn\u2019t return even while bulking up for winter hibernation. Young bears, which had not yet learned to avoid humans and their flying toys, tended to be involved in the most hazing interactions. Hazing would be less necessary, researchers say, if people utilized practices that prevent conflict like removing spilled grain and carcasses that attract predators. Even as the team in Conrad continues to use drones for hazing, the bear management team spends as much time on bear safety education, building electric fences, cleaning up bear attractants, and giving out airhorns, bear spray and bear-proof garbage cans, acknowledging that they can\u2019t be everywhere at once. Limitations and drawbacks The researchers emphasized that drones aren\u2019t a silver bullet. They can\u2019t fly in high winds or inclement weather, and there\u2019s currently no system available outside of the military that can automate drone flights; a trained human pilot always needs to always be on the other side of the controller, making drones a time-consuming strategy. Researchers are actively working on algorithms that can do this, including recognizing the shape of approaching predators, but these programs are still in development. Additionally, because wolves and grizzlies are still on the endangered species list in most places in the US, only researchers with special permits are allowed to harass them. Locals are still asking about the technology, though; Montana recently changed its licensing system to allow ranchers to use drones to haze non-endangered species such as elk out of their fields. Drones are now part of an existing FAA license that previously covered hazing with helicopters. Researchers regard these drawbacks to drones as real but surmountable, especially as enthusiasm for the aircrafts\u2019 new uses spreads and more people try them. \u201cIt seems like every other week I\u2019m getting a different phone call or email from somebody who has heard what we\u2019re doing with drones,\u201d said Ranglack in Utah. He noted that even conservation groups, which often clash with federal wildlife services due to predator policies, have gotten in touch to express their support. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those unique tools that\u2019s really uniting people around this purpose, because it can be so effective.\u201d This story was made possible in part by a grant from the Institute for Journalism and Natural Resources. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2024. A previous version said that Wesley Sarmento was a current, not former, grizzly bear management specialist for Montana\u2019s department of fish, wildlife and parks.",

      "body": "<p>I have a vivid memory of arriving at university at the back end of the 1980s and telling someone I needed to buy a bread cake, at which point I remembered (too late!) that most people call the round baked item in question a bap or a roll. The term bread cake \u2013 no, it has nothing whatsoever to do with cake \u2013 is highly regional: a&nbsp;South Yorkshire and, at a push, East Midlands thing. If I\u2019d been wearing a&nbsp;Tracey Emin-style neon sign on my head that said, \u201cI am from elsewhere, possibly another planet\u201d, I couldn\u2019t have announced myself more clearly. Not that I was embarrassed \u2013 and in any case, old habits die hard. On Sunday mornings, when I make bacon sandwiches, the floury baps that I like to use, soft as pillows, are still bread cakes to me. They&nbsp;always will be.</p> <p>The experience I describe was, however, a long time ago and, today, as I think about making pease pudding for dinner (I\u2019m joking; of course we\u2019re having pasta), I find myself wondering about regional differences when it comes to food. Do they belong, now, to the past? Admittedly, it\u2019s still hard to lay your hands on parkin in London: Gail\u2019s Bakery looks to Europe, not Leeds, its nose in the air and a silk scarf tied firmly around its neck. But Eccles cakes and Cornish pasties are ubiquitous now, and I\u2019ve seen haslet with my own eyes at the Islington branch of Tesco (a&nbsp;herby meat loaf, haslet is very good in bread cakes, so long as they\u2019re thickly buttered). Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy, the fine cheesemonger, sells Staffordshire oatcakes. Leave the capital, meanwhile, and you will find that a sourdough-and-rocket-inflected monotony is spreading ever outwards from the M25.</p> <p>Except \u2026 uh oh. Nature does abhor a vacuum, and where once we had Dorothy Hartley\u2019s classic of 1954, <em>Food in England</em>, to guide us from county to county, now we have Deliveroo, whose latest sales data has helpfully provided an alternative and highly 21st-century map of the nation\u2019s tastes. Some of them are entirely predictable \u2013 in the north, people are more likely to order chips with curry sauce \u2013 and others are downright weird (I cannot think what kind of person panic-orders scones on such an app, but apparently they mostly live in Glasgow). Geographically speaking, York is now the capital of bubble tea, Brighton of oat milk, and Tunbridge Wells of champagne.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Eight pieces boneless from Wingstop' is up there with the worst words I\u2019ve ever heard spoken out loud</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The media swallowed Deliveroo\u2019s press release wholesale, no questions asked, and thanks to this I was able to study its findings in a newspaper for several moments while eating (I\u2019ll use an uncontroversial word) a sandwich. How bewildering, and how melancholy. While some of my neighbours adopted delivery apps with alacrity \u2013 a liveried bicycle arrives at one&nbsp;house in our street virtually every day \u2013 I\u2019ve never used Deliveroo, and don\u2019t plan on doing so any time soon.

      "bodyText": "I have a vivid memory of arriving at university at the back end of the 1980s and telling someone I needed to buy a bread cake, at which point I remembered (too late!) that most people call the round baked item in question a bap or a roll. The term bread cake \u2013 no, it has nothing whatsoever to do with cake \u2013 is highly regional: a South Yorkshire and, at a push, East Midlands thing. If I\u2019d been wearing a Tracey Emin-style neon sign on my head that said, \u201cI am from elsewhere, possibly another planet\u201d, I couldn\u2019t have announced myself more clearly. Not that I was embarrassed \u2013 and in any case, old habits die hard. On Sunday mornings, when I make bacon sandwiches, the floury baps that I like to use, soft as pillows, are still bread cakes to me. They always will be. The experience I describe was, however, a long time ago and, today, as I think about making pease pudding for dinner (I\u2019m joking; of course we\u2019re having pasta), I find myself wondering about regional differences when it comes to food. Do they belong, now, to the past? Admittedly, it\u2019s still hard to lay your hands on parkin in London: Gail\u2019s Bakery looks to Europe, not Leeds, its nose in the air and a silk scarf tied firmly around its neck. But Eccles cakes and Cornish pasties are ubiquitous now, and I\u2019ve seen haslet with my own eyes at the Islington branch of Tesco (a herby meat loaf, haslet is very good in bread cakes, so long as they\u2019re thickly buttered). Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy, the fine cheesemonger, sells Staffordshire oatcakes. Leave the capital, meanwhile, and you will find that a sourdough-and-rocket-inflected monotony is spreading ever outwards from the M25. Except \u2026 uh oh. Nature does abhor a vacuum, and where once we had Dorothy Hartley\u2019s classic of 1954, Food in England, to guide us from county to county, now we have Deliveroo, whose latest sales data has helpfully provided an alternative and highly 21st-century map of the nation\u2019s tastes. Some of them are entirely predictable \u2013 in the north, people are more likely to order chips with curry sauce \u2013 and others are downright weird (I cannot think what kind of person panic-orders scones on such an app, but apparently they mostly live in Glasgow). Geographically speaking, York is now the capital of bubble tea, Brighton of oat milk, and Tunbridge Wells of champagne. The media swallowed Deliveroo\u2019s press release wholesale, no questions asked, and thanks to this I was able to study its findings in a newspaper for several moments while eating (I\u2019ll use an uncontroversial word) a sandwich. How bewildering, and how melancholy. While some of my neighbours adopted delivery apps with alacrity \u2013 a liveried bicycle arrives at one house in our street virtually every day \u2013 I\u2019ve never used Deliveroo, and don\u2019t plan on doing so any time soon. But even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t think of ordering a latte from Costa Coffee (Blackpool), or a rice bowl from Leon (Bath). What strange cravings! These are businesses whose success, at least in part, is built on convenience: you are there, they are there, the train you plan to get boards in 10 minutes. They strike me as last resorts, not the ne plus ultra of a good night in. There are many dispiriting phrases in the English language; I have mentioned before how much I hate to hear anyone say, \u201cI\u2019m not having a starter.\u201d But \u201ceight pieces boneless from Wingstop\u201d is right up there with the worst words I\u2019ve ever heard spoken out loud (according to Deliveroo, the trending food of the past year was chicken, and this easy-to-eat octet from Wingstop, an American chain with 55 outlets in Britain, \u201ctook the top spot\u201d). Ordinary as they may sound to some ears, those words seem to me to encapsulate something: an unstoppable blandification; a refusal to recognise both the value of difference and the danger of ignoring it. Even as I cling to cheese, the one food that has improved beyond all imagining on these islands in my lifetime, I worry about what we\u2019re losing.

      "bodyText": "Fiddling while Rome burns fairly describes the antics of party leaders in the European parliament last week. The EU is under siege from present-day descendants of the Goths, Mongols and Vandals. But what were top MEPs doing? Haggling over who gets which well-padded seat in the European Commission \u2013 as if it really matters in a chaotic, predatory world where Europe is a tethered, bleating goat surrounded by wolves. Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russian horde is advancing from the north, devouring Ukrainian territory and setting the stage for more illegal annexations. To the east, Xi Jinping\u2019s China, leveraging a whopping \u20ac292bn (\u00a3244bn) annual trade surplus, is playing European divide-and-rule while running aggressive covert intelligence and hacking ops. To the west, after an electoral clean sweep, America\u2019s Vandal-in-chief is itching for a fight. Mario Draghi, former European Central Bank president, warns that the EU\u2019s \u201creason for being\u201d is threatened. Yet seemingly oblivious, the commission\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen, spent the week bartering with European People\u2019s party leader Manfred Weber and other jockeying politicians. One crucial question exercising these great minds: can Hungary\u2019s Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi be trusted with animal welfare? \u201cWe are doing politics, sometimes it take a while,\u201d Weber told Politico . An anonymous EU official was less complacent: \u201cWe need to live in the real world and get a move on. The US people have given a carte blanche to Trump as we fuck around.\u201d The parliament was elected in June. Von der Leyen was reappointed in July. But the EU\u2019s new leadership may not be \u201cat work\u201d until December or later. The Brussels bureaucracy\u2019s chronic uselessness is the least of Europe\u2019s problems. In an authoritative report in September, Draghi called for an annual \u20ac800bn investment in areas such as AI, green technology and defence, to boost flagging EU growth, competitiveness and security relative to the US and China. Like Russia, both are rapidly expanding military spending. Responding to Draghi, EU leaders issued a grand-sounding \u201ccompetitiveness declaration\u201d at their Budapest summit this month. In typical Brussels-speak, it pledged to take \u201cdecisive steps\u201d on investment, make \u201curgent progress\u201d on a capital markets union and increase defence capabilities \u201cwithout delay\u201d. Whether any of this ever materialises depends ultimately on national leaders\u2019 political will. But political will is faltering. Just as Donald Trump triumphed, Germany\u2019s government \u2013 which, along with France, is traditionally seen as a driving force within the EU \u2013 collapsed. Olaf Scholz\u2019s lacklustre chancellorship is all but over. Yet an election is not due until late February. Europe\u2019s true \u201cenemy within\u201d \u2013 far-right and far-left parties nurturing anti-democratic, Trumpist tendencies \u2013 will continue its advance in Germany as elsewhere. Whoever comes out ahead, and pollsters favour Friedrich Merz\u2019s centre-right Christian Democrats, will almost certainly be forced into another weak two- or three-party coalition, prone to the same debilitating fissures that sank Scholz.

      "bodyText": "A New Hampshire animal shelter is grappling with how to handle nearly 1,000 mice that have been turned over in recent days, many of which are pregnant. Lisa Dennison, executive director of the New Hampshire Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, called the situation \u201ccrippling\u201d and said the organization is scrambling to care for an overwhelming influx of rapidly reproducing rodents. It all started Monday when a man arrived saying he wanted to give up 150 mice. But then he clarified: 150 containers of mice, not individual critters. He had 73 mice with him that day, and by Friday morning about 450 had been transferred to the shelter. Another 500 or so were on the way. Lined up nose to tail, they\u2019d span more than a football field. There are enough to give one mouse to every member of the US Congress and the 424-member New Hampshire legislature combined. And the total is growing thanks to some basic biology. Female mice are sexually mature at roughly six weeks old, gestation lasts about 20 days, and they can mate again 24 hours later. \u201cEven in the short time that we\u2019ve had them, many of these mice have given birth,\u201d Dennison said. \u201cIt\u2019s an exponential problem that keeps growing.\u201d Part of the shelter\u2019s cat pavilion has been turned into a mouse hospital and hotel, with dozens of containers lined up on the floor, resting atop multiple tables and stacked on shelves. Just logging each mouse into the shelter\u2019s database is a chore, never mind providing food, water and bedding. It\u2019s a lot of work for a facility that at most once took in 125 animals in one day. \u201cIt does happen where you take a large number, but even when we took in 54 goats or we took in 39 cats, I mean, those are still large numbers, but much more manageable as you can imagine than hundreds and hundreds of mice,\u201d Dennison said. Other shelters have agreed to take some of the mice, and some are being sent to foster homes as the shelter seeks donations of food supplies.

      "body": "<p>In the Palm Tree pub, east London, barman Alf is taking only cash at the rattling 1960s till. The building, which is Grade II-listed, stands in the middle of Mile End Park, and Alf has worked here since 1976. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful pub,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It is also ranked fifth in <em>Time Out</em>\u2019s 50 Best Pubs in London list, published this month, and marks a clear preference that has emerged for traditional boozers.</p> <p>The majority of pubs in the top 50 are old-school, with carpets, karaoke or Irish music nights. Pickled eggs are often the extent of the culinary output. Some \u2013 whisper it \u2013 even sell pints for under a fiver.</p> <p>From the outside, the Palm Tree\u2019s windows glow a dark red. \u201cSometimes it might look closed, but always try that door. There\u2019s always a warm welcome, for everyone,\u201d says Alf. And punters agree. \u201cIt\u2019s authentic,\u201d says twentysomething Tabatha, nursing a Guinness. \u201cClassic is coming back. Traditional has become the trend.\u201d</p> <p>Across Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/23/fifty-pubs-a-month-shut-in-first-half-of-year-in-england-and-wales-figures-show\">pubs are struggling</a> with rising costs and changing drinking habits. In the first half of this year, 378 pubs closed, <a href=\"https://harpers.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/33337/More_than_one_in_ten_British_pubs_at_risk_of_closure.html#:~:text=The%20analysis%20indicates%20that%20769,of%20any%20year%20since%202013\">the highest total since 2013</a>.</p> <p>According to the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), \u201cwet-led\u201d pubs, which rely on their beverage offering and often don\u2019t have a food menu, have closed at faster rates than food-driven establishments.</p> <p>When pubs do open \u2013 especially in the capital \u2013 many pitch themselves as a gastropub: \u00a330 roasts, Aperol spritz, posh crisps and pints north of \u00a37. Among London\u2019s most successful openings since the pandemic are the Devonshire in Soho and the Plimsoll in Finsbury Park, both most celebrated for their food. However, it seems that the traditional boozer is far from serving its last pints. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re old romantics, but old-school boozers are the beating heart of this city,\u201d wrote the <em>Time Out</em> food and drink editor, Leonie Cooper, when launching the top 50.</p> <p>\u201cThe pubs on this list are heavy with the powerful whiff of history \u2013 though that just might be the sticky carpets \u2013 and throbbing with heart, soul and community charm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere will always be a desire for well-managed pubs serving amazing beer in our communities,\u201d says Ash Corbett-Collins, national chair at Camra, the campaign for real ale. All the finalists of Camra\u2019s 2024 Pub of the Year competition were \u201cfantastic examples of pubs that prioritise their well-maintained drink selection, as opposed to an extensive food menu.\u201d</p> <p>Max Halley runs three \u201cwet-led\u201d pubs in the West Country, all opened since the pandemic. \u201cIt seemed a crying shame that so many pubs felt that, if they didn\u2019t do food, they were bad business people,\u201d he says. A good traditional boozer means \u201cbeing able to go on your own and feel totally comfortable, being able to eat your own food, velvet banquettes, newspapers, and a pricing structure based on selling a lot of beer at as low a price as possible,\u201d Halley adds.</p>    <p>As for food, \u201cpickled eggs and a good selection of crisps are the only essentials\u201d. His pubs don\u2019t serve hot food: \u201cHow much more boozer can you get?\u201d</p> <p>The Kings Head on Blackstock Road rarely features on \u201cbest London pub\u201d lists. It is small, there\u2019s no kitchen and if you leave your seat you might return to find Scruffy the cat napping on it. On weekends, raucous karaoke can go into the early hours. Last week, it ranked ninth in the <em>Time Out</em> list.</p> <p>\u201cI try to keep it as cheap as I can,\u201d says Mandy Davis, who has been landlord of the Kings Head for nine years and has worked in pubs her whole life. \u201cIf someone new comes in and buys a double, they say somewhere else they\u2019d pay \u00a316, \u00a318 for that. In here, it\u2019s \u00a38.\u201d</p> <p>Davis also puts the bar\u2019s boom in popularity down to the charm of the its events, alongside her complimentary corned beef sandwiches.</p> <p>\u201cYoung people take pictures \u2013 my son dresses up as Elvis now and again and does a bit of a show,\u201d she says, sitting beneath a photo of her uncle with East End gangster Reggie Kray. \u201cEveryone\u2019s easy to get on with in here. We all know each other and we welcome new people.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny Rawe and Sean Robson were lured into the Kings Head by the sight of Scruffy sitting in the window. \u201cYou get what you see,\u201d says 35-year-old Rawe. \u201cIt\u2019s very comforting, and you don\u2019t have to pay \u00a312 for a pint.\u201d</p>    <p>Some publicans have speculated that last month\u2019s budget could cause <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypv0vlyrmo\">the price of pints to rise further</a> due to rising national insurance contributions for employers, a higher minimum wage and the end of business rates relief next year.</p> <p>Writer Jimmy McIntosh, who runs the Instagram account @londondeadpubs and contributed to <em>Time Out</em>\u2019s list, says boozers are \u201cthe quintessential English pub\u201d. He cites the interiors \u2013 \u201crich patterned carpets, plush leather banquettes, lots of deep mahogany panelling\u201d \u2013 and the ambience as key to their continued appeal. \u201cAfter a decade or so of drab millennial-core aesthetics \u2013 stripped back, strip-lit spaces that have all the warmth of a dilapidated morgue \u2013 people are coming round to a kind of cosy, maximal kitsch. They\u2019re much more fun to hang out in, and they look better too.\u201d</p> <p>They are also a vital part of communities. \u201cUsually there\u2019s a real warmth to them \u2026 they\u2019re true third spaces,\u201d says McIntosh.</p> <p>\u201cIn the best pubs, you can spend entire afternoons deep in refreshment without a care in the world.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the Palm Tree pub, east London, barman Alf is taking only cash at the rattling 1960s till. The building, which is Grade II-listed, stands in the middle of Mile End Park, and Alf has worked here since 1976. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful pub,\u201d he says. It is also ranked fifth in Time Out\u2019s 50 Best Pubs in London list, published this month, and marks a clear preference that has emerged for traditional boozers. The majority of pubs in the top 50 are old-school, with carpets, karaoke or Irish music nights. Pickled eggs are often the extent of the culinary output. Some \u2013 whisper it \u2013 even sell pints for under a fiver. From the outside, the Palm Tree\u2019s windows glow a dark red. \u201cSometimes it might look closed, but always try that door. There\u2019s always a warm welcome, for everyone,\u201d says Alf. And punters agree. \u201cIt\u2019s authentic,\u201d says twentysomething Tabatha, nursing a Guinness. \u201cClassic is coming back. Traditional has become the trend.\u201d Across Britain, pubs are struggling with rising costs and changing drinking habits. In the first half of this year, 378 pubs closed, the highest total since 2013. According to the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), \u201cwet-led\u201d pubs, which rely on their beverage offering and often don\u2019t have a food menu, have closed at faster rates than food-driven establishments. When pubs do open \u2013 especially in the capital \u2013 many pitch themselves as a gastropub: \u00a330 roasts, Aperol spritz, posh crisps and pints north of \u00a37. Among London\u2019s most successful openings since the pandemic are the Devonshire in Soho and the Plimsoll in Finsbury Park, both most celebrated for their food. However, it seems that the traditional boozer is far from serving its last pints. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re old romantics, but old-school boozers are the beating heart of this city,\u201d wrote the Time Out food and drink editor, Leonie Cooper, when launching the top 50. \u201cThe pubs on this list are heavy with the powerful whiff of history \u2013 though that just might be the sticky carpets \u2013 and throbbing with heart, soul and community charm.\u201d \u201cThere will always be a desire for well-managed pubs serving amazing beer in our communities,\u201d says Ash Corbett-Collins, national chair at Camra, the campaign for real ale. All the finalists of Camra\u2019s 2024 Pub of the Year competition were \u201cfantastic examples of pubs that prioritise their well-maintained drink selection, as opposed to an extensive food menu.\u201d Max Halley runs three \u201cwet-led\u201d pubs in the West Country, all opened since the pandemic. \u201cIt seemed a crying shame that so many pubs felt that, if they didn\u2019t do food, they were bad business people,\u201d he says. A good traditional boozer means \u201cbeing able to go on your own and feel totally comfortable, being able to eat your own food, velvet banquettes, newspapers, and a pricing structure based on selling a lot of beer at as low a price as possible,\u201d Halley adds. As for food, \u201cpickled eggs and a good selection of crisps are the only essentials\u201d. His pubs don\u2019t serve hot food: \u201cHow much more boozer can you get?\u201d The Kings Head on Blackstock Road rarely features on \u201cbest London pub\u201d lists. It is small, there\u2019s no kitchen and if you leave your seat you might return to find Scruffy the cat napping on it. On weekends, raucous karaoke can go into the early hours. Last week, it ranked ninth in the Time Out list. \u201cI try to keep it as cheap as I can,\u201d says Mandy Davis, who has been landlord of the Kings Head for nine years and has worked in pubs her whole life. \u201cIf someone new comes in and buys a double, they say somewhere else they\u2019d pay \u00a316, \u00a318 for that. In here, it\u2019s \u00a38.\u201d Davis also puts the bar\u2019s boom in popularity down to the charm of the its events, alongside her complimentary corned beef sandwiches. \u201cYoung people take pictures \u2013 my son dresses up as Elvis now and again and does a bit of a show,\u201d she says, sitting beneath a photo of her uncle with East End gangster Reggie Kray. \u201cEveryone\u2019s easy to get on with in here. We all know each other and we welcome new people.\u201d Jenny Rawe and Sean Robson were lured into the Kings Head by the sight of Scruffy sitting in the window. \u201cYou get what you see,\u201d says 35-year-old Rawe. \u201cIt\u2019s very comforting, and you don\u2019t have to pay \u00a312 for a pint.\u201d Some publicans have speculated that last month\u2019s budget could cause the price of pints to rise further due to rising national insurance contributions for employers, a higher minimum wage and the end of business rates relief next year. Writer Jimmy McIntosh, who runs the Instagram account @londondeadpubs and contributed to Time Out\u2019s list, says boozers are \u201cthe quintessential English pub\u201d. He cites the interiors \u2013 \u201crich patterned carpets, plush leather banquettes, lots of deep mahogany panelling\u201d \u2013 and the ambience as key to their continued appeal. \u201cAfter a decade or so of drab millennial-core aesthetics \u2013 stripped back, strip-lit spaces that have all the warmth of a dilapidated morgue \u2013 people are coming round to a kind of cosy, maximal kitsch. They\u2019re much more fun to hang out in, and they look better too.\u201d They are also a vital part of communities. \u201cUsually there\u2019s a real warmth to them \u2026 they\u2019re true third spaces,\u201d says McIntosh. \u201cIn the best pubs, you can spend entire afternoons deep in refreshment without a care in the world.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Righto, congrats to Taylor Fritz. He\u2019ll play the winner of Jannik Sinner and Casper Ruud in tomorrow\u2019s final and I\u2019ll be back in a few hours to bring you that second semi. Goodbye (for now). Fritz becomes the first ATP finalist from the States since 2006, I think the last American winner was Pete Sampras back in 1999. 25 years ago! Taylor Fritz speaks: It was tough in the second and third. I felt like I played a perfect set in the first. He\u2019s such a good server and I felt like in the third we both started to get onto each other\u2019s serve. I tried to be solid and give him absolutely nothing from the back\u201d I trust my game and I trust my level. I\u2019ve been putting myself in these situations at the top level against the top guys and it\u2019s paying off. I\u2019m feeling confident. Taylor Time Fritz runs round a forehand and slams it cross court to seal the win! That\u2019s his fourth victory over Zverev this year, the two men embrace at the net. \u201cGood luck in the final\u201d Zverev offers sportingly. The third set was a cagey affair with both players losing their way for periods but Fritz came through strongest at the back end to seal the tie break and take his spot in tomorrow\u2019s final. Tie Break: *Fritz 6-3 Zverev Zverev\u2019s forehand has deserted him! He shoots long to gift Taylor Fritz match point! Tie Break: *Fritz 5-3 Zverev Fritz has breathing room with a big serve that Zverev returns into the net Tie Break: *Fritz 4-3 Zverev Zverev pings a forehand down the line and it lands right on it! Huge point incoming on the Fritz serve\u2026 Tie Break: Fritz 4-2 Zverev* Zverev serve-volleys to get a point back on his serve. Tie Break: *Fritz 4-1 Zverev Zverev\u2019s forehand looks ragged, concern on his face and those in his team. Fritz looking composed. Tie Break: Fritz 2-1 Zverev* Fritz gets the early break but Zverev claws a point back with an ACE. Fritz will have first serve. Third set: Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 6-6 Zverev* Zverev has ice in his veins as he holds easily to love to take it to a tie break decider. Zverev steps up to serve to stay in the match. Can he take it to a tie break decider? Third set: *Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 6-5 Zverev The match creeps into its third hour as Zverev showcases lighting reactions to adjust to a volley off the net cord. Fritz wasn\u2019t expecting him to make it and follows up with a weak forehand. Zverev takes it to DEUCE. Pressure on Fritz here\u2026 A shanked backhand goes long from Fritz. That was very twitchy from the American. Zverev has BREAK POINT but Fritz saves it with a big serve and ensuing overhead smash. The crowd are well into this match \u2013 a loud groan as Zverev hits one long off a regulation backhand. That\u2019s better! Zverev swishes a backhand down the line to peg it back to deuce. The German is hitting the ball cleanest out of the two men at the minute. Shot! Zverev hits a winner across court from three metres behind the baseline! Fritz holds firm to save the break point. This third set has been very tense, a place in tomorrow\u2019s showcase final is at stake. FRITZ HOLDS! Third set: Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 5-5 Zverev* Zverev makes two line grazing forehands by this much to go 40-15 up. Fritz has his head in his hands. Zverev shows his core steel by holding for 5-5. Who\u2019s going to blink first in Turin? Third set: *Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 5-4 Zverev A twitchy backhand from Fritz lets Zverev back in at 30-30 but the American holds firm eventually to lump the pressure back onto his opponent. The quality has dropped off but it is entertaining tennis no less! Third set: Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 4-4 Zverev* Zverev messes up an approach and then fluffs a backhand to give Fritz a huge opportunity at 15-40! Big serve takes it to 30-40\u2026 Zverev pegs it back! Some cagey play from both men but a Zverev backhand has enough on it to force the error from his opponent. Deuce \u2013 DOUBLE FAULT! Zverev what are you up to!? The German goes for a sonic boom of a second serve and misses it by a country mile! This game is all over the shop! Zverev escapes with the game! He saves three break points and allows himself a double fist pump after a backhand pass seals the deal. Third set: *Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 4-3 Zverev Fritz races to 40-0, calling on his first serve to come to the rescue. Two more \u2018orrible forehands gift Zverev a sniff at 40-30. DEUCE! Another error from Fritz. He gesticulates to the heavens. Fritz survives the scare as Zverev misses with a backhand approach, it\u2019s all got a bit scrappy in the last few games, both men feeling the pressure. Third set: Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 3-3 Zverev* The Taylor Fritz forehand has gone AWOL as another shank gifts Zverev an easy point on his serve. And again! The next misses the baseline by a metre or more. An easy and quick game for Zverev, pressure lumped right back on Fritz. Third set: *Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 3-2 Zverev Oh my days! Taylor Fritz misses three relatively easy forehands in a row to gift Zverev THREE BREAK POINTS. An ACE claws one back for the American. Another big first serve is too hot to handle. 30-40. One more needed. Well played Fritz! He gets it back to Deuce with a bold crosscourt and a solid volley at the net. Another long rally sees Zverev dictate from the back of the court but Fritz stays with him and then forces the error through sheer force of will. Shot! The rallies are lengthening as both players dig deep, the ball pinging back and forth an inch over the net, Zverev then opens his body and whistles a backhand winner as pure as an alpine snow drift. Clean and crisp. This game is a battle. \u201cIt\u2019s a backhand clinic\u201d says Laura Robson on the commentary. Both players are slugging it out as the game ticks up past eight minutes in length. Fritz chastises himself as a ragged forehand goes long and returns him to deuce. Whoever wins this game mught well win the match. Zverev\u2019s turn to admonish himself as he wastes an opportunity on the backhand side with plenty of court to aim at. And Fritz HOLDS! That is huge for the American. He was 0-40 down and went back and forth on deuce. Could have been curtains if that one had got away, but it didn\u2019t. Third set: Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 2-2 Zverev* Speaking of epic! A 32 shot rally has the crowd on tenterhooks, neither player flinching until Fritz misses the baseline by a smidge. Easily the best exchange of the match. Zverev then bangs down a speedy ace to take the game. Phew. Third set: *Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 2-1 Zverev Fritz races to 40-0 with epic serving but then gives Zverev a sniff with a wild forehand that misses by at least a few feet. Nae bother \u2013 a sliced serve out wide hits the line and gets him the game. Fritz is serving first in this set which gives him a bit of an advantage, he can keep putting Zverev under pressure and see if he can wheedle out a break opportunity. Third set: Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 1-1 Zverev* Zverev races to 40-0 before lobbing in the first double fault of the match, a Fritz mis-hit off the frame flies high and wide to hand his opponent the game. Third set: *Fritz 6-3, 3-6, 1-0 Zverev Fritz starts the deciding set off with a comfortable hold. Tim Henman on the telly coverage reckons this is going to a tie break decider. That\u2019d be fun. Both players can still go up a notch or two at least. A huge serve down the T sets up set point for Zverev\u2026 and he takes it at the first time of asking with another torpedo serve out wide that Fritz can barely get back, an easy smash at the net to level things up. Zverev releases a guttural roar \u2013 we\u2019ll have a decider! Fritz\u2019s unforced errors went up and his winners went down in the second set. He needs to find the quality he showed in the first to push Zverev all the way. Second set: *Fritz 6-3, 3-5 Zverev Fritz makes Zverev come out to serve for it, he\u2019s still having success in the longer rallies and can pick up cheap points on serve. If we do go to a decider, and it looks like we will, the the American still has a good chance of creating an upset. Zverev has not looked as comfortable on court today after a serene week. Second set: Fritz 6-3, 2-5 Zverev* Fritz is battling, hitting the lines and covering the court like a whippet to stay in the rallies. It pays off as he carves out a BREAK POINT at 30-40 on the Zverev serve. The crowd gasp at the strokeplay on show. Zverev serves himself out of trouble to hold, surely this second set is his now? Second set: *Fritz 6-3, 2-4 Zverev Fritz shows his mettle with a strong service game. Second set: *Fritz 6-3, 1-4 Zverev* Zverev starting to dictate terms in the rallies now, he holds comfortably to go 4-1 up at the changeover. Fritz looking a tad ruffled for the first time. Second set: *Fritz 6-3, 1-3 Zverev A short backhand by Fritz is punished by Zverev to make it 0-15 but the American levels up with a deliciously placed forehand into the corner. Big miss! Fritz misses a forehand down the line, Zverev gets a sniff at 15-30\u2026 Zverev is basically up against the backboard as he sits deep and tries to stay in the rally and deal with Fritz\u2019s power. Fritz smashes an overhead to make it 30-30 but then gives up the first BREAK POINT on his own serve with a wayward backhand. ACE! Big serve in the big moment. But Zverev BREAKS! A rifled forehand at Fritz\u2019s toes sees the German take the break, he clenches his fist and lets out a big yelp. He needed that. Second set: Fritz 6-3, 1-2 Zverev* The lights in the stadium flicker as Zverev goes through his service motion. Need a new bulb back there, lads. The umpire halts play and calls for them to replay the point. Fritz is getting some joy when Zverev drops his first serve, his powerful groundstrokes are knocking the German off balance behind the baseline. Zverev serves to the Fritz forehand and sees it blitzed back at him, he\u2019s sulking after every dropped point now. Fritz is showing no emotion. He\u2019s fully focused on the task in hand. Zverev gets over the line to take the game but not without feeling some pressure. Second set: *Fritz 6-3, 1-1 Zverev A long delay accompanied by plenty of whoops and jeers as the umpire calls \u2018not up\u2019 on a Zverev backhand. It takes an age to get the side angle but the call is eventually overturned! The players replay the point, Fritz does well to shrug it off and rattle along to 40-15\u2026 and he holds as Zverev shanks into the net. Second set: Fritz 6-3, 0-1 Zverev* Zverev\u2019s body language isn\u2019t great but he starts the second set well, serving his way to a comfortable hold. What a set from Fritz! He finishes it off in style with a thunderous forehand, the stats show he\u2019s hit twelve winners and made only three unforced errors. Zverev is having a right old pop at his box, he doesn\u2019t seem to be happy with the tactics but ultimately he\u2019s the one that is out there. Fritz has played really well, pinned the German back behind the bassline and passed him when he has ventured to the net. First set: Fritz 5-3 Zverev* A hold to love from Zverev in warp speed but Fritz will now serve for the first set. First set: *Fritz 5-2 Zverev Fritz consolidates the break with an aggressive service game, he looks like he\u2019s enjoying himself out there. Zverev on the other hand is starting to sulk. Remonstrating with his box with shoulders slumped. Fritz will be loving this. The German hasn\u2019t gone full Harry Enfield\u2019s Kevin the Teenager but he\u2019s not far off with the first set slipping away quickly. First set: Fritz 4-2 Zverev* Here we go, 15-30 and some heat on the Zverev serve as he misses a couple of first serves and Fritz steps up to the seconds. Zverev misses another first serve but the second is well placed and has him able to come to the net and finish the job. 30-30. What a rally! Fritz drop shots and then follows up with a lob, Zverev juuuust reaches it with a backhand overhead but Fritz blasts the passing shot to bring up the first BREAK POINT of the match at 30-40! Zverev makes it to deuce with a fine pass of his own. The standard of tennis is extremely high. FRITZ BREAKS! For the first time in the tournament Zverev loses his serve and he looks incredibly shocked! Well played Fritz who stepped up, went for the line and grabbed the game. First set: *Fritz 3-2 Zverev Zverev and Fritz trade backhand blows from the back of the court, back and forth multiple times before Zverev puts some extra juice on a cross court and Fritz can\u2019t get it back. Three big serves put the American back in control at 40-15. A shanked forehand makes it 40-30. First bit of pressure on the Fritz serve but no drama as he takes the game with another humdingin\u2019 serve down the T. First set: Fritz 2-2 Zverev* Big serve down the T and smash to follow up from Zverev. Well placed serve out wide next up and Fritz\u2019s return finds the top of the net. A rally! Both players covering plenty of ground, Zverev tries a drop volley but Fritz gets there and makes the pass, even Zverev and his albatross wingspan can\u2019t reach it. Both players hitting plenty of first serves, not much time to draw breath, or type for that matter. First set: *Fritz 2-1 Zverev Another rapid hold on serve by Fritz as I frantically google synonyms for \u2018booming\u2019. First set: Fritz 1-1 Zverev* (*denotes server) You know the drill. Zverev has served and volleyed like a dream all week and he shows off brute power and Andrex soft hands. A comfortable hold for the German. Both men rattling through their games. First set: *Fritz 1-0 Zverev (*denotes server) Fritz sends down two booming aces and takes the first game. Zverev tried a dinky drop shot that didn\u2019t come off but did get a point with a rasping cross court backhand. Righto, first set incoming. Fritz to serve! Be still my beating heart: Both men are sporting a Roger Federer style bandana, neither has opted for Rog\u2019s cable knit cardigan though. Remember that? Peak Fed. Zverev looks steely and focused, he\u2019s in some of the best form of his career so far. Taylor Fritz wins the toss and elects to serve. Both players have absolute gun serves, we might be in for some tie breaks, I can\u2019t see too many breaks of serve in this match. Tim Henman thinks Zverev will take this one, he\u2019s almost drowned out by the stadium DJ and accompanying strobe show. Which can only mean one thing, here come the players. Home favourite and top seed Jannik Sinner will face off against Norway\u2019s Casper Ruud in the second semi final this evening and we\u2019ll be bringing you that game live too. Ambassador, liveblogger, you are spoiling us. Sinner hasn\u2019t dropped a set so far in the tournament but Zverev can best that, having not even been broken in his three matches so far. Hello and welcome to Alexander Zverev v Taylor Fritz in the ATP Finals semi-final. Zverev is on a hot streak having won his last eight matches, an impressive run of form that has seen the lissom limbed German scoop the Paris Masters and impress in Turin thus far. In a commanding performance yesterday, Zverev polished off Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (5), 6-4 and today he goes up against Taylor Fritz. Fritz is something of a boogie man for Zverev, the American having dumped him out of both this year\u2019s Wimbledon and US Open slams. Plenty to play for then, not least a coveted spot in tomorrow\u2019s grand final. \u2018Serve-off\u2019 in Italy is at 1.30 GMT, best of three sets, should be a belter. JOIN US.",

Lichtman had prophesied that Democrat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/05/harris-election-allan-lichtman\">Kamala Harris would win eight of his keys</a>, claiming the presidency, forcing him to face the harsh truth that his winning streak was over. Was it a big personal blow?</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the 77-year-old admits by phone. \u201cBut I care far less about the personal blow than I care about the blow to our democracy. Even before the election I said, \u2018Look, if I\u2019m wrong, the implications are vastly greater for our society than they are for the keys.\u2019 It\u2019s much more important to look at the broader implications.\u201d</p> <p>Lichtman, a history professor who has been teaching at American University in Washington for more than a half a century, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/26/allan-lichtman-prediction-presidential-election\">developed his keys to the White House</a> in the early 1980s.

Lichtman used the model to successfully predict Ronald Reagan\u2019s victory in 1984 and (nearly) every election that followed. After the 2016 election, he received a copy of his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/23/trump-is-headed-for-a-win-says-professor-whos-predicted-30-years-of-presidential-outcomes-correctly/\">Washington Post interview</a> with a message written in a Sharpie pen: \u201cCongrats, professor.

Oh, and the new US ambassador to Israel believes there\u2019s no such thing as the West Bank.</p> <p>Yet what they may lack in intellectual rigour, moral rectitude and empathy, they more than compensate for in fake tans, chiselled jaws and mistresses. Where once Gordon Brown worked to build a \u201cgoat\u201d (government of all talents), Trump is opting for a government of old goats. We could discuss the social, economic and cultural failings over two centuries of US history that have brought it to this place. But I\u2019ve only got 400 words, so let\u2019s talk <em>Die Hard</em> instead. (<em>Die Hard</em> <em>1</em>, <em>2</em> and <em>3</em> obviously. Everyone lost interest by the last two.)</p> <p>Anyway, Pete Hegseth, the Iraq and Afghanistan veteran who has worked as a Guant\u00e1namo Bay guard and New Year\u2019s Eve countdown host for Fox News and is poised to be defence secretary if a previous sex assault allegation doesn\u2019t scupper it, is a big <em>Die Hard</em> fan. His recent bestselling book, <em>The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free</em>, is a deeply troubling rant about elites, where he condenses the world\u2019s ills into that fateful Christmas Eve when something incredible was born. He writes: \u201cOur \u2018elites\u2019 are like the feckless drug-addled businessmen at Nakatomi Plaza, looking down on Bruce&nbsp;Willis\u2019s John McClane in&nbsp;<em>Die Hard</em>.</p> <p>\u201cBut there will come a day when they realize they need John McClane \u2013 their ability to live in peace and prosperity has always depended on guys like him being honorable, powerful and deadly.\u201d It\u2019s easy for the left to snigger at the testosterone-fuelled, gun-slinging, dick-swinging vibe of this new Trump administration. But it got more than half of the US votes. Meanwhile, <em>Die Hard</em> remains one of the most re-watched movies ever. It\u2019s time the left acknowledged the need for heroes. And time it reclaimed John McClane, the brave public servant from an immigrant family fighting the evil of global greed.

There\u2019s a vaccine sceptic in at health, a misogynist as attorney general, a possible Russia sympathiser as director of national intelligence and first choice for defence is a Fox News anchorman. Oh, and the new US ambassador to Israel believes there\u2019s no such thing as the West Bank. Yet what they may lack in intellectual rigour, moral rectitude and empathy, they more than compensate for in fake tans, chiselled jaws and mistresses. Where once Gordon Brown worked to build a \u201cgoat\u201d (government of all talents), Trump is opting for a government of old goats. We could discuss the social, economic and cultural failings over two centuries of US history that have brought it to this place. But I\u2019ve only got 400 words, so let\u2019s talk Die Hard instead. (Die Hard 1, 2 and 3 obviously. Everyone lost interest by the last two.) Anyway, Pete Hegseth, the Iraq and Afghanistan veteran who has worked as a Guant\u00e1namo Bay guard and New Year\u2019s Eve countdown host for Fox News and is poised to be defence secretary if a previous sex assault allegation doesn\u2019t scupper it, is a big Die Hard fan. His recent bestselling book, The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free, is a deeply troubling rant about elites, where he condenses the world\u2019s ills into that fateful Christmas Eve when something incredible was born. He writes: \u201cOur \u2018elites\u2019 are like the feckless drug-addled businessmen at Nakatomi Plaza, looking down on Bruce Willis\u2019s John McClane in Die Hard. \u201cBut there will come a day when they realize they need John McClane \u2013 their ability to live in peace and prosperity has always depended on guys like him being honorable, powerful and deadly.\u201d It\u2019s easy for the left to snigger at the testosterone-fuelled, gun-slinging, dick-swinging vibe of this new Trump administration. But it got more than half of the US votes. Meanwhile, Die Hard remains one of the most re-watched movies ever. It\u2019s time the left acknowledged the need for heroes. And time it reclaimed John McClane, the brave public servant from an immigrant family fighting the evil of global greed.

      "body": "<p>With age comes disease. Cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s dementia are among the commonest and most feared health conditions \u2013 particularly in countries with ageing populations such as the UK. Several decades ago, researchers at a psychiatric centre in New York <a href=\"https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1992.tb04490.x\">observed a curious relationship</a> between these two diseases. <a href=\"https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1991.tb02713.x\">At autopsy</a>, they found an inverse relation between cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p> <p>In one of the first epidemiological studies on the topic Jane Driver of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts in the US followed 1,278 participants aged 65 and older for a mean of 10 years. <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e1442\">Published in 2012</a>, the results showed that cancer survivors had a 33% decreased risk of subsequently developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease compared with people without a history of cancer.</p> <p>As intriguing as the finding was, the scientific community urged caution and pointed out potential pitfalls in dealing with age-related diseases. One of them concerned a so-called survival-bias: perhaps people with a history of cancer simply do not live long enough to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p> <p>Since then, scientists around the world have analysed the relationship between cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in more detail and built an increasingly compelling case. In the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.14283/jpad.2024.135\">largest study to date</a>, published in July this year, researchers at Imperial College London provide convincing evidence of a lower incidence of dementia following a cancer diagnosis. They looked at the NHS health data of more than three million people aged 60 and over and followed them for a mean period of 9.3 years, taking extra care to correct for potential biases. Their results show that cancer survivors have a 25% lower risk of developing age-related dementia compared with people without a history of cancer. The inverse association was observed for the most common types of cancers such as prostate, colon, lung and breast.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The results have been replicated again and again, and most experts now believe the inverse relation appears to be real</p> <footer> <cite>Elio Riboli, Imperial College London</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe relationship between cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease is very intriguing and it\u2019s persistent,\u201d says Erin Abner, a professor at the University of Kentucky. \u201cA lot of people questioned the results and tried hard to find other explanations for the inverse association, but it just keeps showing up, even after taking confounding factors into account.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, Abner published <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awac035\">clinical evidence</a> for the inverse association. Unlike previous epidemiological studies, she looked at brain autopsies of patients at the University\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center. \u201cWe found a pretty consistent association between someone having had cancer and having lower levels of amyloid pathology in their brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In her study the inverse association was seen only with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and not with dementia in general. In contrast, many of the previous epidemiological studies did not differentiate between Alzheimer\u2019s and other age-related dementias. The majority of elderly patients with dementia, however, have Alzheimer\u2019s.</p> <p>But that is not the whole story; there is another twist to the inverse relationship. Not only do those with a history of cancer have a decreased risk of dementia, but those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease are less likely to develop cancer. In her 2012 study Jane Driver reported that the inverse relation goes in both directions, a finding that was <a href=\"https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0b013e31829c5ec1\">replicated in northern Italy</a> looking at more than one million residents, and more recently in South Korea. According to <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/18/4615\">this study</a>, patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease show a 37% lower likelihood of developing overall malignancy compared to those without dementia. Again, the finding was met with scepticism. Perhaps, critics argued, people with dementia were less likely to be screened for cancer given the potentially limited benefit of therapies.</p> <p>\u201cThe results have been replicated again and again, and most experts in the field now believe the inverse relation appears to be real,\u201d says Elio Riboli who led the study at Imperial College London that also confirmed the bidirectionality. \u201cThe next step is to understand the biology behind this phenomenon.\u201d</p> <p>Some researchers have suggested that cancer treatment itself may be having an effect on dementia risk. In recent years, inflammation has emerged as a central process in the onset and progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, so it is possible that chemotherapy may be protecting neurons by suppressing inflammation.</p>    <p>But for Elio Riboli, that is not the whole story. The fact that the inverse relationship is bidirectional suggests there may be underlying biological mechanisms that influence the two groups of diseases in opposite directions. The researchers at Imperial College performed genetic analyses. \u201cLooking at hundreds of genes, we identified a genetic profile that predicts an increased risk of cancer and we found that this profile is tied to a lower risk of dementia.\u201d</p> <p>According to Riboli, the specific genetic factors may be involved in tissue regeneration. \u201cGrowth factors are a large family of molecules that regulate tissue renewal and growth. They are generally associated with better cardiovascular health,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving a genetic makeup that favours replication allows for better renewal of tissues and arteries, but may also slightly increase the risk of some cancers.\u201d</p> <p>Surprising findings can open new lines of research, says Riboli. For instance, it has long been known that people with diabetes have an increased risk of developing cancer, with <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7435261/\">one notable exception</a>: men with diabetes have a 10-20% reduced risk of developing prostate cancer. \u201cWhy does being diabetic come with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, a cancer for which we are desperately trying to understand the risk factors?\u201d asks Riboli. Similarly, research into the inverse association between cancer and dementia may shed light on new molecular pathways that contribute to, or protect people from, the development of dementia. \u201cYou open a window and suddenly you see a new horizon,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Cancer is linked to uncontrolled cell growth, whereas dementia is tied to excessive neuronal death. Mikyoung Park of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology in Seoul, South Korea, recently published a <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7326806/pdf/18_2019_Article_3428.pdf\">review</a> of molecular mechanisms that operate inversely in cancer and neurodegeneration \u2013 some leading to enhanced resistance to cell death and others to a higher risk of cell death. Dysfunctional mitochondria, the cellular power plants, might provide a crucial link between cancer and neurodegeneration, <a href=\"http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/82/20130006.full.html#ref-list-1\">a hypothesis</a> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24249045/\">put forward</a> a decade ago by Jane Driver and Lloyd Demetrius, based on mathematical arguments.</p> <p>Unravelling the inverse association between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases may ultimately help treat or prevent these common conditions. But many questions remain unanswered. \u201cBoth cancer and dementia are actually a bunch of different diseases,\u201d says Erin Abner. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the granularity of data to draw strong conclusions about any one type of disease.\u201d Additionally, there is a long latency period between the development of pathology and the start of symptoms, both in cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s, raising questions around the timing of this inverse relation.</p> <p>These enigmatic findings have no practical relevance for the time being. \u201cBut even now, it may be just a little piece of comfort for cancer survivors, that something is going to be a bit easier for them down the road,\u201d says Abner.</p>",

At autopsy, they found an inverse relation between cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In one of the first epidemiological studies on the topic Jane Driver of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts in the US followed 1,278 participants aged 65 and older for a mean of 10 years. Published in 2012, the results showed that cancer survivors had a 33% decreased risk of subsequently developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease compared with people without a history of cancer. As intriguing as the finding was, the scientific community urged caution and pointed out potential pitfalls in dealing with age-related diseases. One of them concerned a so-called survival-bias: perhaps people with a history of cancer simply do not live long enough to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Since then, scientists around the world have analysed the relationship between cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in more detail and built an increasingly compelling case. In the largest study to date, published in July this year, researchers at Imperial College London provide convincing evidence of a lower incidence of dementia following a cancer diagnosis. They looked at the NHS health data of more than three million people aged 60 and over and followed them for a mean period of 9.3 years, taking extra care to correct for potential biases. Their results show that cancer survivors have a 25% lower risk of developing age-related dementia compared with people without a history of cancer. The inverse association was observed for the most common types of cancers such as prostate, colon, lung and breast. \u201cThe relationship between cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease is very intriguing and it\u2019s persistent,\u201d says Erin Abner, a professor at the University of Kentucky. \u201cA lot of people questioned the results and tried hard to find other explanations for the inverse association, but it just keeps showing up, even after taking confounding factors into account.\u201d Two years ago, Abner published clinical evidence for the inverse association. Unlike previous epidemiological studies, she looked at brain autopsies of patients at the University\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center. \u201cWe found a pretty consistent association between someone having had cancer and having lower levels of amyloid pathology in their brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she says. In her study the inverse association was seen only with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and not with dementia in general. In contrast, many of the previous epidemiological studies did not differentiate between Alzheimer\u2019s and other age-related dementias. The majority of elderly patients with dementia, however, have Alzheimer\u2019s. But that is not the whole story; there is another twist to the inverse relationship. Not only do those with a history of cancer have a decreased risk of dementia, but those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease are less likely to develop cancer. In her 2012 study Jane Driver reported that the inverse relation goes in both directions, a finding that was replicated in northern Italy looking at more than one million residents, and more recently in South Korea. According to this study, patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease show a 37% lower likelihood of developing overall malignancy compared to those without dementia. Again, the finding was met with scepticism. Perhaps, critics argued, people with dementia were less likely to be screened for cancer given the potentially limited benefit of therapies. \u201cThe results have been replicated again and again, and most experts in the field now believe the inverse relation appears to be real,\u201d says Elio Riboli who led the study at Imperial College London that also confirmed the bidirectionality. \u201cThe next step is to understand the biology behind this phenomenon.\u201d Some researchers have suggested that cancer treatment itself may be having an effect on dementia risk. In recent years, inflammation has emerged as a central process in the onset and progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, so it is possible that chemotherapy may be protecting neurons by suppressing inflammation. But for Elio Riboli, that is not the whole story. The fact that the inverse relationship is bidirectional suggests there may be underlying biological mechanisms that influence the two groups of diseases in opposite directions. The researchers at Imperial College performed genetic analyses. \u201cLooking at hundreds of genes, we identified a genetic profile that predicts an increased risk of cancer and we found that this profile is tied to a lower risk of dementia.\u201d According to Riboli, the specific genetic factors may be involved in tissue regeneration. \u201cGrowth factors are a large family of molecules that regulate tissue renewal and growth. They are generally associated with better cardiovascular health,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving a genetic makeup that favours replication allows for better renewal of tissues and arteries, but may also slightly increase the risk of some cancers.\u201d Surprising findings can open new lines of research, says Riboli. For instance, it has long been known that people with diabetes have an increased risk of developing cancer, with one notable exception: men with diabetes have a 10-20% reduced risk of developing prostate cancer. \u201cWhy does being diabetic come with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, a cancer for which we are desperately trying to understand the risk factors?\u201d asks Riboli. Similarly, research into the inverse association between cancer and dementia may shed light on new molecular pathways that contribute to, or protect people from, the development of dementia. \u201cYou open a window and suddenly you see a new horizon,\u201d he says. Cancer is linked to uncontrolled cell growth, whereas dementia is tied to excessive neuronal death. Mikyoung Park of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology in Seoul, South Korea, recently published a review of molecular mechanisms that operate inversely in cancer and neurodegeneration \u2013 some leading to enhanced resistance to cell death and others to a higher risk of cell death. Dysfunctional mitochondria, the cellular power plants, might provide a crucial link between cancer and neurodegeneration, a hypothesis put forward a decade ago by Jane Driver and Lloyd Demetrius, based on mathematical arguments. Unravelling the inverse association between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases may ultimately help treat or prevent these common conditions. But many questions remain unanswered. \u201cBoth cancer and dementia are actually a bunch of different diseases,\u201d says Erin Abner. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the granularity of data to draw strong conclusions about any one type of disease.\u201d Additionally, there is a long latency period between the development of pathology and the start of symptoms, both in cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s, raising questions around the timing of this inverse relation. These enigmatic findings have no practical relevance for the time being. \u201cBut even now, it may be just a little piece of comfort for cancer survivors, that something is going to be a bit easier for them down the road,\u201d says Abner.",

The atmosphere is hysterical. Trump is in expansive form. He stands surrounded by his ghastly tribe of dependants, plus AN Other. In his victory speech, the president-elect praises his campaign staff, his prospective vice-president, and his family. Each gets a few seconds of adulation.</p> <p>But AN Other gets a whole four minutes. He is Elon Musk, the richest manchild in history. Trump calls him a \u201csuper genius\u201d, a \u201cspecial guy\u201d and a \u201cstar\u201d. He has flown straight from Texas in his Gulfstream to bask in the adulation of his new lord and master. He has also paid several hundred million dollars, plus a month of his time, to be here. But now his time has come.</p> <p>Hold that thought. We will return to it later.</p> <p>Now imagine what Musk\u2019s peers in Silicon Valley were thinking, as they sat chewing their pencils composing slavish messages of congratulation to The Donald. And believe me, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289649/big-tech-leaders-donald-trump-presidential-election\">they were toe-curlingly obsequious</a>. All around the valley, though, the prevailing sound was of teeth being gnashed. After all, most of these tech titans had spent months wondering how to curry favour with Trump in case he actually won. And there was Musk, who had done an end-run around them and inserted himself into the heart of the new administration. It must have been maddening.</p> <p>Spool forward a few days and we find that it gets worse: Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-appoints-elon-musk-government-efficiency-department\">has chosen Musk</a> and a wannabe titan, Vivek Ramaswamy, to lead a \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (or \u201cDoge\u201d, after Musk\u2019s favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin), thereby putting the two dudes in charge of a concerted effort to slash rules, bureaucracy and spending throughout the federal government. \u201cTogether, these two wonderful Americans,\u201d declared their new boss, \u201cwill pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies.\u201d</p> <p>Presumably he was impressed by Musk\u2019s claim that he could cut at least $2 trillion from the government\u2019s $6.8tn budget, and by Ramaswamy\u2019s promise, made during his failed campaign for the Republican nomination, to eliminate the FBI, the Department of Education and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p> <p>Although this new outfit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-appoints-elon-musk-government-efficiency-department\">is called a \u201cdepartment</a>\u201d, it won\u2019t actually be a government agency. If it were, Musk would have innumerable conflicts of interest that would cause legal difficulties if he started slashing the regulators with which he is currently in conflict. These include the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Also, last year his various companies had $3bn worth of government contracts from 17 federal agencies. But if he\u2019s \u201coutside\u201d the system, he\u2019ll be freer to slash and burn as he likes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Musk\u2019s past behaviour is anything to go by, concern with safety will cut little ice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2018, the writer Michael Lewis published <em>The Fifth Risk,</em> a remarkable book examining the implications of Trump\u2019s political appointments in his first term, especially with respect to three government agencies: the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce. The book, Lewis explained, was a product of his own desire to find out what branches of the government that never make the headlines actually<em> do</em>. And he found that what they do largely involves keeping people and society <em>safe</em>.</p> <p>If Musk\u2019s past behaviour is anything to go by, such concern with safety will cut little ice. After he had been forced by a Delaware court to proceed with his purchase of Twitter, the first thing he did was to fire 6,500 people \u2013 about 80% of the staff, by his own reckoning. And those dismissed included people whose job was to moderate content on the platform and keep it relatively \u201csafe\u201d. After they\u2019d gone, the platform was opened to all-comers, which is why it has degenerated into a toxic sewer of anti-woke fanatics, white supremacists, misogynists, conspiracy theorists and other inhabitants of alternative universes.

      "bodyText": "Picture, if you will, the scene in Mar-a-Lago on election night at the moment when it\u2019s become clear that Trump has won. The atmosphere is hysterical. Trump is in expansive form. He stands surrounded by his ghastly tribe of dependants, plus AN Other. In his victory speech, the president-elect praises his campaign staff, his prospective vice-president, and his family. Each gets a few seconds of adulation. But AN Other gets a whole four minutes. He is Elon Musk, the richest manchild in history. Trump calls him a \u201csuper genius\u201d, a \u201cspecial guy\u201d and a \u201cstar\u201d. He has flown straight from Texas in his Gulfstream to bask in the adulation of his new lord and master. He has also paid several hundred million dollars, plus a month of his time, to be here. But now his time has come. Hold that thought. We will return to it later. Now imagine what Musk\u2019s peers in Silicon Valley were thinking, as they sat chewing their pencils composing slavish messages of congratulation to The Donald. And believe me, they were toe-curlingly obsequious. All around the valley, though, the prevailing sound was of teeth being gnashed. After all, most of these tech titans had spent months wondering how to curry favour with Trump in case he actually won. And there was Musk, who had done an end-run around them and inserted himself into the heart of the new administration. It must have been maddening. Spool forward a few days and we find that it gets worse: Trump has chosen Musk and a wannabe titan, Vivek Ramaswamy, to lead a \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (or \u201cDoge\u201d, after Musk\u2019s favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin), thereby putting the two dudes in charge of a concerted effort to slash rules, bureaucracy and spending throughout the federal government. \u201cTogether, these two wonderful Americans,\u201d declared their new boss, \u201cwill pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies.\u201d Presumably he was impressed by Musk\u2019s claim that he could cut at least $2 trillion from the government\u2019s $6.8tn budget, and by Ramaswamy\u2019s promise, made during his failed campaign for the Republican nomination, to eliminate the FBI, the Department of Education and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Although this new outfit is called a \u201cdepartment\u201d, it won\u2019t actually be a government agency. If it were, Musk would have innumerable conflicts of interest that would cause legal difficulties if he started slashing the regulators with which he is currently in conflict. These include the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Also, last year his various companies had $3bn worth of government contracts from 17 federal agencies. But if he\u2019s \u201coutside\u201d the system, he\u2019ll be freer to slash and burn as he likes. In 2018, the writer Michael Lewis published The Fifth Risk, a remarkable book examining the implications of Trump\u2019s political appointments in his first term, especially with respect to three government agencies: the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce. The book, Lewis explained, was a product of his own desire to find out what branches of the government that never make the headlines actually do. And he found that what they do largely involves keeping people and society safe. If Musk\u2019s past behaviour is anything to go by, such concern with safety will cut little ice. After he had been forced by a Delaware court to proceed with his purchase of Twitter, the first thing he did was to fire 6,500 people \u2013 about 80% of the staff, by his own reckoning. And those dismissed included people whose job was to moderate content on the platform and keep it relatively \u201csafe\u201d. After they\u2019d gone, the platform was opened to all-comers, which is why it has degenerated into a toxic sewer of anti-woke fanatics, white supremacists, misogynists, conspiracy theorists and other inhabitants of alternative universes. He also tweaked the platform\u2019s algorithms to prioritise his own posts to its 200 million users, thus in effect giving him a broadcast medium for his political views and preferences. Musk\u2019s strategy, once he decided to back Trump, was to go all-in, much as he did years ago when the production of the Tesla Model 3 was running into trouble and he claimed to have slept in the factory for weeks. He moved to Pennsylvania for the last month of the campaign and was active on the ground every day, energising campaigners and generally raising the campaign\u2019s profile, especially in rural areas. In other words, he made himself indispensable to Trump, and therein lies what may come to be his problem. Narcissists do not like to be under an obligation to anyone, no matter how useful they have been. Thomas Cromwell made himself indispensable to Henry VIII in the 1530s and \u2013 as viewers of Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light are soon to discover \u2013 ultimately that was not a great career move. History may not repeat itself, but this time, as Mark Twain is supposed to have said, it might just rhyme. What I\u2019ve been reading The narrow path from despair Diane Coyle\u2019s beautifully succinct review on Enlightenment Economics of Sam Freedman\u2019s book Failed State: Why Nothing Works and How We Fix It. Congratulations, boss The Verge\u2019s compilation of all the nauseatingly obsequious messages sent by tech titans to the president-elect.

      "bodyText": "Thank you for joining me for this North London derby. Arsenal walk away with the bragging rights after a clinical performance which saw them blow Spurs away 3-0. To recap all of the action have a read of the report below. That isn\u2019t the end of the football action today as Chelsea host Manchester City at Stamford Bridge at 5.30 GMT. Our coverage for that game starts in just over half an hour, see you there. Player of the match Frida Maanum told the BBC: \u201cThis game means a lot for us, Arsenal and the fans. To paint London red is really nice. \u201cThey made a huge impact today, you can see that in all the games this season subs always make an impact. \u201cWe are just focusing on each game now, we are enjoying our time under Renee and we will see what happens.\u201d Alessia Russo told the BBC: \u201cToday was massive, not only is it a step in the league but it is the North London derby. I am feeling really good, I\u2019m enjoying myself. \u201cI think we are a little bit more comfortable. She [Renee Slegers] has allowed us a bit more freedom. The Arsenal players hold hands as a squad and run towards the thousands of away fans in the stadium. Huge support for the Gunners. Tottenham remain seventh after that loss. They are four points outside of the relegation spot. Arsenal were dominant in the first half with good goals from Russo and Maanum. Spurs started the second 45 well but they just couldn\u2019t puncture Arsenal\u2019s defence when they had the momentum and their bubble burst when Blackstenius scored. The Gunners remain in fourth but they are still unbeaten under interim boss Slegers. 90 + 3 min: Arsenal came close there with a lovely ball into the area but Spurs marked their opposite players well to not allow them enough space to take a shot. 90 + 1 min: There will be four minutes added. Catley gets a yellow card for time wasting. 90 min: Spurs just look like they want this game to be over, they are putting together some passes but Arsenal win it back after two or three. In all honesty they look exhausted. The BBC have named Maanum as player of the match. 88 min: Buhler is hobbling and clasping her ankle after a tackle, she looks as though she is trying to walk it off so she is staying on the pitch. 86 min: Another yellow card, this time for Summanen for a foul on Cooney-Cross. The last 10 minutes of this one is getting fiery. Arsenal are making another change with Wubben-Moy on for McCabe. Spurs make a double change with Vinberg and Gunning-Williams coming on for Naz and Raso. 84 min: Williamson has stayed down after putting in a tackle but she is okay to continue. 82 min: Cooney-Cross has put in a huge tackle on Nilden but the referee isn\u2019t dipping into her pocket for a card and on the replay it is the right decision 80 min: Cooney-Cross gets a yellow card for a foul on Spence. The hosts have a free kick but its in their own half and so they will have to build from deep. Arsenal make another change with Caldentey off for Kafaji and Spurs make a change with Spence off for Thomas. 78 min: Cooney-Cross rifles off a shot from inside her own half as she spots Spencer off of her line but it doesn\u2019t trouble the keeper. 76 min: Summanen plays it short to Spence who takes a shot but Van Domselaar reads it well to save. 74 min: Spurs fans must be so frustrated watching this. Tottenham weren\u2019t good in the first half but they looked bright in the second but they have still conceded. They have a chance now as McCabe gives away a free kick. 72 min: Poor play from Spurs sees Blackstenius pick up a loose ball but she goes for the wrong option and so the chance comes to nothing. Mead will be fuming as she had acres of space. 71 min: The stadium comes alive as Naz gets in the area but her cross is cleared and Arsenal counter. It comes to Blackstenius but she is muscled off of the ball. End-to-end action. 69 min: Some Spurs fans are leaving the game after that third goal, the camera then pans to Arsenal fans who are spinning scarfs around in celebration. Spurs make a change with Hunt off for Ahtinen. I think it was her third touch that goal and her second was a shot over the bar. Blackstenius was fed the ball and it ends up being a one-on-one with Spencer and she pops the ball in the bottom right corner. That\u2019s the game now surely. Immediate impact. 65 min: Arsenal make a double change with Mead and Blackstenius on for Russo and Foord. 63 min: Russo tries to lay the ball off to McCabe but she doesn\u2019t interact with it as she knows she is offside, if that run was better timed that could have been goal number three. 61 min: The crowd sound like they are getting restless with Arsenal playing a lot of their football in the midfield, where they aren\u2019t being challenged by Spurs at all. They eventually get into the box with Russo crossing to Foord who can\u2019t turn it in from a tight angle. 59 min: Arsenal put together some slick attack with one-two passes. However, Raso does well to initially repel the chance but Arsenal just keep coming. 57 min: Spurs win it back, they have every part of their game firing at the moment bar the final shot. This time they find Naz but she is then ruled offside. 56 min: Foord barges into Neville, her Spurs teammates check if she is okay and she doesn\u2019t need treatment. Spurs have a free kick from the foul, the delivery is good and Walti sees it out for a corner. England is over the corner ball but the delivery isn\u2019t good. 54 min: Hunt is shown a yellow card for a shirt pull and Arsenal have a free kick in a good position. McCabe takes the set piece again and it\u2019s very similar to the ones she has taken all game, straight at Spencer who collects. 52 min: Spurs put a beautiful move together but Nilden\u2019s pass back inside is mopped up by Cooney-Cross. They are knocking on the door and they look the more likely to score. If they are the next to hit the back of the net this derby will get tasty. 50 min: Naz escapes up the right and boos rain down as Catley hits the deck and a free kick allows Arsenal to clear. The hosts quickly win it back, this has been a bright start to the second half for Spurs but they need to capitalise on their momentum. 49 min: Foord has a good run but Hunt marks her well to see the resulting pass reach the feet of a Spurs player. 47 min: Tottenham have all of the early second half ball but they haven\u2019t managed to do anything meaningful with it. Can Spurs fight back? Or will Arsenal seal bragging rights? All to come. Cooney-Cross is coming on for Arsenal, replacing Little. Here\u2019s news from elsewhere in the sport: Elsewhere in the league, Brighton have beaten West Ham 3-2 with Fran Kirby scoring a late winner. Katrina Gorry had scored two goals in five minutes to equalise for the Hammers but Kirby was the Seagulls hero. It was a shocking start from Spurs who conceded in the first two minutes through Russo and Maanum doubled their lead. Tottenham have grown into the game with a great chance by England forcing a brilliant save from Van Domselaar. It\u2019s all to play for. 45 + 3 min: McCabe gives away a free kick and the resulting delivery wins Spurs a corner. Summanen delivers the corner but it\u2019s skied over the bar. 45 + 2 min: McCabe takes a free kick but it\u2019s a weak shot which Spencer mops up. 45 + 1 min: Bartrip\u2019s clearance sees another Arsenal corner, the camera angle made it look like that was going in her own goal but it\u2019s wide. The corner is played short, McCabe crosses it in but Nilden sees it out for a throw in. Fox is then tripped by Raso who gives away a free kick. There will be two minutes added. 44 min: A lull in the game at the moment, end-to-end football but no clear shot from either side. 42 min: Caldentey takes the free kick but it is directly at Spencer who was able to save easily. 40 min: Spence blocks a cross with handball and she gives away a free kick. She is also a bit lucky as she is already on a yellow card but the referee doesn\u2019t show her a second one. 39 min: Tottenham had a really positive spell there for a minute or two but they\u2019ve backed off a bit now with Arsenal pulling all of the strings. 37 min: England takes it, the delivery is good but it\u2019s punched away by the keeper. England sends it in again but Fox sees it out for another corner. Spurs wanted a penalty in amongst that with a foul in the box but it isn\u2019t given. The corner is taken and Naz has a shot but Van Domselaar easily saves. 36 min: What a save from Van Domselaar, that was huge. Spence intercepts a ball and she passes to England who rockets a shot at goal but the keeper sends it over the bar. A corner to come. 35 min: Raso puts on heaps of pressure on Van Domselaar and the keeper only just manages to get it away. Some pressure ensues from Spurs but Arsenal clear their lines. Possession exchanges hands and then Spurs win a free kick where they can relieve some pressure. 33 min: Maanum sends it in again but Spencer reads it well to collect. 31 min: I thought the loose play out the back would eventually see them concede, this time Walti pounces and wins a corner. Maanum is over this one, it\u2019s a great delivery but no one can turn it in. Foord gets contact but her shot is out for another corner. 29 min: England is back to her feet and I think she is okay to continue but when she reaches the sidelines, as she received treatment, she leans over on her knees and grimaces. She does re-enter the game. 28 min: Spurs wanted a free kick there for a challenge on England, she stays down as it looks like she has been hit in the face. The referee eventually blows but the Spurs captain has not moved yet. Hopefully she is okay. 26 min: Spence goes into the book for a foul on Foord. The challenge has given Arsenal a free kick with Maanum and McCabe standing over it, it is the Norway international who takes it but it is a poor delivery and it goes straight out. 24 min: Spencer looks so frustrated in goal, she has just signed a new deal with the club as she has documented her skills in goal but her form has slipped of late. The defence again shaky for Spurs and Spencer has a poor attempted save too. The amount of space Arsenal players have is crazy. It was coming. 21 min: Foord comes close again. She is desperate for a goal today. She has scored seven goals against Tottenham and she wants to add to her tally. Tottenham break forward through England and Naz but the resulting cross results in a Arsenal free kick with Spence fouling Russo, the chance is gone. 19 min: Spurs have had some possession but they do not look like a threat at all when they try and create an attack. That is in part to Arsenal\u2019s pace, they are absolutely everywhere at the moment. 17 min: Nilden blocks a shot from Foord, a really good tackle again from the defender. It doesn\u2019t take long for Arsenal to get back into the box with a McCabe cross but it is headed away. It feels like a matter of time before the visitors double their lead. 15 min: Arsenal rapidly get the ball through the team to carve Spurs open, the hosts\u2019 defence has been better but they still aren\u2019t up to the mark. 13 min: Spurs are continually playing out of the back despite the fact they don\u2019t seem completely comfortable with it. They need to be more confident with their passes in that area because Arsenal are pressing and they could pounce on a loose ball. 11 min: Arsenal get in the box once again and it falls to Fox but her shot is blocked. The Gunners keep pressing but they can\u2019t find a way through this time. 9 min: Raso has a good run and tries to pick out England but it has too much on it so Van Domselaar has time to rid the danger. 7 min: Nilden does really well to time her tackle on Foord in the box, some slick Arsenal passing meant she needed to dispossess her there as Caldentey was lurking. The tackle does concede a corner with McCabe sending it in. It\u2019s not clean in the box but eventually Spencer collects. 6 min: There is no high press from Spurs, Arsenal\u2019s backline have been able to pass between themselves for some time before they decide to move up the pitch. The attack ends in a goal kick but it has been all Arsenal so far. 4 min: Spurs also conceded after 20 seconds against Manchester City last weekend and it is the same old story. They now need to have a flawless game to get back into this. A horror start from Tottenham, Arsenal completely dominant and Spurs\u2019 defence is so weak. No one tracks Russo who strikes cleanly. Wow. Oh my word. Here we go. Is there a bigger game in club football? It is most definitely up there. The rivalry is re-ignited, Kim Little and Beth England are leading their sides out and so let\u2019s get down to business. The players will be out on the pitch soon with a good crowd at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for this one. Can Spurs cause an upset? Or will Arsenal come out on top? All to come. Leah Williamson and Kim Little reach their 150th WSL appearances today and they have joined a select group. They join Jordan Nobbs and Millie Bright for wracking up 150 games at one club. Are you at a game today? If you are get in touch and let me know what the stadium food is like. One of my favourite social media accounts is football scran, which details what clubs have available. I must confess I have treated myself to a takeaway to get prepped for this mega day of football. The North London derby is not the only rivalry re-igniting this weekend with the Merseyside derby taking place tomorrow. Tom Garry spoke to Everton manager Brian S\u00f8rensen about the match: Spurs boss Robert Vilahamn has labelled Arsenal favourites this weekend, saying: \u201cArsenal have been in the game longer than us and won a lot. We are the underdogs, can accept that now, but in the long run in this derby, we want to be expected to win home games.\u201d Arsenal\u2019s interim boss, who is making a claim for the permanent role, Ren\u00e9e Slegers said of Tottenham: \u201cI think Tottenham are a strong team.

But again, I think if we keep on bringing what we\u2019re bringing, I think we\u2019re a top team.\u201d The team news is in. Tottenham make two changes from their defeat to Manchester City last time out. Ella Morris and Matilda Vinberg drop out for Hayley Raso and Amanda Nilden. Tottenham: Spencer, Neville, Buhler, Hunt, Nilden, Bartrip, Summanen, Spence, Raso, Naz England.. Arsenal, meanwhile, make one change with Beth Mead benched in favour of Mariona Caldentey. Leah Williamson and Kim Little make their 150th WSL appearances. Arsenal: Van Domselaar, Fox, Williamson, Catley, Mariona, Little (C), McCabe, Maanum, Walti, Foord, Russo Hello and welcome to the North London derby in the Women\u2019s Super League. This fixture last season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium created history as Spurs beat Arsenal for the first time in the league, the home crowd will be hoping for a similar result this afternoon. However, that will prove tricky as Arsenal have hit some good form over the past few weeks. Last weekend they defeated Brighton, who are having a good season themselves, 5-0. The Gunners then followed that up with a thumping 4-0 win over Juventus in the Women\u2019s Champions League. So Spurs do have their work cut out for them. Tottenham have had a bumpy start to the season and are seventh after only two wins this campaign. But a victory at home in front of a bumper crowd could jumpstart some consistency to their season. We will take a look at what has been said in the build-up shortly but first let\u2019s take a look at the team news before kick-off at 1.45pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "Many owners spend a lifetime in racing without experiencing even a fraction of the success that Sir Alex Ferguson has enjoyed over the last 48 hours, and the former Manchester United manager\u2019s second big-race double in as many days here on Saturday came with the promise of better yet to come. Il Ridoto, from the Paul Nicholls stable, was his biggest winner on the afternoon, taking the Paddy Power Gold Cup, the feature event of Cheltenham\u2019s November meeting, by four and a half lengths, but it was the emphatic success of L\u2019Eau du Sud in the card\u2019s two-mile novice chase that will have Ferguson dreaming of a winner at the Festival meeting here in March. Ferguson, who now co-owns horses with his long-time friend Ged Mason, has previously had shares in a Classic winner on the Flat as well as a Grade One treble at Aintree three years ago, but even by those high standards, his current, seemingly infallible run of form is remarkable, after enjoying a lucrative Friday in Bahrain thanks to Spirit Dancer\u2019s victory there. Il Ridoto set off at 10-1, the apparent second-string in Nicholls\u2019s team behind the 3-1 favourite, Ginny\u2019s Destiny, but Freddie Gingell, his 18-year-old jockey, sent the seven-year-old to the front around the home turn as Ginny\u2019s Destiny started to drop back through the field, and then carved out a decisive lead with fine jumps over the final two fences. \u201cI texted Ged before the race and said it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever seen him look, and if he runs like he looks, he\u2019ll go close,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cHe\u2019s run in these races every year and he deserves to win one. They\u2019re a great bunch of lads [that own Il Ridoto], they\u2019ve got some great horses with Dan [Skelton], with me and with Willie [Mullins]. It must be one of the best squads that Fergie\u2019s had for a long time.\u201d Il Ridoto has been a highly competitive handicapper over both the Old and New Courses here for three seasons now, earning nearly \u00a3300,000 for his owners in the process, but is unlikely to move any further up the ladder. L\u2019Eau du Sud, though, looks like a Grade One winner in waiting, and will step up to the highest level for his next start in the Henry VIII Novice Chase at Sandown in early December. L\u2019Eau du Sud was a high-class handicapper over hurdles last season, finishing second in both the Betfair Hurdle at Newbury and the County Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham\u2019s Festival meeting. He already looks even better over fences, however, and is priced up at about 10-1 for the Arkle Trophy Novice Chase on the opening day of this year\u2019s festival on 11 March. \u201cWith a horse like him you are entitled to get excited,\u201d Skelton, L\u2019Eau du Sud\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cHe has done it around the track and has got the form in the book. Yes, there will be shorter-priced horses [for the Arkle] who achieved more over hurdles, but they have yet to prove their suitability. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one tick in the box now and he\u2019ll go to Sandown and hopefully cement his place as the best two-mile novice in Britain, although I know Nicky [Henderson] and Paul [Nicholls] might have something to say about that.\u201d James Owen, who is fresh from an outstanding debut season on the Flat, took the opening juvenile hurdle for the second year running with a highly rated recruit from there and is now likely to give East India Dock just one more run before the Triumph Hurdle on Gold Cup day in March. East India Dock was even more impressive than Burdett Road, last year\u2019s winner of the same race, and is priced up at about 10-1 for the Triumph. \u201cHe relaxes more than Burdett Road and I think the New Course will suit him better,\u201d Owen said. \u201cHe has run twice over hurdles now and hasn\u2019t made a mistake.\u201d",

The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted \u201ca weapons storage facility\u201d and a Hezbollah \u201ccommand centre\u201d. Israel also said Hezbollah had fired more than 60 projectiles at the country today. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency also reported a strike on the southern city of Tyre. Elsewhere in south Lebanon, the health ministry said Israeli strikes killed two rescuers affiliated with Hezbollah and its ally Amal. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency reported 11 people killed in strikes across the territory earlier today. The Gaza health ministry said at least 35 people were killed in the territory in the previous 24 hours, taking the overall death toll in more than 13 months of war to 43,799. An Italian air force plane took off earlier today carrying more than 13 tonnes of humanitarian aid to be delivered to the population in Gaza, a defence ministry statement said. \u201cItaly is doing and will continue to do everything possible to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in Gaza,\u201d defence minister Guido Crosetto said. Two senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad members were killed in an Israeli strike on Syria on Thursday, a source from the Palestinian group said earlier today. The figures were Abdel Aziz Minawi, a member of Islamic Jihad\u2019s political bureau, and the group\u2019s foreign relations chief Rasmi Abu Issa, who were killed in the strike on Qudsaya, in the Damascus area. An Iranian official met with Elon Musk to discuss Iran\u2019s nuclear program, its support for anti-Israel groups throughout the Middle East and prospects for improved relations with the US, according to a US official. Iran later denied the reports. Israel said Hezbollah had fired more than 60 projectiles into Israel today, as Israeli troops pushed the furthest they have been into Lebanon since its ground invasion began last month. Israeli troops captured a strategic hill in the southern Lebanese village of Chamaa, about 5km (3 miles) from the Israeli border, Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency reported. It said the troops were later pushed back. Israel\u2019s military said its troops \u201ccontinue their limited, localised and targeted operational activity in southern Lebanon\u201d. An Italian air force plane took off earlier today carrying more than 13 tonnes of humanitarian aid to be delivered to the population in Gaza, a defence ministry statement said, Reuters reports. The aid aboard the C-130J aircraft, which departed from the central Italian city of Pisa, had been collected by charity group Confederazione Nazionale delle Misericordie d\u2019Italia, the statement said. \u201cItaly is doing and will continue to do everything possible to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in Gaza,\u201d said defence minister Guido Crosetto, adding Italy did not forget those who are suffering and was committed to a de-escalation of the conflict. The plane will fly to Larnaca airport in Cyprus after which all the materials it is carrying will be transferred to Gaza. Earlier this year, Italy launched a flagship initiative dubbed Food for Gaza to help civilians there, and it has sent several consignments of aid to those hit by the war. The IDF said it had completed a series of attacks in southern Beirut. Israel\u2019s air force said in a tweet it had targeted strikes \u201cin the Da\u2019aheh area of Beirut in which they attacked a munitions warehouse, a headquarters and terrorist infrastructures that were used by the terrorist organization Hezbollah\u201d. The military shared a video purporting to show the strikes. It was not possible to independently verify the footage. Earlier Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency said \u201cthe enemy\u201d had carried out three air raids on Beirut. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency reported 11 people killed in strikes across the territory earlier today, AFP reports. The Gaza health ministry said at least 35 people were killed in the territory in the previous 24 hours, taking the overall death toll in more than 13 months of war to 43,799. The majority of the dead were civilians, according to ministry figures, which the United Nations considers reliable. In Rafah, in the south of the Strip, resident Jamil al-Masry said a house was hit, causing \u201ca massive explosion\u201d. \u201cWe went to the house, only to find it in ruins, with fire raging and smoke and dust everywhere,\u201d he said. People \u201cstarted searching for martyrs and survivors\u201d with their bare hands, he said, with some \u201cstill under the rubble\u201d. The Israeli military said it is continuing \u201coperational activity\u201d in Jabalia and Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, the targets of an intense offensive since early October. Troops also operated in the southern district of Rafah, the army said. Israel says its renewed operations in the ravaged north were meant to stop Hamas militants from regrouping. AFP provides some more detail about Israel\u2019s strikes on Lebanon today \u2013 Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Hezbollah bastions in Beirut and south Lebanon, a day after Lebanese government officials said they were studying a US truce proposal. Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency said \u201cthe enemy\u201d carried out three air raids in the morning, later reporting another attack in the neighbourhood of Chiyah. The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted \u201ca weapons storage facility\u201d and a Hezbollah \u201ccommand centre\u201d in south Beirut. NNA also reported a strike on the southern city of Tyre, in a neighbourhood near the city\u2019s UNESCO-listed ancient ruins. Elsewhere in south Lebanon, the health ministry said Israeli strikes killed two rescuers affiliated with Hezbollah and its ally Amal. Hezbollah claimed several rocket attacks on northern Israel, targeting military sites including a naval base in the Haifa area. The medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has shared a video about the difficulties faced by internally displaced people who suffer from diabetes \u2013 including shortages of vital medication such as insulin, lack of healthcare facilities and a diet made up of donated food that is often high-carbohydrate and therefore not suitable for people living with the condition. The UN estimates about 600,000 people have become internally displaced in Lebanon since Israel started its ground invasion in the country last month. Israeli ground forces have reached their deepest point in Lebanon since they invaded six weeks ago, before pulling back after fierce battles with Hezbollah militants, Lebanese state media reported. Israeli troops captured a strategic hill in the southern Lebanese village of Chamaa, about three miles from the Israeli border, early on Saturday, the state-run National News Agency reported. It said Israeli troops were later pushed back from the hill. The agency added that Israeli troops blew up the Shrine of Shimon the Prophet in Chamaa as well as several homes before they withdrew, but the claim could not be verified, AP said. Israel\u2019s military said its troops \u201ccontinue their limited, localised and targeted operational activity in southern Lebanon\u201d. Two senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) figures were killed in an Israeli strike on Syria on Thursday, a source from the Palestinian group said. PIJ has fought alongside Hamas against Israel in Gaza. The source told AFP on Saturday that Abdel Aziz Minawi, a member of Islamic Jihad\u2019s political bureau, and the group\u2019s foreign relations chief Rasmi Abu Issa were killed in the strike on Qudsaya, in the Damascus area. A Beirut property developer is one among many wealthy Lebanese people denied access to their fortunes by banks after a financial crisis and now left reeling from effects of Israel\u2019s airstrikes, Ruth Michaelson reports for the Observer: Ibrahim Abdallah and his family are still members of the nearby country club, but earlier this year he sold his 10-metre-long boat with a plush cream leather interior. Last year, he sold a flat located among embassy buildings in the pricier neighbourhood farther uphill that was intended for his young son. He has $2m in the bank and the receipts to prove it, but weathering Lebanon\u2019s multiple financial and political crises has left Abdallah selling the trappings of his former life to sustain himself and his family \u2026 \u201cHere\u2019s how it feels: you made your dreams come true, but were forced to give it up. You achieved your aims, then someone takes it away from you,\u201d he said. Lebanon state media reports a strike on Tyre in the south of the country. Earlier today two separate airstrikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Another airstrike hit the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut around midday local time, according to AFP, after the area was hit earlier this morning. Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency reported a raid by \u201cenemy aircraft\u201d in the neighbourhood of Chiyah. Before the strikes, Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee had urged residents of three neighbourhoods to leave the area. Iran has \u201ccategorically\u201d denied that its UN envoy met with Elon Musk in New York, the country\u2019s IRNA news agency reported. In an interview, foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said while \u201ccategorically denying such a meeting\u201d he expressed \u201csurprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard\u201d. Iranian newspapers, particularly those aligned with the reformist party that supports president Masoud Pezeshkian, largely described the meeting in positive terms before Baghaei\u2019s statement. Reuters reports 43,799 Palestinians are confirmed to have been killed and 103,601 wounded in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October last year, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday. An artillery shell hit the west sector headquarters of UN forces in Lebanon yesterday afternoon, the agency said. \u201cThis afternoon, a 155mm live artillery shell hit UNP 2-3, Unifil West Sector headquarters in Shama,\u201d a Unifil statement said. \u201cThe shell did not detonate and Italian bomb disposal experts swiftly secured the area, removed the ordnance, and conducted a controlled detonation. There was no injury among peacekeepers, but only minor damages to the gym.\u201d The statement did not say whether the shell had come from Israeli or Hezbollah forces. \u201cWe strongly remind all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and properties. Deliberate attacks on peacekeepers are a grave violation of international humanitarian laws and of the UN Security Council Resolution 1701.\u201d Israel has been accused of targeting Unifil, the UN-mandated force deployed along the border between Israel and Lebanon since it launched its ground invasion of Lebanon early last month. Israel has said its raids are only targeted at Hezbollah. In the crowded Qalandia refugee camp, UNRWA\u2019s training centre is an island of calm where young people from the occupied West Bank learn trades, but a recent Israeli ban on all cooperation with the UN agency has left the centre in limbo, AFP reports. UNRWA\u2019s ban in Israel and occupied east Jerusalem has raised fears that its West Bank employees could face problems not only accessing those areas, but also moving around more generally because they would lose the ability to coordinate with the Israeli authorities manning checkpoints. The same fears apply to visas and permits delivered by Israeli authorities. Eighteen-year-old Ahmed Naseef, a refugee from the Jalazone camp north of nearby Ramallah, said he didn\u2019t know what he and his classmates would do should the Qalandia training centre close as a result of the law. \u201cIt would disrupt my fellow students. Many don\u2019t have the financial means to go to another institute for study. Here, it\u2019s almost free,\u201d he told AFP during a class in which he was learning how to install lights in a room. Jonathan Fowler, UNRWA spokesman in Jerusalem, warned that if some of the services were unable to continue, the socioeconomic consequences could be \u201cpotentially disastrous\u201d. \u201cIf these services are not able to operate... who is going to provide education for the children and the adolescents in this camp?\u201d Baha Awaad, the school\u2019s principal, said it trains 350 students but cannot provide for more due to the lack of permission to expand buildings. Asked whether the students would be able to finish their school year, Awaad admitted: \u201cFrankly, we don\u2019t know.\u201d Tensions between UNRWA and Israel began after Israel accused about a dozen of the agency\u2019s staff of taking part in Hamas\u2019s attack on southern Israel on 7 October last year. A series of probes found some \u201cneutrality related issues\u201d at UNRWA, and determined that nine employees \u201cmay have been involved\u201d in the attack, but found no evidence for Israel\u2019s central allegations. Outoging US president Joe Biden now has his best opening to end Israel\u2019s war on Gaza but he won\u2019t use it, Mohamad Bazzi writes \u2026 [Biden\u2019s] lack of action this week is especially egregious because he is politically unrestrained: the presidential election is over, and Donald Trump won. Biden can do whatever he wants without incurring a political cost. He doesn\u2019t even have to worry about a transition to his fellow Democrat and vice-president, Kamala Harris. If there was ever a time for Biden to use his considerable power to save Palestinians, this was it. Yet he squandered this final opportunity to make the right and moral choice \u2013 and help end the Gaza war before leaving office. Biden\u2019s decision to keep supplying weapons to Israel reinforces his legacy as the primary enabler of the slaughter in Gaza, and Netanyahu\u2019s campaign to expand the war into Lebanon. While Biden and his allies have done a lot of hand-wringing about Trump\u2019s disregard for the rule of law, the Biden administration failed to uphold US law and its own policies \u2013 and it has undermined US credibility around the world even before Trump takes office once again. You can read the full piece at the link below. Images are coming through of Israel\u2019s strike on Beirut this morning, showing a large plume of smoke rising above the city. An Iranian official met with Elon Musk, according to a US official, AP reports. Iran\u2019s UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani met with Musk \u2014 a key Trump ally and the world\u2019s richest man \u2014 on Monday in New York. The US official said he had been informed that the discussion covered a variety of topics, most notably Iran\u2019s nuclear program, its support for anti-Israel groups throughout the Middle East and prospects for improved relations with the United States. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no immediate decisions were taken by either side. The official said the Iranians sought the meeting with Musk and that it did not take place at the Iranian mission to the UN. The Trump transition team would not confirm or deny the meeting. \u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump because they trust him to lead our country and restore peace through strength around the world. When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary action to do just that,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said in a statement. Iran\u2019s UN mission declined to comment. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed US officials, that Iran told the Biden administration in a written message delivered on 14 October that it would not try to kill Trump. It was a response to an earlier warning from the US that an attempt on Trump\u2019s life would be considered an act of war, the Journal reported. Here is the tweet from the IDF\u2019s Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, calling for the evacuation of southern Beirut\u2019s Haret Hreik neighbourhood a couple of hours ago. \u201cTo all residents in the southern suburb area, specifically in the buildings specified in the attached maps and the buildings adjacent to them in Haret Hreik \u2026 You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests, against which the IDF will act forcefully in the near future,\u201d a translation of the post reads. \u201cFor your safety and the safety of your family members, you must evacuate these buildings and those adjacent to them immediately and stay away from them for a distance of no less than 500 meters.\u201d AFP reported an Israeli strike hit the south of the city this morning. Hello, we are restarting the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. It\u2019s just past 10.30am in Gaza City, Beitrut and Tel Aviv. A strike hit the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut this morning, shortly after the Israeli army issued a new call to evacuate the area. Since Tuesday, Israel has carried out several strikes on the city\u2019s southern suburbs, a stronghold of Hezbollah. Shortly before the attack, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee posted on X a call for residents of the Haret Hreik suburb to evacuate. \u201cYou are close to facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah, against which the Israeli military will be acting with force in the near future,\u201d the post said in Arabic, identifying specific buildings and telling residents to move at least 500 metres away. Repeated Israeli air strikes on south Beirut have led to a mass exodus of civilians from the area, although some return during the day to check on their homes and businesses. Here are some of the other latest developments: A senior Hamas official has said the Palestinian militant group is \u201cready for a ceasefire\u201d in Gaza and urged US president-elect Donald Trump to \u201cpressure\u201d Israel to \u201cend the aggression\u201d. \u201cHamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected\u201d by Israel, Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim said. A UN spokesperson said that aid access in Gaza is at a low point with deliveries to parts of the north of the territory all but impossible. \u201cFrom our perspective, on all indicators you can possibly think of in a humanitarian response, all of them are going in the wrong direction,\u201d Jens Laerke told a press briefing. An Israeli airstrike flattened a building near one of Beirut\u2019s busiest traffic junctions, Tayouneh. The targeted building was located in an area where the southern suburbs meet other. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister has asked Iran to help secure a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah and appeared to urge it to convince the militant group to agree to a deal that could require it to pull back from the Israel-Lebanon border. The prime minister made the comments in talks with Ali Larijani, a top adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, AP reported. Twenty-one civil defence rescuers were killed in two Israeli strikes on Lebanon on Thursday, marking one of the deadliest days for rescue workers since the fighting began between Israel and Hezbollah 13 months ago. The airstrikes brought the total number of emergency workers killed by Israel in Lebanon to more than 200. Fifty-nine people were killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon on Thursday, bringing the total killed since October last year to at least 3,445, with 14,599 wounded, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "After the November elections ushered in a new era of unified Republican governance in Washington, Democratic leaders across the country are once again preparing to lead the resistance to Donald Trump\u2019s second-term agenda. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said he would convene a special legislative session next month to \u201csafeguard California values and fundamental rights\u201d. Washington state\u2019s governor-elect, Bob Ferguson, who is currently the state\u2019s attorney general, said his legal team has been preparing for months for the possibility of a second Trump term \u2013 an endeavor that included a \u201cline-by-line\u201d review of Project 2025, the 900+ page policy blueprint drafted by the president-elect\u2019s conservative allies. And the governors of Illinois and Colorado this week unveiled a new coalition designed to protect state-level institutions against the threat of authoritarianism, as the nation prepares for a president who has vowed to seek retribution against his political enemies and to only govern as a dictator on \u201cday one\u201d. \u201cWe know that simple hope alone won\u2019t save our democracy,\u201d the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, said on a conference call announcing the group, called Governors Safeguarding Democracy. \u201cWe need to work together, especially at the state level, to protect and strengthen it.\u201d With Democrats locked out of control in Washington, many in the party will turn to blue state leaders \u2013 governors, attorneys general and mayors \u2013 as a bulwark against a second Trump administration. For these ambitious Democrats, it is also an opportunity to step into the leadership void left by Kamala Harris\u2019s defeat. Progressives such as Newsom and the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, are viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028, while Democratic governors in states that voted for Trump such as Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan are seen as models for how the party can begin to rebuild their coalition. And Tim Walz, Harris\u2019s vice-presidential running mate, returned home to Minnesota with a national profile and two years left of his gubernatorial term. Leaders of the nascent blue state resistance are pre-emptively \u201cTrump-proofing\u201d against a conservative governing agenda, which they have cast as a threat to the values and safety of their constituents. As a candidate, Trump promised to carry out the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history\u201d. In statements and public remarks, several Democrats say they fear the Trump administration will seek to limit access to medication abortion or seek to undermine efforts to provide reproductive care to women from states with abortion bans. They also anticipate actions by the Trump administration to roll back environmental regulations and expand gun rights. \u201cTo anyone who intends to come take away the freedom, opportunity and dignity of Illinoisans, I would remind you that a happy warrior is still a warrior. You come for my people \u2013 you come through me,\u201d Pritzker said last week. Unlike in 2016, when Trump\u2019s victory shocked the nation, blue state leaders say they have a tested \u2013 and updated \u2013 playbook to draw upon. But they also acknowledge that Trump 2.0 may present new and more difficult challenges. Ferguson said Trump\u2019s first-term executive actions were \u201coften sloppy\u201d, which created an opening for states to successfully challenge them in court. Eight years later, and after studying Project 2025 and Trump\u2019s Agenda 47, he anticipates the next Trump White House will be \u201cbetter prepared\u201d this time around. Pritzker said Trump was surrounding himself with \u201cabsolute loyalists to his cult of personality and not necessarily to the law\u201d. \u201cLast time, he didn\u2019t really know where the levers of government were,\u201d the governor said on a call with reporters this week. \u201cI think he probably does now.\u201d The courts have also become more conservative than they were when Trump took office eight years ago, a direct result of his first-term appointments to the federal bench, which included many powerful federal appeals court judges and three supreme court justices. The political landscape has also changed. In 2016, Trump won the electoral college but lost the popular vote. Despite Republican control of Congress, there were a number of Trump skeptics willing \u2013 at least initially \u2013 to buck the president during his first two years in office. This time around, Trump is all but certain to win the popular vote, and he made surprising gains in some of the bluest corners of the country. Though the former president came nowhere close to winning his home state of New York, he made significant inroads, especially on Long Island. At a post-election conference last week, New York\u2019s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, struck a more neutral tone. Hochul, who faces a potentially tough re-election in 2026, vowed to protect constituents against federal overreach, while declaring that she was prepared to work with \u201chim or anybody regardless of party\u201d. In New Jersey, where Trump narrowed his loss from 16 percentage points in 2020 to five percentage points in 2024, the Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, acknowledged the result was a \u201csobering moment\u201d for the party and country. Outlining his approach to the incoming administration, Murphy said: \u201cIf it\u2019s contrary to our values, we will fight to the death. If there\u2019s an opportunity for common ground, we will seize that as fast as anybody.\u201d Progressives and activists say they are looking to Democratic leaders to lead the charge against Trump\u2019s most extreme proposals, particularly on immigration. \u201cTrump may be re-elected but he does not have a mandate to come into and rip apart our communities,\u201d said Greisa Mart\u00ednez Rosas, the executive director of United We Dream Action, a network of groups that advocate for young people brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. She called on state and local officials, as well as university heads and business leaders, to \u201cuse every tool at their disposal\u201d to resist Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, stressing: \u201cThere is a lot we can do to ensure Trump and his cabinet are not successful in their plans.\u201d State attorneys general are again poised to play a pivotal role in curbing the next administration\u2019s policy ambitions. \u201cThe quantity of litigation since the first Trump administration has been really off the charts \u2013 it\u2019s at a new level,\u201d said Paul Nolette, a political scientist at Marquette University in Wisconsin. \u201cI fully expect that to continue in Trump 2.0.\u201d There were 160 multi-state filings against the Trump administration during his four years in office, twice as many as were filed against Barack Obama during his entire eight-year presidency, according to a database maintained by Nolette. Many of the Democratic lawsuits succeeded \u2013 at least initially \u2013 in delaying or striking down Trump administration policies or regulations, Nolette said. Attorneys general can also leverage their state\u2019s influence and economic power by entering legal settlements with companies. States have used this approach in the past to \u201cadvance their own regulatory goals\u201d, Nolette said, for example, forcing the auto industry to adopt stricter environmental regulations.

Trump responded on Truth Social, using a derisive nickname for the Democratic governor: \u201cGovernor Gavin Newscum is trying to KILL our Nation\u2019s beautiful California. He is using the term \u2018Trump-Proof\u2019 as a way of stopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to \u2018Make California Great Again,\u2019 but I just overwhelmingly won the Election.\u201d Democratic leaders in battleground states that Trump won are also calibrating their responses \u2013 and not all are eager to join the resistance. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the most productive way to govern Arizona,\u201d the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, told reporters this week, according to the Arizona Capitol Times. Hobbs, who faces a potentially difficult re-election fight in 2026, said she would \u201cstand up against actions that hurt our communities\u201d but declined to say how she would respond if Trump sought to deport Dreamers or to nationalize the Arizona national guard as part of his mass deportation campaign. The state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Kris Mayes, who also faces re-election in two years, drew a harder line against Trump, vowing to fight \u201cunconstitutional behavior\u201d and protect abortion access, according to Axios. In an interview on MSNBC, Mayes said she had \u201cno intention\u201d of dropping the criminal case against allies of the former president who attempted to help Trump overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the state. Yet she insisted there would be areas of common ground. She urged Trump to revive a bipartisan border deal that he had previously tanked and called on the next administration to send more federal resources and agents to help combat the flow of fentanyl into the US. With Democrats locked out of power in Washington, the new Indivisible Guide, a manual developed by former Democratic congressional staffers after Trump\u2019s election in 2016 and recently updated to confront a new era of Maga politics, envisions a major role for blue states. \u201cOver the next two years, your Democratic elected officials will make choices every single day about whether to stand up to Maga or whether to go along with it,\u201d the Indivisible guide states. \u201cYour spirited, determined advocacy will ensure that the good ones know they\u2019ve got a movement behind them as they fight back \u2013 and the bad ones know they\u2019re on notice.\u201d Among the examples of actions blue state activists can demand their leaders consider, it suggests establishing protections for out-of-state residents seeking abortion access or gender-affirming care; refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and forging regional compacts to safeguard environmental initiatives, data privacy and healthcare. Democratic leaders at every level and across the country \u2013 even those in purple or red states \u2013 can serve as \u201cbackstops for protecting the democratic space\u201d, said Mary Small, chief strategy officer at Indivisible. \u201cThe important things are to be proactive and bold, to be innovative and to work with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think everybody has to have all of the answers right now, but to have that intention and that commitment and to not shrink down in anticipation of a more oppressive federal government.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>He has trained would-be assassins and marshalled invading hordes, Napoleonic forces and Roman regiments, but movie military adviser Paul Biddiss found himself in the midst of his biggest Hollywood skirmish last month when the actor Saoirse Ronan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/30/saoirse-ronan-graham-norton-reaction-womens-safety-comments\">made a powerful intervention</a> about women\u2019s personal safety.</p> \n<p>Ronan, a guest on Graham Norton\u2019s BBC chatshow sofa, sparked a nationwide debate about women\u2019s security fears when she interrupted fellow actors as they discussed techniques that Biddiss had taught the casts of both <em>Gladiator </em><em>II</em> and the new drama series <em>The Day of the Jackal</em>.</p> \n<p>Paul Mescal, who opens in cinemas this weekend in the lead role in Ridley Scott\u2019s epic <em>Gladiator</em> sequel, swapped details of his new combat skills with Eddie Redmayne, star of the Sky Atlantic show based on Frederick Forsyth\u2019s thriller, when Ronan unexpectedly made her intervention.</p> \n<p>Mescal asked: \u201cWho\u2019s actually going to think about that?\u201d when discussing using his phone as a weapon, then Ronan pointed out that women do \u2013 they think about how to physically protect themselves daily. </p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what girls have to think about all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cAm I right, ladies?\u201d</p> \n<p>Within 24 hours, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/01/i-always-know-where-my-keys-are-uk-survey-backs-saoirse-ronans-words-on-womens-safety\">Ronan\u2019s words had been repeated</a> across the airwaves and social media thousands of times.</p> \n<p>\u201cSaoirse was absolutely right,\u201d said Biddiss, a Parachute Regiment veteran, this weekend, in his first interview since the viral incident. \u201cIt was a bit of a shock to suddenly be at the centre of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/29/chatshow-saoirse-ronan-graham-norton-women\">such an important moment</a>. Paul and Eddie were just enjoying a bit of banter about whether anyone would ever think to use their mobile phone as a weapon, as I\u2019d suggested.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut, as Saoirse then said, phones, along with everything else inside a handbag, are always on the mind of a woman who is walking alone. All these items can be used, and particularly a mobile phone, which is carried in the hand a lot.\u201d</p> \n<p>Redmayne, Mescal and his <em>Gladiator </em>co-star Denzel Washington, also a guest that night, accepted her intervention with good grace. Speaking this weekend on RTE\u2019s <em>The Late Late Show</em>, Mescal backed Ronan\u2019s view, saying: \u201cSaoirse was spot on, hit the nail on the head, and it\u2019s also good that ... messages like that are gaining traction, like that\u2019s a conversation that we should absolutely be having on a daily basis.\u201d The actor added that Ronan is \u201cquite often the most intelligent person in the room\u201d.</p> \n<p>Biddiss was picked to work with Scott on the long-awaited second <em>Gladiator</em> film after working with him on <em>Napoleon</em>. He was hired because of his experience at handling large numbers of supporting artists, and training film \u201cextras\u201d to behave like military forces from different historic eras.</p> \n<p>He spent eight months on the project. Sometimes it was necessary to work while a desert sand storm raged around ranks of new recruits who had been provided with masks and goggles to cover their faces. But Biddiss said the most difficult challenge on <em>Gladiator </em><em>II</em>, filmed in Malta, Britain and Morocco, was reproducing a particular battle scene with the Praetorian Guard.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was very hard to choreograph this drill because Ridley wanted the men to move together in a coordinated way that was very hard to achieve,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>While the adviser has often worked on location, reproducing large military encounters, his expertise also covers creating the illusion of proficient gun handling and espionage practice. \u201cI find, as do the secret services, that females are much more surveillance aware and much more situationally aware. They need to be,\u201d Biddiss said.</p> \n<p>\u201cMen are generally not like that. Their initial instincts, when you train them, are more predatory, and so they miss things. As a result, women are much harder for professionals to follow.\u201d</p> \n<p>Playing the role of a hired assassin for <em>The Day of the Jackal</em>, Redmayne needed to learn covert techniques and, in training, was told to follow a fictional agent called Zara, a role taken by Biddiss\u2019s wife, Debbie. \u201cHe found it hard. It is proof that women are so much more aware and harder to track on the street,\u201d Bidiss said.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven with my knowledge of the techniques,\u201d he added, \u201cI would find it more difficult to follow a female agent.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/02/will-anything-change-six-women-react-saoirse-ronans-viral-comment\">\u2018Will anything change?\u2019: six women react to Saoirse Ronan\u2019s viral comment</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Biddiss also trained the British actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/27/actor-lashana-lynch-interview-007-bond-bob-marley-rita-marley-marvel#:~:text=Lynch%20sees%20me%20and%20grins,Today%2C%20though%2C%20she's%20unassuming.\">Lashana Lynch</a>, who starred in the latest James Bond film and plays Bianca in <em>The Day of the Jackal</em>. She was instructed in surveillance, lock picking, close-quarters weapons training and the kind of \u201cdirty fighting\u201d that was once practised by Special Operations Executive agents during the second world war.</p> \n<p>\u201cDuring world war two, the women working for SOE were among the very top performing agents.

      "bodyText": "He has trained would-be assassins and marshalled invading hordes, Napoleonic forces and Roman regiments, but movie military adviser Paul Biddiss found himself in the midst of his biggest Hollywood skirmish last month when the actor Saoirse Ronan made a powerful intervention about women\u2019s personal safety. Ronan, a guest on Graham Norton\u2019s BBC chatshow sofa, sparked a nationwide debate about women\u2019s security fears when she interrupted fellow actors as they discussed techniques that Biddiss had taught the casts of both Gladiator II and the new drama series The Day of the Jackal. Paul Mescal, who opens in cinemas this weekend in the lead role in Ridley Scott\u2019s epic Gladiator sequel, swapped details of his new combat skills with Eddie Redmayne, star of the Sky Atlantic show based on Frederick Forsyth\u2019s thriller, when Ronan unexpectedly made her intervention. Mescal asked: \u201cWho\u2019s actually going to think about that?\u201d when discussing using his phone as a weapon, then Ronan pointed out that women do \u2013 they think about how to physically protect themselves daily. \u201cThat\u2019s what girls have to think about all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cAm I right, ladies?\u201d Within 24 hours, Ronan\u2019s words had been repeated across the airwaves and social media thousands of times. \u201cSaoirse was absolutely right,\u201d said Biddiss, a Parachute Regiment veteran, this weekend, in his first interview since the viral incident. \u201cIt was a bit of a shock to suddenly be at the centre of such an important moment. Paul and Eddie were just enjoying a bit of banter about whether anyone would ever think to use their mobile phone as a weapon, as I\u2019d suggested. \u201cBut, as Saoirse then said, phones, along with everything else inside a handbag, are always on the mind of a woman who is walking alone. All these items can be used, and particularly a mobile phone, which is carried in the hand a lot.\u201d Redmayne, Mescal and his Gladiator co-star Denzel Washington, also a guest that night, accepted her intervention with good grace. Speaking this weekend on RTE\u2019s The Late Late Show, Mescal backed Ronan\u2019s view, saying: \u201cSaoirse was spot on, hit the nail on the head, and it\u2019s also good that ... messages like that are gaining traction, like that\u2019s a conversation that we should absolutely be having on a daily basis.\u201d The actor added that Ronan is \u201cquite often the most intelligent person in the room\u201d. Biddiss was picked to work with Scott on the long-awaited second Gladiator film after working with him on Napoleon. He was hired because of his experience at handling large numbers of supporting artists, and training film \u201cextras\u201d to behave like military forces from different historic eras. He spent eight months on the project. Sometimes it was necessary to work while a desert sand storm raged around ranks of new recruits who had been provided with masks and goggles to cover their faces. But Biddiss said the most difficult challenge on Gladiator II, filmed in Malta, Britain and Morocco, was reproducing a particular battle scene with the Praetorian Guard. \u201cIt was very hard to choreograph this drill because Ridley wanted the men to move together in a coordinated way that was very hard to achieve,\u201d he said. While the adviser has often worked on location, reproducing large military encounters, his expertise also covers creating the illusion of proficient gun handling and espionage practice. \u201cI find, as do the secret services, that females are much more surveillance aware and much more situationally aware. They need to be,\u201d Biddiss said. \u201cMen are generally not like that. Their initial instincts, when you train them, are more predatory, and so they miss things. As a result, women are much harder for professionals to follow.\u201d Playing the role of a hired assassin for The Day of the Jackal, Redmayne needed to learn covert techniques and, in training, was told to follow a fictional agent called Zara, a role taken by Biddiss\u2019s wife, Debbie. \u201cHe found it hard. It is proof that women are so much more aware and harder to track on the street,\u201d Bidiss said. \u201cEven with my knowledge of the techniques,\u201d he added, \u201cI would find it more difficult to follow a female agent.\u201d Biddiss also trained the British actor Lashana Lynch, who starred in the latest James Bond film and plays Bianca in The Day of the Jackal. She was instructed in surveillance, lock picking, close-quarters weapons training and the kind of \u201cdirty fighting\u201d that was once practised by Special Operations Executive agents during the second world war. \u201cDuring world war two, the women working for SOE were among the very top performing agents. There are many stories that are not widely known yet, and I would like them to come out so these women could get the credit they deserve,\u201d Biddiss said. \u201cAnd today it\u2019s true that using a mobile phone as a weapon, which is what Eddie was talking about with Graham Norton, is a real thing. You can gain enough time to get away from an assailant like that. You can also use the screen as a mirror to watch someone who\u2019s following you.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When it comes to Christmas shopping for the teenagers in your life, it helps to consult an expert. So who better to advise than teenagers themselves? We asked students in years 10 and 11 at the Maelor School in Wrexham, Wales; year 9 at Nunnery Wood High School in Worcester; and sixth formers at Derby College in Derbyshire to share their (reasonable) wishlists. Here are 30-plus suggestions (or should that be requests?) from the people best qualified to tell you what teens really want. *** The best gifts for teenagers *** Cold cases The Naturals Complete Box Set by Jennifer Lynn Barnes, \u00a332.36 guardianbookshop.com \u00a321.98 amazon.co.uk I first heard about these books through TikTok and I\u2019ve been wanting to read them for a while. They\u2019ve really captured my attention with the blurb and the covers. Heather, 17 *** Cuddle up Kids\u2019 faux fur blanket, \u00a320.40 johnlewis.com \u00a38 amazon.co.uk They\u2019re very pretty and comforting. My friend has one in her bedroom, and when we watched a scary film we hid under it! Ellie, 13 *** Get a grip Gain the Edge grip socks, \u00a39.99 gaintheedgeofficial.com Zuimei grip socks, \u00a38.99 amazon.co.uk I\u2019d like these grip socks because I play rugby and get blisters on my feet when they rub in my boots.

Libby, 18 *** Christmas quacker Jellycat Yummy Duckling plushie, \u00a318 jarrolds.co.uk happy-returns.co.uk I would really like a Jellycat Yummy Duckling soft plushie. It\u2019s such a cute and adorable toy and probably the only toy brand acceptable for teenagers. I already have three Jellycats at home and wish to grow my collection. Annie, 14 *** Say cheese Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 instant camera, \u00a373.99 johnlewis.com \u00a372.96 amazon.co.uk A Fuji Instax Mini camera, to take pics with my friends.

Joe, 15 *** Game on EA Sports FC25 \u2013 FC points 1,050, \u00a38.99 xbox.com store.playstation.com The new Fifa has just come out and my team is not very good. With more points, I could buy a player pack that would help with my team. Josef, 15 *** Poster boys Mainoo, Garnacho, H\u00f8jlund magnetic metal poster, \u00a339 displate.com I have supported Manchester United since I was little and they are some of my favourite players.

Josef, 15 *** Smart kit Wrexham 24/25 away shirt, from \u00a340 shop.wrexhamafc.co.uk I would like the new Wrexham black shirt. It looks good and it would be nice to go to the matches in the new away shirt. Elliot, 14 *** Money, money, money It will help me pay for wants and needs.

I heard about this piece on TikTok while scrolling one night and now I have my heart set on it. Lois, 15 *** All heart Aqua opal heart necklace, \u00a349 lauragravestock.com My clothing style has changed and I would like jewellery that matches my clothes now. Paige, 17 *** Customised Converse Custom Chuck Taylor All Star By You, \u00a375 converse.com I would really love a pair of custom Converse, navy on one side and black on the other. I\u2019ve wanted these ever since my cousin got hers a couple of years ago. I already have two pairs of Converse \u2013 one white, and one with a pink bottom, which I love \u2013 but I would also like a darker-coloured pair as we go into the colder, rainier season, so they don\u2019t get as dirty. Maggie, 13 *** Super-cutesy animals Aphmau mystery MeeMeows plush, \u00a314.99 smythstoys.com \u00a39.99 hamleys.com Aphmau mystery safari MeeMeows plush, \u00a312.99 amazon.co.uk I came across this as the producer is a popular Minecraft YouTuber that I follow.

Lucy, 13 *** Denim dream Embellished Miss Me jeans, \u00a363.70 vinted.co.uk I like Miss Me low-rise jeans because they\u2019re cute. I came across them on Vinted.

      "body": "<p>Born in 1940, <a href=\"https://www.peterbiskind.com/about-1\">Peter Biskind</a> is a cultural critic and film historian whose books include <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/easy-riders-raging-bulls-9780747544210/\">Easy Riders</a></em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/easy-riders-raging-bulls-9780747544210/\">, </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/easy-riders-raging-bulls-9780747544210/\">Raging Bulls</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.peterbiskind.com/godfather-companion\">The Godfather Companion</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/10/star-warren-beatty-peter-biskind\">Star: How Warren Beatty Seduced America</a></em>. Between 1981 and 1986 Biskind was editor-in-chief of <em>American Film</em> magazine, and was executive editor of <em>Premiere</em> magazine from 1986 to 1996. His writing has appeared in publications including the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>Sight and Sound</em>. His latest book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pandoras-box-9780241443903/\">Pandora\u2019s Box: The Greed, Lust, and Lies That Broke Television</a></em>, explores the behind-the-screens story of the golden age of TV, from <em>The Sopranos</em> to streaming. </p> <h2><strong>1. </strong><strong>Film</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/03/anora-review-sean-baker-screwball-cinderella-tale-vaults-him-towards-greatness-mikey-madison\">Anora</a> (dir</strong><strong> Sean Baker, 2024)</strong></p>    <p><em>Anora</em> has got a lot of attention this year, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/25/anora-is-a-vivacious-cannes-victor-and-a-fitting-end-to-a-radically-romantic-festival\">it won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes</a>, which Sean Baker dedicated to sex workers. It\u2019s a screwball comedy about a struggling stripper in Brooklyn, played by Mikey Madison, who is saved by the son of a Russian oligarch, named Ivan. Of course, her honeymoon with Ivan doesn\u2019t last, and she pays for her good fortune in several different ways. Baker is a singular talent, and his films deal with everyday people. He is also right to endorse theatres over streaming as the ideal place to show movies.</p>    <h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>Book</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/11/the-hunter-by-tana-french-review-sequel-to-the-searcher\">The Hunter</a> by Tana French</strong></p> <p>Tana French is known for her thrillers, but that doesn\u2019t begin to do her justice. <em>The Hunter</em> is really a novel set in Ireland, bursting with vivid, finely etched characters, that happens to revolve around a murder. It\u2019s about an American ex-cop called Cal who befriends a local girl and they repair furniture together. The girl is wonderfully described: she has very mixed feelings about her father, who\u2019s a wastrel, and she plays a big role in uncovering the murder.</p> <h2><strong>3. </strong><strong>Food</strong></h2> <p><strong>Maine blueberries</strong></p>    <p>I\u2019m addicted to anything with blueberries, including blueberry pancakes, and pie stuffed with those tiny wild blueberries that Maine is famous for. Maine blueberries are just delicious, different from anywhere else. They have more flavour: blueberries that actually taste like blueberries are supposed to taste. There is also a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015511-blueberry-crumb-cake\">blueberry crumb cake</a>, courtesy of the <em>New York Times</em> cooking section, that I first tasted at the house of my friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/14/ruth-reichl-cookbooks-collection-sarah-chamberlain-comment\">Ruth Reichl</a>, who\u2019s a foodie celebrity. You get a wonderful contrast between the crumbly top of the cake and soft inside.</p> <h2><strong>4. </strong><strong>Documentary</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHjUJjaG0q0\">Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat</a> (dir Johan Grimonprez, 2024)</strong></p>    <p>This is a really interesting new documentary about the overthrow of Patrice Lumumba in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 60s, which nobody remembers, really. It\u2019s a thorough and engaging documentary, and I think an important one, because it throws light on the negative impact of the CIA on democratic regimes in that period, as well as the United Nations, which was dominated by the US and the CIA at that point. It\u2019s a real eye opener into cold war politics.</p> <h2><strong>5. </strong><strong>Place</strong></h2> <p><strong>Santa Barbara</strong></p>    <p>It\u2019s in southern California, right on the ocean, and it\u2019s an incredibly picturesque, beautiful place \u2013 as close to heaven as you can get in the United States.

      "bodyText": "Born in 1940, Peter Biskind is a cultural critic and film historian whose books include Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, The Godfather Companion and Star: How Warren Beatty Seduced America. Between 1981 and 1986 Biskind was editor-in-chief of American Film magazine, and was executive editor of Premiere magazine from 1986 to 1996. His writing has appeared in publications including the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Rolling Stone and Sight and Sound. His latest book, Pandora\u2019s Box: The Greed, Lust, and Lies That Broke Television, explores the behind-the-screens story of the golden age of TV, from The Sopranos to streaming. 1. Film Anora (dir Sean Baker, 2024) Anora has got a lot of attention this year, and it won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, which Sean Baker dedicated to sex workers. It\u2019s a screwball comedy about a struggling stripper in Brooklyn, played by Mikey Madison, who is saved by the son of a Russian oligarch, named Ivan. Of course, her honeymoon with Ivan doesn\u2019t last, and she pays for her good fortune in several different ways. Baker is a singular talent, and his films deal with everyday people. He is also right to endorse theatres over streaming as the ideal place to show movies. 2. Book The Hunter by Tana French Tana French is known for her thrillers, but that doesn\u2019t begin to do her justice. The Hunter is really a novel set in Ireland, bursting with vivid, finely etched characters, that happens to revolve around a murder. It\u2019s about an American ex-cop called Cal who befriends a local girl and they repair furniture together. The girl is wonderfully described: she has very mixed feelings about her father, who\u2019s a wastrel, and she plays a big role in uncovering the murder. 3. Food Maine blueberries I\u2019m addicted to anything with blueberries, including blueberry pancakes, and pie stuffed with those tiny wild blueberries that Maine is famous for. Maine blueberries are just delicious, different from anywhere else. They have more flavour: blueberries that actually taste like blueberries are supposed to taste. There is also a blueberry crumb cake, courtesy of the New York Times cooking section, that I first tasted at the house of my friend Ruth Reichl, who\u2019s a foodie celebrity. You get a wonderful contrast between the crumbly top of the cake and soft inside. 4. Documentary Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat (dir Johan Grimonprez, 2024) This is a really interesting new documentary about the overthrow of Patrice Lumumba in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 60s, which nobody remembers, really. It\u2019s a thorough and engaging documentary, and I think an important one, because it throws light on the negative impact of the CIA on democratic regimes in that period, as well as the United Nations, which was dominated by the US and the CIA at that point. It\u2019s a real eye opener into cold war politics. 5. Place Santa Barbara It\u2019s in southern California, right on the ocean, and it\u2019s an incredibly picturesque, beautiful place \u2013 as close to heaven as you can get in the United States. I lived there, in the mountains, for three or four years in the mid-60s, when I was teaching English literature at UC Santa Barbara, at the University of California. It was right in the midst of the anti-war movement, so nobody was studying anything. That added to the drama of it all: the time that I lived there was extremely exciting. I haven\u2019t been back \u2013 it\u2019s wall-to-wall movie stars now. 6. TV Sally Wainwright I love anything by Sally Wainwright: Last Tango in Halifax, Happy Valley, Scott &amp; Bailey, and Gentleman Jack, with Suranne Jones, which HBO stupidly killed after two seasons. She\u2019s a wonderful writer, and Yorkshire is a great setting. Her shows focus on crimes, but it\u2019s not the crimes themselves that rivet viewers; rather, it\u2019s the vibrant, eccentric, complex characters who commit and suffer from them. And women are central to the shows, which is something we often don\u2019t find in thrillers.",

But after Giuliani <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/rudy-giuliani-court-surrender-assets\">missed that deadline</a>, he appeared in court on 7 November and Liman threatened to hold him in contempt.</p> <p>A jury previously ruled that Giuliani owes Freeman and Moss around $150m for spreading lies about them after the 2020 election though Giuliani is appealing the ruling. Liman authorized the two women to immediately begin selling the assets.</p> <p>\u201cThe road to justice for Ruby and Shaye has been long, but they have never wavered,\u201d Aaron Nathan, a lawyer representing Freeman and Moss, said in October. \u201cLast December, a jury delivered a powerful verdict in their favor, and we\u2019re proud that today\u2019s ruling makes that verdict a reality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are proud that our clients will finally begin to receive some of the compensation to which they are entitled for Giuliani\u2019s actions,\u201d said Nathan. \u201cThis outcome should send a powerful message that there is a price to pay for those who choose to intentionally spread disinformation.\u201d</p> <p>Giuliani was also ordered to turn over his apartment on the Upper East Side of New York and several items of Yankees memorabilia. The two women are also entitled to fees the Trump campaign owes Giuliani for his legal work in 2020.</p> <p>But in his letter, Cammarata argued that some of Giuliani\u2019s other possessions should be exempt from the judgment under New York and Florida law.</p> <p>That includes all apparel \u2013 even a shirt signed by New York Yankees legend Joe DiMaggio that is part of the judgment \u2013 and all household furniture, as well as a refrigerator, radio receiver, television set, computer, cellphone, tableware and cooking utensils, the letter stated.</p> <p>Representatives for Freeman and Moss said last week that they had visited Giuliani\u2019s Manhattan apartment only to discover it had been cleared out well before the October deadline. Giuliani <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/01/real-estate/rudy-giuliani-slashes-price-of-nyc-home-by-nearly-1m-in-last-ditch-bid/\">first listed</a> the three-bedroom apartment for $6.5m in 2023, but had cut the price to a little more than $5.1m this fall.</p> <p>Liman did not order Giuliani to turn over a separate Palm Beach condominium, for now, amid an ongoing legal dispute there. Liman instead entered an order barring Giuliani from selling the condo while that dispute is ongoing.</p> <p>After losing the defamation case last fall, Giuliani declared bankruptcy to try to avoid paying Freeman and Moss the money they were owed. A judge dismissed that bankruptcy case earlier this year.</p> <p>After the 2020 election, Giuliani amplified a misleading video and falsely accused Freeman and Moss of illegal activity while counting ballots in Atlanta on election night in 2020. He continued to do so even after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia\">Georgia</a> election officials said the video showed both women doing their jobs with no issue. They have also been formally cleared by investigators of any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The video and lie about the two women became central to Donald Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election results in Georgia. The ex-president mentioned Freeman by name on a phone call in 2021 with Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, asking him to overturn the vote.</p> <p>Both women have rarely been seen in public since the incident, but have spoken about how it has upended their lives. They received constant death threats, were chased from their homes and lost their jobs. During the defamation trial in Washington DC, they spoke about the depression they faced after the election.</p> <p>Giuliani, who lost his law license in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> and Washington DC, has shown little regret for his false statements. During the trial, he gave a press conference on the courthouse steps in which he insisted everything he said about Freeman and Moss was true.</p> <p>Cammarata, in his Friday letter, also asked to delay Giuliani\u2019s January trial over the disposition of some of his assets so that he can attend president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p> <p>Giuliani has claimed he was the victim of a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d and expects to win on appeal and get back all his possessions.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2024 to clarify that Rudy Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, is from the law firm Cammarata &amp; De Meyer PC. </p>",

Liman authorized the two women to immediately begin selling the assets. \u201cThe road to justice for Ruby and Shaye has been long, but they have never wavered,\u201d Aaron Nathan, a lawyer representing Freeman and Moss, said in October. \u201cLast December, a jury delivered a powerful verdict in their favor, and we\u2019re proud that today\u2019s ruling makes that verdict a reality.\u201d \u201cWe are proud that our clients will finally begin to receive some of the compensation to which they are entitled for Giuliani\u2019s actions,\u201d said Nathan. \u201cThis outcome should send a powerful message that there is a price to pay for those who choose to intentionally spread disinformation.\u201d Giuliani was also ordered to turn over his apartment on the Upper East Side of New York and several items of Yankees memorabilia. The two women are also entitled to fees the Trump campaign owes Giuliani for his legal work in 2020. But in his letter, Cammarata argued that some of Giuliani\u2019s other possessions should be exempt from the judgment under New York and Florida law. That includes all apparel \u2013 even a shirt signed by New York Yankees legend Joe DiMaggio that is part of the judgment \u2013 and all household furniture, as well as a refrigerator, radio receiver, television set, computer, cellphone, tableware and cooking utensils, the letter stated. Representatives for Freeman and Moss said last week that they had visited Giuliani\u2019s Manhattan apartment only to discover it had been cleared out well before the October deadline. Giuliani first listed the three-bedroom apartment for $6.5m in 2023, but had cut the price to a little more than $5.1m this fall. Liman did not order Giuliani to turn over a separate Palm Beach condominium, for now, amid an ongoing legal dispute there. Liman instead entered an order barring Giuliani from selling the condo while that dispute is ongoing. After losing the defamation case last fall, Giuliani declared bankruptcy to try to avoid paying Freeman and Moss the money they were owed. A judge dismissed that bankruptcy case earlier this year. After the 2020 election, Giuliani amplified a misleading video and falsely accused Freeman and Moss of illegal activity while counting ballots in Atlanta on election night in 2020. He continued to do so even after Georgia election officials said the video showed both women doing their jobs with no issue. They have also been formally cleared by investigators of any wrongdoing. The video and lie about the two women became central to Donald Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election results in Georgia. The ex-president mentioned Freeman by name on a phone call in 2021 with Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, asking him to overturn the vote. Both women have rarely been seen in public since the incident, but have spoken about how it has upended their lives. They received constant death threats, were chased from their homes and lost their jobs. During the defamation trial in Washington DC, they spoke about the depression they faced after the election. Giuliani, who lost his law license in New York and Washington DC, has shown little regret for his false statements. During the trial, he gave a press conference on the courthouse steps in which he insisted everything he said about Freeman and Moss was true. Cammarata, in his Friday letter, also asked to delay Giuliani\u2019s January trial over the disposition of some of his assets so that he can attend president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Giuliani has claimed he was the victim of a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d and expects to win on appeal and get back all his possessions. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2024 to clarify that Rudy Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, is from the law firm Cammarata &amp; De Meyer PC.",

If she was alive today she would be campaigning to stop what has become a national disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>The discharges are revealed in a new analysis which shows that seven United Utilities sewage plants and pumping stations in the Lake District \u2013 including a station estimated in a BBC report last month to have pumped 140 million litres of waste into Windermere in three years \u2013 are alleged to have illegally spilled on 501 days from 2018 to 2023.

It has written to the Environment Agency, urging it to order United Utilities to prevent further damage.</p> <p>Keir Starmer said before the general election that he was sickened by the reports of raw sewage blighting Windermere. Campaigners now want the prime minister to back an ambitious infrastructure project to end the discharges into England\u2019s largest natural lake. A similar project at Lake Annecy in France in the 1960s and 1970s saw it transformed into one of the cleanest lakes in Europe. United Utilities estimated in a report in February that a similar scheme at Windermere could cost up to \u00a36.4bn.</p> <p>Windermere is regularly blighted by blue-green algae, partly fuelled by discharges of untreated sewage and warmer weather. Agricultural and urban runoff also contribute to pollution. The algae can be toxic, and also suck up oxygen in the water, suffocating fish and other aquatic life.</p>    <p>Tony Coldwell, 67, a cinematographer from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, who was sailing on Windermere last week, said he had also visited Annecy after it was transformed by the scheme to prevent sewage discharges. \u201cWindermere should be as good as Annecy, which is crystal clear,\u201d he said. \u201cUnited Utilities has been taking the money for shareholders and not putting it into the lake. It\u2019s a major scandal.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Taylor, 59, from Grasmere, who also sails on Windermere, was shocked at the algae blooms on the water in early November. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it at this time of year like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are basically paying the water company to pollute the lake.\u201d</p> <p>Hayley Leece, 42, a wild swimmer who lives in Ambleside, said she went swimming recently and found the lake was covered in algae bloom. \u201cIt was disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see the algae swirling around&nbsp;me.\u201d</p>    <p>Environment Agency officials say that key pollutants in Windermere have declined since the 1990s, but more work needs to be done to tackle all sources of pollution. The agency works in the Love Windermere partnership, which aims \u201cto bring about a healthier future for the lake\u201d. More than half of the phosphorus in Windermere comes from sewage from United Utilities and private sewage works, <a href=\"https://environmentagency.blog.gov.uk/2024/05/24/environment-agency-explains-that-pollution-in-windermere-is-reducing-but-more-needs-to-be-done-to-tackle-all-sources-of-pollution-not-just-sewage/\">according to the agency.</a></p> <p>The latest analysis by Hammond, a former professor of computational biology, has found that four sewage treatment works and three pumping stations are suspected of breaching permits on 501 days from 2018 to 2023 by discharging raw sewage. Some of the data was withheld, with the firm citing potential prejudice to ongoing Ofwat and Environment Agency investigations.</p> <p>Hammond\u2019s work is criticised by United Utilities for being based on \u201cassumptions\u201d. Hammond said: \u201cOfwat recently cited my analysis extensively in notices for enforcement orders and financial penalties on Thames Water and Yorkshire Water. My analysis uses actual water company records and is published online for all to see. United Utilities has never published any analysis in rebuttal.\u201d</p> <p>United Utilities has refused to disclose data on phosphorus monitoring at Windermere waste water treatment works and other data from the Near Sawrey plant. It is appealing against rulings by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office to disclose the&nbsp;data.</p>    <p>Responding to the findings in the latest analysis, Staniek said: \u201cThis shows the exploitation of England\u2019s largest lake, which has been used by United Utilities as an open sewer to dump untreated sewage.\u201d Staniek said he was concerned that treated sewage was as much of a threat as untreated sewage to the ecology of the lake, and it was vital that United Utilities provided open access to environmental data.</p> <p>United Utilities has announced nearly \u00a3200m of funding to improve and protect water quality at Windermere. It will improve treatment processes at wastewater plants and invest in improved storm overflows to reduce spills.</p> <p>Campaigners believe a more radical solution is required, and want an end to all discharges of raw sewage and effluent. Stanley Root, who has studied successfulenvironmental improvement projects at Lake Annecy and Lake Washington, near Seattle, said a piecemeal approach was \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d.</p> <p>Root said a major infrastructure project to divert sewage flows would be worth the investment. \u201cA crystal-clear Windermere would produce enormous long-term benefits,\u201d he said.</p>    <p>The Environment Agency said: \u201cWe are currently conducting several investigations into pollution-related incidents in and around Windermere. We remain absolutely committed to improving the water quality in Windermere. Progress is being made, with recent improvements to sewage treatment works leading to a fall in phosphorus input by approximately 30% since 2020.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cThis government will never look the other way while water companies pump record levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas \u2013 and that includes the iconic Windermere.\u201d The spokesperson said the government had introduced a water (special measures) bill to strengthen regulation and launched the largest review of the water sector since privatisation.</p> <p>A United Utilities spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand people\u2019s concerns about the operation of storm overflows and we are already significantly reducing their use, alongside proposing the largest environmental investment in a century across the north-west over the next five years.</p> <p>\u201cIn Windermere, we have so far invested \u00a375m in upgrading wastewater treatment sites and pumping stations and have proposed a further investment of \u00a3200m over the next five years to tackle and reduce spills from all storm overflows in the catchment.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to work with all organisations and individuals that impact water quality in the lake to help deliver the step change we all want to see.\u201d</p> <p>The firm said the Near Sawrey works, and another nearby plant, only served 370 people, and both operated in line with environmental permits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/16/united-utilities-refuses-to-hand-over-data-on-sewage-discharges-into-windermere\">United Utilities refuses to hand over data on sewage discharges into Windermere</a> </p> </aside>",

      "bodyText": "A short stroll from Beatrix Potter\u2019s former farmhouse in the Lake District are the waters of Cunsey Beck, nestling in the breathtaking landscape that inspired the tales of childhood favourites Jeremy Fisher and Jemima Puddle-Duck. Campaigners say the once clear waters are regularly blighted by raw sewage from a nearby works. New figures obtained by the Observer reveal the Near Sawrey plant is alleged to have illegally discharged untreated sewage on 56 days from 2021 to 2023. Matt Staniek, from the campaign group Save Windermere, said: \u201cBeatrix Potter was in awe of this natural landscape. If she was alive today she would be campaigning to stop what has become a national disgrace.\u201d The discharges are revealed in a new analysis which shows that seven United Utilities sewage plants and pumping stations in the Lake District \u2013 including a station estimated in a BBC report last month to have pumped 140 million litres of waste into Windermere in three years \u2013 are alleged to have illegally spilled on 501 days from 2018 to 2023. The analysis by expert Peter Hammond is based on data obtained from United Utilities and the Environment Agency by Save Windermere and the Windrush Against Sewage Pollution campaign. Hundreds of fish were reported killed in a pollution incident at Cunsey Beck in June 2022, but the Environment Agency failed to identify a definitive cause in what was later found to be a seriously flawed investigation. The charity WildFish reported in September that sewage pollution at Cunsey Beck was causing the stream to deteriorate. It has written to the Environment Agency, urging it to order United Utilities to prevent further damage. Keir Starmer said before the general election that he was sickened by the reports of raw sewage blighting Windermere. Campaigners now want the prime minister to back an ambitious infrastructure project to end the discharges into England\u2019s largest natural lake. A similar project at Lake Annecy in France in the 1960s and 1970s saw it transformed into one of the cleanest lakes in Europe. United Utilities estimated in a report in February that a similar scheme at Windermere could cost up to \u00a36.4bn. Windermere is regularly blighted by blue-green algae, partly fuelled by discharges of untreated sewage and warmer weather. Agricultural and urban runoff also contribute to pollution. The algae can be toxic, and also suck up oxygen in the water, suffocating fish and other aquatic life. Tony Coldwell, 67, a cinematographer from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, who was sailing on Windermere last week, said he had also visited Annecy after it was transformed by the scheme to prevent sewage discharges. \u201cWindermere should be as good as Annecy, which is crystal clear,\u201d he said. \u201cUnited Utilities has been taking the money for shareholders and not putting it into the lake. It\u2019s a major scandal.\u201d Chris Taylor, 59, from Grasmere, who also sails on Windermere, was shocked at the algae blooms on the water in early November. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it at this time of year like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are basically paying the water company to pollute the lake.\u201d Hayley Leece, 42, a wild swimmer who lives in Ambleside, said she went swimming recently and found the lake was covered in algae bloom. \u201cIt was disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see the algae swirling around me.\u201d Environment Agency officials say that key pollutants in Windermere have declined since the 1990s, but more work needs to be done to tackle all sources of pollution. The agency works in the Love Windermere partnership, which aims \u201cto bring about a healthier future for the lake\u201d. More than half of the phosphorus in Windermere comes from sewage from United Utilities and private sewage works, according to the agency. The latest analysis by Hammond, a former professor of computational biology, has found that four sewage treatment works and three pumping stations are suspected of breaching permits on 501 days from 2018 to 2023 by discharging raw sewage. Some of the data was withheld, with the firm citing potential prejudice to ongoing Ofwat and Environment Agency investigations. Hammond\u2019s work is criticised by United Utilities for being based on \u201cassumptions\u201d. Hammond said: \u201cOfwat recently cited my analysis extensively in notices for enforcement orders and financial penalties on Thames Water and Yorkshire Water. My analysis uses actual water company records and is published online for all to see. United Utilities has never published any analysis in rebuttal.\u201d United Utilities has refused to disclose data on phosphorus monitoring at Windermere waste water treatment works and other data from the Near Sawrey plant. It is appealing against rulings by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office to disclose the data. Responding to the findings in the latest analysis, Staniek said: \u201cThis shows the exploitation of England\u2019s largest lake, which has been used by United Utilities as an open sewer to dump untreated sewage.\u201d Staniek said he was concerned that treated sewage was as much of a threat as untreated sewage to the ecology of the lake, and it was vital that United Utilities provided open access to environmental data. United Utilities has announced nearly \u00a3200m of funding to improve and protect water quality at Windermere. It will improve treatment processes at wastewater plants and invest in improved storm overflows to reduce spills. Campaigners believe a more radical solution is required, and want an end to all discharges of raw sewage and effluent. Stanley Root, who has studied successfulenvironmental improvement projects at Lake Annecy and Lake Washington, near Seattle, said a piecemeal approach was \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d. Root said a major infrastructure project to divert sewage flows would be worth the investment. \u201cA crystal-clear Windermere would produce enormous long-term benefits,\u201d he said. The Environment Agency said: \u201cWe are currently conducting several investigations into pollution-related incidents in and around Windermere. We remain absolutely committed to improving the water quality in Windermere. Progress is being made, with recent improvements to sewage treatment works leading to a fall in phosphorus input by approximately 30% since 2020.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cThis government will never look the other way while water companies pump record levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas \u2013 and that includes the iconic Windermere.\u201d The spokesperson said the government had introduced a water (special measures) bill to strengthen regulation and launched the largest review of the water sector since privatisation. A United Utilities spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand people\u2019s concerns about the operation of storm overflows and we are already significantly reducing their use, alongside proposing the largest environmental investment in a century across the north-west over the next five years. \u201cIn Windermere, we have so far invested \u00a375m in upgrading wastewater treatment sites and pumping stations and have proposed a further investment of \u00a3200m over the next five years to tackle and reduce spills from all storm overflows in the catchment. \u201cWe continue to work with all organisations and individuals that impact water quality in the lake to help deliver the step change we all want to see.\u201d The firm said the Near Sawrey works, and another nearby plant, only served 370 people, and both operated in line with environmental permits.",

      "body": "<p>The year that Disney debuted the first Black Disney princess, Quiana Moore-Glenn was 21. She was juggling two jobs and applying to culinary school, and she found Disney\u2019s new princess unexpectedly relatable: her name was Tiana, she was Creole, and she started her fairytale as an aspiring restaurant owner working multiple jobs in 1920s New Orleans.</p> <p>\u201cIt reminded me so much of me,\u201d said Moore-Glenn, now 37.</p> <p>This month, the Detroit resident is dealing with the aftermath of an election in which US voters rejected the chance to elect the nation\u2019s first Black female president. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, clearly,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But Moore-Glenn and her Disney fan friends are celebrating a small milestone this week: inside Disney\u2019s Fantasyland, Tiana, the hardworking princess, is finally getting a promotion.</p> <p>In 2020, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd\u2019s murder, Disney had announced that its parks would be \u201cretheming\u201d an iconic, decades-old attraction: Splash Mountain, a log-flume ride with a storyline drawn from a deeply racist 1946 film.</p> <p>The updated ride would be \u201cinclusive\u201d, a Disney spokesperson pledged at the time, with a concept that \u201cspeaks to the diversity of the millions of people who visit our parks\u201d.</p> <p>This week, Disneyland held a glamorous launch for the rebranded ride, which is now Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Anika Noni Rose, the original voice of Princess Tiana, serenaded the California<strong> </strong>crowd from a Disneyland steamboat, fireworks exploding in the sky above her.</p> <p>The ride is Disney\u2019s \u201cfirst attraction that is based on a Black character as a main driver of the narrative\u201d, said Bethanee Bemis, a historian who studies how <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Disney-Theme-Parks-and-Americas-National-Narratives-Mirror-Mirror-for-Us-All/Bemis/p/book/9781032294988\">Disney theme parks</a> reflect the nation\u2019s identity. The new ride has drawn some praise from both fans and scholars for the way it spotlights Black artists, and how Disney\u2019s imagineers used the smallest details of the ride to tell a very different kind of story about Black New Orleans history. (Disney World launched its version of the ride in June.)</p>    <p>When Disney made the announcement that the parks would be dedicating a ride to Tiana, \u201cI was like, it\u2019s about time,\u201d said Chazlyn Stunson, a 23-year-old content creator who attended a Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure launch event on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Tiana, the heroine of The Princess and the Frog, is a waitress in 1920s New Orleans who, with the help of her bayou creature sidekicks and a voodoo priestess fairy godmother, ends up marrying a prince. Her story is inspired in part by a real New Orleans icon, the restaurateur Leah Chase, the \u201cqueen of Creole cuisine\u201d.</p> <p>Stunson was seven years old when The Princess and the Frog came out, and she remembers the film as \u201csuch a big deal\u201d both to her, and to her parents. \u201cLittle Black girls deserve to see themselves as Disney princesses,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>\u2018You are the people who kept Tiana alive\u2019</h2> <p>It had taken Disney until 2009, a full year after the United States elected its first Black president, to debut its first animated Black Disney princess. The film met with some criticism \u2013 including questions about why the first Black princess spent the majority of her film as a frog \u2013 but it also generated plenty of fans, who call Tiana \u201cthe people\u2019s princess\u201d.</p> <p>Fans see Tiana as more compelling than some earlier Disney royalty, like Sleeping Beauty. She\u2019s \u201cthe first entrepreneur-princess\u201d, as Natazsa Roby-Smith, 35, a former Disney cast member from Orlando, Florida, put it.</p>    <p>Black girls who had once felt they had to choose between dressing up as Jasmine or Pocahontas for Halloween now had an African American princess who looked just like them, several fans said.</p> <p>But even once Tiana became an official Disney princess, her role in the Disney pantheon stayed somewhat marginal, fans said. (Disney did not respond to a request for comment.)</p> <p>Roby-Smith recalls noticing how other, more recent Disney animated franchises, like Frozen and Tangled, had seemed to inspire theme park rides or huge cascades of merchandise, while her princess did not.</p> <p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t really represented at the parks, and I wanted her to be,\u201d said Phylicia Hubbard, a Disney content creator from Long Beach, California. Hubbard and other fans kept the flame alive, posting themed photographs on \u201cTiana Tuesdays\u201d and making it clear they were interested in more than a \u201csprinkle of merch\u201d.</p> <p>Even Rose, the voice of Tiana, told Disney fans at the D23 fan conference this summer that she had once believed the story of the people\u2019s princess had been consigned to the Disney archives.</p> <p>\u201cI thought we were done,\u201d Rose told the summer crowd, which included many Black women. \u201cYou all are the people who kept Tiana alive \u2026 that\u2019s why, 15 years later, we have a ride, and we have a restaurant, and we have a rebirth.\u201d</p> <h2>From Song of the South to Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure</h2> <p>Disney\u2019s announcement that it was rebranding Splash Mountain had faced plenty of controversy and backlash in 2020, from both Disney fans and commentators who did not want to accept that a theme park ride they loved could have a racist backstory.</p> <p>Song of the South, the mixed live-action and animated film that inspired the ride, had not been reissued by Disney since 1986, but the ugly stereotypes behind the ride\u2019s cute-animal storyline were far from obvious to many riders. Still, there was no question about the racism of the source material: Song of the South was denounced at the time of its 1946 premiere for popularizing a dangerously rosy view of American slavery, and the film sparked protests and boycotts across multiple US cities, with protesters carrying signs like: \u201cWe fought for Uncle Sam, not Uncle Tom.\u201d</p> <p>The film was a \u201cnostalgic fantasy of an plantation era American South\u201d, and its main character, Uncle Remus, was \u201cthe archetypical magical Negro figure\u201d, said Jason Sperb, the author of Disney\u2019s Most Notorious Film. The comical cartoon animals that ended up in Splash Mountain were based on a white author\u2019s rewriting of stories told by enslaved people in the South \u2013 stories that were also parables about slavery itself.</p> <p>More than three decades after Splash Mountain debuted in 1989, there were plenty of sound economic reasons to refresh the attraction and tie it to a more recent, and popular, film franchise, which Disney is constantly doing with many of its rides, Sperb said: \u201cThat\u2019s what it all comes down to: where is the profit?\u201d</p> <p>By March 2020, Disney CEO Bob Iger had told Disney shareholders that Song of the South \u201ceven with a disclaimer, was just not appropriate in today\u2019s world\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The year that Disney debuted the first Black Disney princess, Quiana Moore-Glenn was 21. She was juggling two jobs and applying to culinary school, and she found Disney\u2019s new princess unexpectedly relatable: her name was Tiana, she was Creole, and she started her fairytale as an aspiring restaurant owner working multiple jobs in 1920s New Orleans. \u201cIt reminded me so much of me,\u201d said Moore-Glenn, now 37. This month, the Detroit resident is dealing with the aftermath of an election in which US voters rejected the chance to elect the nation\u2019s first Black female president. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, clearly,\u201d she said. But Moore-Glenn and her Disney fan friends are celebrating a small milestone this week: inside Disney\u2019s Fantasyland, Tiana, the hardworking princess, is finally getting a promotion. In 2020, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd\u2019s murder, Disney had announced that its parks would be \u201cretheming\u201d an iconic, decades-old attraction: Splash Mountain, a log-flume ride with a storyline drawn from a deeply racist 1946 film. The updated ride would be \u201cinclusive\u201d, a Disney spokesperson pledged at the time, with a concept that \u201cspeaks to the diversity of the millions of people who visit our parks\u201d. This week, Disneyland held a glamorous launch for the rebranded ride, which is now Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure. On Wednesday, Anika Noni Rose, the original voice of Princess Tiana, serenaded the California crowd from a Disneyland steamboat, fireworks exploding in the sky above her. The ride is Disney\u2019s \u201cfirst attraction that is based on a Black character as a main driver of the narrative\u201d, said Bethanee Bemis, a historian who studies how Disney theme parks reflect the nation\u2019s identity. The new ride has drawn some praise from both fans and scholars for the way it spotlights Black artists, and how Disney\u2019s imagineers used the smallest details of the ride to tell a very different kind of story about Black New Orleans history. (Disney World launched its version of the ride in June.) When Disney made the announcement that the parks would be dedicating a ride to Tiana, \u201cI was like, it\u2019s about time,\u201d said Chazlyn Stunson, a 23-year-old content creator who attended a Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure launch event on Wednesday night. Tiana, the heroine of The Princess and the Frog, is a waitress in 1920s New Orleans who, with the help of her bayou creature sidekicks and a voodoo priestess fairy godmother, ends up marrying a prince. Her story is inspired in part by a real New Orleans icon, the restaurateur Leah Chase, the \u201cqueen of Creole cuisine\u201d. Stunson was seven years old when The Princess and the Frog came out, and she remembers the film as \u201csuch a big deal\u201d both to her, and to her parents. \u201cLittle Black girls deserve to see themselves as Disney princesses,\u201d she said. \u2018You are the people who kept Tiana alive\u2019 It had taken Disney until 2009, a full year after the United States elected its first Black president, to debut its first animated Black Disney princess. The film met with some criticism \u2013 including questions about why the first Black princess spent the majority of her film as a frog \u2013 but it also generated plenty of fans, who call Tiana \u201cthe people\u2019s princess\u201d. Fans see Tiana as more compelling than some earlier Disney royalty, like Sleeping Beauty. She\u2019s \u201cthe first entrepreneur-princess\u201d, as Natazsa Roby-Smith, 35, a former Disney cast member from Orlando, Florida, put it. Black girls who had once felt they had to choose between dressing up as Jasmine or Pocahontas for Halloween now had an African American princess who looked just like them, several fans said. But even once Tiana became an official Disney princess, her role in the Disney pantheon stayed somewhat marginal, fans said. (Disney did not respond to a request for comment.) Roby-Smith recalls noticing how other, more recent Disney animated franchises, like Frozen and Tangled, had seemed to inspire theme park rides or huge cascades of merchandise, while her princess did not. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t really represented at the parks, and I wanted her to be,\u201d said Phylicia Hubbard, a Disney content creator from Long Beach, California. Hubbard and other fans kept the flame alive, posting themed photographs on \u201cTiana Tuesdays\u201d and making it clear they were interested in more than a \u201csprinkle of merch\u201d. Even Rose, the voice of Tiana, told Disney fans at the D23 fan conference this summer that she had once believed the story of the people\u2019s princess had been consigned to the Disney archives. \u201cI thought we were done,\u201d Rose told the summer crowd, which included many Black women. \u201cYou all are the people who kept Tiana alive \u2026 that\u2019s why, 15 years later, we have a ride, and we have a restaurant, and we have a rebirth.\u201d From Song of the South to Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure Disney\u2019s announcement that it was rebranding Splash Mountain had faced plenty of controversy and backlash in 2020, from both Disney fans and commentators who did not want to accept that a theme park ride they loved could have a racist backstory. Song of the South, the mixed live-action and animated film that inspired the ride, had not been reissued by Disney since 1986, but the ugly stereotypes behind the ride\u2019s cute-animal storyline were far from obvious to many riders. Still, there was no question about the racism of the source material: Song of the South was denounced at the time of its 1946 premiere for popularizing a dangerously rosy view of American slavery, and the film sparked protests and boycotts across multiple US cities, with protesters carrying signs like: \u201cWe fought for Uncle Sam, not Uncle Tom.\u201d The film was a \u201cnostalgic fantasy of an plantation era American South\u201d, and its main character, Uncle Remus, was \u201cthe archetypical magical Negro figure\u201d, said Jason Sperb, the author of Disney\u2019s Most Notorious Film. The comical cartoon animals that ended up in Splash Mountain were based on a white author\u2019s rewriting of stories told by enslaved people in the South \u2013 stories that were also parables about slavery itself. More than three decades after Splash Mountain debuted in 1989, there were plenty of sound economic reasons to refresh the attraction and tie it to a more recent, and popular, film franchise, which Disney is constantly doing with many of its rides, Sperb said: \u201cThat\u2019s what it all comes down to: where is the profit?\u201d By March 2020, Disney CEO Bob Iger had told Disney shareholders that Song of the South \u201ceven with a disclaimer, was just not appropriate in today\u2019s world\u201d. By that point, the internal work on a new version of the ride was already reportedly under way. But some fans pushed back when Disney publicly announced the rebranding of Splash Mountain in June 2020, at a moment when many corporations and other institutions were struggling to respond to nationwide Black Lives Matter protests. Some Americans bristled at the idea that a theme park ride they had enjoyed could be labeled racist, Bemis, the theme park historian, said. \u201cPeople felt like they were losing something that they enjoyed based on a history they didn\u2019t understand, and there was a fear that the replacement attraction wouldn\u2019t bring them the same feelings of enjoyment,\u201d she said. Four years later, though, Disney fans and others appear to have moved on, Bemis said. The biggest controversy that rightwing outlets like the New York Post and Fox News have been able to stir up about Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure so far is that the new splash ride is \u201ctoo wet\u201d. In some ways, Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure is not that different from Splash Mountain: riders float in a log boat through indoor and outdoor landscapes, meeting animatronic characters while Disney songs play. \u201cWhat has changed is the story of the ride and the perspective from which it is told,\u201d Bemis said earlier this year. \u201cIn this case, that makes all the difference.\u201d The lead Disney imagineer on Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure, Charita Carter, worked her way from the Disney accounting department to becoming the first African American female executive producer of Walt Disney imagineering, Forbes reported in 2022. (Disney did not respond to requests for an interview with Carter.) Carter has spoken publicly about how she \u201cfelt the weight\u201d of making the first Black princess ride, and making sure itfelt authentic and resonated across Disney\u2019s audiences. At Disney\u2019s fan event this summer, Carter explained how her team did intensive research in New Orleans, including meeting with Leah Chase\u2019s family at their celebrated Dooky Chase restaurant and working with New Orleans artists like the muralist Sharika Mahdi and the blacksmith Darryl Reeves. The new ride is full of small tributes to African American history, like mementos that speak to Tiana\u2019s father\u2019s military service, and descriptions of Tiana\u2019s New Orleans food company as a \u201cworker-owned cooperative\u201d. The experience also panders to the fandom with \u201ctwo new looks for Tiana\u201d, Carter told Disney fans this summer. Roby-Smith, who has already adopted one of those new outfits into her Tiana costume repertoire, rode Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure for the first time this summer in Orlando, and said she found the experience \u201cvery emotional\u201d. \u201cIt was very heartwarming to see Disney fix their wrongs, and make something beautiful and better,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<h2>Have rumours of a US sex strike been greatly exaggerated?</h2> <p>Sex sells. Sex strikes, meanwhile, make for an irresistible headline. Ever since Donald Trump overwhelmingly won the election, there have been endless headlines about how American women are emulating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/15/4b-south-korea-feminist-movement-donald-trump-election-backlash\">South Korea\u2019s fringe 4B movement</a> (which encourages heterosexual women not to date, procreate, marry or have sex with men) and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-election-sex-men-misogyny-feminism\">swearing off sex with men</a>\u201d in protest.</p> <p>\u201cA Sex Strike Is a Losing Strategy for American Women,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/opinion/4b-movement-south-korea-trump.html\">a recent op-ed</a> in the New York Times proclaimed, for example.</p> <p>\u201cNo sex. No dating. No marriage. No children. Interest grows in 4B movement to swear off men,\u201d a <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/no-sex-no-dating-no-marriage-no-children-interest-grows-in-4b-movement-to-swear-off-men\">PBS headline declared</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAhead of Trump\u2019s Second Term, Calls for a Sex Strike Grow Online,\u201d the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/4b_movement_online_feminism_trump_media.php\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly true that there has been a spike in US interest in the 4B movement. Voluntary celibacy was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/21/celibacy-hetrosexual-women-boysober-4b-sex-positive-feminism\">growing in popularity</a> long before the election but Trump\u2019s victory gave it a huge boost. There <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/4b_movement_online_feminism_trump_media.php\">are more than 100,000 videos</a> about 4B on TikTok and there has been a surge in Google searches relating to it. There have also been various viral calls for women to withhold sex in order to protest against Trump. (Just in case you\u2019re wondering if you have a severe case of deja vu, there were also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/alyssa-milano-sex-strike-protest-republican-abortion-bans\">calls for a sex strike</a> during Trump\u2019s first term.)</p> <p>But is this online chatter actually translating to offline action? It doesn\u2019t seem that way yet. There is <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/11/15/are-american-women-really-going-on-a-sex-strike/#:~:text=Are%20women%20really%20taking%20a,to%20think%20it%20ever%20will.\">zero evidence</a> that there are large-scale sex strikes protesting against Trump happening in the US. All the hand-wringing by the likes of the New York Times seems to be over something that doesn\u2019t actually exist. The headlines treating women as some sort of monolith also obscure the fact that, according to AP VoteCast, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/votecast/\">53% of white women</a> voted for Trump this year.</p> <p>Still, that doesn\u2019t mean that growing interest in 4B should be written off as some sort of meaningless fad. On the contrary, engagement with the movement points to the fact that many women are not taking Trump\u2019s victory lying down. While there may be no proof of widespread strikes in the sheets, there have been plenty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/womens-march-nationwide-rally\">demonstrations on the streets</a>. Meanwhile, online sales of emergency contraceptives and abortion pills are rocketing before the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/abortion-pills-hormones-trump\">reproductive apocalypse</a>\u201d that will be Trump\u2019s second term. With rights being rolled back and pregnancy growing increasingly dangerous in the US, women are also reconsidering whether they <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/11/women-having-children-trump-win\">want to have children</a>.</p> <p>Let\u2019s say that sex strikes did actually take off, however. Might they be effective? The most famous sex strike certainly was. In the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata by Aristophanes, women withhold sex in an attempt to end the Peloponnesian war and the ruse pays off: peace is declared. Since then, there have been plenty of other real-world sex strikes with varying results, waged everywhere from Belgium to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-15215312\">Liberia</a>. A small town in Colombia held a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/01/colombia-crossed-legs-sex-strike\">crossed legs</a>\u201d protest in 2011, for example; women refused sex with their husbands until the government paved a road linking their town to the rest of the province. The protest is widely considered to have been successful.</p> <p>Less headline-worthy forms of protest, however, tend to be rather more effective. This, by the way, is the rather less talked-about message in Lysistrata itself. As the cultural critic and classicist Helen Morales told the Guardian back in 2022, the play isn\u2019t just about sex strikes: \u201cThere are elder women seizing control of the treasury and the younger women withdraw their unpaid labour at home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/04/do-sex-strikes-ever-work-we-ask-an-expert\">They\u2019re much more a model for effecting political change.</a>\u201d</p> <h2>How the Taliban are erasing Afghanistan\u2019s women \u2013 photo essay</h2> <p>\u201cIt was important for us to look beyond the traditional representations of Afghan women as passive victims of the Taliban and show them as active players in their own lives,\u201d say journalist M\u00e9lissa Cornet and photographer Kiana Hayeri <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/14/women-girls-afghanistan-taliban-repression-interviewed-photographed-100-afghan-women\">in this piece for the Guardian</a>.</p> <h2>Argentina votes alone against UN resolution combating misogynistic online violence</h2> <p>Which is not a huge surprise as Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei is incredibly rightwing and a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/americas/argentina-un-resolution-women-girls-intl-latam/index.html\">vocal critic of the UN</a>.</p> <h2>Gender-fluid Mary, Queen of Scots ballet to debut at Edinburgh festival 2025</h2> <p>It\u2019s the latest example of a trend of gender-neutral casting in artistic productions.

      "bodyText": "Have rumours of a US sex strike been greatly exaggerated? Sex sells. Sex strikes, meanwhile, make for an irresistible headline. Ever since Donald Trump overwhelmingly won the election, there have been endless headlines about how American women are emulating South Korea\u2019s fringe 4B movement (which encourages heterosexual women not to date, procreate, marry or have sex with men) and \u201cswearing off sex with men\u201d in protest. \u201cA Sex Strike Is a Losing Strategy for American Women,\u201d a recent op-ed in the New York Times proclaimed, for example. \u201cNo sex. No dating. No marriage. No children. Interest grows in 4B movement to swear off men,\u201d a PBS headline declared. \u201cAhead of Trump\u2019s Second Term, Calls for a Sex Strike Grow Online,\u201d the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) wrote. It\u2019s certainly true that there has been a spike in US interest in the 4B movement. Voluntary celibacy was growing in popularity long before the election but Trump\u2019s victory gave it a huge boost. There are more than 100,000 videos about 4B on TikTok and there has been a surge in Google searches relating to it. There have also been various viral calls for women to withhold sex in order to protest against Trump. (Just in case you\u2019re wondering if you have a severe case of deja vu, there were also calls for a sex strike during Trump\u2019s first term.) But is this online chatter actually translating to offline action? It doesn\u2019t seem that way yet. There is zero evidence that there are large-scale sex strikes protesting against Trump happening in the US. All the hand-wringing by the likes of the New York Times seems to be over something that doesn\u2019t actually exist. The headlines treating women as some sort of monolith also obscure the fact that, according to AP VoteCast, 53% of white women voted for Trump this year. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean that growing interest in 4B should be written off as some sort of meaningless fad. On the contrary, engagement with the movement points to the fact that many women are not taking Trump\u2019s victory lying down. While there may be no proof of widespread strikes in the sheets, there have been plenty of demonstrations on the streets. Meanwhile, online sales of emergency contraceptives and abortion pills are rocketing before the \u201creproductive apocalypse\u201d that will be Trump\u2019s second term. With rights being rolled back and pregnancy growing increasingly dangerous in the US, women are also reconsidering whether they want to have children. Let\u2019s say that sex strikes did actually take off, however. Might they be effective? The most famous sex strike certainly was. In the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata by Aristophanes, women withhold sex in an attempt to end the Peloponnesian war and the ruse pays off: peace is declared. Since then, there have been plenty of other real-world sex strikes with varying results, waged everywhere from Belgium to Liberia. A small town in Colombia held a \u201ccrossed legs\u201d protest in 2011, for example; women refused sex with their husbands until the government paved a road linking their town to the rest of the province. The protest is widely considered to have been successful. Less headline-worthy forms of protest, however, tend to be rather more effective. This, by the way, is the rather less talked-about message in Lysistrata itself. As the cultural critic and classicist Helen Morales told the Guardian back in 2022, the play isn\u2019t just about sex strikes: \u201cThere are elder women seizing control of the treasury and the younger women withdraw their unpaid labour at home. They\u2019re much more a model for effecting political change.\u201d How the Taliban are erasing Afghanistan\u2019s women \u2013 photo essay \u201cIt was important for us to look beyond the traditional representations of Afghan women as passive victims of the Taliban and show them as active players in their own lives,\u201d say journalist M\u00e9lissa Cornet and photographer Kiana Hayeri in this piece for the Guardian. Argentina votes alone against UN resolution combating misogynistic online violence Which is not a huge surprise as Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei is incredibly rightwing and a vocal critic of the UN. Gender-fluid Mary, Queen of Scots ballet to debut at Edinburgh festival 2025 It\u2019s the latest example of a trend of gender-neutral casting in artistic productions. You can guarantee that this will drive the usual suspects completely bonkers. Armie Hammer\u2019s mother gifted him a vasectomy for his birthday The disgraced actor, who has been accused of sexual abuse by multiple women, has returned to public life via a podcast. He seems to be having trouble rustling up guests so recently had his mum on the podcast, where she shared this little snippet of info. What happened to Palestinian-Egyptian actor May Calamawy\u2019s role in Gladiator II? When Calamawy was originally cast (long before 7 October 2023) it was reported that she\u2019d have an \u201cimportant\u201d or leading role. Now it seems like she has been all but cut from the movie \u2013 relegated to a tiny non-speaking background part. There has been a lot of speculation that this is punishment for her pro-Palestinian advocacy. As we have seen, talking about a genocide and ethnic cleansing can be a real career-killer. Sydney Sweeney says female solidarity in Hollywood is \u2018fake\u2019 Wait, you\u2019re telling me that Hollywood \u2013 a place that fetishizes unrealistic beauty ideals and where women over 40 struggle to find roles \u2013 isn\u2019t a utopia of intersectional feminism? You\u2019re kidding me! Iran announces \u2018treatment clinic\u2019 for women who defy strict hijab laws \u201cIt won\u2019t be a clinic, it will be a prison,\u201d one young woman from Iran told the Guardian. Sweden\u2019s minister for gender equality is terrified of bananas As someone who also hates bananas with a passion, I would like to extend my solidarity to Paulina Brandberg, whose banana-phobia has made international headlines. As one of her colleagues noted, we should be focusing on her work to help vulnerable women rather than her hatred for an alarmingly yellow fruit. The week in pawtriarchy Just in case you were wondering whether the US could get any more dystopian, it turns out that robot dogs are guarding Trump\u2019s home at Mar-a-Lago. Still, probably better to have robots rather than the real thing considering how close Trump is to Kristi Noem.

      "bodyText": "Part of the appeal of the Roundhouse, a famous north London venue, is that if a gig ever becomes boring, you can gaze at its vaulted, jointed ceiling \u2013 a marvel of the industrial age. It\u2019s a safe bet that no one checks the architecture tonight, or on the other two nights of this sold-out residency. Because punk crossover stars Amyl and the Sniffers are never dull: they go off like a long-haul firecracker, detonating time and again. Their ingredients are, yes, consistent \u2013 the thuggish judder of Gus Romer\u2019s bass, the wallop of Bryce Wilson\u2019s drums, the unapologetic squall of Declan Mehrtens\u2019s electric guitar and singer Amy Taylor\u2019s fierce invective \u2013 against predatory men, internet trolls and people who seek to muzzle her. They often feel like the same set of adversaries. But the Australian band rebuild their pub-glam-punk rock Lego again and again, with surprising variety. Partly, this is down to a new, third album, Cartoon Darkness, released last month, which expands the Sniffers\u2019 sound while retaining its meaty heft. It is already pushing the band further along their trajectory from the Melbourne pub rock underground to support slots with Foo Fighters (earlier this year), Green Day (2022) and \u2013 next summer \u2013 Fontaines DC, all in a few short years. The Sniffers\u2019 way with a pop melody comes to the fore tonight on the lead single, U Should Not Be Doing That, a terrific cheerleader chant about tall-poppy syndrome and haters getting in your head. For range, there\u2019s even a slow song called Big Dreams, where Taylor encourages someone to pull themselves out of a bad place. Mehrtens and Romer conjure up some unprecedented \u2013 for them \u2013 widescreen moodiness. But Amyl and the Sniffers also share some of their compatriots AC/DC\u2019s strange power to make a pretty finite set of sounds sing anew, repeatedly. The excellent Jerkin\u2019 \u2013 also off the new record \u2013 is as lurid and straightforward a sally as they have ever penned. \u201cYou\u2019re a dumb cunt, you\u2019re an arsehole,\u201d begins Taylor, before urging creepy losers to \u201cKeep jerkin\u2019 on your squirters/You will never get with me!\u201d The overall Sniffer effect is a little like Iggy and the Stooges \u2013 elastic frontperson, raw power behind \u2013 via the quirky Aussieness of Colin from Accounts. And their not remotely secret weapon is Taylor\u2019s magnetic presence, as she headbangs on the drum riser, spits, punches the air like a mixed martial arts fighter and then runs down the photographers\u2019 pit end to end, grinning like a lunatic. Apart from Mehrtens, who favours more hair and fabric than his companions, none of the band are wearing much: Wilson in just shorts, Romer shirtless with a shaved head and Taylor in tiny black bondage shorts. Her right to wear whatever she wants is defended in songs such as Tiny Bikini. Taylor\u2019s feathered early 1980s hairstyle and manic expression, meanwhile, bring to mind photographer Ellen von Unwerth\u2019s prom-queen-about-to-go-Carrie cover shot for Hole\u2019s 1994 album Live Through This. It\u2019s infectious, seeing someone modelling such a lack of inhibition, such weaponised derangement. As a measure of the success of their formula, the band have booked an even bigger north London venue, the 10,000-plus capacity Alexandra Palace for this time next year. Of course, there is also a softer underbelly to Taylor\u2019s emotional washboard abs. The set has room for relatively soppy songs such as Security, about sweet talking your way past a bouncer. What might be her magnum opus, Guided by Angels, from 2021\u2019s Comfort to Me LP, describes the energy coursing through her body as an otherworldly possession via some swaggering yelps. Cartoon Darkness is, then, an analysis of the pitfalls of getting bigger \u2013 opinionated scenesters, more jerks \u2013 that simultaneously invites more people into their tent. It also deals, off and on, with the state of the world. Between songs, Taylor rails against someone convicted of sexual assault becoming president of the US.

      "bodyText": "Wildfires continue to ravage parts of New York and New Jersey, fueled by high winds and record low precipitation and, despite some rain over last weekend, there is no immediate relief in sight for the historic drought in the region, with ongoing dry conditions exacerbating the risk of spreading fires. Last month was the driest on record in New York City, with only 0.87in (2.2cm) of rain compared with the historic average of 4.12in for October, and forecasts predict the deficit between normal levels of rain and this autumn in the region will grow before the end of the season. The state of New York is currently under a burn ban and a drought watch, meaning that residents and businesses are encouraged to reduce their water usage. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing extreme weather manifest itself,\u201d said Zach Iscol, New York City\u2019s commissioner of emergency management. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we start conserving water now.\u201d Earlier this week, New Jersey declared a drought warning, with mandatory water conservation issued in parts of the state and limiting all non-essential water usage like outdoor watering. The total water usage by over 8 million New Yorkers amounts to about a billion gallons a day. The last time New York City experienced a drought was over 20 years ago, lasting from 2001 to 2003, with the city\u2019s water storage dropping below 42% during the worst of it. As of Thursday, the city\u2019s water reservoir levels were sitting at around 62%, compared with typical 79%. Firefighters are continuing to battle the Jennings Creek wildfire that broke out last Saturday and scorched nearly 5,000 acres in both states, killing at least one person. Dariel Vasque, an 18-year-old parks and recreation aide with the New York state parks department, was killed last Saturday while battling the blaze. Dense, urban areas are not spared from the ongoing bush fires. New York City saw more than 229 brush fires in the two week period between 31 October and 12 November. Officials are still investigating the fire that burned 2 acres of Prospect Park in the borough of Brooklyn last Saturday, and on Thursday fire officials contained a 4-acre (1.6-hectare) fire in Manhattan\u2019s Inwood Hill Park. \u201cIt is a more extreme fire season that we\u2019ve had in recent history,\u201d said Capt Scott Jackson, a forest ranger for the New York department of environmental conservation, at a press conference on Monday. New York state generally has two major fire seasons, a larger one in spring and a more abbreviated autumn season. \u201cWe did have a relatively light spring fire season this year, so I think we\u2019re making up for it in the fall,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the time when we have a lot of dead leaves off the trees, and grass on the ground, so you get that sunlight direct to the ground to dry out those forest fuels.\u201d Wildfire seasons are getting longer and growing more intense, especially across the western United States, according to analysis by non-profit Climate Central. The climate crisis is shifting weather patterns, with warming temperatures and drier air increasing wildfire risks across the country. \u201cWe have seen a little increase in how early and late the seasons are going,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSo far, the changes are occurring at a slow enough rate that I think we\u2019re adapting to those changes as they happen.\u201d Farmers across New York and New Jersey are bracing for the impact of the drought on crop production and water resources. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s still the early days, and we haven\u2019t seen the worst of it yet,\u201d said Emily Eder, farm director at Poughkeepsie Farm Project. \u201cWe\u2019d usually be watering our crops with just a small amount of rainfall, instead we\u2019re moving irrigation around, which we typically wouldn\u2019t this time in the season.\u201d Eder said that although the region had experienced unusually warm temperatures and record low rainfall for several months, some people were starting to realize the full extent of the drought only recently. \u201cA lot of us have had interactions with people where we\u2019ll talk about how it hasn\u2019t rained in so long and people will say: \u2018Oh, really, I didn\u2019t even notice,\u2019\u201d Eder said. \u201cIt\u2019s this sort of semi-invisibility of climate change, despite the fact that these disasters are happening. There\u2019s still a level of it that a lot of people are not seeing and those who work with the land and rely on it for their living are really seeing.\u201d",

And then there are the jesters \u2026 Given this week\u2019s extraordinary developments at the president-elect\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, as he builds the cabinet with which he will govern in January, it is difficult to escape the notion that the operation is being run something akin to a royal court. Trump certainly gives the appearance of acting as America\u2019s first monarch since the official end of the revolutionary war in 1783, plotting, scheming and playing favorites, and setting individuals against each other as his courtiers are assembled. His unexpected nomination as attorney general of the Mar-a-Lago regular Matt Gaetz, the controversial Florida congressman under investigation for sexual misconduct, was a power move that wrong-footed even his closest advisers, and threw a gauntlet to Republicans in the US Senate who must confirm the appointment. It followed Trump\u2019s equally astonishing choice a day earlier of a weekend presenter from the rightwing TV station Fox News to be the US defense secretary in charge of the world\u2019s largest and most potent military: Pete Hegseth, the ultimate entertainer who caught the eye of the king.

      "body": "<p>When people find out I work in fashion, they usually do one of two things: ask me to evaluate their look \u2013 awkward \u2013 or ask me, \u201cWhat\u2019s trending this season?\u201d The second is actually the harder. That\u2019s because, when it comes to menswear, being a la mode is less about some kind of seismic change and more about a twist. It\u2019s a subtle wardrobe rejig: the length of your coat, or whether or not wearing a tie is in, rather than a sudden, dramatic silhouette shift.</p> <p>A better question would be: how many clothes do I actually need? Thanks to the timeless nature of so much menswear, curating an evergreen capsule wardrobe doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Paring back your clothes to the very basics can prove divisive \u2013 some say there\u2019s no fun in minimalism, while for others a sleek uniform edit is the peak of owning a style. Either way, we should all be aiming to buy fewer clothes, so the items that actually do make it into our wardrobes demand an extra level of consideration. </p> <p>\u201cReducing your wardrobe to the fundamentals is a form of sustainability,\u201d says Bill Prince, editor of Wallpaper*, whose wardrobe of grey and navy tailoring, mostly styled with a roll neck or shirt, is in many ways classically smart but crucially never stiff. </p> <p>What is the magic number? Going by TikTok tutorials or books such as <a href=\"https://annmarieoconnor.me/the-happy-closet/\">The Happy Closet</a> by Annmarie O\u2019Connor, 20-25 items seems about right. Mitch Hughes, menswear director at Marks &amp; Spencer, agrees, though adds that this does not include socks or other accessories such as scarves and hats. \u201cFor most men a capsule wardrobe will be built around iconic pieces, which have been seen in different iterations for decades. It will range from casual items \u2013 a white sneaker or plain T-shirt \u2013 to smarter garments such as a wool overcoat, Chelsea boot or simple navy suit.\u201d Creating a leaner, more functional wardrobe will, Hughes says, also make getting dressed a streamlined affair in the long run.</p> <p>Miuccia Prada would know. While she might be credited in fashion circles with setting the trend agenda, she is a huge personal fan of uniforms<strong> </strong>\u2013 hers mostly revolves around an excellent skirt, a cashmere knit and mesmerising earrings \u2013 which she has suggested offer a certain comfort while mostly demanding zero thought.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/24/the-ultimate-capsule-wardrobe-the-only-20-items-youll-ever-really-need\">The ultimate capsule wardrobe: the only 20 items you\u2019ll ever really need</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I have got older, my own wardrobe has narrowed and now offers more style security, less fashion controversy.

      "bodyText": "When people find out I work in fashion, they usually do one of two things: ask me to evaluate their look \u2013 awkward \u2013 or ask me, \u201cWhat\u2019s trending this season?\u201d The second is actually the harder. That\u2019s because, when it comes to menswear, being a la mode is less about some kind of seismic change and more about a twist. It\u2019s a subtle wardrobe rejig: the length of your coat, or whether or not wearing a tie is in, rather than a sudden, dramatic silhouette shift. A better question would be: how many clothes do I actually need? Thanks to the timeless nature of so much menswear, curating an evergreen capsule wardrobe doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Paring back your clothes to the very basics can prove divisive \u2013 some say there\u2019s no fun in minimalism, while for others a sleek uniform edit is the peak of owning a style. Either way, we should all be aiming to buy fewer clothes, so the items that actually do make it into our wardrobes demand an extra level of consideration. \u201cReducing your wardrobe to the fundamentals is a form of sustainability,\u201d says Bill Prince, editor of Wallpaper*, whose wardrobe of grey and navy tailoring, mostly styled with a roll neck or shirt, is in many ways classically smart but crucially never stiff. What is the magic number? Going by TikTok tutorials or books such as The Happy Closet by Annmarie O\u2019Connor, 20-25 items seems about right. Mitch Hughes, menswear director at Marks &amp; Spencer, agrees, though adds that this does not include socks or other accessories such as scarves and hats. \u201cFor most men a capsule wardrobe will be built around iconic pieces, which have been seen in different iterations for decades. It will range from casual items \u2013 a white sneaker or plain T-shirt \u2013 to smarter garments such as a wool overcoat, Chelsea boot or simple navy suit.\u201d Creating a leaner, more functional wardrobe will, Hughes says, also make getting dressed a streamlined affair in the long run. Miuccia Prada would know. While she might be credited in fashion circles with setting the trend agenda, she is a huge personal fan of uniforms \u2013 hers mostly revolves around an excellent skirt, a cashmere knit and mesmerising earrings \u2013 which she has suggested offer a certain comfort while mostly demanding zero thought. As I have got older, my own wardrobe has narrowed and now offers more style security, less fashion controversy. It consists largely of striped shirts, from dependable Uniqlo to Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Shirt, alongside jeans, including vintage Levi\u2019s and a newish pair from French experts APC. If my mood ever dips \u2013 I work in fashion, it happens \u2013 I jazz things up with arty knitwear I\u2019ve collected over the years. Or I just Google Steve Jobs, whose preferred ensemble of black Issey Miyake turtleneck, Levi\u2019s 501 jeans and New Balance 991 sneakers is a persuasive argument for uniform-dressing. I would count artists Gilbert &amp; George\u2019s neat, almost identical suits and Andy Warhol\u2019s blazer and jeans in this category, too \u2013 their use of sartorial repetition is/was never boring. Owning an individual look \u2013 such as Jean-Michel Basquiat in clashing blazer and trousers, or his beloved Armani suits covered in paint splatters \u2013 is arguably just a more creative spin on a capsule. However, nailing the classics \u2013 even as you edit and tweak them towards your own personal style \u2013 can be a good starting point for any wardrobe re-evaluation. Nick Wakeman, founder and creative director of the fashion label Studio Nicholson, whose design approach leans toward function over faff, doesn\u2019t hesitate when asked how to start building a men\u2019s capsule wardrobe. \u201cJeans. Black or blue,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are so many ways you can skew jeans. You can wear them with a suit jacket or any tailored piece, and with sneakers or shoes.\u201d They also transcend age brackets. As Hughes notes, \u201cMy dad is 84, I\u2019m 50 next year and my son is 16, but all three of us would wear an indigo jean.\u201d Sure, the shapes might vary, \u201cand we might all wear them differently, but it underlines the importance of pieces that offer a certain timelessness and versatility\u201d. Almost everyone I speak to agrees that the suit is a crucial player. But not all agree as to what that suit should look like. Wakeman prefers more flexible tailored separates, such as a wearable blazer, as do I. But a suit can of course be broken up \u2013 far from this being sartorial sacrilege, Prince says he is increasingly seeing mismatched blazers and slacks being worn successfully, and given a more relaxed mood when styled with alternatives to starch-collared shirts. It might sound obvious, but if you are investing in a capsule-friendly suit, choose something simple, neutral and devoid of trend affectations \u2013 I promise you, most men don\u2019t need a purple suit or one with more than three buttons on the blazer. Spend as much as you can afford to and try it on with various options before you invest: smart shoes and trainers, for example, or different tops. Try knit layers \u2013 superfine cashmere round-neck tops from Johnstone of Elgin are a Wakeman tip \u2013 polo shirts and well-cut T-shirts.

But what if you could clear out the clutter and strip everything back to a hard-working core edit that will see you through (most) of life\u2019s sartorial eventualities? What would that wardrobe look like and how do you go about achieving it?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/nov/16/go-back-to-basics-find-your-signature-style-men\">Simon Chilvers</a> spoke to menswear experts to hone a list of essential pieces into the sharpest edit. Follow their tips on what to invest in, from tailoring and classic knitwear to denim and the failsafe white T-shirt. The result is a streamlined, trend-free zone that will save you time and money. Here\u2019s a handy guide to the key pieces to have in your closet.</p> <p><strong>How to build a capsule wardrobe</strong></p> <h2><strong>Jeans</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Uniqlo selvedge slim fit jeans, \u00a339.90<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E418910-000/00\"><sub>uniqlo.com</sub></a></p> <p>Nail the classics and the rest will follow \u2013 a good pair of jeans is the cornerstone of any capsule wardrobe. Either buy a denim brand like <a href=\"https://www.levi.com/GB/en_GB/clothing/men/jeans/c/levi_clothing_men_jeans\">Levi\u2019s</a> or <a href=\"https://eu.wrangler.com/uk-en/shop/men/clothing/jeans-c010101\">Wrangler</a> or head to <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/eu-at/en/men/bottoms/jeans?path=%2C%2C85081%2C\">Uniqlo</a> for the best hard-wearing selvedge denim on the high street. Darker styles are typically more useful than paler denim, as they can work for smart-casual events in the way a 90s paler blue wash can\u2019t, but go with your personal preference.</p> <h2><strong>Mid-weight suit</strong></h2>    <p><strong>M&amp;S regular fit wool suit, \u00a3299 for jacket and trousers<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/regular-fit-pure-wool-textured-suit/p/dsaa6417af75efa27b5e67bd65bc27dda5\"><sub>marksandspencer.com</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>Moss Bros tailored navy suit jacket, trousers and waistcoat, \u00a3369</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.moss.co.uk/moss-1851-performance-tailored-fit-navy-jacket-966689909\"><sub>moss.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>Choosing the right suit takes time. Spend as much as you can afford to based on how often you will wear it, whether that be to work several times a week or to the odd wedding. Something simple and neutral will make the most long-term sense.</p> <h2><strong>Tailored trousers</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Cos pleated wool trousers, \u00a3110<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.cos.com/en_gbp/men/menswear/suits/product.pleated-wool-trousers-black.1243931001.html\"><sub>cos.com</sub></a></p> <p>Wear them with anything \u2013 but make sure they fit just so. Get your trousers taken up or down to the right length for you by trying them on with all the shoes or boots you intend to wear with them and pinning the legs at the happy medium point. As a rule of thumb, your trouser should reach the middle to upper part of the back of your shoe and, at the front, have a notable but not-too-significant bend in the fabric where it hits the shoe.</p> <h2><strong>Trenchcoat or overcoat</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Massimo Dutti </strong><strong>double-breasted trenchcoat, \u00a3299<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.massimodutti.com/gb/100-cotton-double-breasted-trench-coat---limited-edition-l03402880\"><sub>massimodutti.com</sub></a></p> <p>A weatherproof trenchcoat or overcoat is a non-negotiable if you live in a temperate climate such as the UK. They\u2019ve been worn by everyone from Hollywood icons, like Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, to Liam Gallagher. Try on single- and double-breasted styles, and shorter and longer lengths to figure out what works best for you.</p> <h2><strong>Utility jacket</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Carhartt beige cotton jacket, \u00a3130.49<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.thrifted.com/products/vintage-carhartt-jacket-mens-beige-xx-large-367361\"><sub>thrifted.com</sub></a></p> <p>Thanks to Prada, field jackets and barn jackets are trending both on and off the catwalks. New iterations come distressed and, in some instances, cost upwards of four figures. For an authentic, cheaper and more sustainable option head to your local charity shop or scour secondhand sites. Brands to look out for include Carhartt, LL Bean, Belstaff and Barbour.</p> <h2><strong>Gilet</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Arket reversible quilted vest, \u00a397<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.arket.com/en_gbp/men/jackets-coats/vest/product.reversible-quilted-vest-blue.1236652003.html\"><sub>arket.com</sub></a></p> <p>The trick with a sleeveless vest is to avoid shiny puffer styles \u2013 you don\u2019t want to look like an extra on Industry. Instead, choose a matt colour and something with a bit of texture, such as this reversible cotton one from Arket. It\u2019s a useful piece for layering in winter. Pop it over a wool jumper on mild mornings or wear it under a thin coat for a heat boost on icy days.</p> <h2><strong>Simple crew neck jumper</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Asket the merino sweater, \u00a3100<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.asket.com/gb/mens/knitwear/merino-sweater-dark-navy\"><sub>asket.com</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>Community Clothing lamb\u2019s wool crew neck, \u00a369.50<br></strong><a href=\"https://communityclothing.co.uk/collections/mens-jumpers-knitwear/products/mens-lambswool-saddle-shoulder-crew-neck-grey\"><sub>communityclothing.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>For an essential, a crew neck is a pretty humble wardrobe hero. A version <a href=\"https://www.asket.com/gb/mens/knitwear/merino-sweater-dark-navy\">made from 100% wool</a> will be less sweaty than a synthetic blend. It should sit flat around the neck but avoid anything too tight, the aim is to be able to wear a thin T-shirt easily underneath it. If you don\u2019t want to draw attention to your stomach, avoid ribbed-hem versions.</p> <h2><strong>V-neck or roll-neck jumper</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Community Clothing lamb\u2019s wool roll neck, \u00a399<br></strong><a href=\"https://communityclothing.co.uk/products/mens-roll-neck-jumper-black\"><sub>communityclothing.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>A black jumper was a key part of Steve Jobs\u2019 uniform for a reason: easy and timeless, it\u2019s one less decision to make when getting dressed in the morning.</p> <h2><strong>T-shirts</strong></h2>    <p><strong>John Lewis </strong><strong>Anyday</strong><strong> white T-shirt, \u00a312<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-anyday-short-sleeve-plain-t-shirt/white/p111468414\"><sub>johnlewis.com</sub></a></p> <p>A white T-shirt is the fashion equivalent of a building block. You can wear it as the hero piece of your outfit, layer it under a shirt or pair it with a boxy jacket. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/oct/14/real-star-the-bear-carmy-perfect-white-t-shirt\">Carmy in The Bear</a> much has been written about finding the perfect one. Yes, you need to consider the fabric and fit but you don\u2019t need to spend a fortune. Once you find one that works for your shape, buy it in black or navy, too.</p> <h2><strong>White trainers</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Adidas Stan Smith shoes, \u00a385<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.adidas.co.uk/stan-smith-shoes/S75104.html\"><sub>adidas.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a368<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.asos.com/adidas-originals/adidas-originals-stan-smith-trainers-in-all-white/prd/204476294\"><sub>asos.com</sub></a></p> <p>Minimal white trainers, such as Adidas Stan Smiths or <a href=\"https://www.mrporter.com/en-gb/mens/product/common-projects/shoes/low-top-sneakers/original-achilles-leather-sneakers/3024088872901549\">Original Achilles from Common Projects</a>, have been a style staple for decades.

Stick to the classics, such as a Chelsea or Derby boot. Buy the best you can afford, then look after them. That means polishing them weekly and getting them resoled regularly to prolong their lifespan.</p> <h2><strong>Loafers</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Russell &amp; Bromley Rook Penny loafer, \u00a3225<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.russellandbromley.co.uk/rook/243043\"><sub>russellandbromley.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>A slip-on shoe, such as a Penny loafer, can be worn in a multitude of ways. Such footwear can be understated for the office, add flair to formal wear or be paired with a contrasting coloured sock to add edge on a night out.</p> <h2><strong>Stripe shirt</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Arket stripe shirt, \u00a367<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.arket.com/en_gbp/men/shirts/product.poplin-shirt-blue.1230999003.html\"><sub>arket.com</sub></a></p> <p>A year-round winner.

      "bodyText": "A capsule wardrobe can seem like a fashion unicorn: a nice idea but impossible in reality. But what if you could clear out the clutter and strip everything back to a hard-working core edit that will see you through (most) of life\u2019s sartorial eventualities? What would that wardrobe look like and how do you go about achieving it? Simon Chilvers spoke to menswear experts to hone a list of essential pieces into the sharpest edit. Follow their tips on what to invest in, from tailoring and classic knitwear to denim and the failsafe white T-shirt. The result is a streamlined, trend-free zone that will save you time and money. Here\u2019s a handy guide to the key pieces to have in your closet. How to build a capsule wardrobe Jeans Uniqlo selvedge slim fit jeans, \u00a339.90 uniqlo.com Nail the classics and the rest will follow \u2013 a good pair of jeans is the cornerstone of any capsule wardrobe. Either buy a denim brand like Levi\u2019s or Wrangler or head to Uniqlo for the best hard-wearing selvedge denim on the high street. Darker styles are typically more useful than paler denim, as they can work for smart-casual events in the way a 90s paler blue wash can\u2019t, but go with your personal preference. Mid-weight suit M&amp;S regular fit wool suit, \u00a3299 for jacket and trousers marksandspencer.com Moss Bros tailored navy suit jacket, trousers and waistcoat, \u00a3369 moss.co.uk Choosing the right suit takes time. Spend as much as you can afford to based on how often you will wear it, whether that be to work several times a week or to the odd wedding. Something simple and neutral will make the most long-term sense. Tailored trousers Cos pleated wool trousers, \u00a3110 cos.com Wear them with anything \u2013 but make sure they fit just so. Get your trousers taken up or down to the right length for you by trying them on with all the shoes or boots you intend to wear with them and pinning the legs at the happy medium point. As a rule of thumb, your trouser should reach the middle to upper part of the back of your shoe and, at the front, have a notable but not-too-significant bend in the fabric where it hits the shoe. Trenchcoat or overcoat Massimo Dutti double-breasted trenchcoat, \u00a3299 massimodutti.com A weatherproof trenchcoat or overcoat is a non-negotiable if you live in a temperate climate such as the UK. They\u2019ve been worn by everyone from Hollywood icons, like Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, to Liam Gallagher. Try on single- and double-breasted styles, and shorter and longer lengths to figure out what works best for you. Utility jacket Carhartt beige cotton jacket, \u00a3130.49 thrifted.com Thanks to Prada, field jackets and barn jackets are trending both on and off the catwalks. New iterations come distressed and, in some instances, cost upwards of four figures. For an authentic, cheaper and more sustainable option head to your local charity shop or scour secondhand sites. Brands to look out for include Carhartt, LL Bean, Belstaff and Barbour. Gilet Arket reversible quilted vest, \u00a397 arket.com The trick with a sleeveless vest is to avoid shiny puffer styles \u2013 you don\u2019t want to look like an extra on Industry. Instead, choose a matt colour and something with a bit of texture, such as this reversible cotton one from Arket. It\u2019s a useful piece for layering in winter. Pop it over a wool jumper on mild mornings or wear it under a thin coat for a heat boost on icy days. Simple crew neck jumper Asket the merino sweater, \u00a3100 asket.com Community Clothing lamb\u2019s wool crew neck, \u00a369.50 communityclothing.co.uk For an essential, a crew neck is a pretty humble wardrobe hero. A version made from 100% wool will be less sweaty than a synthetic blend. It should sit flat around the neck but avoid anything too tight, the aim is to be able to wear a thin T-shirt easily underneath it. If you don\u2019t want to draw attention to your stomach, avoid ribbed-hem versions. V-neck or roll-neck jumper Community Clothing lamb\u2019s wool roll neck, \u00a399 communityclothing.co.uk A black jumper was a key part of Steve Jobs\u2019 uniform for a reason: easy and timeless, it\u2019s one less decision to make when getting dressed in the morning. T-shirts John Lewis Anyday white T-shirt, \u00a312 johnlewis.com A white T-shirt is the fashion equivalent of a building block. You can wear it as the hero piece of your outfit, layer it under a shirt or pair it with a boxy jacket. Thanks to Carmy in The Bear much has been written about finding the perfect one. Yes, you need to consider the fabric and fit but you don\u2019t need to spend a fortune. Once you find one that works for your shape, buy it in black or navy, too. White trainers Adidas Stan Smith shoes, \u00a385 adidas.co.uk \u00a368 asos.com Minimal white trainers, such as Adidas Stan Smiths or Original Achilles from Common Projects, have been a style staple for decades. Continuing to stand the test of time, they go with everything from denim to suits. Boots Grenson Declan Chelsea boot, \u00a3290 grenson.com Among the most important foundational elements of a footwear collection, a decent pair of boots will be reached for more than anything else, especially given the erratic British weather. Stick to the classics, such as a Chelsea or Derby boot. Buy the best you can afford, then look after them. That means polishing them weekly and getting them resoled regularly to prolong their lifespan. Loafers Russell &amp; Bromley Rook Penny loafer, \u00a3225 russellandbromley.co.uk A slip-on shoe, such as a Penny loafer, can be worn in a multitude of ways. Such footwear can be understated for the office, add flair to formal wear or be paired with a contrasting coloured sock to add edge on a night out. Stripe shirt Arket stripe shirt, \u00a367 arket.com A year-round winner. Wear open over a vest with shorts and sandals in summer or buttoned up under a jumper in autumn with chinos. White Oxford or poplin shirt Rise &amp; Fall organic cotton poplin shirt, \u00a372 riseandfall.co Whether you\u2019re going to a job interview or a wedding, a white poplin or thicker Oxford shirt will keep you looking sharp. Naturally breathable organic cotton versions are best to avoid those dreaded sweat patches. After washing your shirt for a smoother finish, iron it while still slightly damp. Denim shirt Levi\u2019s Wellthread Wilder shirt, \u00a3100 levi.com Practical and versatile, a denim shirt can be dressed up or down. For a more rugged take, look for versions that give a subtle nod to Americana workwear with reinforced cuffs and chest pockets. Scarf Barbour tartan scarf, \u00a334.95 barbour.com \u00a335 johnlewis.com Drake\u2019s tartan scarf, \u00a3295 drakes.com A colourful or checked scarf will add an elegant touch to more casual looks.

There will be considerable pressure on Britain in the singles rubbers, though, since Fernandez and the world No 3 in doubles, Gabriela Dabrowski, are a brilliant pair. What is clear is that this is a great chance for all teams in the weaker top half of the draw, where Boulter and Fernandez are the only top 40 singles players. While the US team had been heavy favourites in the half, six of their seven top 50 players opted out of competing in M\u00e1laga and they fell on Thursday to Slovakia. Iga Swiatek\u2019s Poland, meanwhile, are down in the bottom half and face the Czech Republic. On Sunday, it will down to the individual players to seize the opportunity before them.",

      "bodyText": "More than a third of investigations into assaults against prison staff are dropped before the end of the process, according to Ministry of Justice (MoJ) data. Speaking to the Observer, officers working in several different prisons said they felt management did not take abuse against them by inmates seriously and that they were frequently told to \u201cgrow up\u201d and \u201cdeal with it\u201d. Since the start of last year, 36% of investigations into attacks on prison staff were not completed. A number of officers said they felt there was \u201cno point\u201d in starting disciplinary actions because their cases could be thrown out. When they did report an incident that was dropped during the investigation process, they said it created even more conflict with the prisoner, who felt emboldened to continue abusing them. Prison officers report attacks against them through an internal adjudication system. Ian Carson, a former prison officer and national representative for the Prison Officers\u2019 Association, said prison managers are increasingly reluctant to discipline inmates because of the large backlog of cases. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for them to just write off assaults and blame \u2018natural justice\u2019 because they took too long to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can \u2026 make it look like there\u2019s less violence in the prison.\u201d Since 2010, budgets for prisons have been cut, the number of inmates has increased, sentences have become longer and staffing levels have plummeted. According to a recent report by the criminal justice joint inspectorates, the rate of prison officers leaving each year is now at 13.4%. Meanwhile, assaults against staff in prisons have almost tripled since 2005. Former officer Sarah Nixon of Winchester University\u2019s department of policing, criminology and forensics said: \u201cWhen I was an officer \u2013 between 2003 and 2009 \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t ever really get assaulted. I\u2019ve been into prisons since, and it\u2019s a whole different story. It feels unsafe \u2013 there\u2019s just not enough staff.\u201d Prison officer Stephanie* was sexually assaulted by an inmate in his cell while trying to give him his medicine. She was never told the outcome of the disciplinary process. Her assault was not referred to the police, nor was she advised to contact them herself. According to government policy on prison staff, \u201call sexual offences must be referred to the police\u201d and \u201cstaff-victims\u201d should be informed of outcomes \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d. The prisoner allegedly continued to sexually assault more female members of staff until one of them did report it to the police, who opened a criminal investigation. At no point did anyone from Stephanie\u2019s prison tell her this. \u201cI found out when the police contacted me for a statement,\u201d she said. Sexual assaults by inmates on prison officers have increased by 427% since 2005. The MoJ does not collect data on how many of those reports go through the disciplinary process or how often prisoners are found guilty of them. If there is no prosecution, there are specific disciplinary charges for prisoners who have committed sexual offences against staff. Hannah* was sexually harassed by an inmate for months while working in a wing for sex offenders. She captured one incident on camera and had testimony from another officer who had witnessed it, so she decided to report it. \u201cHe [the prisoner] was in for sexual violence, so the abuse was to do with his offence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was important to me that he stopped being sexually aggressive [towards] female officers.\u201d Shortly afterwards, Hannah said her manager took her aside and reprimanded her for reporting it because, she said, it was not serious enough and so it would not be proceeded with. \u201cShe made me feel really stupid and embarrassed,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cI wished I hadn\u2019t done it, even though what he did was clearly against the prison rules. She made me feel like I was just being weak.\u201d The prisoner subsequently made a complaint against Hannah, alleging that she was racist and this was investigated. \u201cIt was completely ridiculous,\u201d Hannah said. The inmate mocked Hannah, saying that the governor would be \u201con his side\u201d. Although his allegations were later dismissed, the events left Hannah feeling upset, frustrated and, she said, as if \u201chis word was better than mine\u201d. The MoJ does not collect data on why investigations into assaults on prison staff are dropped. Governors are allowed to \u201cnot proceed\u201d with a case for a range of reasons, including that the prisoner has been released without a further risk assessment. Cases are also logged as \u201cnot proceeded with\u201d when they are referred to the police if the Crown Prosecution Service decides to prosecute. Multiple prison officers, including Stephanie, said that during and after the disciplinary process, their safety concerns were disregarded. After she was sexually assaulted, Stephanie told her manager that she did not want to deal with that particular prisoner in his cell again, but she said she was told to \u201cdeal with it\u201d. Stephanie added: \u201cIt made me feel so angry. If I was another kind of frontline worker, like a doctor or a nurse, would that be allowed to happen?.\u201d At another prison, Graham*, an officer, was hit by a prisoner so hard that his jaw popped out. \u201cIt was traumatic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came out of nowhere.\u201d The inmate was found guilty during the disciplinary process and put into segregation.

Do you lay everybody off?\u201d</p> <p>Experts disagree on whether the administration spent too much of that funding on law and border enforcement, rather than treatment.

The number of overdose deaths in the US declined for the first time in five years in 2023, and have continued to decline more rapidly this year, according to provisional data. Some of the decline may have resulted from Biden administration efforts to expand access to harm-reduction services, especially the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, which received over-the-counter approval for the first time last year. Public health experts worry that the second Trump administration will gut access to healthcare, including addiction treatment. The president-elect\u2019s legacy on opioids is complicated.

While the Trump administration allocated unprecedented amounts of funding to combat the crisis, Kolodny said the impact was limited, because states were usually given funds in the form of one- or two-year grants. \u201cThat\u2019s not really adequate for building out a treatment system that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cIf you were to hire a whole bunch of staff, what would you do if you don\u2019t get that appropriation the next year? Do you lay everybody off?\u201d Experts disagree on whether the administration spent too much of that funding on law and border enforcement, rather than treatment. Giroir supported harm-reduction and treatment expansion during his time under Trump, and is proud of his efforts to remove red tape and increase access to the opioid-cessation drug buprenorphine. Still, he says, \u201cenforcement has to dominate the discussion\u201d, because treatment is less effective than preventing addiction in the first place. Other experts say that criminalization only exacerbates the crisis. \u201cUnder Trump\u2019s previous administration, they federally criminalized all fentanyl-related substances in 2018 \u2013 and overdose deaths increased from 67,367 that year to 70,630 and 93,331 in 2019 and 2020 respectively,\u201d said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance. Kolodny didn\u2019t necessarily agree that criminalization drove the overdose increases, but he did say \u201cthe balance should be different\u201d when it comes to prioritizing treatment over law enforcement. He said the best way to immediately reduce the overdose death count would be to make treatment \u201cbasically free\u201d and overall easier to access than fentanyl. \u201c[People with opioid use disorder] are not out there using fentanyl because it\u2019s so much fun. If they don\u2019t use, they\u2019re gonna be very, very sick \u2026 People can really feel like they\u2019re gonna die,\u201d he said. It\u2019s hard to predict how Trump will tackle the overdose crisis the second time around. He avoided the topic during his recent presidential campaign, and instead focused on inaccurate talking points about immigrants trafficking drugs across the border. He also falsely claimed he had never wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But a Republican-controlled Congress could cut ACA subsidies and Medicaid. Frederique worries that Trump will continue prioritizing drug arrests during his second term, but said during his first term \u201che also dedicated billions of dollars toward research, education, prevention and treatment. We are committed to supporting the Trump administration\u2019s previous efforts to advocate for health approaches such as increasing access to treatment and naloxone.\u201d",

Archive image: Courtesy of Jessica Raine</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Herefordshire in 1982, actor Jessica Raine studied drama at the University of the West of England, Bristol, and graduated from Rada in 2008. In 2012, she was cast as the lead in Call the Midwife; her subsequent television work includes Patrick Melrose, Line of Duty and Baptiste. Raine is married to the actor Tom Goodman-Hill; they live in London and have one child.&nbsp;Her sister, Sarah Lloyd, is a fashion&nbsp;lecturer at the University for the&nbsp;Creative Arts in London. Jessica stars in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Devils-Hour-Season-1/dp/B0B5LHM1CG\">The&nbsp;Devil\u2019s Hour</a>, available on Prime Video now.</p> <h2><strong>Jessica</strong></h2> <p>I was raging when this photo was taken. The family myth is that I&nbsp;refused to go on stage because I hated being dressed like a robot. I didn\u2019t understand why there even was a&nbsp;robot in The Snow Queen. Every other kid in the school play was wearing white leggings, with a white top and a tinsel wig. Meanwhile, I was covered in foil. Major&nbsp;tantrums ensued.</p> <p>I was insanely jealous of my sister, the snow queen, but at the time I&nbsp;had no idea what that sensation was. I&nbsp;was quite gormless as a child&nbsp;and wouldn\u2019t have had the emotional intelligence to give that feeling a name.</p> <p>I really looked up to my big sister. She influenced my cultural taste, introducing me to bands like Hole and Smashing Pumpkins, and she was always doing cool things like wearing leopard-print coats. I would get sad when she went out with her friends, and hated that she was having a great time without me. By comparison, I was not the most fun kid. I was incredibly inward-looking and would cling to Sarah\u2019s legs if I was introduced to anyone new.</p> <p>Dad was a farmer, and where we&nbsp;grew up in rural Wales was very isolated. I spent most of my time with Sarah and our cousins. The freedom of the countryside was incredible for our imaginations; we would play outside all day, and re-enact films like Labyrinth. There was always an edge of violence, too. A lot of wrestling \u2013 Sarah would pin me down, or vice versa. Sometimes spitting would be involved; that thing where you hover over the other person, waiting for the spit to get close to their face before sucking it back up. I once kneed Sarah in the nose. I\u2019ve never seen her in so much pain. \u201cSarah, stop it!\u201d and \u201cJessie, don\u2019t!\u201d were very&nbsp;much&nbsp;the&nbsp;mantras of&nbsp;the house.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I was turned down by every drama school I applied to, which\u00a0was devastating. But I just kept trying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After the Snow Queen debacle, I&nbsp;did the odd panto. It wasn\u2019t until I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;teenager that I found my love of acting. I auditioned for Tallulah in a&nbsp;school production of Bugsy Malone, and Mrs Field, my amazing English teacher, gave me the part. That put a&nbsp;few of the other girls\u2019 noses out of joint, but it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 I loved the feeling of being on stage.</p> <p>When I was in sixth form, a very inspirational teacher, Mr Ricks, told my mum and dad at a parents\u2019 evening: \u201cJess is never going to get an&nbsp;A in drama.\u201d He\u2019d clocked how defiant I was and knew that kind of antagonism would motivate me. In the end, I got the highest A in the year.</p> <p>That defiance comes through in the robot photo, but back then I&nbsp;didn\u2019t know how to direct it. It has since become a very useful quality. After graduating, I was turned down by every drama school I applied to, which&nbsp;was devastating. But I just kept trying. I went away and taught English in Thailand for a year, to live a&nbsp;bit, and to stop obsessing about this&nbsp;career that I wanted so badly. I&nbsp;eventually acknowledged that there was a crucial aspect to auditioning, which was to not care so much what people think. When I came back from&nbsp;travelling, I&nbsp;auditioned for Rada and got in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/26/vanessa-feltz-looks-back\">Vanessa Feltz looks back: \u2018Russell Brand said he wanted to \u201chave it off\u201d with both my daughters \u2013 it was revolting\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While living in Bristol, I worked at the tourist information in the middle of a shopping mall, handing out leaflets. Sarah had moved to London, and I would write her letters about how mind-numbing my life was. \u201cSomeone just came up and asked for the toilet again. How much worse can this get? Oh wait, someone\u2019s vomited, I have to call security.\u201d At the time, she was working in a call centre and was equally bored, but we both had to make ends meet. Those letters were a&nbsp;real lifeline \u2013 to be able to see the humour in our situations, and to share&nbsp;how genuinely worried we were about where our lives were going.</p> <p>In my final year at Rada, I got plucked out to go to the National Theatre and performed play after play of new writing. I learned so much from every actor that I worked with. Then I got Call the Midwife, which was another level of TV work and fame. That show was a real turning point, and I started getting invited to red-carpet events. Sometimes I would take Sarah along with me, but it\u2019s not exactly a natural night out. I may have even passed my bag to her once when I&nbsp;was getting my photo taken.</p> <p>These days we prefer to spend our time together at each other\u2019s houses, with our kids causing chaos. We never talk about it explicitly, but each time one of us moves, the other will follow. Now we live one mile apart, and I would like to stay like that for ever, until we are OAPs, together in a home.</p> <h2><strong>Sarah</strong><br></h2> <p>I felt powerful in my Snow Queen costume. Mum told me I should pretend my heart was made of ice, so my face is trying to channel evil. There was an expectation that Jess would start singing or something, but there were no lines. The robot just wandered around, looking furious.</p> <p>Despite this incident, Jess and I&nbsp;were always great mates. I&nbsp;was thrilled when she was born. I&nbsp;remember holding her and feeling so excited. Apparently I said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a&nbsp;baby!\u201d I&nbsp;also remember biting her bum.</p> <p>School was rough.

      "bodyText": "Born in Herefordshire in 1982, actor Jessica Raine studied drama at the University of the West of England, Bristol, and graduated from Rada in 2008. In 2012, she was cast as the lead in Call the Midwife; her subsequent television work includes Patrick Melrose, Line of Duty and Baptiste. Raine is married to the actor Tom Goodman-Hill; they live in London and have one child. Her sister, Sarah Lloyd, is a fashion lecturer at the University for the Creative Arts in London. Jessica stars in The Devil\u2019s Hour, available on Prime Video now. Jessica I was raging when this photo was taken. The family myth is that I refused to go on stage because I hated being dressed like a robot. I didn\u2019t understand why there even was a robot in The Snow Queen. Every other kid in the school play was wearing white leggings, with a white top and a tinsel wig. Meanwhile, I was covered in foil. Major tantrums ensued. I was insanely jealous of my sister, the snow queen, but at the time I had no idea what that sensation was. I was quite gormless as a child and wouldn\u2019t have had the emotional intelligence to give that feeling a name. I really looked up to my big sister. She influenced my cultural taste, introducing me to bands like Hole and Smashing Pumpkins, and she was always doing cool things like wearing leopard-print coats. I would get sad when she went out with her friends, and hated that she was having a great time without me. By comparison, I was not the most fun kid. I was incredibly inward-looking and would cling to Sarah\u2019s legs if I was introduced to anyone new. Dad was a farmer, and where we grew up in rural Wales was very isolated. I spent most of my time with Sarah and our cousins. The freedom of the countryside was incredible for our imaginations; we would play outside all day, and re-enact films like Labyrinth. There was always an edge of violence, too. A lot of wrestling \u2013 Sarah would pin me down, or vice versa. Sometimes spitting would be involved; that thing where you hover over the other person, waiting for the spit to get close to their face before sucking it back up. I once kneed Sarah in the nose. I\u2019ve never seen her in so much pain. \u201cSarah, stop it!\u201d and \u201cJessie, don\u2019t!\u201d were very much the mantras of the house. After the Snow Queen debacle, I did the odd panto. It wasn\u2019t until I was a teenager that I found my love of acting. I auditioned for Tallulah in a school production of Bugsy Malone, and Mrs Field, my amazing English teacher, gave me the part. That put a few of the other girls\u2019 noses out of joint, but it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 I loved the feeling of being on stage. When I was in sixth form, a very inspirational teacher, Mr Ricks, told my mum and dad at a parents\u2019 evening: \u201cJess is never going to get an A in drama.\u201d He\u2019d clocked how defiant I was and knew that kind of antagonism would motivate me. In the end, I got the highest A in the year. That defiance comes through in the robot photo, but back then I didn\u2019t know how to direct it. It has since become a very useful quality. After graduating, I was turned down by every drama school I applied to, which was devastating. But I just kept trying. I went away and taught English in Thailand for a year, to live a bit, and to stop obsessing about this career that I wanted so badly. I eventually acknowledged that there was a crucial aspect to auditioning, which was to not care so much what people think. When I came back from travelling, I auditioned for Rada and got in. While living in Bristol, I worked at the tourist information in the middle of a shopping mall, handing out leaflets. Sarah had moved to London, and I would write her letters about how mind-numbing my life was. \u201cSomeone just came up and asked for the toilet again. How much worse can this get? Oh wait, someone\u2019s vomited, I have to call security.\u201d At the time, she was working in a call centre and was equally bored, but we both had to make ends meet. Those letters were a real lifeline \u2013 to be able to see the humour in our situations, and to share how genuinely worried we were about where our lives were going. In my final year at Rada, I got plucked out to go to the National Theatre and performed play after play of new writing. I learned so much from every actor that I worked with. Then I got Call the Midwife, which was another level of TV work and fame. That show was a real turning point, and I started getting invited to red-carpet events. Sometimes I would take Sarah along with me, but it\u2019s not exactly a natural night out. I may have even passed my bag to her once when I was getting my photo taken. These days we prefer to spend our time together at each other\u2019s houses, with our kids causing chaos. We never talk about it explicitly, but each time one of us moves, the other will follow. Now we live one mile apart, and I would like to stay like that for ever, until we are OAPs, together in a home. Sarah I felt powerful in my Snow Queen costume. Mum told me I should pretend my heart was made of ice, so my face is trying to channel evil. There was an expectation that Jess would start singing or something, but there were no lines. The robot just wandered around, looking furious. Despite this incident, Jess and I were always great mates. I was thrilled when she was born. I remember holding her and feeling so excited. Apparently I said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a baby!\u201d I also remember biting her bum. School was rough. It was one of those places where you just had to get through it. Jess was shy, so she kept her head down. She didn\u2019t get into acting until sixth form, whereas that\u2019s when I left it behind. When she discovered how good she was at it, I watched her blossom. It was like a rocket to the moon. We were all relieved, because it was a way for her to channel those big emotions. If Jess had an audition, I would sometimes help her practise her lines, but I found it quite disconcerting. There were times when it was like she had shapeshifted into the character entirely. As we are so close, it is incredibly confusing to see someone you love turning into someone else. Even after all these years, it\u2019s still very tough if she is in a play; I can\u2019t quite lose myself in the moment. \u201cWhat are you doing Jess? Come back!\u201d I\u2019m Jess\u2019s biggest fan. I\u2019m always talking about her at work. \u201cDid you see my sister at the Emmys? Didn\u2019t she look amazing?\u201d Watching her career ascent has been amazing, but what I don\u2019t relish is when we\u2019re on the tube or in a restaurant and she gets recognised.

Of course, there are other times when I forget that she is famous. I turn on Netflix, her face pops up and I think: \u201cHang on, isn\u2019t that the furious robot?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The pros of buying a Christmas present for a tween (age nine to 12): they\u2019ll tell you exactly what they want. The cons: they\u2019ll tell you exactly what they want, and could very well change their mind 17 times before Christmas. Time moves fast for Gen A tweens, who start as children with a love of Beyblades and end as teens who likely have a more expensive skincare routine than you. So, we spoke to several tweens to find out what they really want for Christmas (for now, at least). *** The best gifts for tweens *** Wimpy Kid and stationery Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hot Mess, \u00a37.49 amazon.co.uk whsmith.co.uk Legami Savannah erasable pen set, \u00a35.99 amazon.co.uk waterstones.com Avocuddle eraser, \u00a31.99 ryman.co.uk waterstones.com Wimpy Kids are so funny, you can read them over and over, and I love the pictures. It\u2019s exciting that there\u2019s a new one for Christmas (Hot Mess)! I also want some pens from Legami. There are loads of different characters to collect, like animals, and you can rub them out. I also love their Avocuddle stationery. Cecily, 10 *** Movie moments Mini projector, \u00a385.99 amazon.co.uk \u00a3129 currys.co.uk For Christmas, I would love a cool phone projector, as it could turn my room\u2019s wall into a big screen \u2013 so I can watch movies with my friends.

They\u2019re great because you can control them from your phone and change the colour. There\u2019s even a disco mode. Also, an Instax photo printer: this one is great because you can print collages and add a background and stickers. I love taking fun photos of my friends and family. Louis W, 12 *** Digital pets Tamagotchi, \u00a313 amazon.co.uk argos.co.uk Strawberry lip butter, \u00a36 thebodyshop.com \u00a38.99 amazon.co.uk I\u2019d like a Tamagotchi, as I\u2019d like the responsibility of a virtual pet!

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight, but we\u2019ll have a match report on the site shortly. Thanks for your company! That\u2019s a really good win for this inexperienced Australia side. In the end, that riotous opening partnership of 52 in 3.4 overs proved decisive. Pakistan were on course for victory until the outstanding Spencer Johnson returned to dismiss the top scorer Usman Khan and then complete a maiden five-for. It feels weird to say it about a 28-year-old, but he is such an exciting prospect. Australia win by 13 runs! Irfan clubs to long on for a single. Rauf is so desperate to get him on strike that he looks for a non-existent second and is run out by a mile. 19.3 overs: Pakistan 133-9 (Irfan 36, Haris 2) Another dot ball! This is nerveless stuff from Ellis. Irfan swept him to deep backward square but could only have taken a single and decided to stay on strike. He needs two sixes and a four from the last three deliveries. 19.2 overs: Pakistan 133-9 (Irfan 36, Haris 2) Irfan turns down a single to long off. Very well bowled. 19.1 overs: Pakistan 133-9 (Irfan 36, Haris 2) Haris edges a single, then tries to come back for two! Irfan on strike, Pakistan need 15 from 5 balls. 19th over: Pakistan 132-9 (Irfan 36, Haris 1) Irfan flicks Stoinis\u2019s last ball beautifully for four, which brings the target down to 16 from six balls. Trouble is, he\u2019s not on strike at the start of Nathan Ellis\u2019s last over. Australia are one wicket away. Muqeeb turns for a second, trying to keep Irfan on strike, but it\u2019s never on. He\u2019s sent back and is short of his ground when Inglis collects Short\u2019s throw and breaks the stumps. 18th over: Pakistan 124-8 (Irfan 29, Muqeem 0) Hello! The youngster Irfan Khan slugs Ellis for 16 from three balls to give Pakistan fresh hope, including a flat, dragged six over square leg. Irfan is able to steal a bye off the last ball to keep the strike. Pakistan need 24 from 12 balls. 17th over: Pakistan 107-8 (Irfan 15, Muqeem 0) Zampa is done for the night: 4-0-19-2. He is so good. Superb bowling, wretched batting. Naseem charges Zampa, who zips the ball straight through the gate and into the stumps. Shaheen misses, Zampa hits. An entirely predictable development that moves Australia even closer to a series victory. 16th over: Pakistan 106-6 (Irfan 14, Shaheen 0) Spencer Johnson started his spell with five wides and ended it with five wickets: 4-0-26-5. It was an outstanding performance; he gets some prodigious bounce. Spencer Johnson takes his maiden five-for in T20 cricket! Abbas Afridi hits his first ball imperiously for four but carves his second to Matt Short in the covers. Three balls ago Pakistan were on top; now Australia are heavy favourites. Another twist at the SCG. Usman Khan tries to pull Spencer Johnson but can only top-edge the ball gently to short fine leg. Australia really needed that. 15th over: Pakistan 101-4 (Usman 52, Irfan 14) Australia are in danger of losing the plot, and the match. Bartlett, back for his final over, wants to review an LBW appeal when Usman is hit on the glove. Inglis pulls rank but then Irfan gloves a short ball down the leg side for four. Usman takes a pair of twos to bring up a fine fifty from 35 balls, his first in T20 internationals. Pakistan need 47 from 30 balls. They looked beaten when they were 44 for 4 after 10 overs; now they\u2019re favourites. 14th over: Pakistan 89-4 (Usman 47, Irfan 9) Now it\u2019s Australia who are under pressure. Short drops Usman, a pretty straightforward chance at deep square off Ellis, and the ball bursts through his hands for four. Pakistan has scored more runs in the last four overs than they did in the first 10. 13th over: Pakistan 80-4 (Usman 41, Irfan 7) Zampa drops Usman off his own bowling, a seriously tough chance, before being driven delightfully over extra cover for six by Usman Khan. He scored 12 from his first 17 balls; he\u2019s biffed 29 from the last 12. 12th over: Pakistan 68-4 (Usman 33, Irfan 3) Usman Khan is keeping Pakistan in the hunt. He drives Stoinis over extra cover for four, then carts another boundary through midwicket. A gloved pull brings two more, but also a blow that requires treatment, and he squirts three behind square. Pakistan have hit 24 from the last two overs. 11th over: Pakistan 55-4 (Usman 20, Irfan 3) Usman Khan laps Maxwell for a rare boundary, only the second off the bat in this innings. He\u2019s Pakistan\u2019s main hope now, but there\u2019s a lot of work to do: they need 93 from 54 balls. 10th over: Pakistan 44-4 (Usman 14, Irfan 0) Irfan Khan keeps out the hat-trick ball, though he\u2019s a bit fortunate to survive the over. Both edges of the bat are beaten, with the latter leading to an appeal for caught behind off the inside edge. Turned out the noise was the ball hitting the body. Two in two! The dangerous Salman Agha snicks a beauty through to Josh Inglis and is out for a golden duck. Salman didn\u2019t do much wrong there; it was a lovely delivery that seamed and bounced across him. Rizwan has gone now. The ball after hitting Johnson for the first boundary of the innings, he mistimed a pull towards long on, where David ran in and swooped forward to take an excellent catch. Australia are on course for a series-winning victory. 9th over: Pakistan 40-2 (Rizwan 12, Usman 12) Usman is dropped by Inglis off Zampa, a very sharp chance standing up to the stumps. It was a big deflection so I wouldn\u2019t be too critical. Zampa has an unsuccessul LBW review against Rizwan two balls later. Rizwan missed a sweep at a ball that dipped under the bat to hit the front pad and then the back thigh; the technology suggested it would have hit the outside of leg stump. Hmm, that doesn\u2019t quite feel right. 8th over: Pakistan 36-2 (Rizwan 11, Usman 10) Usman edges the new bowler Nathan Ellis on the bounce to short third, where Zampa adjusts smartly to save the boundary. Another over of\u2026 not much from Pakistan, who have been strangely passive with the bat. 7th over: Pakistan 33-2 (Rizwan 10, Usman 8) Adam Zampa, sporting a bleached blond buzzcut, comes on straight after the Powerplay and concedes three singles from his first over. The required rate is creeping towards nine an over; it already feels like the net is closing around Pakistan. 6th over: Pakistan 30-2 (Rizwan 9, Usman 6) Rizwan tries to slog sweep Bartlett, misses and is thumped in the gut. That sounded nasty and he winces a few times before taking guard again. Pakistan just can\u2019t get going, particularly against Bartlett who has marvellous figures of 3-0-7-1. Australia didn\u2019t concede a single boundary off the bat in the Powerplay. 5th over: Pakistan 27-2 (Rizwan 8, Usman 4) The relatively small target means Pakistan can take a bit of time to regroup; they can\u2019t afford to lose any more wickets in the Powerplay. The upshot is a low-key over from Stoinis: a dot, four singles and a two. 4th over: Pakistan 21-2 (Rizwan 4, Usman 2) What a fantastic over from Xavier Bartlett. Rizwan is beaten by successive deliveries that seam and bounce past the outside edge; then he\u2019s hit on the back thigh by another excellent delivery. One run from an over that belonged in a Test match, not a T20. 3rd over: Pakistan 20-2 (Rizwan 3, Usman 2) Pakistan are grateful for Spencer Johnson\u2019s wides, without which they\u2019d be 13 for 2. Farhan, who has struggled to beat the infield with his ground shots, pulls Johnson breezily over midwicket for a couple. But then he plays a second pull that is neither one nor t\u2019other and goes straight to Bartlett at midwicket. 2nd over: Pakistan 15-1 (Rizwan 3, Farhan 3) The new batter, Sahibzada Farhan, survives a big LBW shout after missing a waft across the line. Australia decide against a review. It looks close but probably umpire\u2019s call at best and therefore not out. Farhan chips the last ball of the over jauntily down the ground for three. Xavier Bartlett strikes first ball! It was a poor delivery, in truth, but Babar flicked it high towards deep square leg. Nathan Ellis ran round the boundary to take a well-judged catch. 1st over: Pakistan 11-0 (Rizwan 3, Babar 3) Johnson\u2019s first ball swings down the leg side for five wides. An LBW appeal against Rizwan is caught in the throat because of an inside edge, but overall it\u2019s not a great first over. A short ball outside leg stump is gloved fine for three by Babar Azam. Twelve from the over. Which, rather absurdly, means Australia are nine runs ahead on the comparison. Right, we\u2019re back. Spencer Johnson to Mohammad Rizwan. \u201cYesterday my friend told me that India won another match and that had scored 280-odd with two centuries against South Africa,\u201d begins Krishnamoorthy V. \u201cI replied, \u2018These days teams score that in a T20\u2019 and he replied: \u2018It IS a T20\u2019. \u201cI give up now.\u201d 20th over: Australia 146-9 (Ellis 1, Zampa 0) Adam Zampa steals a bye off the last ball of the innings. That\u2019s a brilliant performance from Abbas Afridi, who didn\u2019t concede a single boundary in a spell of 4-0-17-3. He and Haris Rauf dragged Pakistan back into the contest after a monstrous start from Australia, who were 50 for 0 after 3.1 overs. But for some desperate fielding, Pakistan would be chasing an even lower total. Spencer Johnson slices his first ball high in the air and is taken at mid-on. Abbas Afridi looks a real find for Pakistan. And now he\u2019s on a hat-trick. Abbas Afridi strikes with one of the worst deliveries of his life. It was a slower short ball that would have been called wide on line and height, but Hardie was committed to the shot and top-edged it straight up in the air. Mohammad Rizwan did the rest. 19th over: Australia 141-7 (Hardie 24, Ellis 1) Haris ends a glorious spell with figures of 4-0-22-4. He came on with Australia 48 for 0 after three overs and instantly changed the game. By the way the wicket of Bartlett was Haris\u2019s 107th in T20 internationals, equalling Shadab Khan\u2019s Pakistan record. 18.4 overs: Australia 140-7 (Hardie 23, Ellis 1) Nathan Ellis misses his first two balls, sets off each time for a bye and then thinks better of it. He\u2019s desperate to get Hardie on strike and manages it next ball with a straight drive that hits the bowler Haris on the ankle. Haris in a bit of pain here \u2013 he twisted his left ankle at the same time as the ball hit him on the right ankle. The right one looks to be the problem; there\u2019s a break in play while he receives treatment. He\u2019s okay to continue. The main man strikes again. Bartlett drags a pull onto the stumps to give Haris Rauf his fourth wicket. He\u2019s been sensational. 18th over: Australia 139-6 (Hardie 23, Bartlett 5) Hardie pulls Naseem\u2019s first ball sweetly to the square-leg boundary. Naseem again finishes the over strongly, conceding three off the bat from the last five balls. Two overs to go, Australia will be aiming for 160. 17th over: Australia 131-6 (Hardie 16, Bartlett 5) Bartlett slugs Shaheen over midwicket for his first boundary, a pretty good shot for a No8. Shaheen finishes his spell of two halves. The first two overs disappeared for 32, the last two cost just seven. 16th over: Australia 124-6 (Hardie 14, Bartlett 1) Hardie, the senior batter after David\u2019s departure, pulls Naseem Shah for a beautiful flat six. It\u2019s been such a topsy-turvy innings that it\u2019s hard to know whether Australia are anywhere near a par score. You\u2019d think they\u2019ll want at least 150. That\u2019s if they don\u2019t run out of wickets. Bartlett almost falls, chipping Naseem just short of Farhan at short midwicket. A good comeback from Naseem: six off the first ball, three from the last five. 15th over: Australia 115-6 (Hardie 6, Bartlett 0) Haris Rauf has taken 3 for 20 from three high-quality overs. Another dropped catch! Tim David slugged Haris Rauf straight to mid-on, where Babar Azam put down a dolly. Apparently Haris has had seven catches dropped off his bowling in these white-ball series, which is frankly ridiculous. David slices the next ball just over the head of Farhan, running back from bnackward point, then short-arm pulls his first boundary. It was another poor bit of fielding, this time from Sufyan, whose foot was touching the boundary sponge as he stopped the ball. David thumps another boundary and then holes out to long on, where Abbas Afridi takes a comfortable catch. Haris clenches his fist, punches the air and growls with delight. He has bowled brilliantly. Australia\u2019s first 52 runs came in 20 balls; the next 52 have taken almost 12 overs. 14th over: Australia 104-5 (David 8, Hardie 5) The left-arm wristspinner Muqeem ends a crafty, slippery spell with a boundaryless final over. That gives him terrific figures of 4-0-21-2. This is only Muqeem\u2019s fourth T20 international, and his 13th T20 game full stop, but he looks very promising. 13th over: Australia 99-5 (David 5, Hardie 3) An outstanding over from Shaheen, full of clever slower balls, with only one run off the bat. His overs tonight have cost 21, 11 and now 1. David is not out He tried to pull a slower short ball, was beaten all ends up and\u2026 well, he was beaten all ends up. Not Pakistan\u2019s finest review. Pakistan review for caught behind against David Shaheen likes it; Rizwan doesn\u2019t look convinced. 12th over: Australia 97-5 (David 5, Hardie 2) Muqeem\u2019s inclusion has been a triumph; he has figures of 3-0-16-2. A huge wicket for Pakistan! Glenn Maxwell, who looked in really good touch, drags Muqeem straight to the man at deep midwicket. Australia, who roared to 52 for 0 after 3.3 overs, are now in a bit of bother. 11th over: Australia 92-4 (Maxwell 19, David 4) Another terrific over from the impressive Abbas Afridi, who has bowled three overs without conceding a boundary. David is completely beaten by a slower short ball; the other five deliveries all go for singles. 10th over: Australia 87-4 (Maxwell 17, David 1) Tim David is the new batter, and for once he can take a bit of time to get his eye in. Sufiyan Muqeem strikes! Stoinis middles a reverse sweep straight to deep point, where Abbas Afridi takes a comfortable catch. File under \u2018he hit it too well\u2019. 9th over: Australia 83-3 (Maxwell 15, Stoinis 13) Naseem Shah, back in the attack, is driven sweetly between mid-off and extra cover for four by Maxwell. He looks in good touch after that little cameo in Brisbane. Stoinis gets his first boundary to end the over, helped by a lazy bit of fielding from Haris Rauf at deep square leg. It feels like Australia have weathered the storm, mainly because Haris is no longer bowling. 8th over: Australia 71-3 (Maxwell 9, Stoinis 7) This should be fun: the left-arm wristspinner Sufiyan Muqeem is coming on to bowl. And he has Stoinis dropped third ball! He reverse-hoicked a poor delivery towards short third man, where Shaheen put down a diving chance. It wasn\u2019t easy but he should really have taken it. Maxwell carves a boundary through the covers, the first since the third over. At that stage Australia were 47 for 0 from 2.3 overs. Things have changed. 7th over: Australia 64-3 (Maxwell 4, Stoinis 5) The Australian commentators are raving about Abbas Afridi. He\u2019s a sizeable unit who hits the pitch hard and at pace; he also grunts like a tennis player every time he releases the ball. Stoinis tries to cut and is beaten by some extra pace. \u201cLove his energy,\u201d says David Warner. \u201cHis energy at the crease is unbelievable.\u201d There\u2019s a bit too much energy on the next ball, an attempted slower ball that goes miles down the leg side. It only just landed on the pitch. Despite the wide it\u2019s another really good over, which concludes with a slower ball that totally hoodwinks Maxwell. He misses it completely and shakes his head. After that shambolic start, Afridi and Haris have taken three for 16 in four overs. 6th over: Australia 61-3 (Maxwell 3, Stoinis 4) Stoinis is dropped first ball! He fenced Haris Rauf to first slip, where Salman Agha contrived to drop a very simple chance. Haris is on fire and has a big LBW appeal turned down two balls later. He wants to go upstairs but Rizwan overrules him; it looked a bit high and replays show there was an inside edge as well. Even so, this is blistering, game-changing stuff from Haris: 2-0-9-2. And he should have three wickets. 5th over: Australia 56-3 (Maxwell 2, Stoinis 0) Erm, who the hell is on top when the team batting first is 56 for 3 after five overs? Steven Stern, you out there? He\u2019s got a wicket now! Short has been duped by a beautiful slower ball. He tried to launch it over midwicket, missed and was cleaned up. Pakistan have taken three wickets for four runs, having previously conceded 50 in 3.1 overs. Only them. 4.5 overs: Australia 56-2 (Short 32, Maxwell 2) Abbas Afridi continues Pakistan\u2019s mini-revival, conceding four singles from his first five balls. He almost takes a wicket when Maxwell top-edges the ball into his grille and up in the air. Rizwan charges towards leg gully, dives forward but can\u2019t quite reach the ball. There\u2019s a break in play while Maxwell has a concussion check. 4th over: Australia 52-2 (Short 30, Maxwell 0) Haris Rauf: 1-0-4-2. The rest: 3-0-48-0. Haris Rauf is doing it again! Inglis gets a leading edge to cover, where Muqeem sweeps forward to take another very good catch. Two wickets in three balls for Rauf, who has changed the mood of this game in the space of one over. Haris Rauf comes into the attack. Short works him for two to bring up the fifty in just 3.1 overs, a record for Australia in T20 cricket. Pakistan are already in death-bowling mode, with lots of variations, and it has brought the first wicket. Fraser-McGurk is hit in the gut by a slower ball, then swats a very short ball high over extra cover. Salman Agha backpedals to take an excellent catch; Fraser-McGurk goes for 20 from 9 balls. 3rd over: Australia 48-0 (Short 27, Fraser-McGurk 20) This is getting silly. Shaheen\u2019s first ball is too short to Short, who wallops it over midwicket for six. A mistimed pull almost goes the distance as well, though in the end Short has to settle for four. Shaheen switches to around the wicket and bowls two successive dot balls, both slower ones. Australia are slowing down too; they only managed 11 from that over. 2nd over: Australia 37-0 (Short 16, Fraser-McGurk 20) Short pulls Naseem Shah\u2019s first ball into the crowd at midwicket. \u201cCan someone tell our blokes this isn\u2019t a seven-over game?\u201d deadpans Mark Waugh on commentary. Another short ball from Naseem is cut emphatically for four by Short. He has 16 from 5 balls, Fraser-McGurk 20 from 7. Crikey. 1st over: Australia 21-0 (Short 3, Fraser-McGurk 18) A flying start for Australia, with Shaheen\u2019s first over disappearing for 21! Jake Fraser-McGurk hit three successive fours and then carted a spectacular six over wide mid-on. One of those fours involved a chance to Naseem Shah at third man; he dived forward, didn\u2019t quite get to the ball and felt it slither under him to the fence. Here come the players. There\u2019s a big crowd at the SCG \u2013 not quite the reported sell-out, but enough to create a pretty good atmosphere. Shaheen Shah Afridi will open the bowling. A happy 53rd birthday to Waqar Younis, the man who busted stumps for a living. This video is well worth a watch. Weather watch It\u2019s a bit of a moody night in Sydney, but the forecast is for a dry night. We should get a full game. Australia are unchanged. Pakistan bring in the left-arm wrist spinner Sufiyan Muqeem for Haseebullah Khan. Australia Short, Fraser-McGurk, Inglis (c/wk), Maxwell, Stoinis, David, Hardie, Ellis, Bartlett, Johnson, Zampa. Pakistan Sahibzada Farhan, Mohammad Rizwan (c/wk), Babar Azam, Usman Khan, Salman Agha, Irfan Khan, Abbas Afridi, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Sufiyan Muqeem. Mohammad Rizwan calls incorrectly and Josh Inglis is happy to bat first, as Australia did in the first T20. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the second T20 international between Australia and Pakistan in Sydney. The Brisbane weather turned the first game turned into a Seven7, won handsomely by Australia, but happily today\u2019s forecast is much better so we should get a full game. Another win would give Australia the series with a match to spare. The first T20I was notable for Glenn Maxwell\u2019s hitting and a devastating new-ball burst from Xavier Bartlett (3 for 12) and Nathan Ellis (3 for 9). Bartlett has made an eye-catching start to his international career, taking 17 wickets at 9.23 across both white-ball codes. Australia will soon need a new pace attack across all three formats; Bartlett, Ellis and Spencer Johnson will be hoping to impress again tonight. The match starts at 7pm AEDT.",

Michael Broers, a professor of western European history at the University of Oxford, was about to retire when he was summoned to a meeting with Ridley Scott. The director had read Broers\u2019 books about Napoleon, and wanted to consult him for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/15/napoleon-review-joaquin-phoenix-emperor-ridley-scott\">his biopic</a>, which came out last year with Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s rather Napoleonic himself,\u201d Broers tells me of Scott, laughing. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt when he comes into a room who\u2019s in charge, and pretty soon I became fully aware that we were making a movie, not a documentary.\u201d</p> <p>Scott had already filmed a now notorious scene in which Napoleon\u2019s troops blow the tops of the Egyptian pyramids with cannon, in an explosive revision of Napoleon\u2019s very real capture of Cairo. \u201cWhen he explained that he had done this, I was aghast,\u201d Broers says. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen, I told him, and nothing like it happened. He said: \u2018Come on, just sit down and watch it.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>When Broers watched the scene, he burst out laughing. \u201cI said I thought it was the funniest thing I\u2019d ever seen. \u2018Well, then, it\u2019s staying in, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 [Scott] said.

The director\u2019s response in an interview last November: \u201cGet a life.\u201d But I gather the 86-year-old Scott was privately fuming. An insider on Gladiator II, which had just started filming when Napoleon was released, tells me that, in response, Scott banned historical consultants from the set. (Neither the director\u2019s production company nor Paramount, the studio behind the film, comments on the claim when I put it to them.)</p> <p>It\u2019s not Scott\u2019s first clash with historians. Kathleen Coleman, head of classics at Harvard, was so appalled by the first Gladiator movie that she asked for her consultant credit to be removed. She claimed that in one message from the production office she was asked to find evidence to show that female gladiators attached razor blades to their busts. \u201cScholars are, of course, notorious for being obsessed with detail \u2026 but detail is the repository of authenticity,\u201d Coleman later wrote in an essay called <a href=\"https://mail.classics.domains.skidmore.edu/lit-campus-only/secondary/Film/Coleman%202004.pdf\">The Pedant Goes to Hollywood</a>.</p>    <p>Scott revels in disregarding such detail. \u201cThis is the first coffee bar in Roman history,\u201d he reportedly boasted after the first film came out, when one pedant pointed out pavement cafes weren\u2019t a thing in ancient Rome. (The new film goes further, featuring a noble reading a newspaper at a cafe, 1,200 years before the invention of the printing press.) But Broers shares Scott\u2019s sentiment, and was amused by the historical inaccuracies in one viral nitpicker\u2019s video (he prefers not to say whose). \u201cIt\u2019s a movie! What do you want to sit down and watch here?\u201d he says. The historian recalls moments in script meetings when it was Scott\u2019s turn to be aghast.

On the same set, Erin Doherty, who plays Anne Askew, the doomed Protestant poet and preacher, wanted to learn more about her character\u2019s religious convictions. \u201cShe wanted to get into the mindset of someone who believed so fervently in the Bible in English that she would die for it,\u201d says Wagstaff, whose work has ranged from a Cadbury\u2019s ad with a Victorian setting to the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/25/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light-bbc\">new series of Wolf Hall</a>, in which he also has a singing role in a choral scene.</p> <p>Mariotti, Vickery and Broers all say that they have come away from brushes with Hollywood feeling enriched rather than abused.

They are there in the posters, if you know where to look, and they feature throughout the film itself, which hits cinemas this week with Paul Mescal in the leading role. We\u2019re talking about the leather wrist guards. \u201cI\u2019m afraid leather forearm bracers have nothing to do with ancient Rome,\u201d says Alexander Mariotti, a historian and specialist in gladiatorial combat who worked as a researcher and script consultant on the new film. \u201cThey don\u2019t appear in any imagery or sources \u2026 they just look good on film.\u201d And so, just as Russell Crowe wore some heavy duty wrist-strapping as Maximus Decimus Meridius in the 2000 blockbuster, so does Mescal in his turn as the first gladiator\u2019s even beefier son, Lucius Verus (who, sure enough, is also forced into slavery and becomes a gladiator). Mariotti, who is based in Rome and London, says the arm armour is closer to something that medieval archers might have worn. Yet it has appeared in almost every screen representation of fighty Romans since Ben Hur (the silent 1907 one). He thinks early costume departments may have taken inspiration from neoclassical depictions of Rome. The ubiquity of the accessories reveals much about the way Hollywood flirts with verisimilitude and shapes popular historical understanding, even while consultants are in growing demand. Their role can vary, from early development advice up to script reviews and seats on set. As well as dutifully pointing out anachronistic wristwear and incongruous rhinos, Mariotti advised Scott on the use of weapons and language. He hasn\u2019t yet seen the film but was heartened to see in the trailer the line \u201cUbi tu ibi ego\u201d (\u201cWherever you are I will be\u201d), a Latin marriage vow that he suggested, and which is inscribed in his own wife\u2019s wedding ring.

The film approaches a historical truth by breaking the rules.\u201d Mariotti has absorbed time on elaborate sets into his lectures. \u201cSuddenly, after spending years studying ruins, I was walking on the cobbled streets of the Via Sacra, looking at the Temple of Jupiter,\u201d he says of his first consulting role, on the 2007 HBO series Rome. \u201cI found that when I was giving lectures, I was able to do it more vividly because I\u2019d seen these images.\u201d The real Colosseum might not have featured rhinos or wrist guards, but Mariotti sees parallels between Hollywood movies and the theatrical staging that was often central to shows in ancient Rome. \u201cWhen you sat in the Colosseum and you watched trees pop out of the ground as they transformed the arena into a jungle, it wasn\u2019t really what a jungle looked like,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t matter, because it was entertainment.\u201d Gladiator II is in cinemas now.",

      "bodyText": "The great X-odus is under way. More than 1 million new users have joined the social media platform Bluesky since the US election. Many are seeking to escape Elon Musk\u2019s X amid warnings from anti-hate speech campaign groups and the EU about misinformation and extremism on the platform. But what exactly is Bluesky, why it is proving so popular, and who has already made the move? What is Bluesky? Bluesky is a social media platform where people can interact much as they do on X, posting, replying and messaging one another on a vertical user interface. The recent influx of new users, largely from North America and the UK, has helped it reach more than 15 million users worldwide, up from 9 million in September, the company said. How did it start out and who owns it? Bluesky began as a project inside Twitter, after its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, announced in 2019 that the company would fund developers to create an \u201copen and decentralised standard for social media\u201d. Bluesky became an independent company in 2021 and is now primarily owned by the chief executive, Jay Graber. How is it any different to X? Bluesky offers users the chance to more heavily moderate their experience. This includes the ability to select the algorithm that drives what you see, helping create custom feeds, for example a feed for mutual followers, a feed for cat photos or one for your special interest. Bluesky also allows users to have website addresses as their handles, which it anticipates could act as a verification tool for journalists, athletes and public figures who could have a company\u2019s website in their handle. How does Bluesky deal with trolls? While X appears to deregulate the user experience \u2013 it recently changed its block function to allow users to see the posts of public accounts that have blocked them \u2013 Bluesky talks up its \u201canti-toxicity\u201d features. These include allowing users to detach an original post of theirs from someone else\u2019s quote post, preventing unwanted interactions. Why are people leaving X for Bluesky? The platform has previously benefited from dissatisfaction with X and its billionaire owner, Elon Musk, who is closely tied to the US president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s successful election campaign. Bluesky reported picking up 3 million new users in the week after X was suspended in Brazil in September and a further 1.2 million in the two days after X announced it would allow users to view posts from people who had blocked them. X users have also reported an increase in bots, making the site difficult to use. Who is already using it? Several MPs have already made the move, including the safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips, the Liberal Democrat technology spokesperson Layla Moran and Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott. The US actor Jamie Lee Curtis has been vocal about her decision to leave X after she confirmed she had deactivated her account in a post on Instagram. The TV presenter and naturalist Chris Packham, the comedian Dara \u00d3 Briain and Countdown\u2019s Susie Dent are also among the public figures on the network.",

It now includes his parents and two siblings, along with their families, all 16 sheltering in his house and sleeping on the living room floor each night, feeling the blast waves and hearing the bombardments raining down among their flats in the neighbourhoods below. A house that he built for his family in their village, close to the de facto border with Israel, was destroyed beyond repair in a strike earlier this year. \u201cHere\u2019s how it feels: you made your dreams come true, but were forced to give it up.

What followed was later described by the World Bank as one of the worst economic and financial crises globally in 150 years, catapulting much of the country into poverty. As Lebanon staggered forward, it was hit by the effects of theCovid pandemic and a deadly explosion in Beirut\u2019s port in 2020 that destroyed large parts of the capital. Abdallah continued to protest, joining and organising a group of depositors who vented their fury \u2013 first by attacking bank branches and later going as far as to try robbing them to get their deposits back, in the hope of inspiring others to do the same. The 44-year-old has found himself at the crossroads of each of the main crises to hit Lebanon over the past five years. This includes escalating Israeli bombardments intended to target Hezbollah, killing over 3,300 people since last year, as well as displacing at least 1.4 million, according to Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati. Abdallah has no association with the Islamist militant group and even ran for parliament two years ago on an independent ticket, pitting himself against Amal and Hezbollah, political parties that traditionally represent the Shia community in southern Lebanon. This did little to spare his house in the village of Khiam that was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike earlier this year. \u201cThey hit my house, which sits alone on a hill. Why would they want to hit my house? It is a lie that they\u2019re targeting Hezbollah \u2013 I am certain that they just want to destroy things.

He remains disappointed that the government failed to prepare for the effects of the escalating war, furious at the politicians and elites who managed to move their money out of Lebanon while others sufferedand disenchanted with many of the revolutionaries he once protested alongside.

Like many in Lebanon, he and his family are looking for ways out, ideally to the Emirates, despite repeated and mysterious denials of a work visa to his longtime former home. \u201cI love this country but I want my kids to live somewhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I need is to work again. I don\u2019t like to be negative, let them destroy whatever, I just want to go back to work. I want a decent life. It\u2019s not for me, it\u2019s for my kids\u2019 futures.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Russian spy ship has been escorted out of the Irish Sea after it entered Irish-controlled waters and patrolled an area containing critical energy and internet submarine pipelines and cables. It was spotted on Thursday east of Dublin and south-west of the Isle of Man but Norwegian, US, French and British navy and air defence services initially observed it accompanying a Russian warship, the Admiral Golovko, through the English channel last weekend. The Irish navy ship the L\u00c9 James Joyce escorted it out of the Irish exclusive economic zone (EEZ) at about 3am on Friday with the air corps continuing to monitor its movements as it headed south. Its presence has raised fresh concerns about the security of the interconnector cables that run between Ireland and the UK carrying global internet traffic from huge datacentres operated by tech companies including Google and Microsoft, which have their EU headquarters sited in Ireland. The sighting of the Russian intelligence ship came as British defence forces monitored other Russian vessels near its eastern coastal waters. On Thursday, British jets were also scrambled to monitor a Russian reconnaissance aircraft flying close to UK airspace, the Ministry of Defence said. The ship was also spotted on Monday and Tuesday west of Cork, where there are another set of connectors between Ireland and France, some offering transatlantic interconnection. At one point it was positioned just inside the Irish EEZ, 5-7km (3.1 to 4.3 miles) north of the cables connecting Ireland and the UK. Edward Burke, an assistant professor in the history of war at University College Dublin, told the Examiner the situation was alarming. \u201cOnce again we see the Russian navy probing the defences of western Europe. It\u2019s yet another wake-up call \u2013 one that we shouldn\u2019t need \u2013 that Ireland needs to bolster its naval capabilities and deepen its maritime security partnerships in Europe,\u201d he said. It is understood defence forces in Ireland observed the ship operating three drones over Irish waters, raising fears it was conducting surveillance. Concerns over critical infrastructure around Europe have been raised on multiple occasions this year after the alleged sabotage of the Baltic gas pipeline and undersea internet cables between Finland and Estonia. In August, China admitted that a Hong Kong-flagged ship damaged the pipeline but said it was accidental. The Yantar is officially classed as an auxiliary general oceanographic research vessel with underwater rescue capabilities. It is tasked by an arm of the Russian defence ministry and is separate from its navy. It can deploy deep-diving submersibles and has been seen operating close to seabed infrastructure on a number of occasions by open source intelligence analysts, according to Navy Lookout intelligence analysts. The analysts said the ship\u2019s mission was \u201cprobably more about strategic signalling and intelligence gathering\u201d than sabotage. Irish and British defence forces have worked together since the vessels entered waters off the coast of the UK with a significant multinational operation put in place. The Yantar was travelling with Golovko and a tanker, Vyazma, and both vessels were monitored throughout their journey in the English channel by RFA Tideforce and HMS Iron Duke. They then handed over surveillance to the French as it headed out of the English channel with the British navy also shadowing another Russian vessel heading north towards the Baltics. When the Yantar broke away from the Golovko and headed north into the Irish sea, it was shadowed by HMS Cattistock, with the operation becoming public when the ship activated its automatic identification for about four minutes on Thursday when it was south of the Isle of Man. According to reports, it switched off its transponders transmitting its position after entering the Irish EEZ but the Irish vessel continued to shadow it. They tried to make contact with the ship but Russian personnel did not respond and at about 3am on Friday it left the waters and headed south.",

      "body": "<p>Nobody\u2019s home. Not in the young woman with the big headphones cycling against the light. Not in the person in the middle of the crossing staring at their phone, or the person talking to someone who\u2019s not there and ignoring the one they\u2019re pushing in the baby carriage, or the distracted driver who doesn\u2019t seem to notice those cyclists and pedestrians. So I move through a world of people who are not all the way there and sometimes hardly there at all \u2013 and who don\u2019t seem to want anyone else to be there either.</p> <p>Aversion to direct contact with others has become so normal in my home town \u2013 San Francisco, a city swallowed up by Silicon Valley \u2013 that I\u2019ve become avoidant myself after too many encounters with people who seem to find it bafflingly transgressive to engage with any casual remark or question from a stranger, and mostly fail to respond. I wander in a city that feels ghostly, depopulated, even when bodies are on the street, and I feel like a ghost myself in the lack of acknowledgment, in others\u2019 blank reluctance to utter even those tiny \u201cexcuse me\u201d negotiations to get around someone or warn someone.</p> <p>The pandemic emptied out the streets, but this is another kind of emptiness \u2013 it often seems as though fewer people are out and about, but also the people still present are a lot less present. Had this happened overnight it would be a sci-fi horror movie scenario \u2013 people seeming numbed, dazed, their attention captured and manipulated by the contents of tiny devices controlled by powerful corporations, a billion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/11/the-manchurian-candidate-one-of-cinemas-greatest-paranoid-thrillers-still-resonates\">Manchurian candidates</a> in a wifi-equipped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/27/ive-never-seen-metropolis-fritz-lang-film\">Metropolis</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/night-of-the-living-dead\">Night of the Living Dead</a> to You. But it\u2019s happened so incrementally it\u2019s become normal for us all to be in that limbo, that bardo.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>All of which is to say, welcome to my zombie movie, which I daresay is also yours to some extent. San Francisco still has its walkable, dense cityscape, but no longer the sense \u2013 especially among the young and affluent \u2013 that it is a place you belong to by connecting. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I am not confident the people I pass by would do anything more than take out their phones to record an assault, if they noticed at all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rightwing tech bros and conservative media have pushed hard at the idea that San Francisco is a scary, dangerous place to walk around in, so much so that when a friend came to the city, his Lyft driver repeated the idea that he \u2013 a tall, fit ex-New Yorker \u2013 should quail at the idea of traversing our streets. They are, in one way, a little more dangerous: if people out in public keep each other safe as potential witnesses and participants, the withdrawal from paying attention, the reluctance to intervene, makes us less safe. I am not confident a lot of the people I pass by would do anything more than take out their phones to record an assault, if they noticed and stopped at all. And, after decades of decline, pedestrian fatalities have risen nationwide at the hands of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/11/upshot/nighttime-deaths.html\">distracted drivers</a> (the extent to which distracted pedestrians also play a role has been less studied and, of course, the arguments for the driverless cars now cruising around San Francisco could be that we need this technology because we\u2019ve been captured by another one). So maybe it <em>is</em> less safe, not for the reasons they claim, but for reasons they\u2019re complicit in.</p> <p>A lot of people seem to move through the streets as though they\u2019re somehow both hostile and boring, and they <em>are</em> more boring now that people around us are less engaged and more enterprises are outlets of corporate chains such as Starbucks and Walgreens, so there\u2019s nothing distinctive or local and no one lasting to get to know.</p> <p>The desire to withdraw, to seek smoothness and avoid the potential friction of contact, arises from the view that nonparticipation is self-protection, in contrast to the older idea that being urban is a participatory sport. Promenading, strolling to see and be seen, was a celebrated, desired part of urban life in the 19th and much of the 20th century, whether it meant showing off your Sunday finery on the boulevard or cruising the sidestreets under cover of darkness in search of erotic opportunities. The films of an earlier era feature jaunty boulevardiers or lady flaneurs moving from&nbsp;encounter to encounter. The detectives in classic film noir movies are masterful because they know cops,&nbsp;cabbies, bartenders, reporters, crooks, nightclub hat-check girls and everyone in between. They\u2019re love songs to cities that are made out of connections and circulation. It\u2019s true that after the golden age of such movies, we in the US had a few decades of high urban street crime, now long over; true that police have always been a menace to Black people, men to women \u2013 but the conviviality of the Black neighbourhood I lived in in the 80s, and the nearby gay neighbourhood I wandered through then, was real and, despite my own youthful experiences with street harassment, I have never stopped walking&nbsp;the city.</p> <p>Democracy itself is based in trust in strangers and a sense of having something in common with them (which is part of why xenophobia and fear of crime serve fascist agendas so well). Circulating freely among them \u2013 especially in the diverse places most cities are \u2013 helps inculcate this feeling; it gives you a sense of confidence, of being able to coexist with difference. It orients you, literally, and it\u2019s very useful knowledge in an emergency. That\u2019s what\u2019s celebrated in those old movies and shunned in the rhetoric and designs of the new technologies.</p> <p>I suspect a lot of people are now if not outright disoriented, not really oriented to where they live. Unlike using a map to find your way, which gradually becomes superfluous as you internalise it, using an app means obeying instructions without grasping the&nbsp;underlying geography, so you never really learn where you are. As someone who learned to navigate several cities and regions before smartphones came in, I wonder about the spatial blur the phone-reliant inhabit, the lack of a mental picture of the terrain. As San Francisco awaits its next big earthquake, I also wonder how my most tech-dependent neighbours will cope when it comes and electricity, and likely cell phone towers, fail.</p> <p>This navigational withdrawal, like the others, is egged on by the new technologies, in part because it\u2019s useful to them if everything we do is mediated by a product they\u2019re selling, either directly because we bought the phone or paid for the service plan, or indirectly because, as the tech adage goes, \u201cif it\u2019s free, you\u2019re the product\u201d. When you\u2019re on social media or using a search engine, it\u2019s harvesting your data and collecting revenue from pushing targeted ads at you, unless you went through the acrobatics of opting out.</p> <p>Some of the old points of connection have disappeared \u2013 automatic toll machines replace the people in booths, self-checkout replaces the cash register, renewing your car registration, bill-paying and banking can be done online, as can buying almost anything. Other connection points are still there, but shunned. There\u2019s a Middle Eastern deli run by a really nice guy I go to sometimes \u2013 the first time I went in he gave me some free falafel while I waited; he\u2019s greeted me warmly every time since, but these days on the tables are signs for \u201ccontactless ordering\u201d, in case you want to scan the QR code right there because walking the few steps up to the counter and speaking would be too much. Many restaurants have put their menus online and offer a QR code to access it even when you\u2019re there in person, a dismal way to find out what\u2019s on offer; a San Francisco mall has signs on its entrances offering a QR code to find out its hours, rather than simply putting them on the signs; sometimes filtering things through phones seems reflexive, even when direct information is easy to come by.</p> <p>Of course, you can just order takeaway and avoid contact almost entirely. I had a startling experience last year in a Mexican restaurant here \u2013 it was half-empty when we sat down and ordered dinner; an hour later it turned out our food hadn\u2019t come because our order came in after dozens of online orders, which were being filled first. The kitchen was very busy, but not for those there in person. The takeaway boom, which works by pressuring restaurants to cut prices for the tech companies running the services carried out by underpaid workers, has created its own in-between, in which neither the creative labour of cooking your own dinner nor the gregariousness of eating out occurs.</p> <p>In between the wholly public space of city streets and parks and the entirely private space of home are the workplaces, cafes, restaurants and other social spaces in decline in various ways. For example, Silicon Valley has provided both the technology and the arguments for working from home, which has emptied out San Francisco\u2019s centre and made it something of a ghost town, with the ripple effect of bankrupting sandwich shops and retail establishments there. (Cafes in this city had too often become de facto workplaces in which freelancers were silently absorbed in their screens, which prompted some to stop offering wifi and others to stop offering anything but takeaway drinks.) I recognise the benefits of being spared some of the lousy aspects of in-person work, including time-consuming commutes and related emissions, office attire, workplace sexual harassment. But it\u2019s happened without much discussion of what else occurs in the workplace besides work, including friendships, mentorships, conversations, human contact and informal and formal worker solidarity. This is part of a larger shift towards pursuing the quantifiable \u2013 productivity, efficiency, profitability \u2013 while overlooking or devaluing the unquantifiable.</p> <p>The science journalist Victoria Atkinson <a href=\"https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/celebrating-the-coffee-break/4018987.article?utm_source=Live+Audience&amp;amp;utm_campaign=733b72da19-nature-briefing-weekly-20241018&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_b27a691814-733b72da19-49735100\">wrote recently</a> in praise of the coffee break. She states that in the labs she used to work in as a chemist, \u201cfrom the very beginning of my time to now, years after leaving, I have found these pauses from work one of the most productive uses of my time\u201d. This is because in the conversations around her when she was starting out, \u201cI began to pick up the little bits and pieces of knowledge that make lab work quicker and easier \u2013 the kind of advice and information you\u2019d never find in a paper or a departmental handbook.\u201d She adds that \u201cmore than once, a suggestion over coffee led to an important breakthrough\u201d and as she became more experienced, she became one of the participants offering, as well as receiving, guidance and took pleasure in that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907d4317064f37b045ec3b042efd7787a06520b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907d4317064f37b045ec3b042efd7787a06520b3/5_244_541_676/400.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of zombies in a ruined San Francisco looking at their phones\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a small jump from there to the fact that the workplace once featured prominently among the ways couples used to meet. In the 80s, according to one study, the second most common way couples met was through work. Of course, now it\u2019s primarily through online means, notably dating apps (and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/23/dating-app-privacy-data/\">most of them</a> are harvesting your data for sale to third parties). I\u2019m all for love, but the rise of online services reflects the decline of other means of connecting. As unmediated in-person places and experiences get undermined by technology, we become yet more dependent on the technology, and that\u2019s part of the horror movie.</p> <p>At the gym a few months ago, I spent at least 15 minutes waiting for a guy to get off the weight machine I wanted to use, a guy who would do a desultory short set of reps, then sit on the device scrolling through Grindr. The annoyance wasn\u2019t so much that he was shopping for sex as that, for an exceptionally long stretch, he was doing something a lot of people in this gym do: use their phones to distract themselves between sets, but also to stay in the bubble that justifies their obliviousness to the people waiting for them to be finished. The mobile phone is not only a device offering you things to pay attention to but also offers you a way <em>not</em> to pay attention to other things.</p> <p>I could have forced Grindr guy to shake out of his trance and let me take a turn, but it would have been so unwelcome an act that I gave up instead. It was not my job to make someone who was wilfully anywhere-but-here show up. I suspect all these things are worse because I live in a city annexed by Silicon Valley, and I\u2019ve lately found more civic joy in New York City and in Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico. But the affliction is worldwide, and you\u2019re in it, too.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Vampires have devoured our attention and left us the ghosts of public and civic and community life. Tech has sold us not only the capacity to withdraw but the logic of it, with the rhetoric \u2013 at least since the late 90s dotcom boom and the birth of online shopping and banking \u2013 that insists leaving the house, milling around, talking to strangers, going to your bank or the post office, or even eating out in a restaurant is inconvenient, unpleasant, unnecessary and possibly dangerous.</p> <p>Some of the justification for the withdrawal seems to be efficiency \u2013 the capitalist sense that time is money and you need to hoard the former so you can work incessantly to earn the latter. Another piece of it is the idea that the activities of daily life are so tedious and burdensome that you should try to avoid them.

      "bodyText": "Nobody\u2019s home. Not in the young woman with the big headphones cycling against the light. Not in the person in the middle of the crossing staring at their phone, or the person talking to someone who\u2019s not there and ignoring the one they\u2019re pushing in the baby carriage, or the distracted driver who doesn\u2019t seem to notice those cyclists and pedestrians. So I move through a world of people who are not all the way there and sometimes hardly there at all \u2013 and who don\u2019t seem to want anyone else to be there either. Aversion to direct contact with others has become so normal in my home town \u2013 San Francisco, a city swallowed up by Silicon Valley \u2013 that I\u2019ve become avoidant myself after too many encounters with people who seem to find it bafflingly transgressive to engage with any casual remark or question from a stranger, and mostly fail to respond. I wander in a city that feels ghostly, depopulated, even when bodies are on the street, and I feel like a ghost myself in the lack of acknowledgment, in others\u2019 blank reluctance to utter even those tiny \u201cexcuse me\u201d negotiations to get around someone or warn someone. The pandemic emptied out the streets, but this is another kind of emptiness \u2013 it often seems as though fewer people are out and about, but also the people still present are a lot less present. Had this happened overnight it would be a sci-fi horror movie scenario \u2013 people seeming numbed, dazed, their attention captured and manipulated by the contents of tiny devices controlled by powerful corporations, a billion Manchurian candidates in a wifi-equipped Metropolis. A Night of the Living Dead to You. But it\u2019s happened so incrementally it\u2019s become normal for us all to be in that limbo, that bardo. * * * All of which is to say, welcome to my zombie movie, which I daresay is also yours to some extent. San Francisco still has its walkable, dense cityscape, but no longer the sense \u2013 especially among the young and affluent \u2013 that it is a place you belong to by connecting. Rightwing tech bros and conservative media have pushed hard at the idea that San Francisco is a scary, dangerous place to walk around in, so much so that when a friend came to the city, his Lyft driver repeated the idea that he \u2013 a tall, fit ex-New Yorker \u2013 should quail at the idea of traversing our streets. They are, in one way, a little more dangerous: if people out in public keep each other safe as potential witnesses and participants, the withdrawal from paying attention, the reluctance to intervene, makes us less safe. I am not confident a lot of the people I pass by would do anything more than take out their phones to record an assault, if they noticed and stopped at all. And, after decades of decline, pedestrian fatalities have risen nationwide at the hands of distracted drivers (the extent to which distracted pedestrians also play a role has been less studied and, of course, the arguments for the driverless cars now cruising around San Francisco could be that we need this technology because we\u2019ve been captured by another one). So maybe it is less safe, not for the reasons they claim, but for reasons they\u2019re complicit in. A lot of people seem to move through the streets as though they\u2019re somehow both hostile and boring, and they are more boring now that people around us are less engaged and more enterprises are outlets of corporate chains such as Starbucks and Walgreens, so there\u2019s nothing distinctive or local and no one lasting to get to know. The desire to withdraw, to seek smoothness and avoid the potential friction of contact, arises from the view that nonparticipation is self-protection, in contrast to the older idea that being urban is a participatory sport. Promenading, strolling to see and be seen, was a celebrated, desired part of urban life in the 19th and much of the 20th century, whether it meant showing off your Sunday finery on the boulevard or cruising the sidestreets under cover of darkness in search of erotic opportunities. The films of an earlier era feature jaunty boulevardiers or lady flaneurs moving from encounter to encounter. The detectives in classic film noir movies are masterful because they know cops, cabbies, bartenders, reporters, crooks, nightclub hat-check girls and everyone in between. They\u2019re love songs to cities that are made out of connections and circulation. It\u2019s true that after the golden age of such movies, we in the US had a few decades of high urban street crime, now long over; true that police have always been a menace to Black people, men to women \u2013 but the conviviality of the Black neighbourhood I lived in in the 80s, and the nearby gay neighbourhood I wandered through then, was real and, despite my own youthful experiences with street harassment, I have never stopped walking the city. Democracy itself is based in trust in strangers and a sense of having something in common with them (which is part of why xenophobia and fear of crime serve fascist agendas so well). Circulating freely among them \u2013 especially in the diverse places most cities are \u2013 helps inculcate this feeling; it gives you a sense of confidence, of being able to coexist with difference. It orients you, literally, and it\u2019s very useful knowledge in an emergency. That\u2019s what\u2019s celebrated in those old movies and shunned in the rhetoric and designs of the new technologies. I suspect a lot of people are now if not outright disoriented, not really oriented to where they live. Unlike using a map to find your way, which gradually becomes superfluous as you internalise it, using an app means obeying instructions without grasping the underlying geography, so you never really learn where you are. As someone who learned to navigate several cities and regions before smartphones came in, I wonder about the spatial blur the phone-reliant inhabit, the lack of a mental picture of the terrain. As San Francisco awaits its next big earthquake, I also wonder how my most tech-dependent neighbours will cope when it comes and electricity, and likely cell phone towers, fail. This navigational withdrawal, like the others, is egged on by the new technologies, in part because it\u2019s useful to them if everything we do is mediated by a product they\u2019re selling, either directly because we bought the phone or paid for the service plan, or indirectly because, as the tech adage goes, \u201cif it\u2019s free, you\u2019re the product\u201d. When you\u2019re on social media or using a search engine, it\u2019s harvesting your data and collecting revenue from pushing targeted ads at you, unless you went through the acrobatics of opting out. Some of the old points of connection have disappeared \u2013 automatic toll machines replace the people in booths, self-checkout replaces the cash register, renewing your car registration, bill-paying and banking can be done online, as can buying almost anything. Other connection points are still there, but shunned. There\u2019s a Middle Eastern deli run by a really nice guy I go to sometimes \u2013 the first time I went in he gave me some free falafel while I waited; he\u2019s greeted me warmly every time since, but these days on the tables are signs for \u201ccontactless ordering\u201d, in case you want to scan the QR code right there because walking the few steps up to the counter and speaking would be too much. Many restaurants have put their menus online and offer a QR code to access it even when you\u2019re there in person, a dismal way to find out what\u2019s on offer; a San Francisco mall has signs on its entrances offering a QR code to find out its hours, rather than simply putting them on the signs; sometimes filtering things through phones seems reflexive, even when direct information is easy to come by. Of course, you can just order takeaway and avoid contact almost entirely. I had a startling experience last year in a Mexican restaurant here \u2013 it was half-empty when we sat down and ordered dinner; an hour later it turned out our food hadn\u2019t come because our order came in after dozens of online orders, which were being filled first. The kitchen was very busy, but not for those there in person. The takeaway boom, which works by pressuring restaurants to cut prices for the tech companies running the services carried out by underpaid workers, has created its own in-between, in which neither the creative labour of cooking your own dinner nor the gregariousness of eating out occurs. In between the wholly public space of city streets and parks and the entirely private space of home are the workplaces, cafes, restaurants and other social spaces in decline in various ways. For example, Silicon Valley has provided both the technology and the arguments for working from home, which has emptied out San Francisco\u2019s centre and made it something of a ghost town, with the ripple effect of bankrupting sandwich shops and retail establishments there. (Cafes in this city had too often become de facto workplaces in which freelancers were silently absorbed in their screens, which prompted some to stop offering wifi and others to stop offering anything but takeaway drinks.) I recognise the benefits of being spared some of the lousy aspects of in-person work, including time-consuming commutes and related emissions, office attire, workplace sexual harassment. But it\u2019s happened without much discussion of what else occurs in the workplace besides work, including friendships, mentorships, conversations, human contact and informal and formal worker solidarity. This is part of a larger shift towards pursuing the quantifiable \u2013 productivity, efficiency, profitability \u2013 while overlooking or devaluing the unquantifiable. The science journalist Victoria Atkinson wrote recently in praise of the coffee break. She states that in the labs she used to work in as a chemist, \u201cfrom the very beginning of my time to now, years after leaving, I have found these pauses from work one of the most productive uses of my time\u201d. This is because in the conversations around her when she was starting out, \u201cI began to pick up the little bits and pieces of knowledge that make lab work quicker and easier \u2013 the kind of advice and information you\u2019d never find in a paper or a departmental handbook.\u201d She adds that \u201cmore than once, a suggestion over coffee led to an important breakthrough\u201d and as she became more experienced, she became one of the participants offering, as well as receiving, guidance and took pleasure in that. It\u2019s a small jump from there to the fact that the workplace once featured prominently among the ways couples used to meet. In the 80s, according to one study, the second most common way couples met was through work. Of course, now it\u2019s primarily through online means, notably dating apps (and most of them are harvesting your data for sale to third parties). I\u2019m all for love, but the rise of online services reflects the decline of other means of connecting. As unmediated in-person places and experiences get undermined by technology, we become yet more dependent on the technology, and that\u2019s part of the horror movie. At the gym a few months ago, I spent at least 15 minutes waiting for a guy to get off the weight machine I wanted to use, a guy who would do a desultory short set of reps, then sit on the device scrolling through Grindr. The annoyance wasn\u2019t so much that he was shopping for sex as that, for an exceptionally long stretch, he was doing something a lot of people in this gym do: use their phones to distract themselves between sets, but also to stay in the bubble that justifies their obliviousness to the people waiting for them to be finished. The mobile phone is not only a device offering you things to pay attention to but also offers you a way not to pay attention to other things. I could have forced Grindr guy to shake out of his trance and let me take a turn, but it would have been so unwelcome an act that I gave up instead. It was not my job to make someone who was wilfully anywhere-but-here show up. I suspect all these things are worse because I live in a city annexed by Silicon Valley, and I\u2019ve lately found more civic joy in New York City and in Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico. But the affliction is worldwide, and you\u2019re in it, too. * * * Vampires have devoured our attention and left us the ghosts of public and civic and community life. Tech has sold us not only the capacity to withdraw but the logic of it, with the rhetoric \u2013 at least since the late 90s dotcom boom and the birth of online shopping and banking \u2013 that insists leaving the house, milling around, talking to strangers, going to your bank or the post office, or even eating out in a restaurant is inconvenient, unpleasant, unnecessary and possibly dangerous. Some of the justification for the withdrawal seems to be efficiency \u2013 the capitalist sense that time is money and you need to hoard the former so you can work incessantly to earn the latter. Another piece of it is the idea that the activities of daily life are so tedious and burdensome that you should try to avoid them. There are upscale counter-narratives that sometimes penetrate \u2013 think of baking sourdough bread during the pandemic, or knitting, or growing tomatoes, things that are not about getting ahead economically, but are about reconnecting to manual skills and activities, to seeing a process through rather than just getting the product, to slowing down rather than speeding up. In Zen training, just sweeping or washing the dishes can be an occasion for mindfulness, and being fully present \u2013 just doing that one thing with full attention, not being half there and half elsewhere \u2013 is an important part of the practice. Tech, by contrast, promotes ghosting your own embodied life and the systems that support it (though it also offers mindfulness apps you can install on your phone). The people designing and promoting and profiting off those technologies genuinely seem to both shun the turbulent, unpredictable world out there and to believe substitutes for direct and authentic human contact and experience are as good as the real thing \u2013 all the way down to virtual reality, virtual girlfriends and AI therapists. There is no shortage of actual human beings, but society is increasingly organised \u2013 in no small part by these merchants of withdrawal \u2013 to make it harder to connect, which becomes the justification for pushing these substitutes. We\u2019re now in the midst of an international loneliness pandemic whose impact on mental \u2013 and even physical \u2013 health, as well as happiness, is now a subject of medical concern. If you object that we\u2019re not in a zombie movie because there are no brain-eating cannibals, let me reassure you, there are. The corporations are devouring our attention, and chewing our lives down to the bone to get at our data. They have shown their ruthlessness in what they offer as long as they capture us and extract our attention, information and other assets from us. And the harm is real. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta (parent company of Facebook and Instagram) turned a blind eye to Facebook Messenger being used for the Rohingya genocide a few years back or for organising extremist militias on Facebook now. Meta\u2019s Instagram is clearly fine with teenage body issues, social anxiety and suicides as long as the profits roll in, and the same goes for X and TikTok when it comes to misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, or YouTube with algorithms pushing extremist content. All these sites have been used to corrupt elections, and X owner Elon Musk himself promoted extremist content and misinformation as he toiled to elect Donald Trump.

At the far end of this nightmare is China\u2019s Orwellian surveillance society, in which few activities are free of government oversight and violation of the rules leads to dire consequences.

      "body": "<p>I met Philippa Brewster in 1983. She was a commissioning editor at Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul \u2013 in&nbsp;those days an independent London publisher, specialising in nonfiction. Philippa had been given the go-ahead by RKP to launch Pandora Press. Back&nbsp;then, publishing was a male-dominated industry. Editors were men, authors were men, reviewers were men. This was normal. Feminism had begun to change the normal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/virago\">Virago</a> led the field in 1973, initially republishing female writers whose work had gone out of print. The Women\u2019s Press, founded in 1978, was more directly political, and interested in the work of women of colour whose voices were not heard. Philippa saw a&nbsp;gap in the market for a nonfiction imprint covering history, biography, travel, cultural studies \u2013 the kind of books she was already championing as an editor, now given the boost of their own brand and a marketing budget.</p> <p>Pandora advertised for a publicity director. I had no idea what this meant. I was 23, and my CV, such as it was, was in theatre. But I got an interview. Philippa sat at her desk, elegant and humorous, and saw at once that I was not fit for purpose. I realised it too. She took me back downstairs, where my bike was chained to a lamp-post, and I&nbsp;started to tell her about my idea for a&nbsp;novel, with chapters that followed the first seven books of the Bible. Philippa had been raised Catholic, and educated at St Mary\u2019s Convent, Ascot. She knew all about the Bible, and as we stood on the street, I rambled on with stories about Winterson world, that peculiar planet of my upbringing.</p>    <p>My adoptive parents were Pentecostal. I was supposed to be a missionary. In Accrington, Lancashire, in our terrace house with no bathroom, books were forbidden, unless they were religious. I left home at 16, because I had no choice. I had fallen in&nbsp;love with another girl.</p> <p>Philippa asked why it wouldn\u2019t be nonfiction. It was an astute question. I had told her I would use my own name \u2013 Jeanette \u2013 for the main character. I&nbsp;said I wanted to go beyond biography. Too limiting. Too obvious. And as all adopted children know, there\u2019s a story hidden behind the story. We arrive in our life after it has begun. The first few pages are torn out. This discomfort set me wondering about how I could tell who I am \u2026 in both senses of the word.</p> <p>I solved it by learning to read myself as a fiction as well as a fact. This meant I could rewrite, overwrite, and go on writing myself. It was the only way out of a set of circumstances that would otherwise have crushed me. \u201cI discovered this in the library,\u201d I told her \u2013 beginning yet another riff on the insights gleaned from the shelves of English Literature in Prose A-Z.</p> <p>Philippa said: \u201cIf you can write it the way you tell it, I\u2019ll buy it.\u201d</p> <p>I cycled home to Kentish Town, counted my cash, and bought a huge, secondhand office typewriter \u2013 the kind that used cassette ribbons. That, plus Alpine quantities of Tipp-Ex, produced the chapters that became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/08/oranges-only-fruit-jeanette-winterson\">Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit</a>.</p> <p>Months later, I set off back to Store Street, just off Tottenham Court Road, with a manuscript in my saddlebag. I&nbsp;couldn\u2019t afford to get it photocopied, and as Philippa was at lunch with a&nbsp;real author, I refused to hand it over&nbsp;at&nbsp;reception, sitting there until she came back.</p> <p>The person she came back with was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/19/dale-spender-obituary\">Dale Spender</a> \u2013 pioneering feminist thinker and writer.

      "bodyText": "I met Philippa Brewster in 1983. She was a commissioning editor at Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul \u2013 in those days an independent London publisher, specialising in nonfiction. Philippa had been given the go-ahead by RKP to launch Pandora Press. Back then, publishing was a male-dominated industry. Editors were men, authors were men, reviewers were men. This was normal. Feminism had begun to change the normal. Virago led the field in 1973, initially republishing female writers whose work had gone out of print. The Women\u2019s Press, founded in 1978, was more directly political, and interested in the work of women of colour whose voices were not heard. Philippa saw a gap in the market for a nonfiction imprint covering history, biography, travel, cultural studies \u2013 the kind of books she was already championing as an editor, now given the boost of their own brand and a marketing budget. Pandora advertised for a publicity director. I had no idea what this meant. I was 23, and my CV, such as it was, was in theatre. But I got an interview. Philippa sat at her desk, elegant and humorous, and saw at once that I was not fit for purpose. I realised it too.

Historian Alice Loxton points to other Tudor treasures that were not used in the filming, but also make for inspirational visits. \u201cKnole near Sevenoaks, where Henry used to hunt, is a particular favourite of mine, and the Mary Rose museum in Portsmouth.\u201d She ascribes the enduring allure of the Tudors to larger-than-life characters, political intrigue and dramatic power struggles. \u201cBut the entire Wolf Hall series has breathed new life into our fascination with the period and its locations.\u201d The Mirror and the Light closes with the execution of Thomas Cromwell in 1540, a victim, it\u2019s presumed, of trumped-up charges. But for anyone who worries about the longevity of autocracies, there is a tiny scrap of comfort in the fact that within seven years his despotic tormentor was gone too.",

But another trend could be more consequential: when citizens stood up across red, blue and purple states this year with reforms designed to strengthen democracy and make all elections more meaningful and competitive, the parties undermined them with brutal, deceptive tactics and submerged them in a swamp of dark money. It worked nearly every time. Unlike 2018, when pro-democracy reforms won big nationwide, this time, reformers were routed. This is frightening news. The vast majority of states \u2013 even the purple ones \u2013 are either safely Republican or Democratic, or have been gerrymandered that way.

They need open primaries,\u201d claimed one of the most ridiculous and misleading, but effective, mailers. Leonard Leo\u2019s billion-dollar dark-money network \u2013 which, after capturing the US supreme court and multiple levels of the judiciary, has now cast its eye on locking in far-right minority rule in the states \u2013 dispatched its operatives to mislead voters with one dishonest claim after another about ranked-choice voting. In one especially rich claim, opponents funded by billionaires and the wealthiest rightwing foundations have created front groups to argue that ranked-choice voting would make it easier for the wealthy to buy elections. The true agenda is clear: to protect and defend extreme lawmakers who perform best in base-driven primaries with multiple candidates and a small, divided electorate. That\u2019s why a constellation of groups with ever-shifting names \u2013 but with the same far-right foundations and even election deniers behind them \u2013 have engaged in this multimillion-dollar scare operation. In Nevada, both Democrats and Republicans (and their aligned groups) spent millions in a successful effort to defeat open primaries and ranked choice. The state\u2019s political elites \u2013 the still powerful machine built by the late senator Harry Reid and the Maga state Republican apparatus \u2013 built an odd coalition to brand a heretofore popular political reform, incorrectly, as \u201cunproven\u201d and \u201ccomplicated\u201d. Some Colorado Democrats, and even advocates of ranked-choice voting elsewhere such as Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, sadly swallowed Leo\u2019s talking points whole to ensure the party retained power in this growing Democratic bastion where a record half of registered voters are unaffiliated. Perhaps what\u2019s happening here is no surprise. Citizens want to reclaim state legislatures that have been distorted by gerrymandering and captured by unrepresentative winners of party primaries. The powerful want to close off one of the last avenues for reform. After all, Ohio\u2019s unbreakable gerrymander, now in its 14th year, is so extreme that only four of 99 state house races were within five points this year, and just one of 17 state senate races. Uncompetitive elections push all the action to low-turnout primaries, where the tiniest percentage of the base can select unrepresentative candidates to coast into the general \u2013 and then advance unpopular legislation such a six-week abortion ban once in office. Ohio\u2019s supreme court rejected the state house and congressional maps as unconstitutional not once, not twice, but seven times. A cowed governor, Mike DeWine, conceded that the maps could have been \u201cmore clearly constitutional\u201d, but went along with the party line anyway.

Then, when courts and determined citizens pushed forward anyway, the legislature drowned them out with the support of organizations funded not only by Leonard Leo but also the Koch brothers, the Bradley Foundation and DonorsTrust (\u201cthe dark-money ATM of the right\u201d). There was one significant bright spot last Tuesday: Washington DC, which overwhelmingly adopted ranked-choice voting despite some misleading efforts by officials from the district\u2019s dominant Democratic party. But the simple truth is that the structural reform we so desperately need has become harder, as those from both the left and the right who prefer to govern without majorities, and without persuading everyone to their side, recognize it as a threat. They won\u2019t stop here, and they have said so.

Police launched an investigation in April after at least 12 men with links to Westminster received unsolicited messages from an account posing as aliases \u201cCharlie\u201d and \u2018\u201cAbi\u201d. The fake accounts were allegedly engaged in a sophisticated scam designed to trick MPs and other figures in political circles into sending explicit pictures and other private or sensitive information. Wragg, who was the MP for Hazel Grove, told the Times in April that he gave out the personal phone numbers of colleagues after he had sent intimate pictures of himself, saying he was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cmortified\u201d. But unlike others who had been scammed by the accounts, Wragg approached \u201cCharlie\u201d himself after spotting the profile on Grindr, believing it to be a real person. Wragg claimed he felt threatened and under pressure to share the phone numbers and personal information of his Westminster colleagues with the mystery account, fearing that the catfish would leak his intimate images in retaliation if he did not comply. In an interview with the BBC, Wragg said he spotted the first news articles about the Westminster honeytrap scandal on the train. He told the broadcaster: \u201cMy stomach just dropped.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Helen</strong></h2> <p>The night I first met Lexy, I was supposed to be going on a date. I was 25 and had yet to really make friends since moving to London, so when she asked me for a drink I said yes. The Guardian tended to hire only one young reporter a year in those days, and Lexy was the fresh face for 2006 (I was 2004 \u2013 it had been a rather lonely first two years).</p> <p>She had just returned from living in Paris and exuded a certain French cool. Her wardrobe seemed to have been sourced almost entirely from a little vintage shop in the Marais, which would have made her insufferable were it not fatally undermined by her coming from Skelmersdale, the least glamorous town in the Lancashire coalfields. She was funny and clever and generous with her compliments (I was thrilled when she said she liked my shoes \u2013 metallic blue-and-silver Mary Janes) and when I reluctantly trotted off on my date, I spent the night wishing I was back with her instead.</p> <p>Everything was more fun with Lexy. There is something very special about making a best friend in early adulthood, when your brain is fully developed and your personality formed but your responsibilities do not extend beyond paying the rent and turning up to work on time. You\u2019re not mates simply because your names went after each other in the register, or because you were lumped together in the same university halls. Lexy and I were kindred spirits: the babies of the Guardian newsroom, two blonde northerners let loose in noughties London. She soon became both my biggest cheerleader and harshest critic \u2013 two essential attributes for any proper pal.</p> <p>We spent our days scribbling shorthand at the Old Bailey and our nights out in east London, often on some sort of manhunt, despite us preferring each other to any boy on the market. She generally had far more success, but occasionally the stars aligned for us both. I used to enjoy the mornings-after as much as the nights themselves, as we howled with laughter at whatever nonsense we had been up to until the early hours. We never liked it when the other got a boyfriend: she was furious with me when&nbsp;a snog at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/23/popandrock.camdencrawl\">Camden Crawl</a> turned into a relationship just before what she&nbsp;had pre-emptively called our \u201csummer of fun\u201d. Direct quote: \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined <em>everything</em>.\u201d</p> <p>A favourite haunt was the Birdcage, a Hackney pub with a karaoke machine that attracted both indie sleaze mavens and proper East Enders. One night we used our appalling pool-playing to attract the attention of a promising young duo: a Swede for Lexy, and, for me, a rough diamond I thought was going to be my first cockney conquest but whose mother, it later transpired, was a feature writer at the Telegraph.</p>    <p>I don\u2019t remember talking about having kids much when we were in our 20s. I just assumed we would both have as many as we fancied when the time was right. When she got pregnant, at 34, I\u2019d spent a few years living&nbsp;abroad and had moved to Manchester. I was happy for her but also, frankly, jealous. My long-term relationship had come to a calamitous end and, at 33, I was panicking about my own reproductive window slamming shut.</p> <p>Everybody seemed to be having babies except me. My response, I realise now, was to try to make my life more exciting. I made new friends: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/23/everythings-more-fun-with-my-cherry-red-keytar-the-christmas-present-ill-never-forget\">hedonists</a> who could go away outside the school holidays and could make a plan without having to factor in nap times. I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/09/my-syrian-refugee-lodger-helen-pidd\">invited a Syrian refugee</a> to live with me for six months, went on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2015/sep/08/rapha-manchester-to-london-2015-long-distance-cycling\">ridiculously long bike rides</a>, and upped my extracurricular antics, doing everything Lexy no longer could.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When her son turned one, she invited me to the party and I sat in her kitchen, the only woman without a baby on her knee</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not long after her son was born, I was staying with her in London for a few days and one night simply didn\u2019t go back, partaking instead in an ill-advised sleepover at the opposite end of the tube map. On the slightly melancholy ride home, I tried to dampen down my regret by thinking to myself, \u201cWell, Lexy can\u2019t do this any more!\u201d (Nor, it has to be said, did she want to). I still have a photo I took of myself holding her baby when I got in, my eyes bloodshot and the previous night\u2019s mascara smudged under each eye. Looking at that photo now, I&nbsp;see someone trying a bit <em>too</em> hard to have fun.</p> <p>I was thrilled when she asked me to be her son\u2019s god(less)mother but resented her new NCT friends, worrying they would replace me. When her son turned one, she invited me to the party and I sat in her kitchen, the only woman without a baby on her knee, and felt like a barren alien. She used to insist she liked not talking about child-rearing with me, that I talked to her about interesting things. But it was the first time that I felt excluded from any part of her life. She used to tell me everything: now I was only getting half the story.</p> <p>The half was not what it used to be, either. I&nbsp;am old enough now to realise that all new mothers are too knackered for the first year(s) to do anything other than keep their babies alive. But the truth is that having a baby doesn\u2019t make anyone more interesting. It softens some people and toughens others up. But the all-encompassing nature of parenthood, particularly for mothers in the early years, means there is neither time nor energy to discuss anything else. I wouldn\u2019t say I found Lexy boring, but there was basically nothing to report apart from how tired she was and how hard breastfeeding is. </p> <p>In the decade since my friends began breeding in earnest, some have more or less disappeared from my life. Maybe they just didn\u2019t value me that much anyway. But there comes a point when you are doing all the running in a friendship that you start to feel bitter. I&nbsp;give every parent a pass for the first few years. After that, if you want to still be my friend: make an effort.</p> <p>I missed the old Lexy. I missed going on holiday with her. I missed the decadent dinners we would have when she didn\u2019t spend half her salary on nursery fees. I missed spontaneity. I missed inviting her to something and her being able to say yes without first negotiating childcare with her partner.</p> <p>Sometimes it was hard to bridge the divide between my life and hers, particularly during the painful years after I got married in 2017<strong> </strong>when I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/22/not-being-able-to-have-a-baby-was-devastating-then-i-found-people-who-embraced-a-childfree-life\">trying and failing to get pregnant</a> and she had her second baby, a girl. I didn\u2019t tell her that we had been referred for IVF until very late in the process. Now I was the one keeping a big part of my life from her. I knew she wanted to know how it was going, and that she was genuinely sad for me when each cycle failed. But she was not the person I wanted to be comforted by. It wasn\u2019t her fault, but she was too fertile for my fragile state of mind. There was nothing she could say to make me feel better. The only people I talked to in detail had been through the same heartache, or at least had difficulty conceiving themselves. Lexy occasionally would try to tell me what a great life I had without kids, which was true. But I didn\u2019t want to hear it from her.</p> <p>About 18 months after I gave up on IVF, we finally started talking properly again. I\u2019d been on a particularly outrageous holiday to Barbados in January during term time, and, as I swayed in a hammock, drinking pi\u00f1a coladas, started to see the upside in my situation. I&nbsp;returned tanned and at peace, and we had a noughties-style night out that ended up with her discovering a mysterious chilli in her handbag the morning after.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>She admitted it was hard for her to know what she could and couldn\u2019t say about her kids </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pivotal chat, which began in the Sheffield pub we used to go to when we were trainee journalists, began with me lamenting having not seen much of her youngest (then almost three) when she was a baby. Lexy shot me a look as if to say, \u201cDo you really not realise why you weren\u2019t there?\u201d I hadn\u2019t deliberately avoided her daughter, but her first year was the start of what I must reluctantly call my fertility journey. It hurt too much. I really wish now that I could have been a better friend.</p> <p>She admitted it was hard for her to know what she could and couldn\u2019t say about her kids. She didn\u2019t know if she could moan about them when they were doing her head in, or whether that would seem heartless to someone who wanted kids but couldn\u2019t have them. She said she held back from sharing with me the joy of parenting and the pure delight that children can bring. I felt sad she couldn\u2019t tell me these things, but I knew I didn\u2019t want to hear them. I can hear the moaning all day long. It\u2019s the joy I find harder to swallow, perhaps because it confirms what I still fear may be true: that having children is life\u2019s greatest pleasure.</p> <p>You know the Q&amp;A in the Guardian every Saturday, which asks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/qa\">celebrities a series of questions</a>? The one that always makes me feel most inadequate asks for their proudest achievement. Parents almost always say their children, no matter how many Oscars they have won. Is that because being a mum or a dad really is the most rewarding job of all? Or because it\u2019s so hard that if their kids turn out OK it really does seem like the greatest accomplishment? Or because it\u2019s the sort of thing you are supposed to say?</p> <p>But I also know now that having kids is not all proud parents\u2019 evenings and bathing in a lifelong glow of reciprocated love. That cute little babies can turn into anarchist toddlers and grumpy teenagers, and that while parenting certainly keeps you busy, it doesn\u2019t necessarily stave off an existential crisis. I see the sacrifices Lexy makes for her children, the freedoms she gives up to be a good mum, and sometimes wonder, would I have been willing to do the same? When I got married I gained a lovely stepdaughter, who is now 15. She and I have a special relationship, but my role is not really parental. I provide the fun and adventures rather than doing the hard yards.</p> <p>Now that Lexy and I can actually talk about all of this, we have reached the following conclusions: that however much we loved each other, there were times when we just were not the right person to be holding the other\u2019s hand. And that there is happiness and joy on both sides of the parenting divide \u2013 as well as occasional regret about the path not taken.</p> <p>She admits she sometimes envies my life \u2013 better holidays, lazy Sunday mornings reading the paper, uninterrupted sleep, all the classic childfree tropes. And sometimes I envy her shaping the lives of her two wonderful children, who love her unconditionally and who really do say the funniest things. Should they ever go on to procreate I will no doubt feel jealous all over again when Lexy becomes a granny. But I hope to stay in their lives for ever: their daft Auntie Helen who makes their mum laugh till she cries.</p>    <h2><strong>Alexandra</strong></h2> <p>I can remember so clearly the first time I met Helen. I\u2019d just joined the Guardian, and we arranged to meet at a pub nearby. She was wearing an electric-blue skater skirt, black top and matching Mary Janes; we drank pints and laughed at each other\u2019s jokes. She had a date that night, and before we left asked me to check that she didn\u2019t smell. I thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to have so much fun with this girl.\u201d</p> <p>That September, the Guardian paid for us both to go to Sheffield to study journalism for three months, even though Helen had already been working as a journalist for years. I was 26, just out of a serious relationship. She was 25, single and ambitious.</p> <p>Back in the north, we were unstoppable. We studied media law and immediately applied our learning by telling all the boys who touched our bums in the Leadmill (shots of vodka: 50p; bottles of blue WKD: \u00a31) that they were in contravention of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Helen had a side gig as an occasional music reviewer \u2013 I remember watching her, pint tucked under her arm, dancing to the beat, scribbling in her notebook.</p> <p>In an early class, we were set the task of interviewing the person next to us, before relaying to the other students the most surprising thing about them. \u201cWhat you might find interesting about Helen,\u201d said our friend Bex, \u201cis that despite seeming like an ambitious career woman, all she really wants to do is have loads of kids.\u201d I took the piss out of her afterwards. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, jutting out her chin with classic Pidd stubbornness. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>The marauding continued when we moved back to London. We put on our best frocks and had extravagant boozy lunches; we went dancing in basements; flew to Istanbul, Granada, Jerez. We made dinners, played ping-pong, pulled dodgy boys, belted out Total Eclipse of the Heart on the night bus. We drank so many cups of tea, spluttering on the sofa when we remembered another detail from the night before. It felt a lot like falling in love.</p> <p>The pace of the friendship changed, of course. Helen moved in with a boyfriend; I started an ill-fated love affair with a Frenchman, and spent a lot of time going back and forth to Paris. Helen started her foreign correspondent years \u2013 but she was still resolutely my best friend. We hung out in Berlin, in Austria, in London, in Spain. She moved to Manchester to become the north of England editor. I missed her like hell, but she was still such a part of my life.</p> <p>In my early 30s, I fell in love with my partner. We were on our first holiday together in the Highlands when a doctor called me to say that a routine smear had found cancerous cells on my cervix. They\u2019d caught it early, and the machinery of the NHS moved up a gear \u2013 more tests, then, quickly, procedures. When we came out of the other side I was 33, and we were all in. We bought our first house and on a drunken night decided to have a baby. Nothing like being told you might not be able to have kids to focus the mind.</p> <p>When our son was born, we asked Helen to be his godmother. She looked faintly horrified and told us she didn\u2019t believe in God. She settled on \u201cgodlessmother\u201d and threw herself into it. Helen has always loved babies. After our boy was born, she came to visit and snuggled with him on the sofa. She took me for lunch and held him so I could eat uninterrupted. It was a shame that we weren\u2019t having babies at the same time, but I assumed I\u2019d also do this for her \u2013 just a bit later on.</p> <p>She was 35 when she met her now husband. I was the best woman at her wedding; we DJed in sunglasses. I thought, \u201cCrack on: let\u2019s do it together next time.\u201d</p>    <p>It took more than a year for me to get pregnant again. I&nbsp;knew Helen was trying, too \u2013 we spoke about the relative merits of cycle trackers, whether it was worth taking your temperature. Then I got the blue lines. I was driving when I told Helen. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t.\u201d I tried to sound as offhand as possible. \u201cYeah, well, turns out I was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>A space hung between us. And as my pregnancy progressed, it got wider. Being pregnant with my first had made me feel like a superhero, but my body carried the new baby like a hostile agent. With a couple of months to go, scans showed she was small in the womb. Deemed high-risk, I traipsed to my hospital three times a week and sat in a packed maternity ward, while a noisy machine monitored her heart rate. I was so scared. Helen sent me a message one day: \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d She was saying she cared, but it felt so distant. She was saying she was there, but she wasn\u2019t. I wanted to kill her.</p> <p>The baby, expulsed early from my swollen body by drugs, propelled herself into the world surrounded by concerned doctors and midwives. She was, in the end, small but mighty. We went home the next day, wide-eyed with shock. I couldn\u2019t breastfeed properly, she didn\u2019t put on weight for weeks, nobody slept. In the maelstrom, I called my best friend from university. Having twice been through her own post-birth delirium, she heard my panic. She took time off work, left her kids with her husband and moved in for a few days. She emptied the dishwasher, played with my son, put a wash on. It genuinely felt like she\u2019d saved my life.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that I wanted Helen to do that \u2013 she couldn\u2019t. She messaged me support, made a collage card for the baby that read \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d. But I didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to pick up the phone and tell her what I was actually going through. I couldn\u2019t have explained it if I\u2019d tried. I had this perfectly healthy baby girl, and all I wanted to do was cry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Maybe you don\u2019t have to share everything in a friendship. Maybe its intensity can ebb and flow while the core remains fixed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Helen didn\u2019t disappear. When the baby was six weeks old, deep in an exhausted fug I handed her over for the duration of a restaurant lunch, snatched before Helen shot off to Amsterdam for the weekend. She made it to mine; I took the kids up to hers. But then Covid struck, and by the time it was over, my life was an endless round of dashing to the childminder from work, washing small clothes and failing to have a good night\u2019s sleep. Helen, meanwhile, was constantly on another adventure.</p> <p>I always wanted to hear what new project she was working on, or where she was going next, even if I&nbsp;wanted her not to have as good a time as she would have done with me. I probably felt quite boring by comparison. When I did speak to her about my kids, I&nbsp;made sure to only tell the funny stuff.</p> <p>Over the next few years, the cord that had expanded and retracted between us for more than a decade stretched further, became taut, which we now realise coincided with her starting IVF. When she told me about it, I weighed every word carefully. I remember standing at the kitchen sink while she \u2013 in a matter-of-fact tone \u2013 set out the intricacies of the process and why it probably wouldn\u2019t work. I mainly tried not to say the wrong thing. I wanted to be supportive, but I felt useless.</p> <p>After Helen\u2019s final round of IVF failed, I had no idea what to do. I almost certainly didn\u2019t do enough. We\u2019ve talked about it since, how I was not the person to provide succour. I wish I had been. When she told me they weren\u2019t going to try again, I felt profoundly sad. Sad for her, sad for them and, in some, undeniable way, sad for us. From that point on, we would always be on separate tracks, I thought.</p> <p>But, actually, it was the start of us finding our way back to each other. The elastic didn\u2019t exactly twang back into place, but it has drawn us in, gently. When her Saturday magazine piece about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/22/not-being-able-to-have-a-baby-was-devastating-then-i-found-people-who-embraced-a-childfree-life\">accepting being childfree</a> came out last year, I read it again and again. I was so glad that writing it had been a positive experience and had helped so many other people. But there was something else. \u201cIt also makes me a bit jealous, in all honesty,\u201d I rambled in a voice note I recorded at the time. \u201cJealous of this kind of super-exciting crowdsurfing life that you have that is so, so far away from mine. Like, I\u2019m literally running the bath right now and I\u2019m hiding from my kids so that I can have two minutes \u2026 I can\u2019t put this down on paper, because I haven\u2019t got time.\u201d</p> <p>Because the thing that you can\u2019t share with your friends who wanted children but didn\u2019t have them is how \u2013 not all the time, but sometimes, fiercely \u2013 you long for the freedom they would do anything to give up. The ability, as Helen wrote, \u201cto be responsible for your own destiny\u201d rather than responsible for another human\u2019s safety, development, hygiene and happiness. You want the spontaneity, the space, the unscripted hours. You never want to go to another kid\u2019s birthday party again.</p> <p>I started writing this piece hunched over my phone in the rain while my kids played hockey. It\u2019s been tapped away at tennis practice, and in the dark hours of the early morning \u2013 the only time there is peace in the house. Helen started hers on the Eurostar on the way to the south of France for a weekend with her husband.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Helen is my kids\u2019 favourite fake auntie; I hope I\u2019m still her favourite dance partner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even as I write this I cringe at my own solipsistic ingratitude. I know I have no right to moan. I know what a privilege motherhood is, how lucky I am. But is it OK to feel envious? Just occasionally?</p> <p>But the other thing mothers \u2013ones like me, at least \u2013 keep secret is the psychedelic, heady joy of it. The moment when your sleepy firstborn buries his head into your neck and says, \u201cMama, I love you so, so much\u201d, and you feel a flood of oxytocin that at 6.55am beats the best pill of your life. The extraordinary, ordinary mornings with both kids in bed, laughing at your partner\u2019s silliness. The firework of pride when your kid scores the winner in the last minute of a finely balanced under-nines football match. Dancing in the kitchen with a little girl who, somehow, contains the purest version of your best self.</p> <p>But maybe you don\u2019t have to share everything in a friendship. Maybe its intensity can ebb and flow while the core remains fixed. As the kids get older we can go out for dinner more easily, and phone calls aren\u2019t always interrupted; this year we managed a classic Big Night Out in a Foreign City (chino-wearing big-bummed boys, we apologise for our hilarity). Helen is my kids\u2019 favourite fake auntie; I hope I\u2019m still her favourite dance partner.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/09/biography.features\">A Life\u2019s Work</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/21/biography.women\">Rachel Cusk</a> said of seeing old friends after having a baby that they met \u201cat the uncrossable border between the free world and the closed regime of motherhood\u201d. Mine and Helen\u2019s friendship felt like that for a while, but as the years continue, the connection that made us both realise we\u2019d met someone important in the pub on that first night is still there. It\u2019s in the texts and the shared jokes, the work chats and the sparse but regular weekends of fun. It\u2019s in the stories we repeat, and the ones we\u2019re still creating. If there is a border, it can be traversed \u2013 and we both have a pass. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Helen The night I first met Lexy, I was supposed to be going on a date. I was 25 and had yet to really make friends since moving to London, so when she asked me for a drink I said yes. The Guardian tended to hire only one young reporter a year in those days, and Lexy was the fresh face for 2006 (I was 2004 \u2013 it had been a rather lonely first two years). She had just returned from living in Paris and exuded a certain French cool. Her wardrobe seemed to have been sourced almost entirely from a little vintage shop in the Marais, which would have made her insufferable were it not fatally undermined by her coming from Skelmersdale, the least glamorous town in the Lancashire coalfields. She was funny and clever and generous with her compliments (I was thrilled when she said she liked my shoes \u2013 metallic blue-and-silver Mary Janes) and when I reluctantly trotted off on my date, I spent the night wishing I was back with her instead. Everything was more fun with Lexy. There is something very special about making a best friend in early adulthood, when your brain is fully developed and your personality formed but your responsibilities do not extend beyond paying the rent and turning up to work on time. You\u2019re not mates simply because your names went after each other in the register, or because you were lumped together in the same university halls. Lexy and I were kindred spirits: the babies of the Guardian newsroom, two blonde northerners let loose in noughties London. She soon became both my biggest cheerleader and harshest critic \u2013 two essential attributes for any proper pal. We spent our days scribbling shorthand at the Old Bailey and our nights out in east London, often on some sort of manhunt, despite us preferring each other to any boy on the market. She generally had far more success, but occasionally the stars aligned for us both. I used to enjoy the mornings-after as much as the nights themselves, as we howled with laughter at whatever nonsense we had been up to until the early hours. We never liked it when the other got a boyfriend: she was furious with me when a snog at the Camden Crawl turned into a relationship just before what she had pre-emptively called our \u201csummer of fun\u201d. Direct quote: \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined everything.\u201d A favourite haunt was the Birdcage, a Hackney pub with a karaoke machine that attracted both indie sleaze mavens and proper East Enders. One night we used our appalling pool-playing to attract the attention of a promising young duo: a Swede for Lexy, and, for me, a rough diamond I thought was going to be my first cockney conquest but whose mother, it later transpired, was a feature writer at the Telegraph. I don\u2019t remember talking about having kids much when we were in our 20s. I just assumed we would both have as many as we fancied when the time was right. When she got pregnant, at 34, I\u2019d spent a few years living abroad and had moved to Manchester. I was happy for her but also, frankly, jealous. My long-term relationship had come to a calamitous end and, at 33, I was panicking about my own reproductive window slamming shut. Everybody seemed to be having babies except me. My response, I realise now, was to try to make my life more exciting. I made new friends: hedonists who could go away outside the school holidays and could make a plan without having to factor in nap times. I invited a Syrian refugee to live with me for six months, went on ridiculously long bike rides, and upped my extracurricular antics, doing everything Lexy no longer could. Not long after her son was born, I was staying with her in London for a few days and one night simply didn\u2019t go back, partaking instead in an ill-advised sleepover at the opposite end of the tube map. On the slightly melancholy ride home, I tried to dampen down my regret by thinking to myself, \u201cWell, Lexy can\u2019t do this any more!\u201d (Nor, it has to be said, did she want to). I still have a photo I took of myself holding her baby when I got in, my eyes bloodshot and the previous night\u2019s mascara smudged under each eye. Looking at that photo now, I see someone trying a bit too hard to have fun. I was thrilled when she asked me to be her son\u2019s god(less)mother but resented her new NCT friends, worrying they would replace me. When her son turned one, she invited me to the party and I sat in her kitchen, the only woman without a baby on her knee, and felt like a barren alien. She used to insist she liked not talking about child-rearing with me, that I talked to her about interesting things. But it was the first time that I felt excluded from any part of her life. She used to tell me everything: now I was only getting half the story. The half was not what it used to be, either. I am old enough now to realise that all new mothers are too knackered for the first year(s) to do anything other than keep their babies alive. But the truth is that having a baby doesn\u2019t make anyone more interesting. It softens some people and toughens others up. But the all-encompassing nature of parenthood, particularly for mothers in the early years, means there is neither time nor energy to discuss anything else. I wouldn\u2019t say I found Lexy boring, but there was basically nothing to report apart from how tired she was and how hard breastfeeding is. In the decade since my friends began breeding in earnest, some have more or less disappeared from my life. Maybe they just didn\u2019t value me that much anyway. But there comes a point when you are doing all the running in a friendship that you start to feel bitter. I give every parent a pass for the first few years. After that, if you want to still be my friend: make an effort. I missed the old Lexy. I missed going on holiday with her. I missed the decadent dinners we would have when she didn\u2019t spend half her salary on nursery fees. I missed spontaneity. I missed inviting her to something and her being able to say yes without first negotiating childcare with her partner. Sometimes it was hard to bridge the divide between my life and hers, particularly during the painful years after I got married in 2017 when I was trying and failing to get pregnant and she had her second baby, a girl. I didn\u2019t tell her that we had been referred for IVF until very late in the process. Now I was the one keeping a big part of my life from her. I knew she wanted to know how it was going, and that she was genuinely sad for me when each cycle failed. But she was not the person I wanted to be comforted by. It wasn\u2019t her fault, but she was too fertile for my fragile state of mind. There was nothing she could say to make me feel better. The only people I talked to in detail had been through the same heartache, or at least had difficulty conceiving themselves. Lexy occasionally would try to tell me what a great life I had without kids, which was true. But I didn\u2019t want to hear it from her. About 18 months after I gave up on IVF, we finally started talking properly again. I\u2019d been on a particularly outrageous holiday to Barbados in January during term time, and, as I swayed in a hammock, drinking pi\u00f1a coladas, started to see the upside in my situation. I returned tanned and at peace, and we had a noughties-style night out that ended up with her discovering a mysterious chilli in her handbag the morning after. The pivotal chat, which began in the Sheffield pub we used to go to when we were trainee journalists, began with me lamenting having not seen much of her youngest (then almost three) when she was a baby. Lexy shot me a look as if to say, \u201cDo you really not realise why you weren\u2019t there?\u201d I hadn\u2019t deliberately avoided her daughter, but her first year was the start of what I must reluctantly call my fertility journey. It hurt too much. I really wish now that I could have been a better friend. She admitted it was hard for her to know what she could and couldn\u2019t say about her kids. She didn\u2019t know if she could moan about them when they were doing her head in, or whether that would seem heartless to someone who wanted kids but couldn\u2019t have them. She said she held back from sharing with me the joy of parenting and the pure delight that children can bring. I felt sad she couldn\u2019t tell me these things, but I knew I didn\u2019t want to hear them. I can hear the moaning all day long. It\u2019s the joy I find harder to swallow, perhaps because it confirms what I still fear may be true: that having children is life\u2019s greatest pleasure. You know the Q&amp;A in the Guardian every Saturday, which asks celebrities a series of questions? The one that always makes me feel most inadequate asks for their proudest achievement. Parents almost always say their children, no matter how many Oscars they have won. Is that because being a mum or a dad really is the most rewarding job of all? Or because it\u2019s so hard that if their kids turn out OK it really does seem like the greatest accomplishment? Or because it\u2019s the sort of thing you are supposed to say? But I also know now that having kids is not all proud parents\u2019 evenings and bathing in a lifelong glow of reciprocated love. That cute little babies can turn into anarchist toddlers and grumpy teenagers, and that while parenting certainly keeps you busy, it doesn\u2019t necessarily stave off an existential crisis. I see the sacrifices Lexy makes for her children, the freedoms she gives up to be a good mum, and sometimes wonder, would I have been willing to do the same? When I got married I gained a lovely stepdaughter, who is now 15. She and I have a special relationship, but my role is not really parental. I provide the fun and adventures rather than doing the hard yards. Now that Lexy and I can actually talk about all of this, we have reached the following conclusions: that however much we loved each other, there were times when we just were not the right person to be holding the other\u2019s hand. And that there is happiness and joy on both sides of the parenting divide \u2013 as well as occasional regret about the path not taken. She admits she sometimes envies my life \u2013 better holidays, lazy Sunday mornings reading the paper, uninterrupted sleep, all the classic childfree tropes. And sometimes I envy her shaping the lives of her two wonderful children, who love her unconditionally and who really do say the funniest things. Should they ever go on to procreate I will no doubt feel jealous all over again when Lexy becomes a granny. But I hope to stay in their lives for ever: their daft Auntie Helen who makes their mum laugh till she cries. Alexandra I can remember so clearly the first time I met Helen. I\u2019d just joined the Guardian, and we arranged to meet at a pub nearby. She was wearing an electric-blue skater skirt, black top and matching Mary Janes; we drank pints and laughed at each other\u2019s jokes. She had a date that night, and before we left asked me to check that she didn\u2019t smell. I thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to have so much fun with this girl.\u201d That September, the Guardian paid for us both to go to Sheffield to study journalism for three months, even though Helen had already been working as a journalist for years. I was 26, just out of a serious relationship. She was 25, single and ambitious. Back in the north, we were unstoppable. We studied media law and immediately applied our learning by telling all the boys who touched our bums in the Leadmill (shots of vodka: 50p; bottles of blue WKD: \u00a31) that they were in contravention of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Helen had a side gig as an occasional music reviewer \u2013 I remember watching her, pint tucked under her arm, dancing to the beat, scribbling in her notebook. In an early class, we were set the task of interviewing the person next to us, before relaying to the other students the most surprising thing about them. \u201cWhat you might find interesting about Helen,\u201d said our friend Bex, \u201cis that despite seeming like an ambitious career woman, all she really wants to do is have loads of kids.\u201d I took the piss out of her afterwards. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, jutting out her chin with classic Pidd stubbornness. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d The marauding continued when we moved back to London. We put on our best frocks and had extravagant boozy lunches; we went dancing in basements; flew to Istanbul, Granada, Jerez. We made dinners, played ping-pong, pulled dodgy boys, belted out Total Eclipse of the Heart on the night bus. We drank so many cups of tea, spluttering on the sofa when we remembered another detail from the night before. It felt a lot like falling in love. The pace of the friendship changed, of course. Helen moved in with a boyfriend; I started an ill-fated love affair with a Frenchman, and spent a lot of time going back and forth to Paris. Helen started her foreign correspondent years \u2013 but she was still resolutely my best friend. We hung out in Berlin, in Austria, in London, in Spain. She moved to Manchester to become the north of England editor. I missed her like hell, but she was still such a part of my life. In my early 30s, I fell in love with my partner. We were on our first holiday together in the Highlands when a doctor called me to say that a routine smear had found cancerous cells on my cervix. They\u2019d caught it early, and the machinery of the NHS moved up a gear \u2013 more tests, then, quickly, procedures. When we came out of the other side I was 33, and we were all in. We bought our first house and on a drunken night decided to have a baby. Nothing like being told you might not be able to have kids to focus the mind. When our son was born, we asked Helen to be his godmother. She looked faintly horrified and told us she didn\u2019t believe in God. She settled on \u201cgodlessmother\u201d and threw herself into it. Helen has always loved babies. After our boy was born, she came to visit and snuggled with him on the sofa. She took me for lunch and held him so I could eat uninterrupted. It was a shame that we weren\u2019t having babies at the same time, but I assumed I\u2019d also do this for her \u2013 just a bit later on. She was 35 when she met her now husband. I was the best woman at her wedding; we DJed in sunglasses. I thought, \u201cCrack on: let\u2019s do it together next time.\u201d It took more than a year for me to get pregnant again. I knew Helen was trying, too \u2013 we spoke about the relative merits of cycle trackers, whether it was worth taking your temperature. Then I got the blue lines. I was driving when I told Helen. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t.\u201d I tried to sound as offhand as possible. \u201cYeah, well, turns out I was wrong.\u201d A space hung between us. And as my pregnancy progressed, it got wider. Being pregnant with my first had made me feel like a superhero, but my body carried the new baby like a hostile agent. With a couple of months to go, scans showed she was small in the womb. Deemed high-risk, I traipsed to my hospital three times a week and sat in a packed maternity ward, while a noisy machine monitored her heart rate. I was so scared. Helen sent me a message one day: \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d She was saying she cared, but it felt so distant. She was saying she was there, but she wasn\u2019t. I wanted to kill her. The baby, expulsed early from my swollen body by drugs, propelled herself into the world surrounded by concerned doctors and midwives. She was, in the end, small but mighty. We went home the next day, wide-eyed with shock. I couldn\u2019t breastfeed properly, she didn\u2019t put on weight for weeks, nobody slept. In the maelstrom, I called my best friend from university. Having twice been through her own post-birth delirium, she heard my panic. She took time off work, left her kids with her husband and moved in for a few days. She emptied the dishwasher, played with my son, put a wash on. It genuinely felt like she\u2019d saved my life. It wasn\u2019t that I wanted Helen to do that \u2013 she couldn\u2019t. She messaged me support, made a collage card for the baby that read \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d. But I didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to pick up the phone and tell her what I was actually going through. I couldn\u2019t have explained it if I\u2019d tried. I had this perfectly healthy baby girl, and all I wanted to do was cry. Helen didn\u2019t disappear. When the baby was six weeks old, deep in an exhausted fug I handed her over for the duration of a restaurant lunch, snatched before Helen shot off to Amsterdam for the weekend. She made it to mine; I took the kids up to hers. But then Covid struck, and by the time it was over, my life was an endless round of dashing to the childminder from work, washing small clothes and failing to have a good night\u2019s sleep. Helen, meanwhile, was constantly on another adventure. I always wanted to hear what new project she was working on, or where she was going next, even if I wanted her not to have as good a time as she would have done with me. I probably felt quite boring by comparison. When I did speak to her about my kids, I made sure to only tell the funny stuff. Over the next few years, the cord that had expanded and retracted between us for more than a decade stretched further, became taut, which we now realise coincided with her starting IVF. When she told me about it, I weighed every word carefully. I remember standing at the kitchen sink while she \u2013 in a matter-of-fact tone \u2013 set out the intricacies of the process and why it probably wouldn\u2019t work. I mainly tried not to say the wrong thing. I wanted to be supportive, but I felt useless. After Helen\u2019s final round of IVF failed, I had no idea what to do. I almost certainly didn\u2019t do enough. We\u2019ve talked about it since, how I was not the person to provide succour. I wish I had been. When she told me they weren\u2019t going to try again, I felt profoundly sad. Sad for her, sad for them and, in some, undeniable way, sad for us. From that point on, we would always be on separate tracks, I thought. But, actually, it was the start of us finding our way back to each other. The elastic didn\u2019t exactly twang back into place, but it has drawn us in, gently. When her Saturday magazine piece about accepting being childfree came out last year, I read it again and again. I was so glad that writing it had been a positive experience and had helped so many other people. But there was something else. \u201cIt also makes me a bit jealous, in all honesty,\u201d I rambled in a voice note I recorded at the time. \u201cJealous of this kind of super-exciting crowdsurfing life that you have that is so, so far away from mine. Like, I\u2019m literally running the bath right now and I\u2019m hiding from my kids so that I can have two minutes \u2026 I can\u2019t put this down on paper, because I haven\u2019t got time.\u201d Because the thing that you can\u2019t share with your friends who wanted children but didn\u2019t have them is how \u2013 not all the time, but sometimes, fiercely \u2013 you long for the freedom they would do anything to give up. The ability, as Helen wrote, \u201cto be responsible for your own destiny\u201d rather than responsible for another human\u2019s safety, development, hygiene and happiness. You want the spontaneity, the space, the unscripted hours. You never want to go to another kid\u2019s birthday party again. I started writing this piece hunched over my phone in the rain while my kids played hockey. It\u2019s been tapped away at tennis practice, and in the dark hours of the early morning \u2013 the only time there is peace in the house. Helen started hers on the Eurostar on the way to the south of France for a weekend with her husband. Even as I write this I cringe at my own solipsistic ingratitude. I know I have no right to moan. I know what a privilege motherhood is, how lucky I am. But is it OK to feel envious? Just occasionally? But the other thing mothers \u2013ones like me, at least \u2013 keep secret is the psychedelic, heady joy of it. The moment when your sleepy firstborn buries his head into your neck and says, \u201cMama, I love you so, so much\u201d, and you feel a flood of oxytocin that at 6.55am beats the best pill of your life. The extraordinary, ordinary mornings with both kids in bed, laughing at your partner\u2019s silliness. The firework of pride when your kid scores the winner in the last minute of a finely balanced under-nines football match. Dancing in the kitchen with a little girl who, somehow, contains the purest version of your best self. But maybe you don\u2019t have to share everything in a friendship. Maybe its intensity can ebb and flow while the core remains fixed. As the kids get older we can go out for dinner more easily, and phone calls aren\u2019t always interrupted; this year we managed a classic Big Night Out in a Foreign City (chino-wearing big-bummed boys, we apologise for our hilarity). Helen is my kids\u2019 favourite fake auntie; I hope I\u2019m still her favourite dance partner. In A Life\u2019s Work, Rachel Cusk said of seeing old friends after having a baby that they met \u201cat the uncrossable border between the free world and the closed regime of motherhood\u201d. Mine and Helen\u2019s friendship felt like that for a while, but as the years continue, the connection that made us both realise we\u2019d met someone important in the pub on that first night is still there. It\u2019s in the texts and the shared jokes, the work chats and the sparse but regular weekends of fun. It\u2019s in the stories we repeat, and the ones we\u2019re still creating. If there is a border, it can be traversed \u2013 and we both have a pass.",

      "body": "<p>When Dana White <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwXemp48VeY\">barreled up to the microphone</a>, at Donald Trump\u2019s request, to say his piece on election night, it represented confirmation of the UFC CEO\u2019s status as one of the key members of the president-elect\u2019s inner circle. But White\u2019s brief speech also signaled his own growing importance as a kind of impresario for a new class of Trump-supporting influencers, podcasters, streamers and wellness bros. \u201cI want to thank the Nelk Boys, Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bussin\u2019 with the Boys, and last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan,\u201d White enthused.</p> <p>With the exception of Rogan, who\u2019s about as close to a household name as the world of podcasting has today, none of these figures would probably be familiar to anyone who observed the election through traditional media or cable TV. Theo Von is a comedian and former reality TV contestant whose podcasts, like those of many of his peers, often extend to several hours; Bussin\u2019 with the Boys is hosted by a pair of NFL players; the Nelk Boys are former college pranksters with a brand of hard seltzer and a taste for casual cruelty; Adin Ross is a streamer who\u2019s been banned multiple times (most recently permanently) from the gaming platform Twitch for hateful conduct. These online \u201ccreators\u201d form a network: they all appear on each other\u2019s shows, which often feature far-right streamers like Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate alongside more mainstream figures of the Maga movement like Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro and Elon Musk.</p> <p>Trump happily sat for lengthy interviews with each of them, often more than once: he appeared on Full Send, the Nelk Boys\u2019 podcast, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/2AzudK4Bars1p1mCGDs4RF\">three times</a> over the course of the campaign. This support was likely key to securing Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/us-election-donald-trump-voters-gender-race-data\">seismic victory among young men</a>. At the center of this sprawling alternative media universe sits the UFC supremo, who Trump frequently named as the key connector between the creator economy and his own presidential campaign during his appearances on these podcasts. White must now be considered more than a mere surrogate for Trump: by aligning his own business interests with a particular style of new media built on podcasting, gambling, crypto, and violence, he has become the glue between Maga and the so-called \u201cmanosphere\u201d. Trump not only rode a wave of popular support to victory in this election; in a very real sense he also bro\u2019d his way to victory, and White was one of the main orchestrators in securing the testosterone vote.</p> <p>It\u2019s long been argued \u2013 correctly \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/28/ufc-donald-trump-dana-white-campaign\">UFC represents the sporting arm of the Maga movement</a>. Trump was one of the key early backers of UFC at a time when it appeared the nascent mixed martial arts competition \u2013 derided as \u201chuman cockfighting\u201d, shunned by the sporting and media establishment, and barred from hosting events in most states throughout the US \u2013\u2013was on the brink of failure: in 2001 he allowed the organization to host two consecutive events at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, and a lifelong alliance was forged. Trump himself is now a fixture at UFC events, often staying right until the end of spectacles that can run for five or six hours, and he has used his entrances at arenas hosting UFC cards to signal his enduring strength and support base in the face of adversity: the twice-impeached president\u2019s first <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/us/politics/donald-trump-ufc-newark-dana-white.html\">public appearance</a> following his conviction on 34 felony counts by a Manhattan jury earlier this year was at UFC 302 in New Jersey. (Trump also used the event to <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@realdonaldtrump/video/7375744699140721963\">launch</a> his TikTok account.) The relationship between Maga and the UFC is more than simply transactional, however: there\u2019s a real stylistic symbiosis between Trump and White, both of whom see themselves and their constituents as maverick outsiders upending the smug old certainties of politics, sport, and culture. Kid Rock\u2019s rap-rock anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt84J7U75e0\">American Bad Ass</a> (\u201cI\u2019m an American bad ass, watch me kick / You can roll with rock or you can suck my dick\u201d) became the unofficial anthem of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign. But it first became popular among the Trumpian core as a standard title fight opener at UFC events.</p>    <p>White\u2019s influence extends far beyond the fight cage, however; it stretches into media, politics and the neverending culture wars, making him a kind of cultural czar of the Maga movement. The UFC now regularly brings in more than $1bn in annual revenue, enough to make White, who lives in a $50m mansion in Las Vegas and has vacationed on a $2.8m-a-week yacht, an <a href=\"https://www.si.com/onsi/athlete-lifestyle/real-estate/dana-white-bought-50m-vegas-mansion-for-shockingly-low-price\">exceptionally wealthy man</a>. Displays of wealth and luck are key to White\u2019s personal mythos, as they are to other leading figures in the right-aligned grift economy: in September White <a href=\"https://x.com/jedigoodman/status/1837245652193137005?s=46&amp;t=OONAkjzZ-blRA9oVy2_3wA\">won big</a> at a blackjack night in Vegas and immediately offered Barstool Sports reporter Robbie Fox $20,000 to pay for Fox\u2019s wedding. \u201cI\u2019m about to be the number one Power Slap reporter in the world,\u201d Fox declared; in Dana-land, the gift and the grift are never far apart. The episode highlighted the central role White (or \u201cUncle Dana\u201d as Fox later <a href=\"https://x.com/robbiebarstool/status/1835021625978503249?s=46&amp;t=rj15tjA9ipN1thJ9TBPYHA\">called</a> him in his own post about the gift) now occupies as an orchestrator of disparate elements of the Trump-aligned cultural universe, with its orbit set around long-form male-hosted podcasts, casinos, testosterone-fueled sports like football, boxing, wrestling and mixed martial arts, and bro-heavy media organizations like Barstool. Each of these is a node in a mutually enforcing network built on protein, nutritional supplements, risk and resentment; boosterism is the key to this network\u2019s success, and criticism its greatest enemy.</p> <p>Power Slap, for those unfamiliar with it, is White\u2019s latest business venture \u2013 a face-slapping competition launched in 2022 in which big-jawed men with arms like hams take turns in smacking each other into submission. The clips that Power Slap generates are tailor-made for social media and contemporary \u201chighlights culture\u201d \u2013 blood-soaked snackables that act as tributes to both the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCPUfGwPVWI/?hl=en\">thrill of violence</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCZntYCRCna/?hl=en\">majesty of the mandible</a>. Other new or newish sports are being invented to capitalize on the online public\u2019s insatiable thirst for short-form televisual jolts of excitement \u2013 among them SlamBall, a trampoline-enhanced hybrid of basketball, football, hockey and gymnastics, WWE Speed, a short-form wrestling competition hosted on X, and CarJitsu, a car-bound adaptation of jiu jitsu which <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dzanzYIR1bs\">looks every bit as uncomfortable as it sounds</a>. But none fuses shock value with sheer face-dissolving idiocy into compulsively watchable content quite as effectively as Power Slap.</p> <p>The point here is not that Power Slap is about to take over the world; that seems unlikely, and internet users were quick to debunk White\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/acdmma_/status/1798475565344964618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1798475565344964618%7Ctwgr%5Edf1adb7ee4fc526c7607f93bfcad2285622640d1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marca.com%2Fen%2Fufc%2F2024%2F06%2F06%2F666210fe22601d896b8b4583.html\">recent claim</a> that Power Slap has more followers than any other sports team on the planet. Rather, it\u2019s to emphasize the degree to which White has understood that brevity, virality and action are the key to winning the war for attention across sport, politics and culture. Many of the leading media properties of the manosphere may produce podcasts that extend to two or three hours, but they\u2019re all consistently mined for their highlights and seams of potential virality: the most memorable media moment of the 2024 presidential campaign was arguably when Theo Von <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@theovon/video/7405379084210965802?lang=en\">told</a> Trump, \u201cCocaine will turn you into a damn owl, homie.\u201d White\u2019s aggressive promotion of gambling and crypto \u2013 crypto.com is the UFC\u2019s biggest sponsor \u2013 adds to the allure of his high-speed, high-shock model of culture and entertainment; to his fans he embodies an against-the-odds, chips-on-the-table spirit of risk-taking and defiance that\u2019s of a piece with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxMmacYlBPs\">Trump\u2019s fist pump and \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d</a>, Conor McGregor\u2019s neverending comebacks, and Musk\u2019s moonshot bids to populate Mars and father every child on earth. Trump is \u201cso resilient\u201d, Theo Von <a href=\"https://x.com/notPBD/status/1855573264518594600\">told</a> Rogan recently, that \u201cat a certain point you\u2019re just like, I gotta bet on this dog.\u201d Adin Ross did this literally, <a href=\"https://x.com/adinross/status/1853620840228651481\">putting $1m on on a Trump victory</a>. But no one has bet more powerfully and meaningfully on Trump than UFC\u2019s heaviest heavy.

But the grifters and gabsters of the MMA-aligned right, with White as their godfather, seem far more adept at exploiting the messiness and velocity of clips culture than risk-averse liberals, who remain in thrall to legacy media and apparently still see conventional celebrity endorsements as a meaningful way to pull in the youth vote. In entertainment terms, the liberal order, like the Democratic Party that has come to embody it, represents the last gasp of the old studio system. The Trump right\u2019s infotainment-addiction industry, with its phalanx of brawlers, talkers, gamblers, grifters, vloggers and floggers, feels increasingly like the future. And the UFC boss is now its leader. Trump may lead the party and soon again take control of the country, but Dana White is the American right\u2019s instigator-in-chief.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Dana White barreled up to the microphone, at Donald Trump\u2019s request, to say his piece on election night, it represented confirmation of the UFC CEO\u2019s status as one of the key members of the president-elect\u2019s inner circle. But White\u2019s brief speech also signaled his own growing importance as a kind of impresario for a new class of Trump-supporting influencers, podcasters, streamers and wellness bros. \u201cI want to thank the Nelk Boys, Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bussin\u2019 with the Boys, and last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan,\u201d White enthused. With the exception of Rogan, who\u2019s about as close to a household name as the world of podcasting has today, none of these figures would probably be familiar to anyone who observed the election through traditional media or cable TV. Theo Von is a comedian and former reality TV contestant whose podcasts, like those of many of his peers, often extend to several hours; Bussin\u2019 with the Boys is hosted by a pair of NFL players; the Nelk Boys are former college pranksters with a brand of hard seltzer and a taste for casual cruelty; Adin Ross is a streamer who\u2019s been banned multiple times (most recently permanently) from the gaming platform Twitch for hateful conduct. These online \u201ccreators\u201d form a network: they all appear on each other\u2019s shows, which often feature far-right streamers like Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate alongside more mainstream figures of the Maga movement like Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro and Elon Musk. Trump happily sat for lengthy interviews with each of them, often more than once: he appeared on Full Send, the Nelk Boys\u2019 podcast, three times over the course of the campaign. This support was likely key to securing Trump\u2019s seismic victory among young men. At the center of this sprawling alternative media universe sits the UFC supremo, who Trump frequently named as the key connector between the creator economy and his own presidential campaign during his appearances on these podcasts. White must now be considered more than a mere surrogate for Trump: by aligning his own business interests with a particular style of new media built on podcasting, gambling, crypto, and violence, he has become the glue between Maga and the so-called \u201cmanosphere\u201d. Trump not only rode a wave of popular support to victory in this election; in a very real sense he also bro\u2019d his way to victory, and White was one of the main orchestrators in securing the testosterone vote. It\u2019s long been argued \u2013 correctly \u2013 that UFC represents the sporting arm of the Maga movement. Trump was one of the key early backers of UFC at a time when it appeared the nascent mixed martial arts competition \u2013 derided as \u201chuman cockfighting\u201d, shunned by the sporting and media establishment, and barred from hosting events in most states throughout the US \u2013\u2013was on the brink of failure: in 2001 he allowed the organization to host two consecutive events at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, and a lifelong alliance was forged. Trump himself is now a fixture at UFC events, often staying right until the end of spectacles that can run for five or six hours, and he has used his entrances at arenas hosting UFC cards to signal his enduring strength and support base in the face of adversity: the twice-impeached president\u2019s first public appearance following his conviction on 34 felony counts by a Manhattan jury earlier this year was at UFC 302 in New Jersey. (Trump also used the event to launch his TikTok account.) The relationship between Maga and the UFC is more than simply transactional, however: there\u2019s a real stylistic symbiosis between Trump and White, both of whom see themselves and their constituents as maverick outsiders upending the smug old certainties of politics, sport, and culture. Kid Rock\u2019s rap-rock anthem American Bad Ass (\u201cI\u2019m an American bad ass, watch me kick / You can roll with rock or you can suck my dick\u201d) became the unofficial anthem of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign. But it first became popular among the Trumpian core as a standard title fight opener at UFC events. White\u2019s influence extends far beyond the fight cage, however; it stretches into media, politics and the neverending culture wars, making him a kind of cultural czar of the Maga movement. The UFC now regularly brings in more than $1bn in annual revenue, enough to make White, who lives in a $50m mansion in Las Vegas and has vacationed on a $2.8m-a-week yacht, an exceptionally wealthy man. Displays of wealth and luck are key to White\u2019s personal mythos, as they are to other leading figures in the right-aligned grift economy: in September White won big at a blackjack night in Vegas and immediately offered Barstool Sports reporter Robbie Fox $20,000 to pay for Fox\u2019s wedding. \u201cI\u2019m about to be the number one Power Slap reporter in the world,\u201d Fox declared; in Dana-land, the gift and the grift are never far apart. The episode highlighted the central role White (or \u201cUncle Dana\u201d as Fox later called him in his own post about the gift) now occupies as an orchestrator of disparate elements of the Trump-aligned cultural universe, with its orbit set around long-form male-hosted podcasts, casinos, testosterone-fueled sports like football, boxing, wrestling and mixed martial arts, and bro-heavy media organizations like Barstool. Each of these is a node in a mutually enforcing network built on protein, nutritional supplements, risk and resentment; boosterism is the key to this network\u2019s success, and criticism its greatest enemy. Power Slap, for those unfamiliar with it, is White\u2019s latest business venture \u2013 a face-slapping competition launched in 2022 in which big-jawed men with arms like hams take turns in smacking each other into submission. The clips that Power Slap generates are tailor-made for social media and contemporary \u201chighlights culture\u201d \u2013 blood-soaked snackables that act as tributes to both the thrill of violence and the majesty of the mandible.

      "body": "<p>The integrity of an inquiry into sexual misconduct allegations against the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court could be jeopardised by his ties to the body tasked with the investigation, court staff have said.</p> <p>The Guardian understands a number of court officials have raised concerns about Karim Khan\u2019s links to the UN watchdog being lined up to investigate the claims.</p> <p>Some of the concerns, which have been raised at the highest levels of the court,<strong> </strong>relate to the prosecutor\u2019s wife, a human rights lawyer<strong> </strong>who previously worked as an investigator at the UN watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). Dato Shyamala Alagendra is also alleged to have acted inappropriately after the claims against her husband had been made, including contacting the alleged victim.</p> <p>Several ICC sources said the concerns about potential conflicts of interest also related to the chief prosecutor\u2019s links with the OIOS\u2019s head of investigations, whom Khan is understood to have hired as one of his top officials when they worked at the UN.</p> <p>On Monday, the court\u2019s governing body, the assembly of state parties, announced an external inquiry into the allegations after relieving an internal body of re-examining the matter due in part to \u201cperceptions of possible and future conflicts of interest\u201d.</p> <p>The assembly did not disclose who would conduct the investigation, but diplomatic sources said it has asked the OIOS to do so and was finalising an agreement.</p> <p>The scope and formation of the inquiry has been the subject of protracted closed-door negotiations between the ICC\u2019s member states as they grapple with a deepening crisis for the court amid acute geopolitical sensitivities.</p> <p>The external inquiry will examine the allegations against Khan, which, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/oct/27/icc-prosecutor-karim-khan-allegedly-tried-suppress-sexual-misconduct-claims\">the Guardian reported last month</a>, include claims of unwanted sexual touching and \u201cabuse\u201d over an extended period, as well as coercive behaviour and abuse of authority.</p> <p>Lawyers for Khan, 54, have said he denies all the allegations and that he \u201clooks forward to engaging fully\u201d with the inquiry. The alleged victim, an ICC staff member in her 30s who worked directly for the chief prosecutor, has declined to comment.</p> <p>According to several ICC sources, the woman has told court authorities she would be willing to cooperate with the investigation provided it was sufficiently independent, but is said to have expressed concerns about the OIOS.</p> <p>Khan is facing a backlash among many of his staff over his decision to ignore advice from senior officials that he should take a leave of absence until the inquiry is resolved, four sources in the prosecutor\u2019s office said.</p> <p>\u201cStaff are boiling that he has unilaterally decided to stay on,\u201d one source said. Khan\u2019s senior staff, they added, had conveyed to his two deputy prosecutors that he should temporarily step aside \u201cto prevent a chilling effect on witnesses and protect the integrity of the inquiry\u201d.</p> <h2>Claims about Alagendra\u2019s actions</h2> <p>As some of Khan\u2019s senior staff began to press for an external inquiry into the allegations last month, it emerged internally that the OIOS \u2013 a watchdog responsible for internal investigations, audits and inspections of UN agencies \u2013 was in the running to carry out the investigation.</p> <p>Within days, concerns began to be raised among senior ICC officials, the staff union, and with the presidency of the assembly about Khan and his wife\u2019s connections to the OIOS, sources familiar with the discussions said.</p> <p>Alagendra, a high-profile international lawyer who specialises in sexual and gender-based crimes, worked at the<strong> </strong>OIOS from 2019-20 as a senior investigator focused on sexual harassment and abuse.</p>    <p>One former UN official said Alagendra has \u201cdeep connections\u201d at the watchdog. \u201cShe was an investigator and knows many of [its] investigators,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Alagendra\u2019s OIOS ties have raised concerns among a group of Khan\u2019s staff who learned in recent weeks of how she is alleged to have responded to the claims against her husband.</p> <p>According to four sources aware of the situation, within days of Khan being informed of the allegations against him in early May, Alagendra contacted and spoke to the alleged victim and an ICC staff member, a longstanding adviser to the prosecutor who had reported the allegations internally days earlier.</p> <p>The sources said the timing and nature of her contacts with both people were regarded as unusual and highly inappropriate.</p> <p>At the time, an internal oversight body at the court was conducting an initial inquiry to assess the allegations. Within five days of learning of the claims, internal investigators decided against opening a full investigation.</p> <p>Alagendra contacted the alleged victim shortly after Khan had been told the allegations would be formally reported, according to several ICC sources. She suggested they meet the following day when she would be in the court for a previously arranged official meeting with her husband.</p> <p>Sources briefed on the situation said the alleged victim subsequently told colleagues she found the situation involving Khan\u2019s wife, which included two further approaches, to be alarming.</p> <p>In a statement, Alagendra said: \u201cI have never discussed these allegations or any related inquiry with an alleged victim or with anyone from OIOS. Nor have I ever attempted to discourage, threaten or intimidate anyone at all, let alone an alleged victim or an OTP [office of the prosecutor] staff member, from pursuing or reporting any complaint.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cThese allegations are extremely hurtful to me because all spheres of my life have been devoted to defending and upholding the rights of the vulnerable and disadvantaged. This includes my work in prioritising the prosecution of sexual and gender-based crimes as well as crimes against children.

      "bodyText": "The integrity of an inquiry into sexual misconduct allegations against the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court could be jeopardised by his ties to the body tasked with the investigation, court staff have said. The Guardian understands a number of court officials have raised concerns about Karim Khan\u2019s links to the UN watchdog being lined up to investigate the claims. Some of the concerns, which have been raised at the highest levels of the court, relate to the prosecutor\u2019s wife, a human rights lawyer who previously worked as an investigator at the UN watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). Dato Shyamala Alagendra is also alleged to have acted inappropriately after the claims against her husband had been made, including contacting the alleged victim. Several ICC sources said the concerns about potential conflicts of interest also related to the chief prosecutor\u2019s links with the OIOS\u2019s head of investigations, whom Khan is understood to have hired as one of his top officials when they worked at the UN. On Monday, the court\u2019s governing body, the assembly of state parties, announced an external inquiry into the allegations after relieving an internal body of re-examining the matter due in part to \u201cperceptions of possible and future conflicts of interest\u201d. The assembly did not disclose who would conduct the investigation, but diplomatic sources said it has asked the OIOS to do so and was finalising an agreement. The scope and formation of the inquiry has been the subject of protracted closed-door negotiations between the ICC\u2019s member states as they grapple with a deepening crisis for the court amid acute geopolitical sensitivities. The external inquiry will examine the allegations against Khan, which, the Guardian reported last month, include claims of unwanted sexual touching and \u201cabuse\u201d over an extended period, as well as coercive behaviour and abuse of authority. Lawyers for Khan, 54, have said he denies all the allegations and that he \u201clooks forward to engaging fully\u201d with the inquiry. The alleged victim, an ICC staff member in her 30s who worked directly for the chief prosecutor, has declined to comment. According to several ICC sources, the woman has told court authorities she would be willing to cooperate with the investigation provided it was sufficiently independent, but is said to have expressed concerns about the OIOS. Khan is facing a backlash among many of his staff over his decision to ignore advice from senior officials that he should take a leave of absence until the inquiry is resolved, four sources in the prosecutor\u2019s office said. \u201cStaff are boiling that he has unilaterally decided to stay on,\u201d one source said. Khan\u2019s senior staff, they added, had conveyed to his two deputy prosecutors that he should temporarily step aside \u201cto prevent a chilling effect on witnesses and protect the integrity of the inquiry\u201d. Claims about Alagendra\u2019s actions As some of Khan\u2019s senior staff began to press for an external inquiry into the allegations last month, it emerged internally that the OIOS \u2013 a watchdog responsible for internal investigations, audits and inspections of UN agencies \u2013 was in the running to carry out the investigation. Within days, concerns began to be raised among senior ICC officials, the staff union, and with the presidency of the assembly about Khan and his wife\u2019s connections to the OIOS, sources familiar with the discussions said. Alagendra, a high-profile international lawyer who specialises in sexual and gender-based crimes, worked at the OIOS from 2019-20 as a senior investigator focused on sexual harassment and abuse. One former UN official said Alagendra has \u201cdeep connections\u201d at the watchdog. \u201cShe was an investigator and knows many of [its] investigators,\u201d they said. Alagendra\u2019s OIOS ties have raised concerns among a group of Khan\u2019s staff who learned in recent weeks of how she is alleged to have responded to the claims against her husband. According to four sources aware of the situation, within days of Khan being informed of the allegations against him in early May, Alagendra contacted and spoke to the alleged victim and an ICC staff member, a longstanding adviser to the prosecutor who had reported the allegations internally days earlier. The sources said the timing and nature of her contacts with both people were regarded as unusual and highly inappropriate. At the time, an internal oversight body at the court was conducting an initial inquiry to assess the allegations. Within five days of learning of the claims, internal investigators decided against opening a full investigation. Alagendra contacted the alleged victim shortly after Khan had been told the allegations would be formally reported, according to several ICC sources. She suggested they meet the following day when she would be in the court for a previously arranged official meeting with her husband. Sources briefed on the situation said the alleged victim subsequently told colleagues she found the situation involving Khan\u2019s wife, which included two further approaches, to be alarming. In a statement, Alagendra said: \u201cI have never discussed these allegations or any related inquiry with an alleged victim or with anyone from OIOS. Nor have I ever attempted to discourage, threaten or intimidate anyone at all, let alone an alleged victim or an OTP [office of the prosecutor] staff member, from pursuing or reporting any complaint.\u201d She added: \u201cThese allegations are extremely hurtful to me because all spheres of my life have been devoted to defending and upholding the rights of the vulnerable and disadvantaged. This includes my work in prioritising the prosecution of sexual and gender-based crimes as well as crimes against children. My commitment in this regard has always been, and continues to be, unwavering.\u201d Khan\u2019s ties with senior watchdog investigator The second concern among Khan\u2019s staff about his ties to the UN watchdog surfaced when it became known that the director of its investigations division previously worked closely with Khan at the UN. It is understood the senior investigator served as one of Khan\u2019s top officials from 2018-21 when he ran a UN body that investigated crimes committed by Islamic State militants. It is unclear whether the official, who did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment, will recuse herself from any involvement in the inquiry into Khan. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by her. Lawyers for Khan said he had not discussed the allegations with the UN watchdog or its investigations chief and \u201che has had no communication with that official or for that matter the OIOS itself for some years\u201d. The president of the assembly of state parties declined to comment when asked what steps it was taking to ensure the independence of the OIOS investigation. A diplomat familiar with the plan to appoint the OIOS suggested it had \u201cinbuilt mechanisms to deal with any potential conflicts\u201d. The assembly is understood to be working with the watchdog to establish how the inquiry will operate. The investigation comes at a sensitive moment for Khan as a panel of ICC judges continues to consider his applications for arrest warrants against the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Khan has suggested the sexual misconduct allegations may be part of a campaign against him, referring to \u201ca wide range of attacks and threats\u201d, however the Guardian reported on Monday that officials close to him do not believe the allegations are connected to any kind of plot by hostile external actors.",

      "body": "<p>When the ecologist and writer Robin Wall Kimmerer is in a city for work and starts to feel disconnected from the natural world, she likes to do a breathing exercise. She inhales and thinks about how she is breathing in the breath of plants. And then she exhales, and she thinks about how her breath, in turn, gives plants life. \u201cThat is a super fundamental way to recognise our reciprocity in the living world; that we are not separate,\u201d she tells me, speaking on a video call from her farm near Syracuse, in upstate New York.</p> <p>Once you begin to recognise yourself as symbiotically connected to plants, it might shift your views on politics, too. One of the great \u201cdelusions\u201d of market capitalism, Kimmerer continues, is its notion of self-interest. Because how should you define the self? \u201cIf&nbsp;my self is the economic me, supposed to maximise my return on investment, that\u2019s a very different notion than if my self is permeable, if it includes the trees whose oxygen I am breathing, and those birds, and the soil,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is October and outside her home the leaves are turning, while farmers are harvesting corn and picking apples. She is speaking from her office, which is painted such a vibrant shade of blue that it looks otherworldly. Kimmerer, who is 71, with long grey wavy hair and a mellifluous voice, does most of her writing in this blue room. She writes her first drafts longhand, in green or purple ink on lined yellow legal paper. \u201cI can tear them&nbsp;up and shuffle them!\u201d she says of this method, flapping a few pages of her next book towards the computer&nbsp;camera.</p> <p>Kimmerer\u2019s second book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/braiding-sweetgrass-9780141991955/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">Braiding Sweetgrass</a>, was published in 2013 by the small nonprofit publisher Milkweed Editions and became a word-of-mouth sensation, entering the bestseller lists in 2020 \u2013 where it remains \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/95400-braiding-sweetgrass-author-robin-wall-kimmerer-heads-to-scribner.html\">selling more than 2m copies</a>. It is beautiful and unusual, the rare book that might cause you to forever see the world a little differently. In lyrical essays that span science, memoir, Indigenous wisdom and storytelling, Kimmerer, who is Native American, invites people to reconsider their relationship with plants and animals. She tells me she wanted to \u201chelp people fall in love with the world again\u201d.</p> <p>Her new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-serviceberry-9780241721308/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Serviceberry</a>, is a slim, elegant distillation of some of her political ideas. It uses the serviceberry \u2013 a wild, red-purple berry, also known as a juneberry or sugarplum \u2013 to explore the idea of the&nbsp;gift economy, one structured around interconnectedness and reciprocity, as an alternative to the market economy. The serviceberry shares its wealth, its berries, freely with the natural world, and these birds, insects and humans in turn ensure its survival. In this world, all flourishing is mutual.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We hear so much about hope.\u00a0Hope for what? For me it\u2019s about helping people fall in love with the world again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When we buy something, we acquire rights over it and feel we can use it as we please. When something is a gift, however, we recognise our wider responsibilities. \u201cA woolly knit hat that you purchase at the store will keep you warm regardless of its origin, but if it was hand knit by your favourite auntie, then you are in relationship to that \u2018thing\u2019 in a very different way: you are responsible for it, and your gratitude has motive force in the world,\u201d she writes. A serviceberry picked by the roadside feels, quite obviously, like a gift from nature: it would be greedy to pick all the berries and wrong to cut down the bush. What if we recognised more things as a gift from nature?</p> <p>The Serviceberry is the first book Kimmerer has written knowing she now has a wide readership, and she felt newly \u201ccautious\u201d, particularly as she is venturing into new territory by writing about economics. It grew out of an essay she wrote for the US magazine Emergence in 2022. She initially turned down the commission to write about economics, saying that she didn\u2019t know enough about the subject, \u201cother than that what I understand to be market capitalism is somehow destroying the things I love, and that I am somehow complicit because it\u2019s the default world that we live in\u201d. But then she realised that as an ecologist she had long studied the \u201ceconomy of nature\u201d, how energy and resources are distributed between living beings. \u201cAnd so I wondered if my own musings, confusion, resistance might be of value to others,\u201d she tells me.</p> <p>In the book, she cites free farm stands, used to share surplus vegetables, and <a href=\"https://littlefreelibrary.org/\">Little Free Library</a>, the book-sharing initiative that has spread across the US, as examples of thriving gift economies. Knowing that such projects exist gives people more agency to push back against modern capitalism, she argues, and invites them to ask: \u201cHow could we create this more subversive, relationship-based, commons-based economy and let it grow up underneath capitalism, hoping that one day it might replace it?\u201d</p>    <p>When we speak, the US election is fast approaching, and upstate New York is politically divided. On the country roads near Kimmerer\u2019s farm, she sees both Harris signs and \u201cvitriolic\u201d Trump signs. \u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of great change. We\u2019re in great danger. I feel that every day,\u201d Kimmerer says. She has found the level of support for Trump in Syracuse shocking. I wondered how these stark political divides play out in close-knit rural communities. \u201cThere are tensions,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cFor the most part, people are very community-minded \u2026 if you slip off the road on an icy, snowy night, people are going to pull you out of the ditch regardless of what bumper stickers you have on your truck. But it does undermine this call for coming together as a community, because we\u2019ve become distrustful of each other.\u201d</p> <p>The prose in The Serviceberry is vivid and poetic, and also fierce. The frilly cup at the top of a serviceberry is called a calyx, she writes, \u201cin case you were craving a delicious new word, the way some people crave money\u201d. When she writes of people who are greedy and dishonest, she calls them \u201cDarrens\u201d, after Darren Woods, the CEO of ExxonMobil. When she was writing The Serviceberry, new evidence emerged that Exxon and other fossil fuel companies <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64241994\">made accurate predictions about global heating</a> decades ago but covered up the evidence. (Exxon denies the allegations.)</p> <p>She says when she feels \u201cparalysed\u201d she finds it helpful to remember that even a system as big as global capitalism is led by individuals. \u201cWe do have to call them out, and name them as the Windigos that they are, with all the ethical, moral jeopardy associated with that,\u201d she says. (A Windigo is the selfish, cannibalistic monster of Native American storytelling.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I fear altogether too many scientists hide behind the notion that our objectivity will somehow be compromised by advocacy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kimmerer has long been involved in the environmental movement but believes its efforts to scare people into action are misguided. Fear doesn\u2019t motivate people to act, she says. But love does. \u201cAnd&nbsp;it\u2019s really love more than hope,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe hear so much of: \u2018Well, do you have hope?\u2019 Hope for what? For me it\u2019s about helping people fall in love with the world again. We know as people the power we have when we really recognise our love for someone or something. Hmm! \u2013 there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to stand in our way.\u201d</p> <p>As an author, Kimmerer\u2019s first inspiration was the scientist and writer Loren Eiseley, whose lyrical explorations of natural science served as a model. She&nbsp;says she also draws inspiration from the poet&nbsp;Wendell Berry, and Rachel Carson, the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/silent-spring-9780141184944/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">Silent Spring</a>, a foundational text for the modern environmental movement. Kimmerer says she admires Carson as a pioneering female scientist and one who \u201ccombined her knowledge with a sense of responsibility for that knowledge\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI fear altogether too many scientists hide behind this notion that our objectivity will somehow be compromised by advocacy. I couldn\u2019t disagree more,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we have the privilege of understanding how the living world works, who better than the scientific community to also stand up and tell this story?\u201d</p> <p>Kimmerer, who has enjoyed an eminent academic career and is a distinguished teaching professor of environmental biology at the State University of New&nbsp;York (SUNY), is nonetheless critical of academia, which she describes as \u201chighly conformist, highly assimilative; there are milestones you have to meet, ways you have to behave\u201d. When she was applying for graduate studies,&nbsp;an adviser wrote that \u201cshe\u2019s done remarkably well for an Indian girl\u201d, and for many years Kimmerer felt forced to conform, which meant setting aside her&nbsp;Native heritage.</p>    <p>Her grandfather had been sent to a state boarding school, where students were forcibly stripped of their Native language and traditions, but Kimmerer was raised by her parents as part of the Potawatomi tribe. Kimmerer now leads the <a href=\"https://www.esf.edu/nativepeoples/\">Center for Native Peoples and the Environment</a> at SUNY, which champions the marriage of Indigenous wisdom and modern science. She tells her students they must become \u201cbilingual\u201d, and they must understand the use and limits of each intellectual tradition. The scientific method is the best tool for settling factual questions, but it isn\u2019t equipped to answer questions about values or ethics.</p> <p>Kimmerer always describes herself first as a mother and only then as a scientist, decorated professor and enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation.

Children are \u201ca gift, and the essence of a gift economy is a gift stays in motion\u201d, she tells me.

      "bodyText": "When the ecologist and writer Robin Wall Kimmerer is in a city for work and starts to feel disconnected from the natural world, she likes to do a breathing exercise. She inhales and thinks about how she is breathing in the breath of plants. And then she exhales, and she thinks about how her breath, in turn, gives plants life. \u201cThat is a super fundamental way to recognise our reciprocity in the living world; that we are not separate,\u201d she tells me, speaking on a video call from her farm near Syracuse, in upstate New York. Once you begin to recognise yourself as symbiotically connected to plants, it might shift your views on politics, too. One of the great \u201cdelusions\u201d of market capitalism, Kimmerer continues, is its notion of self-interest. Because how should you define the self? \u201cIf my self is the economic me, supposed to maximise my return on investment, that\u2019s a very different notion than if my self is permeable, if it includes the trees whose oxygen I am breathing, and those birds, and the soil,\u201d she says. It is October and outside her home the leaves are turning, while farmers are harvesting corn and picking apples. She is speaking from her office, which is painted such a vibrant shade of blue that it looks otherworldly. Kimmerer, who is 71, with long grey wavy hair and a mellifluous voice, does most of her writing in this blue room. She writes her first drafts longhand, in green or purple ink on lined yellow legal paper. \u201cI can tear them up and shuffle them!\u201d she says of this method, flapping a few pages of her next book towards the computer camera. Kimmerer\u2019s second book, Braiding Sweetgrass, was published in 2013 by the small nonprofit publisher Milkweed Editions and became a word-of-mouth sensation, entering the bestseller lists in 2020 \u2013 where it remains \u2013 and selling more than 2m copies. It is beautiful and unusual, the rare book that might cause you to forever see the world a little differently. In lyrical essays that span science, memoir, Indigenous wisdom and storytelling, Kimmerer, who is Native American, invites people to reconsider their relationship with plants and animals. She tells me she wanted to \u201chelp people fall in love with the world again\u201d. Her new book, The Serviceberry, is a slim, elegant distillation of some of her political ideas. It uses the serviceberry \u2013 a wild, red-purple berry, also known as a juneberry or sugarplum \u2013 to explore the idea of the gift economy, one structured around interconnectedness and reciprocity, as an alternative to the market economy. The serviceberry shares its wealth, its berries, freely with the natural world, and these birds, insects and humans in turn ensure its survival. In this world, all flourishing is mutual. When we buy something, we acquire rights over it and feel we can use it as we please. When something is a gift, however, we recognise our wider responsibilities. \u201cA woolly knit hat that you purchase at the store will keep you warm regardless of its origin, but if it was hand knit by your favourite auntie, then you are in relationship to that \u2018thing\u2019 in a very different way: you are responsible for it, and your gratitude has motive force in the world,\u201d she writes. A serviceberry picked by the roadside feels, quite obviously, like a gift from nature: it would be greedy to pick all the berries and wrong to cut down the bush. What if we recognised more things as a gift from nature? The Serviceberry is the first book Kimmerer has written knowing she now has a wide readership, and she felt newly \u201ccautious\u201d, particularly as she is venturing into new territory by writing about economics. It grew out of an essay she wrote for the US magazine Emergence in 2022. She initially turned down the commission to write about economics, saying that she didn\u2019t know enough about the subject, \u201cother than that what I understand to be market capitalism is somehow destroying the things I love, and that I am somehow complicit because it\u2019s the default world that we live in\u201d. But then she realised that as an ecologist she had long studied the \u201ceconomy of nature\u201d, how energy and resources are distributed between living beings. \u201cAnd so I wondered if my own musings, confusion, resistance might be of value to others,\u201d she tells me. In the book, she cites free farm stands, used to share surplus vegetables, and Little Free Library, the book-sharing initiative that has spread across the US, as examples of thriving gift economies. Knowing that such projects exist gives people more agency to push back against modern capitalism, she argues, and invites them to ask: \u201cHow could we create this more subversive, relationship-based, commons-based economy and let it grow up underneath capitalism, hoping that one day it might replace it?\u201d When we speak, the US election is fast approaching, and upstate New York is politically divided. On the country roads near Kimmerer\u2019s farm, she sees both Harris signs and \u201cvitriolic\u201d Trump signs. \u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of great change. We\u2019re in great danger. I feel that every day,\u201d Kimmerer says. She has found the level of support for Trump in Syracuse shocking. I wondered how these stark political divides play out in close-knit rural communities. \u201cThere are tensions,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cFor the most part, people are very community-minded \u2026 if you slip off the road on an icy, snowy night, people are going to pull you out of the ditch regardless of what bumper stickers you have on your truck. But it does undermine this call for coming together as a community, because we\u2019ve become distrustful of each other.\u201d The prose in The Serviceberry is vivid and poetic, and also fierce. The frilly cup at the top of a serviceberry is called a calyx, she writes, \u201cin case you were craving a delicious new word, the way some people crave money\u201d. When she writes of people who are greedy and dishonest, she calls them \u201cDarrens\u201d, after Darren Woods, the CEO of ExxonMobil. When she was writing The Serviceberry, new evidence emerged that Exxon and other fossil fuel companies made accurate predictions about global heating decades ago but covered up the evidence. (Exxon denies the allegations.) She says when she feels \u201cparalysed\u201d she finds it helpful to remember that even a system as big as global capitalism is led by individuals. \u201cWe do have to call them out, and name them as the Windigos that they are, with all the ethical, moral jeopardy associated with that,\u201d she says. (A Windigo is the selfish, cannibalistic monster of Native American storytelling.) Kimmerer has long been involved in the environmental movement but believes its efforts to scare people into action are misguided. Fear doesn\u2019t motivate people to act, she says. But love does. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really love more than hope,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe hear so much of: \u2018Well, do you have hope?\u2019 Hope for what? For me it\u2019s about helping people fall in love with the world again. We know as people the power we have when we really recognise our love for someone or something. Hmm! \u2013 there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to stand in our way.\u201d As an author, Kimmerer\u2019s first inspiration was the scientist and writer Loren Eiseley, whose lyrical explorations of natural science served as a model. She says she also draws inspiration from the poet Wendell Berry, and Rachel Carson, the author of Silent Spring, a foundational text for the modern environmental movement. Kimmerer says she admires Carson as a pioneering female scientist and one who \u201ccombined her knowledge with a sense of responsibility for that knowledge\u201d. \u201cI fear altogether too many scientists hide behind this notion that our objectivity will somehow be compromised by advocacy. I couldn\u2019t disagree more,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we have the privilege of understanding how the living world works, who better than the scientific community to also stand up and tell this story?\u201d Kimmerer, who has enjoyed an eminent academic career and is a distinguished teaching professor of environmental biology at the State University of New York (SUNY), is nonetheless critical of academia, which she describes as \u201chighly conformist, highly assimilative; there are milestones you have to meet, ways you have to behave\u201d. When she was applying for graduate studies, an adviser wrote that \u201cshe\u2019s done remarkably well for an Indian girl\u201d, and for many years Kimmerer felt forced to conform, which meant setting aside her Native heritage. Her grandfather had been sent to a state boarding school, where students were forcibly stripped of their Native language and traditions, but Kimmerer was raised by her parents as part of the Potawatomi tribe. Kimmerer now leads the Center for Native Peoples and the Environment at SUNY, which champions the marriage of Indigenous wisdom and modern science. She tells her students they must become \u201cbilingual\u201d, and they must understand the use and limits of each intellectual tradition. The scientific method is the best tool for settling factual questions, but it isn\u2019t equipped to answer questions about values or ethics. Kimmerer always describes herself first as a mother and only then as a scientist, decorated professor and enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. Introducing herself in this way is an \u201cact of resistance\u201d. \u201cI got a bit tired of mostly all of my male colleagues, every time they introduced themselves, it was like a resum\u00e9,\u201d she tells me. She remembers the first time she accidentally let slip that she couldn\u2019t make a work meeting because she had to go to Brownies, and how this confession opened the way for her colleagues to also be more honest about their personal commitments. I tell her how deeply her writing on motherhood has resonated with me. In Braiding Sweetgrass there is a poignant essay about time and entropy, her two daughters growing up and leaving home, and her efforts to create for them a swimming pond in her garden \u2013 the epic, never-ending task of keeping the algae at bay so that the pond can sustain other life. \u201cIt is the fundamental unfairness of parenthood that if we do our jobs well, the deepest bond we are given will walk out of the door with a wave over the shoulder,\u201d she writes, and although my children are still very young, this line always makes me cry.

And then she leans forward and adds in a conspiratorial stage whisper: \u201cBut they do come back!\u201d Kimmerer remains close to both of her daughters, one of whom lives near her in Syracuse, and she now has three grandchildren, aged four, seven and 10.

Scholz, who spoke to Trump by phone on Sunday, told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Friday his call with the president-elect was \u201cperhaps surprisingly, a very detailed and good conversation\u201d. Asked by the paper whether Trump would make a deal over the head of the Ukrainians, Scholz said Trump gave \u201cno indication\u201d that he would.

It said units downed one drone each in Bryansk region, also on the border, and in Lipetsk region, farther north. The ministry said one drone was downed in central Oryol region. And the governor of Belgorod region, a frequent target on the Ukrainian border, said a series of attacks had smashed windows in a block of flats and caused other damage, but no casualties were reported.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Russia will suspend gas deliveries to Austria via Ukraine on Saturday.</strong> Russia\u2019s gas export route to Europe via Ukraine is set to shut at the end of this year. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement with Russian state-owned Gazprom, in order to deprive Russia of profits that Kyiv says help to finance the war against it. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said Gazprom\u2019s notice of ending supplies was long expected and Austria has made preparations, but the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia\u2019s action showed it \u201conce again uses energy as a weapon\u201d. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Russia\u2019s leading tanker group, Sovcomflot, said on Friday that western sanctions on Russian oil tankers were limiting its financial performance, as it reported falling revenues and core earnings.</strong> The US imposed sanctions on Sovcomflot in February, part of Washington\u2019s efforts to reduce Russia\u2019s revenues from oil sales that it can use to finance its war in Ukraine.

Trump\u2019s re-election in last week\u2019s US presidential vote has raised concerns he could withdraw Washington\u2019s significant support for Ukraine once back in the White House. Scholz, who spoke to Trump by phone on Sunday, told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Friday his call with the president-elect was \u201cperhaps surprisingly, a very detailed and good conversation\u201d. Asked by the paper whether Trump would make a deal over the head of the Ukrainians, Scholz said Trump gave \u201cno indication\u201d that he would. Germany, for its part, would not accept a \u201cpeace by diktat\u201d, Scholz said. Scholz urged Putin to pull Russian forces out of Ukraine and begin talks with Kyiv that would open the way for a \u201cjust and lasting peace\u201d, in the first phone conversation between the two leaders in nearly two years. The Kremlin said the conversation on Friday had come at Berlin\u2019s request, and that Putin had told Scholz any agreement to end the war in Ukraine must take Russian security interests into account and reflect \u201cnew territorial realities\u201d. A German government spokesperson said Scholz \u201cstressed Germany\u2019s unbroken determination to back Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression for as long as necessary\u201d. Russian air defence units intercepted a series of Ukrainian drones in several Russian regions, officials said, many of them in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a major incursion in August. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said air defences downed 15 drones in Kursk region on the Ukrainian border. It said units downed one drone each in Bryansk region, also on the border, and in Lipetsk region, farther north. The ministry said one drone was downed in central Oryol region. And the governor of Belgorod region, a frequent target on the Ukrainian border, said a series of attacks had smashed windows in a block of flats and caused other damage, but no casualties were reported. Russia will suspend gas deliveries to Austria via Ukraine on Saturday. Russia\u2019s gas export route to Europe via Ukraine is set to shut at the end of this year. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement with Russian state-owned Gazprom, in order to deprive Russia of profits that Kyiv says help to finance the war against it. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said Gazprom\u2019s notice of ending supplies was long expected and Austria has made preparations, but the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia\u2019s action showed it \u201conce again uses energy as a weapon\u201d. Russia\u2019s leading tanker group, Sovcomflot, said on Friday that western sanctions on Russian oil tankers were limiting its financial performance, as it reported falling revenues and core earnings. The US imposed sanctions on Sovcomflot in February, part of Washington\u2019s efforts to reduce Russia\u2019s revenues from oil sales that it can use to finance its war in Ukraine. Sovcomflot reported a 22.2% year-on-year drop in nine-month revenue to $1.22bn and said its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation slumped by 31.5% to $861m.",

      "body": "<p>There is an issue in most British cities these days with the sheer density of hi-vis clothing in circulation. Walk through any busy urban location and it can take a while to adjust to the fact that pretty much everyone and everything is draped in some shade of luminous yellow, an entire world clamouring to be seen before the other things are seen.</p> <p>It raises some interesting questions. If everything is hi-vis, is anything ever actually just vis? If you were, for example, to walk past a cyclist and an Argos delivery driver being arrested by a vanload of police, watched by a group of builders and 400 members of a charity walk, is there a danger the entire spectacle will be completely invisible, that all we have in this scenario is emphasis, hi-vis on top of hi-vis?</p> <p>This is of course a clumsily realised introductory metaphor, on this occasion for the internet, news media, social media and the shared Algorithm Life. For anyone who spends any time in it, the daily online existence is basically all emphasis now, all clamour, coalescing into a single increasingly nudged and politicised field of noise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/13/the-guardian-no-longer-post-on-x-twitter-elon-musk\">Guardian will no longer post on Elon Musk\u2019s X from its official accounts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a process that reached an interesting stage this week with a significant migration away from one of these sources of static, the posting site X. The Guardian has suspended its own accounts and resolved to share its online content in other ways.</p> <p>On the face of it this is very obviously a good decision, if only because anything that involves not being on social media for any period of time is always a good decision. Humans are not really supposed to live inside a globally networked hive mind. And certainly not a hive mind like X, which feels from the first moment of log-in like being dry humped by a malevolent robot, and in the longer term like repeatedly stabbing yourself in the brain with a white-hot knitting needle made of hate.</p> <p>Many former X users have shifted to alternative apps called things like AgreeSpace or BeardGuy. The Elon Musk ownership has altered things in this respect, and not just by diminishing the basic experience. Musk is a highly unusual human, obviously super-high-functioning in very specific areas, perfect for right here and now, and with that oozing quality, spreading himself into every surface like human AI.</p> <p>Musk has also chosen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/13/elon-musk-donald-trump-us-politics\">to make himself a political figure</a>, and to engage like this on his platform so that it too becomes political. This in turn forces users to make their own political choice. Annoyingly, both staying and leaving have both now become unavoidably significant.</p>    <p>Here\u2019s the thing though. Sport Twitter (as I will insist on calling it) is both highly socialised and weirdly absorbing. The idea of leaving it is still hard to swallow. Not because it\u2019s good or nice. God no. Sometimes it is simply the worst place in the world. But it is also perfect content for the medium. In its best moments it\u2019s a genuinely warm and funny online community. You\u2019ve got to admit, it has been a pretty wild ride these last 15 years.</p> <p>Even an average Sport Twitter day \u2013 share thought, read posts, learn things, get called a nonce, scroll some AI stuff about how Max Rushden\u2019s appearance on the Tonight Show has people talking about his tax planning scheme (\u201cthey were shocked\u201d) \u2013 can feel like a party.</p> <p>Back when the world was young, when the wild frontier was wide open, it was exhilarating to hear those distant, instant voices for the first time. Here is Darren Bent talking about his shoes. Here is Jordan Pickford wanting a McDonald\u2019s. As long ago as May 2011 I wrote a naive and hopeful article about the Twitter phenomenon of open access to players, gushing about grappling hooks being thrown between two worlds, a new sense of warmth and connection.</p> <p>Naturally the first comment underneath the article, still present to this day, is \u201cWhat a load of middle class garbage\u201d. And this is the real tone of Sport Twitter \u2013 unruliness and iconoclasm, endless waves of hate-fun, often just hate, sometimes just fun.</p> <p>Twitter would go on to become a highly effective rolling news source. I first heard of Nelson Mandela\u2019s death via a Pakistani cricket account. Stars have risen and fallen here. There are vast tangled empires now based solely around one well-groomed man telling you about a transfer news story slightly before it actually happens.</p> <p>Good things happened on Sport Twitter, or spread there from the other socials. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jan/20/rashford-demands-a-meal-a-day-for-all-school-pupils-in-need\">Marcus Rashford and food for kids</a>. Raheem Sterling redefining racism in the media. There was a genuine thrill of event glamour about, say, Pel\u00e9 tweeting, which always did feel like actual Pel\u00e9, twanging at your chest every time. In between there have just been loads of laughs, from Danny Gabbidon telling the entire Swansea Twitter fanbase to fuck off after trying and failing to have a friendly discussion, to Ian Botham\u2019s \u201chacked\u201d cock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/15/x-bluesky-social-media-platforms\">The exodus from X to Bluesky has happened \u2013 the era of mass social media platforms is over | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are clear subsets within this world. Cricket Twitter is waspish, funny and, ineffably disappointed. Tennis Twitter: obsessive, cliquey, passionate. Olympic Twitter: very enthusiastic mums who are nice. Boxing Twitter: informed grudge-laden one-upmanship. Rugby Twitter: no idea, but we could all definitely learn a lot from rugby Twitter.</p> <p>And so we arrive at the desiccated present, with an app that seems to be populated now almost entirely by robots, lunatics, one-note hobbyists, and one-note lunatic robots. It has been easy to grow slightly addicted to this stuff down the years. But it has also got noticeably worse.</p> <p>Ambient anger levels are through the roof. Some people are just out there to break things. Otherwise it can feel like this is the space where we all put our most toxic part, where the collective black dog lurks.</p> <p>The whole place feels less human and more automatised. Maybe because it is, and maybe also because this is what a decade in here does to you. We\u2019re all robots now, another side-effect of that sustained hi-vis exposure, senses dulled, bored but over-stimulated, always looking for something to feel.</p> <p>Perhaps it really is time to deactivate X. Personally, I still quite like it on there. Filter the replies. Never, ever scroll. Take the good bits and exit when it\u2019s bad. And what about those newer social sites? Yes, you can join Windbag: Communing in Pleasancy. But how long will that purity last?</p> <p>This is the real moral of the story of Noah\u2019s ark. Sin will always bloom again. Someone will have the wrong vibe. Your views on Emile Smith Rowe or craft ale will be unacceptable. People will get angry about not being angry any more. Before we know it Hal won\u2019t open the doors. Humans are humans. It\u2019s all in there still.</p> <p>It will be hard to say goodbye to this thing, to accept that the party is over, that the last few years have been spent trying to dance with a corpse. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m done just yet. I still like the fight, and the warmth that belongs in the end to actual people and the things they like, not to human plutonium in a baseball hat. There is surely time for one last glass. Look, it\u2019s already open. Margaux 53. Best of the century. Before it\u2019s time, finally, to close the door on all this.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is an issue in most British cities these days with the sheer density of hi-vis clothing in circulation. Walk through any busy urban location and it can take a while to adjust to the fact that pretty much everyone and everything is draped in some shade of luminous yellow, an entire world clamouring to be seen before the other things are seen. It raises some interesting questions. If everything is hi-vis, is anything ever actually just vis? If you were, for example, to walk past a cyclist and an Argos delivery driver being arrested by a vanload of police, watched by a group of builders and 400 members of a charity walk, is there a danger the entire spectacle will be completely invisible, that all we have in this scenario is emphasis, hi-vis on top of hi-vis? This is of course a clumsily realised introductory metaphor, on this occasion for the internet, news media, social media and the shared Algorithm Life. For anyone who spends any time in it, the daily online existence is basically all emphasis now, all clamour, coalescing into a single increasingly nudged and politicised field of noise. It is a process that reached an interesting stage this week with a significant migration away from one of these sources of static, the posting site X. The Guardian has suspended its own accounts and resolved to share its online content in other ways. On the face of it this is very obviously a good decision, if only because anything that involves not being on social media for any period of time is always a good decision. Humans are not really supposed to live inside a globally networked hive mind. And certainly not a hive mind like X, which feels from the first moment of log-in like being dry humped by a malevolent robot, and in the longer term like repeatedly stabbing yourself in the brain with a white-hot knitting needle made of hate. Many former X users have shifted to alternative apps called things like AgreeSpace or BeardGuy. The Elon Musk ownership has altered things in this respect, and not just by diminishing the basic experience. Musk is a highly unusual human, obviously super-high-functioning in very specific areas, perfect for right here and now, and with that oozing quality, spreading himself into every surface like human AI. Musk has also chosen to make himself a political figure, and to engage like this on his platform so that it too becomes political. This in turn forces users to make their own political choice. Annoyingly, both staying and leaving have both now become unavoidably significant. Here\u2019s the thing though. Sport Twitter (as I will insist on calling it) is both highly socialised and weirdly absorbing. The idea of leaving it is still hard to swallow. Not because it\u2019s good or nice. God no. Sometimes it is simply the worst place in the world. But it is also perfect content for the medium. In its best moments it\u2019s a genuinely warm and funny online community. You\u2019ve got to admit, it has been a pretty wild ride these last 15 years. Even an average Sport Twitter day \u2013 share thought, read posts, learn things, get called a nonce, scroll some AI stuff about how Max Rushden\u2019s appearance on the Tonight Show has people talking about his tax planning scheme (\u201cthey were shocked\u201d) \u2013 can feel like a party. Back when the world was young, when the wild frontier was wide open, it was exhilarating to hear those distant, instant voices for the first time. Here is Darren Bent talking about his shoes. Here is Jordan Pickford wanting a McDonald\u2019s. As long ago as May 2011 I wrote a naive and hopeful article about the Twitter phenomenon of open access to players, gushing about grappling hooks being thrown between two worlds, a new sense of warmth and connection. Naturally the first comment underneath the article, still present to this day, is \u201cWhat a load of middle class garbage\u201d. And this is the real tone of Sport Twitter \u2013 unruliness and iconoclasm, endless waves of hate-fun, often just hate, sometimes just fun. Twitter would go on to become a highly effective rolling news source. I first heard of Nelson Mandela\u2019s death via a Pakistani cricket account. Stars have risen and fallen here. There are vast tangled empires now based solely around one well-groomed man telling you about a transfer news story slightly before it actually happens. Good things happened on Sport Twitter, or spread there from the other socials. Marcus Rashford and food for kids. Raheem Sterling redefining racism in the media. There was a genuine thrill of event glamour about, say, Pel\u00e9 tweeting, which always did feel like actual Pel\u00e9, twanging at your chest every time. In between there have just been loads of laughs, from Danny Gabbidon telling the entire Swansea Twitter fanbase to fuck off after trying and failing to have a friendly discussion, to Ian Botham\u2019s \u201chacked\u201d cock. There are clear subsets within this world. Cricket Twitter is waspish, funny and, ineffably disappointed. Tennis Twitter: obsessive, cliquey, passionate. Olympic Twitter: very enthusiastic mums who are nice. Boxing Twitter: informed grudge-laden one-upmanship. Rugby Twitter: no idea, but we could all definitely learn a lot from rugby Twitter. And so we arrive at the desiccated present, with an app that seems to be populated now almost entirely by robots, lunatics, one-note hobbyists, and one-note lunatic robots. It has been easy to grow slightly addicted to this stuff down the years. But it has also got noticeably worse. Ambient anger levels are through the roof. Some people are just out there to break things. Otherwise it can feel like this is the space where we all put our most toxic part, where the collective black dog lurks. The whole place feels less human and more automatised. Maybe because it is, and maybe also because this is what a decade in here does to you. We\u2019re all robots now, another side-effect of that sustained hi-vis exposure, senses dulled, bored but over-stimulated, always looking for something to feel. Perhaps it really is time to deactivate X. Personally, I still quite like it on there. Filter the replies. Never, ever scroll. Take the good bits and exit when it\u2019s bad. And what about those newer social sites? Yes, you can join Windbag: Communing in Pleasancy. But how long will that purity last? This is the real moral of the story of Noah\u2019s ark. Sin will always bloom again. Someone will have the wrong vibe. Your views on Emile Smith Rowe or craft ale will be unacceptable. People will get angry about not being angry any more. Before we know it Hal won\u2019t open the doors. Humans are humans. It\u2019s all in there still. It will be hard to say goodbye to this thing, to accept that the party is over, that the last few years have been spent trying to dance with a corpse. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m done just yet. I still like the fight, and the warmth that belongs in the end to actual people and the things they like, not to human plutonium in a baseball hat. There is surely time for one last glass. Look, it\u2019s already open. Margaux 53. Best of the century. Before it\u2019s time, finally, to close the door on all this.",

      "body": "<p>James Rowe remembers packing a suitcase before the day of his trial verdict, looking at his two young sons and wondering when he would be able to hold them again. He feared that had a jury found him guilty he could have been in prison for up to two years. The level of anxiety was extreme; the loss of control felt almost overwhelming. \u201cSaying goodbye to them is something I\u2019ll never forget in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m feeling I can\u2019t stop the train: that it\u2019s just running away.\u201d</p> <p>Rowe, a free man since his acquittal last month, orders a still water as he tells his story in a Suffolk pub. He would like a swift return to doing what he loves: to further a career that was flourishing when, as manager of Chesterfield on 24 January 2022, life was essentially put on pause. That morning he was at the family home in Derbyshire when John Croot, the Spireites\u2019 CEO, told him he would be suspended after an allegation of sexual harassment. \u201cIt had been released to the media before I could put the phone down,\u201d Rowe says. A matter of days later, police arrived at the house to arrest him; he was charged the following September.</p> <p>Just over a fortnight before Croot\u2019s call Rowe had been on the touchline at Stamford Bridge as Chesterfield, two points clear atop the National League, contested an FA Cup third-round tie against Thomas Tuchel\u2019s European champions. It was a quick, precipitous fall and he had no idea at that point that the fight to clear his name would take almost three years. There are a number of regrets, whether about the chain of events that led to his being charged with sexual assault or the fact that he feels the justice system prevents the full facts from being heard.</p> <p>The case boiled down to whether Rowe had instigated non-consensual sexual contact with the complainant, a masseuse, when he visited her for a massage at a private salon on 24 November 2021. The jury decided that the allegation against him had been unfounded. Rowe knows he consensually participated in something that has had a heavy impact on his personal life and accepts responsibility for that. \u201cI have deep regrets, obviously, about my behaviour in the moment but it was a private matter that should have remained private,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Much of Rowe\u2019s frustration surrounds a legal rule which in his case restricted certain evidence or questions relating to the complainant. \u201cI was bewildered going into the trial because I couldn\u2019t disclose the full story,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to say a key part of my defence.\u201d</p>    <p>Rowe understands the importance of the protection the law offers. He does not want people who have experienced sexual harassment or sexual assault to be deterred from coming forward. But, in his case, he believes there was more behind the complaint and its timing; he is baffled, too, that his legal team was not allowed to cross-examine a friend of the complainant.</p> <p>He also has no real desire to rake back over the case. His first trial collapsed last December owing to a courtroom heating failure, an illness to a prosecutor and the discovery that a member of the jury did not speak English. It was hanging over all parties involved for far too long and he is candid about the effects on his family. He left Chesterfield soon after his suspension and, after a brief spell at Fylde was cut short when charges were brought, found himself out of work. The case has cost him tens of thousands of pounds that will never be recovered.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to sell our home, which was hard,\u201d he says. \u201cThe emotions of not working, losing my livelihood, I wasn\u2019t in a great place. I\u2019ve been carrying a weight, a dark cloud, around with me and trying to hide it in everyday interactions.</p> <p>\u201cMy fiancee was pregnant with our second son at the time and there were complications with his birth last July. We were told he wasn\u2019t going to make it, and that\u2019s difficult to put into words. But after 13 days of amazing care in the neonatal unit he pulled through and I think that was a turning point in the process for me. Everything else became secondary and it was a timely reminder about what matters most.\u201d</p> <p>There was, he says, \u201ca lot of suffering going on behind closed doors\u201d and he knows not everyone can benefit from the kind of network that has backed him. He points to the added strain brought about by being named in the media before he was charged, which led to harassment of his family over social media and what he describes as \u201cbaseless hate crime\u201d.</p> <p>During his period away Rowe took individual sessions with players he had coached during spells with the academies at Birmingham and West Ham, whose set-ups included Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice. He also completed a master\u2019s course in sports directorship, his third qualification of that level. \u201cBut my real passion is setting up a team to win,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love. Coming onto the grass, showing how we\u2019re going to set up, dissecting the information and detail before feeding that back into the players for them to develop. That\u2019s my passion, my craft.\u201d</p> <p>Chesterfield had been 22nd in the National League when he took over at the age of 37 in 2020, having previously managed Gloucester City. He had a win percentage of 59%, one that improved to 60% in his 27 games with Fylde, and Chesterfield had lost twice in the league upon his departure. There is no doubt Rowe\u2019s spell transformed their fortunes; they fell short of promotion after he left but he has watched, with a strong mixture of pride and regret, as they finally put that right under Paul Cook. \u201cJourneys like the one we took at Chesterfield excite me the most,\u201d he says. \u201cA drifting club with an excellent fanbase that was on the brink of regional football, putting processes in place to move it forward while getting results on the pitch.\u201d</p> <p>He had signed improved terms at Chesterfield in October 2021 despite interest from the Football League and Scotland. What still hurts is that the club, to all intents and purposes, dropped him like a stone when the allegation was first made. \u201cThe club hadn\u2019t spoken to the complainant or myself,\u201d he says of the time Croot telephoned. \u201cAnd safeguarding-wise there were no provisions put in place for me or my family, not one interaction took place. They had no idea what I was doing or who I was with. To drop that on me and isolate us, when I genuinely didn\u2019t know what it was until the police came, is just beyond shocking.</p> <p>\u201cEven now, I\u2019ve been swiftly acquitted but where\u2019s my phone call to say: \u2018James, how are you? What do you think you\u2019ll do moving forwards?\u2019\u201d In court Chesterfield were asked why they prevented players from assisting the case despite written requests to do so. Chesterfield did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.</p> <p>Nonetheless it is time to move on. \u201cYou have to remember the good things you have done, but also remember what happened three years ago and be stronger than that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere I left off was a very good space. I got a bump that\u2019s taken me off track, but I want to look forward to how much I can achieve at my next club. I feel I\u2019ve got so much more to give.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "June Squibb\u2019s career has run on a different timeline to that of most movie stars: she made her film debut, in Woody Allen\u2019s Alice, at the age of 60, and it was another 23 years before she landed her breakthrough role in Alexander Payne\u2019s Nebraska. Her performance as an embittered pensioner who saltily badmouths past acquaintances and flashes the gravestone of an ex got her an Oscar nomination. It also got her a run of progressively less amusing naughty-granny roles. In Hollywood, older people can be blandly comforting support or quirky joke fodder but not much more. In Thelma, however, the now 95-year-old Squibb gets her first leading role, as a phone-scam victim tracking down those who robbed her, and adds some welcome human shading to the pensioner-behaving-badly stereotype.

Alexander Payne\u2019s About Schmidt \u2013 briefly featuring Squibb \u2013 finds more offbeat comedy in the senior road-trip premise, as Jack Nicholson\u2019s emotionally adrift widower hits the asphalt in a Winnebago to disrupt his daughter\u2019s wedding, though the film ultimately comes down on the side of taking the nicer, kinder, more regular path in life. There\u2019s certainly little kindness to be found in Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, a film that can hardly be said to respect octogenarians by casting a latex-bedecked Johnny Knoxville as one \u2013 not least in an elaborate gag where his penis is caught in a vending machine \u2013 though there is something to be said for its unsentimental vision of a grumpy old man without the usually mandatory heart of gold. Frank Capra\u2019s delicious 1944 black comedy Arsenic and Old Lace (Internet Archive) took old-age malevolence up a notch with its memorable duo of beaming maiden aunts who also happen to be calculating murderers \u2013 albeit for a cause, as they aim to relieve lonely bachelors of their supposed suffering. There\u2019s less sinister senior criminality to be found in Martin Brest\u2019s Going in Style, as elderly friends George Burns, Art Carney and Lee Strasberg plot and execute a bank heist \u2013 though as their crime has fatal consequences, this seemingly jaunty farce takes on a surprisingly melancholic tone.

      "body": "<h2>Auto-enrolment</h2> <p>Since 2012, employers have had to enrol eligible workers in a pension scheme. You can opt out if you want, but the idea is that you are less likely to leave a pension than start one. Once in the scheme, your employer must&nbsp;make payments worth at least 3% of your salary. You must put in the equivalent of at least 5% of your pre-tax salary. But many experts say that isn\u2019t enough. Phoenix Insights, a thinktank, says the current 8% total minimum contribution \u201cis too low for most savers to achieve an adequate retirement income, and may be giving some a false sense of security\u201d. So consider increasingupping your payments if you can. </p> <h2>Basic-rate taxpayer </h2> <p>Contributions into a workplace scheme are usually paid before you are taxed. For a basic-rate taxpayer, this means a contribution of 5% of your salary into your scheme will reduce your take-home pay by 4% \u2013 so it will cost you \u00a340 to pay in \u00a350. For other workplace schemes and personal pension schemes, the provider will typically claim back the basic-rate tax (20%) for you and pay it into your fund.</p> <h2>Carry forward</h2> <p>There is a maximum sum you can pay into your pensions in each tax year before you have to pay tax. Currently it\u2019s \u00a360,000 for most workers (those earning more than \u00a3200,000 may have a reduced figure). But, as an extra perk, you can use any annual allowance you have left over relating to any of the last three tax years, as long as you earn at least the same amount you want to pay in. That could be useful for people nearing retirement who want to top up their pension, and those who have had a pay rise/promotion, says the Association of Taxation Technicians. As an example, if you paid in \u00a320,000 this year, you could use the remaining \u00a340,000 allowance for 2024-25 in one of the next three tax years.</p> <h2>Defined contribution</h2> <p>With this type of pension, you know how much is going in each month but you don\u2019t know how much you will get at the end. This is because the money that goes in is invested (see Underlying investments). How much it grows will depend on how well the investments perform. Most private sector workers in the UK are now offered this type of scheme.</p>    <h2>Ethical questions</h2> <p>An estimated \u00a388bn of the \u00a33tn in UK pensions funds is invested in fossil fuel firms, and there could be other holdings&nbsp;you disagree with. But there are things you can do. Your workplace pension scheme\u2019s default fund may not be very green, but many offer an ethical or sustainable option, so do ask about that. David Macdonald, the founder of the ethical adviser Path, says: \u201cMany more people are starting to think about green pensions.\u201d Funds he likes include Pictet Water, BlueBay impact-aligned bond fund and Columbia Threadneedle global social bond fund.</p> <h2>Final salary</h2> <p>This type of pension, also known as a defined benefit scheme, gives you a guaranteed income for life, typically based on your income in the last few years of your career. If you are lucky enough to be in one of these schemes, you should probably stay where you are. \u201cFor most people, the certainty of a secure lifetime income from a defined benefit scheme is the best form of retirement provision,\u201d says Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who is now a partner at the&nbsp;consultancy LCP. But, he says, there may be some cases where a transfer is attractive. \u201cThis could include cases where there is already enough secure income from other sources [including a spouse or partner], or where the potential for someone to inherit any unspent pension balance on death would be important.\u201d</p> <h2>Guaranteed income</h2> <p>If you are not in a final salary scheme, you could use your fund to buy a product called an annuity. This gives a guaranteed payment, usually monthly, for the rest of your life, or a fixed term. How much it pays depends on several factors including how much money you have to spend on it, your age when you buy it and your state of health \u2013 the longer the company expects to pay an income for, the lower the monthly payment it will offer. For a non-smoking 65-year-old, a \u00a3100,000 pension will currently buy an annuity that pays up to&nbsp;\u00a37,550 a year.</p> <h2>Higher-rate taxpayers</h2> <p>People who pay tax at 40% or 45% get extra tax relief on their pensions \u2013 but may have to claim it through self-assessment. If&nbsp;you are paying into your pension before you are taxed, you will be getting the benefit without having to do anything. Otherwise you\u2019ll need to do some paperwork as your scheme may only be claiming 20% on your behalf. The relief will be limited to how much of your income you pay the higher rate on. So if \u00a314,000 of your salary is taxed at that level, you will only get the extra relief on up to \u00a314,000 worth of contributions a year. When you are doing your self-assessment form, you put down the gross figure \u2013 so if you pay in \u00a38,000, you gross this up for basic-rate tax and report a \u00a310,000 figure on your tax return.</p> <h2>Inheritance tax</h2> <p>It was announced in the budget that unspent money left in a defined contribution pension when you die will be included in inheritance tax (IHT) calculations from April 2027. If you planned to leave money this way you may want to talk to a financial adviser and/or review your will.</p> <h2>Junior pensions </h2> <p>You could consider setting up a retirement fund for your children. Starting early means the pot has decades to grow in value and can take advantage of compounding, where you earn returns on your returns. Pensions have the added benefit of not being accessible until retirement, whereas with a Junior Isa, the child can withdraw the cash at 18. \u201cYou can open a self-invested personal pension (Sipp) for anyone under 18. You can pay a maximum of \u00a32,880 a year into this, which becomes \u00a33,600 through 20% tax relief,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/pensions-retirement/starting-a-pension/junior-pensions\">says the financial adviser website Unbiased</a>.</p>    <h2>Know what you\u2019re going to get</h2> <p>Forewarned is forearmed. Go to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-state-pension\">gov.uk/check-state-pension</a> to find out how much state pension you could get, when you can take it and how to increase it (if you can). Those in a workplace scheme or with a personal pension should get an annual statement telling them what they are in line to receive. If you haven\u2019t had a statement for a while or can\u2019t find the latest, ask for one.</p> <h2>Lifetime Isa</h2> <p>This government scheme lets people save for a first home costing up to \u00a3450,000, or for their retirement. People can pay in up to \u00a34,000 each year until they are aged 50, and the government will add a 25% bonus to their savings, up to a maximum of \u00a31,000 a year. If you don\u2019t use it to buy your first home you can access the money at age 60.</p> <h2>Married couples and those in civil partnerships</h2> <p>Both will still be able to inherit pensions without paying IHT. If one partner dies, the other may also qualify for a larger state pension each week. When it comes to your other pensions, often final salary schemes have restrictions so that only a spouse, civil partner or child aged under 23 can receive regular payments after you die. Defined contribution schemes tend to be more flexible and let you nominate whoever you want as the beneficiary. If you are under 75, they will be able to take out the money tax-free (except possibly inheritance tax \u2013 see above). All <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-pension-death-benefits\">regular pension payments are subject to income tax</a>, as are lump sums if the deceased was 75 or over.</p> <h2>New state pension</h2> <p>It\u2019s not actually that new, as it came into effect on 6 April 2016 and is paid to anyone who retired from then on, but it is referred to as such to distinguish it from the pension paid to people who retired before that date. The full value is now \u00a3221.20 a week, usually paid to you every four weeks, but you could get more or less, depending on your number of national insurance qualifying years (see below) and whether you paid into the additional state pension that was part of the old system. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/may/18/uk-state-pensions-are-older-retirees-getting-a-bad-deal\">more on the new and basic state pensions here</a>.</p> <h2>Old pensions</h2> <p>It is estimated there are about \u00a320bn of lost and forgotten pension pots waiting to be reunited with their owners. This is often money that people paid into a former employer\u2019s pension scheme and then forgot about or lost track of. If you are struggling to track down an old pension, give the government\u2019s online <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-pension-contact-details\">Pension Tracing Service</a> a go. You can use this to find contact details to search for a lost pension (it won\u2019t tell you whether you have a pension or what its value is). You can also call the service on 0800 731 0175. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.gretel.co.uk/\">Gretel</a> is a free service you can use to trace lost pensions, accounts and&nbsp;investments.</p> <h2>Personal pension</h2> <p>This is a scheme you organise yourself or pay into directly. It is a defined contribution scheme, and you decide how much you want to pay in each month. You don\u2019t need lots of cash: the insurer Standard Life will let you open a personal pension with as little as \u00a31. Many people pay in monthly, and some firms let you pay in as little as \u00a310 or \u00a325 a month, but to build up a decent retirement fund, many experts suggest you put away <a href=\"https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/pensions-retirement/managing-a-pension/paying-into-your-pension\">12.5% of your monthly pay</a>. You won\u2019t get money from your employer but will get tax relief. Your money will go into funds (see Underlying investments). Typically run by insurance firms, though you may be offered one via your bank or another provider, these schemes tend to work for the self-employed and people who move jobs a lot.</p> <h2>Qualifying years</h2> <p>Your state pension will be based on your record of making national insurance contributions. To be entitled to any new state pension, you will need to have 10 qualifying years on your record. These can be contributions you made when working \u2013 if you are an employee, they will have been taken out of your pay before you got your money, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-credits/eligibility\">credits you received</a> while you were a parent, carer or looking for a job, or voluntary payments to make up for missing years. Your state pension forecast will tell you how much you have built up.</p>    <h2>Retirement age </h2> <p>The state pension age is now 66 for men and women and is due to rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. For other pensions there is a minimum age at which you can access your cash \u2013 it\u2019s currently 55 in most cases but will rise to 57 in April 2028. That will affect people born after 6 April 1973. If you are terminally ill you may be able to get your money earlier. You don\u2019t have to have stopped working to access your pension. You no longer have to start drawing your pension by the time you are 75, but once you get to that age, there is no advantage to paying more in as you won\u2019t get tax relief on your contributions.</p> <h2>Self-invested personal pension<strong> </strong></h2> <p>Sipp is a personal pension but with more options about where your money goes once it is in your pension account. You can invest in shares, funds and commercial property, among other things \u2013 and it\u2019s your job to decide how much to put where and when to move it. They are offered by lots of providers, including investment companies. Shop around, because there are fees and they vary, and different providers offer different investment choices.</p> <h2>Tax-free lump sum</h2> <p>When you reach the minimum age, most pension schemes let you withdraw a lump sum worth up to 25% of your savings that you will not have to pay income tax on. That applies across all pensions you have, but it is capped overall at \u00a3268,275 \u2013 for which you would need a pension or pensions worth \u00a31.073m. You don\u2019t necessarily have to take it all at once (or at all) \u2013 you can withdraw it in chunks.</p> <h2>Underlying investments</h2> <p>Almost all pension schemes&nbsp;need to invest their money to make it grow (there are some \u201cunfunded\u201d schemes that operate differently, including the teachers\u2019 pension scheme). With a final salary scheme, you don\u2019t really need to worry about this (unless you have ethical concerns), but with a defined contribution scheme, you should take an interest, as the value of your pot will go up or down depending on how the investments perform. \u201cWhile checking fund performance daily would be excessive, it does make sense to check periodically that your money is invested in a way that is right for your stage of life and attitude to risk,\u201d Webb says.</p>    <h2>Voluntary contributions</h2> <p>You can top up your workplace pension with additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). Some employers will boost these up to a set limit \u2013 perhaps adding 50p for every \u00a31 you pay in. AVCs benefit from tax relief, so for a higher-rate taxpayer, that \u00a31 will only cost 60p. If you are 50-plus and can afford it, this is a no-brainer. Free-standing additional voluntary contributions (FSAVCs) are similar and also designed to sit alongside your workplace pension, but you set this up yourself via a pension provider, and the FSAVCs are collected from you directly and invested.</p> <h2>Withdrawals</h2> <p>You can\u2019t usually take any money from your pension before you are 55 (there are some rare cases when you can). If you have a defined contribution pension (see above), you can usually start taking an income or lump sums, or both, from 55 onwards. Lots of people finance their retirement via pension drawdown. With this, your pension pot (what\u2019s left after the tax-free lump sum has been taken) remains invested, so it will hopefully grow in value, and you take a regular income, or amounts as and when you need them.</p> <h2>Exes</h2> <p>Your pension savings will be taken into account if you divorce, and could form part of the financial settlement. If a judge decides it should be divided between you and your former partner, there are two ways this can happen: pension sharing or earmarking. The first sees some or all of the pension transferred into the other person\u2019s name, and they get complete control over it. The second sees a portion of the pension designated to the other person, but they have no control over how it is invested or when it is paid \u2013 that remains with the original pension holder. Another alternative is offsetting, where the pension is left untouched, but something equal to some of its value is given to the other person.</p> <h2>Young workers</h2> <p>Auto-enrolment into pensions starts at 22, but if you are younger than that and earn \u00a36,240 or more a year (in the current tax year), you have the right to opt into your employer\u2019s scheme. If you do, you will be entitled to the minimum level of employer contributions. If you earn less than \u00a36,240 a year, you can ask your employer to give you access to a pension, and it has to do this, but it doesn\u2019t have to pay any money in. If your employer lets you join its scheme and will contribute, too, you really should consider joining.</p> <h2>Zero-point 75</h2> <p>You are likely to have to pay some charges for a pension plan to cover the cost of managing it and investing your contributions, but many people will be paying an amount with a \u201c0\u201d at the beginning. \u201cIf you are in a workplace pension and haven\u2019t made any special fund choices, you will be paying a maximum of 0.75% in charges [known as the \u201ccharge cap\u201d], and often a lot less than this,\u201d Webb says. For an older pension plan, it is&nbsp;worth reviewing the charges, says the government-backed MoneyHelper website. Those who opt for a Sipp (see above) can get the all-in fees down to a very low figure. The investment company Vanguard offers one of the cheapest deals: if you manage your investments yourself, the total fee is from 0.21% a year, depending on the funds you choose (that includes an account fee of 0.15% of your investments a year).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Auto-enrolment Since 2012, employers have had to enrol eligible workers in a pension scheme. You can opt out if you want, but the idea is that you are less likely to leave a pension than start one. Once in the scheme, your employer must make payments worth at least 3% of your salary. You must put in the equivalent of at least 5% of your pre-tax salary. But many experts say that isn\u2019t enough. Phoenix Insights, a thinktank, says the current 8% total minimum contribution \u201cis too low for most savers to achieve an adequate retirement income, and may be giving some a false sense of security\u201d. So consider increasingupping your payments if you can. Basic-rate taxpayer Contributions into a workplace scheme are usually paid before you are taxed. For a basic-rate taxpayer, this means a contribution of 5% of your salary into your scheme will reduce your take-home pay by 4% \u2013 so it will cost you \u00a340 to pay in \u00a350. For other workplace schemes and personal pension schemes, the provider will typically claim back the basic-rate tax (20%) for you and pay it into your fund. Carry forward There is a maximum sum you can pay into your pensions in each tax year before you have to pay tax. Currently it\u2019s \u00a360,000 for most workers (those earning more than \u00a3200,000 may have a reduced figure). But, as an extra perk, you can use any annual allowance you have left over relating to any of the last three tax years, as long as you earn at least the same amount you want to pay in. That could be useful for people nearing retirement who want to top up their pension, and those who have had a pay rise/promotion, says the Association of Taxation Technicians. As an example, if you paid in \u00a320,000 this year, you could use the remaining \u00a340,000 allowance for 2024-25 in one of the next three tax years. Defined contribution With this type of pension, you know how much is going in each month but you don\u2019t know how much you will get at the end. This is because the money that goes in is invested (see Underlying investments). How much it grows will depend on how well the investments perform. Most private sector workers in the UK are now offered this type of scheme. Ethical questions An estimated \u00a388bn of the \u00a33tn in UK pensions funds is invested in fossil fuel firms, and there could be other holdings you disagree with. But there are things you can do. Your workplace pension scheme\u2019s default fund may not be very green, but many offer an ethical or sustainable option, so do ask about that. David Macdonald, the founder of the ethical adviser Path, says: \u201cMany more people are starting to think about green pensions.\u201d Funds he likes include Pictet Water, BlueBay impact-aligned bond fund and Columbia Threadneedle global social bond fund. Final salary This type of pension, also known as a defined benefit scheme, gives you a guaranteed income for life, typically based on your income in the last few years of your career. If you are lucky enough to be in one of these schemes, you should probably stay where you are. \u201cFor most people, the certainty of a secure lifetime income from a defined benefit scheme is the best form of retirement provision,\u201d says Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who is now a partner at the consultancy LCP. But, he says, there may be some cases where a transfer is attractive. \u201cThis could include cases where there is already enough secure income from other sources [including a spouse or partner], or where the potential for someone to inherit any unspent pension balance on death would be important.\u201d Guaranteed income If you are not in a final salary scheme, you could use your fund to buy a product called an annuity. This gives a guaranteed payment, usually monthly, for the rest of your life, or a fixed term. How much it pays depends on several factors including how much money you have to spend on it, your age when you buy it and your state of health \u2013 the longer the company expects to pay an income for, the lower the monthly payment it will offer. For a non-smoking 65-year-old, a \u00a3100,000 pension will currently buy an annuity that pays up to \u00a37,550 a year. Higher-rate taxpayers People who pay tax at 40% or 45% get extra tax relief on their pensions \u2013 but may have to claim it through self-assessment. If you are paying into your pension before you are taxed, you will be getting the benefit without having to do anything. Otherwise you\u2019ll need to do some paperwork as your scheme may only be claiming 20% on your behalf. The relief will be limited to how much of your income you pay the higher rate on. So if \u00a314,000 of your salary is taxed at that level, you will only get the extra relief on up to \u00a314,000 worth of contributions a year. When you are doing your self-assessment form, you put down the gross figure \u2013 so if you pay in \u00a38,000, you gross this up for basic-rate tax and report a \u00a310,000 figure on your tax return. Inheritance tax It was announced in the budget that unspent money left in a defined contribution pension when you die will be included in inheritance tax (IHT) calculations from April 2027. If you planned to leave money this way you may want to talk to a financial adviser and/or review your will. Junior pensions You could consider setting up a retirement fund for your children. Starting early means the pot has decades to grow in value and can take advantage of compounding, where you earn returns on your returns. Pensions have the added benefit of not being accessible until retirement, whereas with a Junior Isa, the child can withdraw the cash at 18. \u201cYou can open a self-invested personal pension (Sipp) for anyone under 18. You can pay a maximum of \u00a32,880 a year into this, which becomes \u00a33,600 through 20% tax relief,\u201d says the financial adviser website Unbiased. Know what you\u2019re going to get Forewarned is forearmed. Go to gov.uk/check-state-pension to find out how much state pension you could get, when you can take it and how to increase it (if you can). Those in a workplace scheme or with a personal pension should get an annual statement telling them what they are in line to receive. If you haven\u2019t had a statement for a while or can\u2019t find the latest, ask for one. Lifetime Isa This government scheme lets people save for a first home costing up to \u00a3450,000, or for their retirement. People can pay in up to \u00a34,000 each year until they are aged 50, and the government will add a 25% bonus to their savings, up to a maximum of \u00a31,000 a year. If you don\u2019t use it to buy your first home you can access the money at age 60. Married couples and those in civil partnerships Both will still be able to inherit pensions without paying IHT. If one partner dies, the other may also qualify for a larger state pension each week. When it comes to your other pensions, often final salary schemes have restrictions so that only a spouse, civil partner or child aged under 23 can receive regular payments after you die. Defined contribution schemes tend to be more flexible and let you nominate whoever you want as the beneficiary. If you are under 75, they will be able to take out the money tax-free (except possibly inheritance tax \u2013 see above). All regular pension payments are subject to income tax, as are lump sums if the deceased was 75 or over. New state pension It\u2019s not actually that new, as it came into effect on 6 April 2016 and is paid to anyone who retired from then on, but it is referred to as such to distinguish it from the pension paid to people who retired before that date. The full value is now \u00a3221.20 a week, usually paid to you every four weeks, but you could get more or less, depending on your number of national insurance qualifying years (see below) and whether you paid into the additional state pension that was part of the old system. There\u2019s more on the new and basic state pensions here. Old pensions It is estimated there are about \u00a320bn of lost and forgotten pension pots waiting to be reunited with their owners. This is often money that people paid into a former employer\u2019s pension scheme and then forgot about or lost track of. If you are struggling to track down an old pension, give the government\u2019s online Pension Tracing Service a go. You can use this to find contact details to search for a lost pension (it won\u2019t tell you whether you have a pension or what its value is). You can also call the service on 0800 731 0175. Meanwhile, Gretel is a free service you can use to trace lost pensions, accounts and investments. Personal pension This is a scheme you organise yourself or pay into directly. It is a defined contribution scheme, and you decide how much you want to pay in each month. You don\u2019t need lots of cash: the insurer Standard Life will let you open a personal pension with as little as \u00a31. Many people pay in monthly, and some firms let you pay in as little as \u00a310 or \u00a325 a month, but to build up a decent retirement fund, many experts suggest you put away 12.5% of your monthly pay. You won\u2019t get money from your employer but will get tax relief. Your money will go into funds (see Underlying investments). Typically run by insurance firms, though you may be offered one via your bank or another provider, these schemes tend to work for the self-employed and people who move jobs a lot. Qualifying years Your state pension will be based on your record of making national insurance contributions. To be entitled to any new state pension, you will need to have 10 qualifying years on your record. These can be contributions you made when working \u2013 if you are an employee, they will have been taken out of your pay before you got your money, credits you received while you were a parent, carer or looking for a job, or voluntary payments to make up for missing years. Your state pension forecast will tell you how much you have built up. Retirement age The state pension age is now 66 for men and women and is due to rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. For other pensions there is a minimum age at which you can access your cash \u2013 it\u2019s currently 55 in most cases but will rise to 57 in April 2028. That will affect people born after 6 April 1973. If you are terminally ill you may be able to get your money earlier. You don\u2019t have to have stopped working to access your pension. You no longer have to start drawing your pension by the time you are 75, but once you get to that age, there is no advantage to paying more in as you won\u2019t get tax relief on your contributions. Self-invested personal pension Sipp is a personal pension but with more options about where your money goes once it is in your pension account. You can invest in shares, funds and commercial property, among other things \u2013 and it\u2019s your job to decide how much to put where and when to move it. They are offered by lots of providers, including investment companies. Shop around, because there are fees and they vary, and different providers offer different investment choices. Tax-free lump sum When you reach the minimum age, most pension schemes let you withdraw a lump sum worth up to 25% of your savings that you will not have to pay income tax on. That applies across all pensions you have, but it is capped overall at \u00a3268,275 \u2013 for which you would need a pension or pensions worth \u00a31.073m. You don\u2019t necessarily have to take it all at once (or at all) \u2013 you can withdraw it in chunks. Underlying investments Almost all pension schemes need to invest their money to make it grow (there are some \u201cunfunded\u201d schemes that operate differently, including the teachers\u2019 pension scheme). With a final salary scheme, you don\u2019t really need to worry about this (unless you have ethical concerns), but with a defined contribution scheme, you should take an interest, as the value of your pot will go up or down depending on how the investments perform. \u201cWhile checking fund performance daily would be excessive, it does make sense to check periodically that your money is invested in a way that is right for your stage of life and attitude to risk,\u201d Webb says. Voluntary contributions You can top up your workplace pension with additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). Some employers will boost these up to a set limit \u2013 perhaps adding 50p for every \u00a31 you pay in. AVCs benefit from tax relief, so for a higher-rate taxpayer, that \u00a31 will only cost 60p. If you are 50-plus and can afford it, this is a no-brainer. Free-standing additional voluntary contributions (FSAVCs) are similar and also designed to sit alongside your workplace pension, but you set this up yourself via a pension provider, and the FSAVCs are collected from you directly and invested. Withdrawals You can\u2019t usually take any money from your pension before you are 55 (there are some rare cases when you can). If you have a defined contribution pension (see above), you can usually start taking an income or lump sums, or both, from 55 onwards. Lots of people finance their retirement via pension drawdown. With this, your pension pot (what\u2019s left after the tax-free lump sum has been taken) remains invested, so it will hopefully grow in value, and you take a regular income, or amounts as and when you need them. Exes Your pension savings will be taken into account if you divorce, and could form part of the financial settlement. If a judge decides it should be divided between you and your former partner, there are two ways this can happen: pension sharing or earmarking. The first sees some or all of the pension transferred into the other person\u2019s name, and they get complete control over it. The second sees a portion of the pension designated to the other person, but they have no control over how it is invested or when it is paid \u2013 that remains with the original pension holder. Another alternative is offsetting, where the pension is left untouched, but something equal to some of its value is given to the other person. Young workers Auto-enrolment into pensions starts at 22, but if you are younger than that and earn \u00a36,240 or more a year (in the current tax year), you have the right to opt into your employer\u2019s scheme. If you do, you will be entitled to the minimum level of employer contributions. If you earn less than \u00a36,240 a year, you can ask your employer to give you access to a pension, and it has to do this, but it doesn\u2019t have to pay any money in.

Zero-point 75 You are likely to have to pay some charges for a pension plan to cover the cost of managing it and investing your contributions, but many people will be paying an amount with a \u201c0\u201d at the beginning. \u201cIf you are in a workplace pension and haven\u2019t made any special fund choices, you will be paying a maximum of 0.75% in charges [known as the \u201ccharge cap\u201d], and often a lot less than this,\u201d Webb says.

      "body": "<p>Not for the first time in rugby union\u2019s turbulent professional history there is a lot happening. A mooted breakaway global league is the latest curveball threatening to destabilise the sport with even the newly elected chair of World Cup suggesting rugby\u2019s financial sustainability is \u201cat crisis point\u201d. No one, from the top down, can be entirely sure how the medium-term future will pan out.</p> <p>Much the same, frankly, can be said about England as they prepare to face the double world champions South Africa. A morale-lifting win, by whatever means, would transform an uncertain current narrative and cast their recent string of near misses in a relatively more flattering light. A proper pummelling by a strong Springbok side, on the other hand, could result in them dropping to the equal lowest world ranking in red rose history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/15/rugby-union-steve-borthwick-england-kick-chase-escort-laws\">Rugby\u2019s \u2018escort\u2019 crackdown prompts disgruntled Borthwick to change tack | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For that to happen South Africa will need to win by more than 15 points and Australia would need to defeat Wales by a similar margin, an improbable but not impossible double based on those respective sides\u2019 most recent form. Eighth position \u2013 down one from their present spot of seventh \u2013 would equal the darkest days of 2015 when England had just bombed out of their home World Cup in the pool stages.</p> <p>Are Steve Borthwick\u2019s side really that down on their luck? Most of us who watched them at close quarters in the summer felt otherwise: they looked purposeful, defended with energy and should have won at least one of their two Tests against the All Blacks in Dunedin and Auckland. This month, though, they have played mostly in fits and starts and the Wallabies, in particular, found an alarming number of defensive holes.</p> <p>And this could well be the contest that, for better or worse, ends up defining the character of Borthwick\u2019s England. The Springbok scrum do not mess around and an increasing aura and confidence is discernible across the team. They also reign supreme in precisely the kind of tight games that England have been struggling to close out.</p> <p>At least the hosts and their experienced captain, Jamie George, know what is coming and exactly how deep they will have to dig for victory. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a brain surgeon to work out they like to scrum for penalties then kick and maul,\u201d confirmed George. \u201cAs a forward pack we know the scrum is coming, we know the maul is coming. [But] the message this week is that we\u2019re at home and we want to make sure we put a mark down. We were disappointed about what we put out there last Saturday. In terms of a reaction there\u2019s no better team to do it against.\u201d</p>    <p>George, who learned his trade at Saracens under the South African World Cup-winning captain John Smit, has also been accentuating the positives of England\u2019s defeats by the All Blacks and the Wallabies, both decided in the closing moments. The margins can be slim and England also have a very decent record when they perceive their manhood is being questioned.</p> <p>But compare the two team sheets and, on paper, South Africa appear to have a slight edge in most areas, either in terms of brute physicality or collective organisation. There is also more tactical flexibility about them. Manie Libbok may not be the world\u2019s greatest goalkicker but that may not matter if his touch and vision gives the brilliant Cheslin Kolbe and Kurt-Lee Arendse space out wide.</p> <p>This is a big game, then, not just for England\u2019s scrum but for their defensive organisers and potential game breakers. Last week Marcus Smith gave perhaps his most influential display at 10 for his country and will be a handful again if he has enough quick ball and sufficient people on his wavelength. If so, his little dinks over the top, identification of mismatches and acceleration will keep the visitors fully occupied.</p> <p>To resurrect their autumn, however, Borthwick\u2019s team will also have to do the straightforward meat and potatoes part of the job. They have only once conceded more points at home than they did last Saturday and the unwanted record of 53 was also set against Borthwick\u2019s England by France last year.</p> <p>Restarts were also part of their undoing against Australia, for whom the soaring Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii caused all sorts of strife. More dynamism from England\u2019s bench is also required, along with more consistent line speed. If any one department falls short, the Boks will expose it.</p> <p>It can be done, as England showed on that damp night in Paris when they almost unseated South Africa in last year\u2019s World Cup semi-final. That memory has rekindled their motivation this week and, as their erstwhile captain Courtney Lawes confirmed in his Times column, there is now a genuine bristling edge whenever these two sides meet.</p> <p>There is no doubt, either, that this is South Africa\u2019s keynote game of the month. The Boks\u2019 spiritual leader Rassie Erasmus is still driven to remind the rugby world where the balance of earthly power currently resides.</p> <p>He has been making the point, even so, that his side suffered narrow losses to Ireland and France in 2022 prior to regaining their world title within 12 months. Interestingly, too, Borthwick\u2019s record as England\u2019s head coach in his first 26 Tests \u2013 W13 L13 \u2013 is remarkably similar to that of Sir Clive Woodward \u2013 W13 D2 L11 \u2013 over the same span. Woodward\u2019s side subsequently went on to win 43 of their next 49 Tests, culminating in their 2003 World Cup triumph.</p> <p>The difference is that Woodward\u2019s England had a once-in-a-generation side coming together, not least a pack equipped to lay down the law when required.

      "bodyText": "Not for the first time in rugby union\u2019s turbulent professional history there is a lot happening. A mooted breakaway global league is the latest curveball threatening to destabilise the sport with even the newly elected chair of World Cup suggesting rugby\u2019s financial sustainability is \u201cat crisis point\u201d. No one, from the top down, can be entirely sure how the medium-term future will pan out. Much the same, frankly, can be said about England as they prepare to face the double world champions South Africa. A morale-lifting win, by whatever means, would transform an uncertain current narrative and cast their recent string of near misses in a relatively more flattering light. A proper pummelling by a strong Springbok side, on the other hand, could result in them dropping to the equal lowest world ranking in red rose history. For that to happen South Africa will need to win by more than 15 points and Australia would need to defeat Wales by a similar margin, an improbable but not impossible double based on those respective sides\u2019 most recent form. Eighth position \u2013 down one from their present spot of seventh \u2013 would equal the darkest days of 2015 when England had just bombed out of their home World Cup in the pool stages. Are Steve Borthwick\u2019s side really that down on their luck? Most of us who watched them at close quarters in the summer felt otherwise: they looked purposeful, defended with energy and should have won at least one of their two Tests against the All Blacks in Dunedin and Auckland. This month, though, they have played mostly in fits and starts and the Wallabies, in particular, found an alarming number of defensive holes. And this could well be the contest that, for better or worse, ends up defining the character of Borthwick\u2019s England. The Springbok scrum do not mess around and an increasing aura and confidence is discernible across the team. They also reign supreme in precisely the kind of tight games that England have been struggling to close out. At least the hosts and their experienced captain, Jamie George, know what is coming and exactly how deep they will have to dig for victory. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a brain surgeon to work out they like to scrum for penalties then kick and maul,\u201d confirmed George. \u201cAs a forward pack we know the scrum is coming, we know the maul is coming. [But] the message this week is that we\u2019re at home and we want to make sure we put a mark down. We were disappointed about what we put out there last Saturday. In terms of a reaction there\u2019s no better team to do it against.\u201d George, who learned his trade at Saracens under the South African World Cup-winning captain John Smit, has also been accentuating the positives of England\u2019s defeats by the All Blacks and the Wallabies, both decided in the closing moments. The margins can be slim and England also have a very decent record when they perceive their manhood is being questioned. But compare the two team sheets and, on paper, South Africa appear to have a slight edge in most areas, either in terms of brute physicality or collective organisation. There is also more tactical flexibility about them. Manie Libbok may not be the world\u2019s greatest goalkicker but that may not matter if his touch and vision gives the brilliant Cheslin Kolbe and Kurt-Lee Arendse space out wide. This is a big game, then, not just for England\u2019s scrum but for their defensive organisers and potential game breakers. Last week Marcus Smith gave perhaps his most influential display at 10 for his country and will be a handful again if he has enough quick ball and sufficient people on his wavelength. If so, his little dinks over the top, identification of mismatches and acceleration will keep the visitors fully occupied. To resurrect their autumn, however, Borthwick\u2019s team will also have to do the straightforward meat and potatoes part of the job. They have only once conceded more points at home than they did last Saturday and the unwanted record of 53 was also set against Borthwick\u2019s England by France last year. Restarts were also part of their undoing against Australia, for whom the soaring Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii caused all sorts of strife. More dynamism from England\u2019s bench is also required, along with more consistent line speed. If any one department falls short, the Boks will expose it. It can be done, as England showed on that damp night in Paris when they almost unseated South Africa in last year\u2019s World Cup semi-final. That memory has rekindled their motivation this week and, as their erstwhile captain Courtney Lawes confirmed in his Times column, there is now a genuine bristling edge whenever these two sides meet. There is no doubt, either, that this is South Africa\u2019s keynote game of the month. The Boks\u2019 spiritual leader Rassie Erasmus is still driven to remind the rugby world where the balance of earthly power currently resides. He has been making the point, even so, that his side suffered narrow losses to Ireland and France in 2022 prior to regaining their world title within 12 months. Interestingly, too, Borthwick\u2019s record as England\u2019s head coach in his first 26 Tests \u2013 W13 L13 \u2013 is remarkably similar to that of Sir Clive Woodward \u2013 W13 D2 L11 \u2013 over the same span. Woodward\u2019s side subsequently went on to win 43 of their next 49 Tests, culminating in their 2003 World Cup triumph. The difference is that Woodward\u2019s England had a once-in-a-generation side coming together, not least a pack equipped to lay down the law when required. England have some decent young forwards on the horizon \u2013 some of whom could break cover in their A team fixture against Australia A at the Stoop on Sunday \u2013 but it is going to take a while before they are ready for senior service. It is just another reason why this weekend is highly significant. England\u2019s supporters will not be keen to pay top dollar indefinitely to watch a losing team and the entire English game is craving a pre-Christmas feelgood boost. As Ellis Genge recently warned in the Guardian \u201csomething has got to give\u201d in terms of the precarious economics of the domestic club game and the Rugby Football Union could do without another national team meltdown. Even if England again finish second \u2013 as seems probable \u2013 they need to give their fans fresh reason to keep the faith.",

      "body": "<p>Bob Woodward is probably the best-known journalist in the world. He built his reputation on Watergate, of course, and just about&nbsp;everything he and Carl Bernstein wrote about it turned out to be entirely accurate: including the existence of Deep Throat, who was sometimes thought to be a \u201cWoodstein\u201d invention, but was much later revealed to be a top FBI official. If you talk to Woodward on deep background, he won\u2019t break trust with you and leak your name; so hundreds of senior officials and politicians over the years have had the&nbsp;confidence to speak to&nbsp;him on condition of anonymity. In&nbsp;War, as in every other one of Woodward\u2019s 22 books (this one billed as a \u201cbehind-the-scenes story of three wars \u2013 Ukraine, the Middle East and the struggle for the American Presidency\u201d), you can have total faith&nbsp;in the accuracy of every quotation he provides.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a problem. Although the&nbsp;confidences which Woodward passes on to us are no doubt exactly as&nbsp;his interviewees gave them to him,&nbsp;how do we know these were the&nbsp;words originally spoken in the moment being&nbsp;recalled? Reading War,&nbsp;like so many of&nbsp;the other monosyllabically titled books Woodward has given us,&nbsp;you find yourself wondering if some of&nbsp;the&nbsp;key&nbsp;stuff isn\u2019t <em>l\u2019esprit de&nbsp;l\u2019escalier&nbsp;</em>\u2013 the&nbsp;things people <em>wish</em> they\u2019d said; or&nbsp;maybe wish they\u2019d said&nbsp;more clearly&nbsp;and toughly and quotably, instead of mumbling or trailing away&nbsp;into aposiopesis. Personally, I prefer the rigorous methodology of Norma Percy\u2019s brilliant television documentaries (The Death of Yugoslavia, Putin vs the West, Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, etc). She interviews everyone again and again, on the record, then plays each interviewee\u2019s words back to the other participants. They can then answer, \u201cWell, he/she may say that now, but that wasn\u2019t what they said at the time.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I read this book without coming across a single thing that was a genuine surprise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, we can have little doubt that&nbsp;Joe Biden genuinely said things like, \u201cThat fucking Putin \u2026 We are dealing&nbsp;with the epitome of evil,\u201d or \u201cThat son of a bitch Bibi Netanyahu. He\u2019s a bad fucking guy.\u201d It\u2019s entirely credible, as&nbsp;Woodward\u2019s sources say, that Donald Trump had up to seven phone conversations with Vladimir Putin after leaving office, that he sent&nbsp;him boxes of Covid-19 tests, and&nbsp;that Biden thought there was a&nbsp;50% chance that Putin would use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Yet these&nbsp;things don\u2019t exactly come as a&nbsp;huge shock.</p> <p>And that\u2019s my main beef with War:&nbsp;it simply reinforces everything we already know about Ukraine, Gaza,&nbsp;and the presidential campaign. I&nbsp;read this book, which like all Woodward\u2019s work is well-written, even a page-turner, without coming&nbsp;across a single thing that was&nbsp;a&nbsp;genuine surprise. We&nbsp;don\u2019t need&nbsp;Woodward to tell us that the CIA&nbsp;and&nbsp;MI6 had complete knowledge of&nbsp;Putin\u2019s plans for the invasion of&nbsp;Ukraine, because the two intelligence&nbsp;agencies made it absolutely plain at the time. They told&nbsp;us the day and even the hour when the invasion would start.</p> <p>Pungent quotes do a lot of heavy lifting (\u201cBarack never took Putin seriously,\u201d Biden says about Russia\u2019s&nbsp;theft of Crimea in 2014. \u201cWe&nbsp;gave Putin a licence to continue. Well, I\u2019m revoking his fucking licence!\u201d), yet the language distracts our attention from the issues that provoke it. We may still get the occasional flash of juvenile pleasure at&nbsp;hearing the great ones of the world&nbsp;calling one another \u201cpricks\u201d and \u201cmorons\u201d, but it really doesn\u2019t mean much. The Watergate days, when we&nbsp;were genuinely shocked to learn that&nbsp;Nixon F-bombed his way round the White House, are long gone.</p> <p>Still, the fundamental verdict of&nbsp;War is a powerful one. Trump is \u201cthe&nbsp;wrong man for the country\u201d and&nbsp;is unfit to lead it, Woodward says,&nbsp;magisterially. (In return, Trump&nbsp;calls&nbsp;Woodward a liar, and his spokesman has implausibly denied that most of the quotes in the book were genuine.) Yet here again there\u2019s&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem. Woodward is no longer the&nbsp;impartial recipient of the confidences of hundreds of well-placed people across the spectrum; he&nbsp;has got his own&nbsp;strong views, and&nbsp;he wants to convince us they\u2019re correct. The fly on&nbsp;the Oval Office wall has fluttered down and joined in the argument. Where does Woodward\u2019s long, masterful, often mesmerising series&nbsp;of&nbsp;Washington insider books&nbsp;go&nbsp;after this?</p> <p>\u2022 John Simpson is the BBC\u2019s world affairs editor.

      "bodyText": "Bob Woodward is probably the best-known journalist in the world. He built his reputation on Watergate, of course, and just about everything he and Carl Bernstein wrote about it turned out to be entirely accurate: including the existence of Deep Throat, who was sometimes thought to be a \u201cWoodstein\u201d invention, but was much later revealed to be a top FBI official. If you talk to Woodward on deep background, he won\u2019t break trust with you and leak your name; so hundreds of senior officials and politicians over the years have had the confidence to speak to him on condition of anonymity. In War, as in every other one of Woodward\u2019s 22 books (this one billed as a \u201cbehind-the-scenes story of three wars \u2013 Ukraine, the Middle East and the struggle for the American Presidency\u201d), you can have total faith in the accuracy of every quotation he provides. But there\u2019s a problem. Although the confidences which Woodward passes on to us are no doubt exactly as his interviewees gave them to him, how do we know these were the words originally spoken in the moment being recalled? Reading War, like so many of the other monosyllabically titled books Woodward has given us, you find yourself wondering if some of the key stuff isn\u2019t l\u2019esprit de l\u2019escalier \u2013 the things people wish they\u2019d said; or maybe wish they\u2019d said more clearly and toughly and quotably, instead of mumbling or trailing away into aposiopesis. Personally, I prefer the rigorous methodology of Norma Percy\u2019s brilliant television documentaries (The Death of Yugoslavia, Putin vs the West, Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, etc). She interviews everyone again and again, on the record, then plays each interviewee\u2019s words back to the other participants. They can then answer, \u201cWell, he/she may say that now, but that wasn\u2019t what they said at the time.\u201d Still, we can have little doubt that Joe Biden genuinely said things like, \u201cThat fucking Putin \u2026 We are dealing with the epitome of evil,\u201d or \u201cThat son of a bitch Bibi Netanyahu. He\u2019s a bad fucking guy.\u201d It\u2019s entirely credible, as Woodward\u2019s sources say, that Donald Trump had up to seven phone conversations with Vladimir Putin after leaving office, that he sent him boxes of Covid-19 tests, and that Biden thought there was a 50% chance that Putin would use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Yet these things don\u2019t exactly come as a huge shock. And that\u2019s my main beef with War: it simply reinforces everything we already know about Ukraine, Gaza, and the presidential campaign. I read this book, which like all Woodward\u2019s work is well-written, even a page-turner, without coming across a single thing that was a genuine surprise. We don\u2019t need Woodward to tell us that the CIA and MI6 had complete knowledge of Putin\u2019s plans for the invasion of Ukraine, because the two intelligence agencies made it absolutely plain at the time. They told us the day and even the hour when the invasion would start. Pungent quotes do a lot of heavy lifting (\u201cBarack never took Putin seriously,\u201d Biden says about Russia\u2019s theft of Crimea in 2014. \u201cWe gave Putin a licence to continue. Well, I\u2019m revoking his fucking licence!\u201d), yet the language distracts our attention from the issues that provoke it. We may still get the occasional flash of juvenile pleasure at hearing the great ones of the world calling one another \u201cpricks\u201d and \u201cmorons\u201d, but it really doesn\u2019t mean much. The Watergate days, when we were genuinely shocked to learn that Nixon F-bombed his way round the White House, are long gone. Still, the fundamental verdict of War is a powerful one. Trump is \u201cthe wrong man for the country\u201d and is unfit to lead it, Woodward says, magisterially. (In return, Trump calls Woodward a liar, and his spokesman has implausibly denied that most of the quotes in the book were genuine.) Yet here again there\u2019s a problem. Woodward is no longer the impartial recipient of the confidences of hundreds of well-placed people across the spectrum; he has got his own strong views, and he wants to convince us they\u2019re correct. The fly on the Oval Office wall has fluttered down and joined in the argument. Where does Woodward\u2019s long, masterful, often mesmerising series of Washington insider books go after this? \u2022 John Simpson is the BBC\u2019s world affairs editor.

      "body": "<p>The armoured car\u2019s bumpy high-speed journey comes to a halt, and the Guardian team are dropped off in the November darkness, where two Ukrainians soldiers await. Using hard to detect red and green torchlight, they follow an unmarked trail across rough fields, punctuated by the sounds of frontline shelling, until a concealed opening appears. Inside, a specialist drone crew is at work.</p> <p>Nearby, a drone flight of a few minutes away, is the frontline Donetsk town of Toretsk, where the Russian invaders have been gaining territory using surges of infantry and ceaseless artillery. Underground in the surprisingly warm bunker is a team of four Ukrainians, all members of the Khyzhak Brigade of police officers turned soldiers.</p>    <p>To reward its best drone squads, Ukraine\u2019s military introduced a points system in June. To an outsider it appears chilling: points are scored for Russian soldiers recorded killed or wounded and for tanks, guns and other equipment destroyed. In return, new drones are on offer per point scored.</p> <p>Luiza, a brigade spokesperson, says for every Russian soldier wounded, four points are added \u2013 if they are \u201celiminated\u201d it is six. If a Russian 152mm artillery piece is destroyed it is 40 points and half that if the weaponry is simply damaged. \u201cCollected points can be exchanged for drones,\u201d she adds, so an FPV (first person view) drone is available for \u201cone to three points depending on the functionality\u201d. This is considered by the brigade as a boon when so many drones in the Ukrainian army are paid for by soldiers or via fundraising through family and friends.</p> <p>But in the bunker it is not a game \u2013 the deadly threat in the background is one reminder that it is too serious for that. The drone squad\u2019s primary goal would always be to halt the remorseless Russian advance, though in Toretsk, and across the eastern front, the battlefield situation for Ukraine remains fraught.</p>    <p>Rostik, 31, is the unit commander and a police officer who previously worked in the central city of Dnipro. The bunker, he says, is the eighth position since June, each one further back than the one before. The withdrawal amounts to \u201cseven kilometres\u201d, a figure he obtains by picking up a small handheld device with a live war map, on which every building and intersection is marked with a number. He draws a ruler to calculate the territory lost.</p> <p>Tonight, the team in the bunker are launching armed Mavic 3 drones with thermal cameras. They arm the drones with small bombs before one member of the unit heads into the chilly night to release them for takeoff. Other squads are running reconnaissance \u2013 hunting for targets \u2013 their video feeds shared while periodically the mobiles used for group communication chatter into life.</p> <p>In the bunker, the thermal imaging is revealing. Heat sources can be detected hundreds of metres away. In the early evening, 7pm to 8pm, the drone is sent up repeatedly. It flies at about 60km/h (37mph) \u2013 meaning no person can outrun it \u2013 though for now the goal is to drop a bomb through a hole in a building where Russian soldiers are believed to be hiding. As the drones fly into Toretsk, outlines of buildings appear and stray dogs can be seen running out, as pointed out by one of the team members.</p>    <p>Iryna, 32, was a police officer in Lviv, until a few months ago; now she is one of a growing number of women volunteering to fight. Her husband was already in the military, and she had become frustrated by living in the largely peaceful western city without contributing, she says. \u201cMy husband was against this, but there was a moment when I realised that what if I joined up and killed at least two Russians? Maybe it means my husband is going to come back earlier?\u201d she adds.</p> <p>To join up, however, Iryna lied \u2013 telling her husband she was responding to a forced summons. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what exactly he said in reply, but I remember that I told him: \u2018Hold on. You could complain about this. We could fight on this. Or you could help me to prepare the gear.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A drone mission lasts about 15 to 20 minutes, before the craft is brought back for a battery change. Soon it becomes possible to identify some landmarks, notably the slag heaps, by which the pilots must fly. We stay the entire night watching, though for the crew a shift lasts three days, minimising the risk of trips in and out.</p>    <p>Soon after 1am, another team has news. They have found a person patrolling or walking alone \u2013 a target. Andrii, a burly man with a love of American football, is at the controls while Iryna sits alongside. Soon he finds a glowing white figure walking along a road or path. Allowing for the wind, he drops a bomb from 140 metres; it bends towards its target, exploding, he says, \u201cthree meters away\u201d. The person falls at the side of the road, apparently collapsed.</p> <p>By now the team of four are crowded around the screen, attentive and mostly silent. Andrii then drops a second bomb \u2013 a standard tactic. The team cheer, though it is impossible not to be shocked. Later, when asking Andrii how he felt when he appeared to kill, he looks surprised at the question and instead expresses satisfaction at completing the task.</p> <p>This is a war fought in battles of ones and twos via drones and screens, as often as with guns and mortars. \u201cObviously it is easier to kill from drones, not with small arms,\u201d Rostik says, \u201cbut we are attacking them because otherwise they will attack our infantry or make our life worse somehow.\u201d In Toretsk, Russian forces press forward most nights, relying heavily on infantry, typically in waves of five, going from building to building \u2013 used, Rostik says, by their commanders as \u201cbiomass\u201d.</p>    <p>The team decide to drop a third bomb, with Iryna at the controls. Then they begin the task of documentation to ensure the incident is verified and their points score updated. Iryna records a clip from the drone feed to be shared to a brigade Telegram group for review.</p> <p>It is not the busiest night. Often the pace slackens, and there is a chance for conversation and food. Volodya, 32, also a police officer from Lviv, heats up chicken, rice and vegetables on a gas stove, washed down with cans of the Ukrainian Non Stop energy drink.

      "bodyText": "The armoured car\u2019s bumpy high-speed journey comes to a halt, and the Guardian team are dropped off in the November darkness, where two Ukrainians soldiers await. Using hard to detect red and green torchlight, they follow an unmarked trail across rough fields, punctuated by the sounds of frontline shelling, until a concealed opening appears. Inside, a specialist drone crew is at work. Nearby, a drone flight of a few minutes away, is the frontline Donetsk town of Toretsk, where the Russian invaders have been gaining territory using surges of infantry and ceaseless artillery. Underground in the surprisingly warm bunker is a team of four Ukrainians, all members of the Khyzhak Brigade of police officers turned soldiers. To reward its best drone squads, Ukraine\u2019s military introduced a points system in June. To an outsider it appears chilling: points are scored for Russian soldiers recorded killed or wounded and for tanks, guns and other equipment destroyed. In return, new drones are on offer per point scored. Luiza, a brigade spokesperson, says for every Russian soldier wounded, four points are added \u2013 if they are \u201celiminated\u201d it is six. If a Russian 152mm artillery piece is destroyed it is 40 points and half that if the weaponry is simply damaged. \u201cCollected points can be exchanged for drones,\u201d she adds, so an FPV (first person view) drone is available for \u201cone to three points depending on the functionality\u201d. This is considered by the brigade as a boon when so many drones in the Ukrainian army are paid for by soldiers or via fundraising through family and friends. But in the bunker it is not a game \u2013 the deadly threat in the background is one reminder that it is too serious for that. The drone squad\u2019s primary goal would always be to halt the remorseless Russian advance, though in Toretsk, and across the eastern front, the battlefield situation for Ukraine remains fraught. Rostik, 31, is the unit commander and a police officer who previously worked in the central city of Dnipro. The bunker, he says, is the eighth position since June, each one further back than the one before. The withdrawal amounts to \u201cseven kilometres\u201d, a figure he obtains by picking up a small handheld device with a live war map, on which every building and intersection is marked with a number. He draws a ruler to calculate the territory lost. Tonight, the team in the bunker are launching armed Mavic 3 drones with thermal cameras. They arm the drones with small bombs before one member of the unit heads into the chilly night to release them for takeoff. Other squads are running reconnaissance \u2013 hunting for targets \u2013 their video feeds shared while periodically the mobiles used for group communication chatter into life. In the bunker, the thermal imaging is revealing. Heat sources can be detected hundreds of metres away. In the early evening, 7pm to 8pm, the drone is sent up repeatedly. It flies at about 60km/h (37mph) \u2013 meaning no person can outrun it \u2013 though for now the goal is to drop a bomb through a hole in a building where Russian soldiers are believed to be hiding. As the drones fly into Toretsk, outlines of buildings appear and stray dogs can be seen running out, as pointed out by one of the team members. Iryna, 32, was a police officer in Lviv, until a few months ago; now she is one of a growing number of women volunteering to fight. Her husband was already in the military, and she had become frustrated by living in the largely peaceful western city without contributing, she says. \u201cMy husband was against this, but there was a moment when I realised that what if I joined up and killed at least two Russians? Maybe it means my husband is going to come back earlier?\u201d she adds. To join up, however, Iryna lied \u2013 telling her husband she was responding to a forced summons. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what exactly he said in reply, but I remember that I told him: \u2018Hold on. You could complain about this. We could fight on this. Or you could help me to prepare the gear.\u2019\u201d A drone mission lasts about 15 to 20 minutes, before the craft is brought back for a battery change. Soon it becomes possible to identify some landmarks, notably the slag heaps, by which the pilots must fly. We stay the entire night watching, though for the crew a shift lasts three days, minimising the risk of trips in and out. Soon after 1am, another team has news. They have found a person patrolling or walking alone \u2013 a target. Andrii, a burly man with a love of American football, is at the controls while Iryna sits alongside. Soon he finds a glowing white figure walking along a road or path. Allowing for the wind, he drops a bomb from 140 metres; it bends towards its target, exploding, he says, \u201cthree meters away\u201d. The person falls at the side of the road, apparently collapsed. By now the team of four are crowded around the screen, attentive and mostly silent. Andrii then drops a second bomb \u2013 a standard tactic. The team cheer, though it is impossible not to be shocked. Later, when asking Andrii how he felt when he appeared to kill, he looks surprised at the question and instead expresses satisfaction at completing the task. This is a war fought in battles of ones and twos via drones and screens, as often as with guns and mortars. \u201cObviously it is easier to kill from drones, not with small arms,\u201d Rostik says, \u201cbut we are attacking them because otherwise they will attack our infantry or make our life worse somehow.\u201d In Toretsk, Russian forces press forward most nights, relying heavily on infantry, typically in waves of five, going from building to building \u2013 used, Rostik says, by their commanders as \u201cbiomass\u201d. The team decide to drop a third bomb, with Iryna at the controls. Then they begin the task of documentation to ensure the incident is verified and their points score updated. Iryna records a clip from the drone feed to be shared to a brigade Telegram group for review. It is not the busiest night. Often the pace slackens, and there is a chance for conversation and food. Volodya, 32, also a police officer from Lviv, heats up chicken, rice and vegetables on a gas stove, washed down with cans of the Ukrainian Non Stop energy drink. Because the base is connected to the internet via Starlink, the one critical piece of US technology in the dugout, calls can be made. Soon after we arrive, Rostik, talks to his wife and two sons. \u201cI speak to them five six times a day,\u201d he says. And so his military call sign is Aliona, his wife\u2019s name. The background shelling is constant, though only once does the earth shake. \u201cOnly a person who is mentally not healthy is not afraid of dying,\u201d says Rostik. Russian armed drones track the \u201croad of death\u201d to Toretsk, though Iryna says the team takes \u201call necessary measures\u201d to protect themselves, including \u201cpraying vigorously\u201d. The real fear comes from Russian one tonne glide bombs \u2013 partly guided air-launched munitions that Ukraine cannot counter. At the unit\u2019s central command, they can observe Su-30 and Su-34s jets as they approach, and track a missile once launched. All they can do is give soldiers around 90 seconds\u2019 warning. The bunker would not survive a direct hit. The US election concluded a week earlier, and it is time to ask what they would say if Donald Trump was present. \u201cI guess if he reached this place, he would understand everything,\u201d Andrii says. So what about potentially losing US support at a time when the war is already difficult? \u201cWe have no other way to go,\u201d Rostik says. \u201cWe are fighting for our country, for our families, for our kids, those we have lost; for those who were killed, who were raped, who were tortured.

Around two-thirds of their neurons are in their arms (not in their heads, like humans)., 2:C - Licking your lips makes them chapped because you\u2019re covering your lips in saliva, which is full of things that are a bit harsh for lip skin, so makes lips dry. Sunburn can also cause this, as can dry or hot weather, cold weather and not drinking enough water., 3:A - The mass of the sun is about 1.989 x 1030 kilograms, which is 1,989 followed by 27 zeros \u2013 the same as about 333,000 Earths, according to Nasa., 4:C - Chipmunks can collect more than 160 acorns a day. In theory they can collect all the acorns they need for a whole winter in just two days \u2013 though they tend to hoard them, and often gather many more than they need., 5:D - The Goliath frog is the largest in the world. It\u2019s an endangered species \u2013 it lives in west Africa, and can grow up to about 35cm.

Connor Brackin, 24, was on duty for the McNairy county sheriff\u2019s office on 4 November when he was tasked with going to a home in Bethel Springs to check the condition of some dogs there, the Tennessee bureau of investigation (TBI) said in a recent statement. The TBI said Brackin arrived and released one of the dogs to the person who called and asked for the animals\u2019 welfare to be checked on, but the reasons for that were not made clear. Then, for reasons that remain under investigation, Bracken began firing his service gun and shot seven dogs on the property to death, the TBI alleged.

Brackin subsequently turned himself over to authorities at the jail operated by the sheriff\u2019s office that employed him, and he was booked.

High costs mean they can bring few delegates, and are less able to make their voices heard. Some delegates have been forced to improvise. One South Pacific delegate has a half-eaten Pot Noodle on her desk, having been stung for $33 the previous day. She took warm water from a water fountain to make it. Damian Carrington Fuel companies \u2018broke the planet\u2019, says Global Witness on cop29.com \u201cFossil fuel companies broke the planet, they should pay for it,\u201d according to the website cop29.com. Anyone visiting the site is in for a surprise. It has been acquired by the campaign group Global Witness and now leads with the faces of five big oil bosses and the headline: \u201cFossil fuel companies are destroying the planet for profit. They broke it, they should pay for it.\u201d Global Witness said it acquired the cop29.com site from an Indian couple who used the domain for their family business. They were offered a significant sum by Azerbaijan\u2019s Cop29 team for the site, Global Witness said, but the owners were worried about climate breakdown and decided to let Global Witness have it instead.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Shift your mindset</strong></h2> <p><strong>Question your \u2018winter blues\u2019</strong></p> <p>Convinced you suffer from seasonal affective disorder (Sad)? Don\u2019t be so quick, says Kari Leibowitz, winter psychology mindset expert<em> </em>and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-winter-9781035006960/\">How to Winter: Harnessing Your Mindset to Thrive in Cold, Dark Or Difficult Times</a>. \u201cSad is a subtype of clinical depression, and diagnosis relies on meeting the critria for this,\u201d she explains. \u201cBeyond that, people fall into two categories: those who feel more down in the winter, with worse mood in response to the lack of daylight; and those who are having a very normal, healthy response to a change in daylight but don\u2019t view it that way.\u201d Leibowitz argues that feeling more tired and less social is a normal response to the \u201c10-hour difference in the amount of daylight between the summer solstice and the winter solstice \u2013 yet people have this expectation that they\u2019ll have the same energy, the same interests, the same productivity year-round\u201d. She advocates tuning in to \u201cyour body and mind telling you to slow down, rest more, socialise in a low-key way\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Socialise gently</strong></p> <p>\u201cIn winter, I do more low-energy gatherings \u2013 I\u2019ll invite friends over to watch a movie, or if I\u2019m making a big pot of stew, it\u2019s easy to make it for a few extra people,\u201d says Leibowitz. \u201cIf you\u2019re a knitter, invite people over for a knitting night. If you\u2019re a baker, drop cookies off to friends and go in for a cup of tea.\u201d Don\u2019t want to socialise at all? \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between \u2018I don\u2019t feel like socialising so I\u2019m staying home feeling depressed\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t feel like socialising so I\u2019m staying at home and making myself a nice dinner and watching a show that I love and feeling cosy\u2019. If you don\u2019t feel like going out, be indulgent about staying in.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Notice the </strong><em><strong>actual </strong></em><strong>weather</strong></p> <p>Watch your negative winter weather bias. \u201cWe have this designation that if it has rained at all, it\u2019s a rainy day,\u201d says Leibowitz. Weather apps play into this; we see the dreaded double-raindrop icon and write off the day, but often the rain is only scheduled for part of the day. \u201cIf we start noticing the actual weather, we enjoy those times when the clouds part and you get that beautiful golden winter light.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Find new ways to have fun </strong></p> <p>When it\u2019s chucking it down outside, Leibowitz recommends asking yourself what things are actually <em>more fun</em> because of the weather. \u201cMaybe going to the pub for a roast with friends, maybe reading, painting or baking. Rather than saying, \u2018I\u2019m stuck inside because it\u2019s raining,\u2019 say, \u2018These are the things I get to do because it\u2019s raining\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Three winters are better than one</strong></p> <p>The idea is not to see winter as one eternal, dragging juggernaut. \u201cThe Sami, Indigenous people of the Nordic countries have eight seasons, so each season has what\u2019s called a \u2018shoulder season\u2019; they have autumn-winter, winter and spring-winter,\u201d says Leibowitz. It helps you to have realistic expectations, so in spring-winter you notice the days are getting longer, plants are starting to bud, but it\u2019s not yet T-shirt weather. \u201cA lot of people feel fatigued in February and March because they\u2019re ready for it to be over. Splitting winter into three can help.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Look for the light</strong></p> <p>Waking up in the dark, only to be shrouded in it again by 4pm is grim, so \u201cFind and create light,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thepsychologymum/?hl=en\">Dr Emma Hepburn</a>, clinical psychologist and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-toolkit-for-your-emotions-9781529416213\">A Toolkit for Your Emotions</a>. \u201cMorning light can be particularly beneficial for your sleep/wake cycle, so try to get outside in the morning, even if briefly, or sit next to windows if you are stuck indoors. Creating light means bringing light indoors to create welcoming, cosy, comforting spaces that help us relax.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.drtara.co.uk/\">Dr Tara Quinn-Cirillo</a>, psychologist and co-author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mental-health-micro-gains-9781837960767//\">Mental Health Micro Gains</a>, agrees, also suggesting using mirrors to reflect the light at home and \u201cundoing your coat when you can to let the light fall on your skin\u201d.</p>    <h2><strong>Get outside!</strong></h2> <p><strong>Connect with winter nature</strong></p> <p>To feel more upbeat, Leibowitz recommends that you, \u201cLook outside your window or step outside for a moment, and think: \u2018What looks nice in the winter?\u2019\u201d It could be patterns of rain and fog, the light reflected in the street, a robin perched on a window ledge. This changes our mindset because \u201cattention is a muscle and if we get used to opening the curtains every morning and noticing what we <em>don\u2019t</em> like, that becomes our default, but we can rewrite some of those scripts in our heads\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Keep kids entertained in the rain</strong></p> <p>Negativity towards \u201cbad weather\u201d is an adult thing, according to Linda Akeson McGurk, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/theres-no-such-thing-as-bad-weather-9781501143632/\">There\u2019s No Such Thing As Bad Weather</a>. She recommends a bit of outdoor play every day, and Dr Yiannis Ioannou, paediatrician and founder of <a href=\"https://childhealthy.co.uk/\">Childhealthy clinics in London</a>, agrees. \u201cGetting outdoors has a huge effect on children\u2019s mood, mental health, sleep and appetite,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they\u2019re adequately wrapped up, children will be happy to play outdoors even if it\u2019s raining.\u201d Not sure what to do? \u201cFollow your child\u2019s lead,\u201d says McGurk. \u201cIf they need some nudging, younger children enjoy stomping in puddles, digging canals in the dirt or making mud pies.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2026 and the snow</strong></p> <p>Aside from whizzing down a hill on a kitchen tray (which, while tempting, isn\u2019t recommended), McGurk says that \u201cmany children love playing with ice, only when in a safe place, of course \u2013 sliding on it, stomping on it or excavating toys from it. Another fun activity is to follow animal tracks in the snow \u2013 see how many you can find and try to work out what has left which tracks. You can also pack up some tasty food and hot drinks for a winter picnic.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Provide screen alternatives for little kids</strong></p> <p>To avoid overreliance on screens among younger children, Ioannou suggests \u201creading, make-believe games, any kind of drawing, painting, arts and crafts. Dancing indoors means you\u2019re getting exercise in by stealth, which will help on with physical and mental health \u2013 it\u2019s hard to be grumpy when you\u2019re dancing. Involving children in cooking is a good way to instil good eating habits, and for older children, board games and anything that involves manipulating things are excellent. This could be doing puzzles, building blocks, drawing, colouring, painting, throwing and catching or climbing. There\u2019s some benefit in terms of hand-eye coordination with some video games as well,\u201d he adds, \u201cjust use them in balance and moderation.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tear teens away from their phones</strong></p> <p>Struggling to keep your adolescent away from gaming or social media? Dr Nihara Krause, consultant clinical psychologist and founder of <a href=\"https://stem4.org.uk/\">stem4</a>, which provides training to support teenage mental health, suggests working out their \u201cindividual attraction to online activities, to then tap into the same need or reward\u201d. She advises parents to rotate these activities regularly to keep teens engaged, join in with them, and set screen time limits together and review them. Here are her favoured swaps:</p> <p><em>If they seek instant gratification</em><strong> </strong>\u201cReal-life alternatives to onscreen rewards might include playing an exciting board game, an organised treasure hunt or a science experiment.\u201d</p> <p><em>For those who crave social connection</em> \u201cHaving friends over, or having a film-making competition with friends in real life\u201d might hit the spot instead of \u201conline gaming or chasing likes on a post or reel\u201d.</p> <p><em>For mastery and achievement</em> \u201cFor teens who enjoy being the most skilled at a game out of a group of friends, introduce activities or sports that involve learning a new skill.\u201d</p> <p><em>To escape from boredom or stress</em> \u201cProvide calming or mood-changing activities: collating an album of jokes, having a cosy reading corner, or cooking something special together.\u201d</p> <p><em>For teens who love fast-paced entertainment</em> \u201cProvide real-life high-energy activities such as dance, exercise or an indoor obstacle course. Intersperse these activities with learning to get used to a slower pace in between.\u201d</p>    <h2><strong>Stay fit when the weather sucks</strong></h2> <p><strong>Find a challenge</strong></p> <p>Unmotivated when it\u2019s gloomy? Matthew Bourke, research fellow at the Health and Wellbeing Centre for Research Innovation at the University of Queensland in Australia,<strong> </strong>says the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14927713.2017.1399816\">research-backed</a> antidote is<strong> </strong>\u201cto find something that brings you joy. People who sustain exercise during winter are more strongly motivated by enjoyment, challenge, competition and social affiliation.\u201d To that end, find a challenge. \u201cA mass participation event a few months down the track might be a great way to motivate yourself during winter.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Stay social</strong></p> <p>\u201cJoin a team, get a membership to a group exercise club, join community events like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/05/parkrun-at-20-years-old-how-a-gentle-jog-turned-into-a-5km-saturday-morning-obsession\">Parkrun</a>, or find a friend or family member to exercise with,\u201d advises Bourke. Fire up a playlist, as \u201cresearch shows that people report more enjoyment during exercise when they are listening to music\u201d, says Bourke, who recommends high-tempo tracks to improve performance, but adds that \u201caudiobooks and podcasts can achieve the same thing\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Replace willpower with habit</strong></p> <p>\u201cWhen exercising becomes a habit, it takes less motivation and self-control to initiate,\u201d says Bourke, who suggests context-dependent repetition, ie doing the same thing in the same contexts, such as \u201cgoing to the gym during your lunchbreak every Tuesday. Habits can be strengthened by providing cues \u2013 this could include leaving a set of workout clothes at the office, leaving a pair of running shoes by the front door, or having workout equipment in the lounge.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How to avoid slipping on the ice</strong></p> <p>Appropriate footwear is the key, says chief scout Dwayne Fields, who in 2021 became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/28/dwayne-fields-first-black-briton-north-pole-polar-bear-young-people\">first Black Briton to reach the north pole</a>. Start with proper insulated winter boots. If you\u2019re heading out alone, tell someone where you\u2019re going. \u201cUse a stick or a walking pole. Take your time, look and think about what could be underfoot, and take each step cautiously. Walk on grass, if that\u2019s an option, as concrete can be slippery when snow has melted and refrozen into a sheet of ice.\u201d If you need to walk on a pavement, \u201clook for fluffy, white snow\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Keep the feeling in your fingers and toes</strong></p> <p>Wear appropriate gloves and use handwarmers, says Fields. For a quick, simple warm-up, \u201cswing your arms like a windmill, as this movement forces blood to your fingertips\u201d. And to use your phone (though Fields always recommends carrying a paper map, too), \u201cchoose gloves made of electrostatic material\u201d. Fields has never got a blister, so follow his sock rules: \u201cWear a pair of thin, silky-type socks with a thick pair made of merino wool or something synthetic on top. It allows moisture to dissipate to keep your feet warm, but instead of the sock rubbing your foot, the boot will rub the sock and the sock will rub the other sock.\u201d</p>    <h2><strong>Bolster your health</strong></h2> <p><strong>Eat for energy</strong></p> <p>Food-wise, dietitian Priya Tew suggests going for diversity, \u201cplanning as many plant foods and colours into your meals as you can\u201d, adding that \u201cwholegrains such as couscous, quinoa, wholemeal bread, oats and brown rice and pasta can provide great sources of energy, but this does not mean you can <em>only</em> eat the brown versions. Also take a vitamin D supplement in winter, as low vitamin D is linked to fatigue, and in the UK there is not enough sunshine to make it in our skin.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mix up your meals</strong></p> <p>Winter food can get samey, but Tew says meal planning can help you avoid getting in a rut. \u201cI love roasting a tray of vegetables like courgette, peppers and aubergines, and then adding them to all sorts of meals; stir through pasta with chicken or chickpeas and pesto, make extra for lunches or as a side, or as a vegetable lasagne to bring a taste of summer.\u201d She also suggests some spice, via a ramen or noodle soup: \u201cSpices such as ginger and turmeric help fight against infections, and are a way to add extra plants into the diet.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tackle your perma-cold</strong></p> <p>Constantly dripping nose or tickly cough? \u201cHydration is essential; warm teas with honey, ginger and lemon can be soothing, while using a humidifier can add moisture to the air and help ease respiratory symptoms, and saline nasal sprays can help clear nasal passages,\u201d says immunologist Dr Jenna Macciochi. \u201cZinc lozenges have been shown to reduce the duration of colds<strong> </strong>if taken within the first 24 hours of symptom onset. Additionally, adequate rest can help your body recover more quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, check if you are a mouth breather, as \u201cthis can leave you more susceptible to infections\u201d. Either ask a partner to let you know how you breathe as you sleep or, look out for \u201ctelltale signs \u2013 drool on your pillow when you wake up, snoring, dry mouth upon waking, bad breath, thirst during the night or after sleep, feeling tired and irritable\u201d, says Macciochi. \u201cYour mouth doesn\u2019t filter the air like your nose does. The nose also humidifies and warms the air, making it less likely to dry and irritate the airways inside your lungs, which makes them more sensitive and makes it easier for infections to enter your cells.\u201d How can you become a nasal breather? With awareness and time, \u201cmaking a conscious effort to breathe through your nose during the day and bringing awareness to your breathing habits,\u201d says Macciochi. \u201cYou can also practise specific breathwork exercises, like diaphragmatic breathing.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2026 and your kids\u2019</strong></p> <p>For children, Ioannou says handwashing is key to limiting spread. Feel as if your toddler is constantly ill? \u201cIn that age group, as many as 12 upper respiratory infections a year is normal \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a problem with their immune system.\u201d He reminds parents to keep up with vaccines, including the nasal flu spray, and says it\u2019s recommended that under-fives take a daily multivitamin.</p> <h2><strong>Weather-proof your pets</strong></h2> <p><strong>Clean up muddy dogs</strong></p> <p>\u201cIf your dog has a naturally long coat, keeping them well-groomed can help,\u201d says vet <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drlazaris_vet/?hl=en\">Michael Lazaris</a>. \u201cSometimes even just clipping the fur around their paws is enough.\u201d If they get caked in muck, \u201cuse a coarse brush to comb out the majority before it dries and gets matted. Also, keep a microfibre towel at hand or in the car to dry and wipe off as much as possible before getting home.\u201d If pooch needs a shampoo, \u201cuse a mild product specifically for dogs once every one to two weeks, as it can dry out fur and wash away natural oils. Stick to warm water the rest of the time.\u201d If your dog just has dirty feet or underbelly, \u201conly wash these areas. For mucky paws, I\u2019ll either fill a <a href=\"https://henrywag.com/product/henry-wag-pet-paw-cleaner/\">paw cleaner</a> with water and a touch of doggy shampoo, or I have a spray bottle with diluted shampoo at hand to wet paws and spray off any dirt. Paw washing is especially important as road grit can get stuck between your dog\u2019s paws and cause irritation. Finally, dry your dog properly, especially if it\u2019s cold.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Keep pets calm for new year fireworks</strong></p> <p>First prepare them: \u201cExercise and tire out your dog as much as possible during daylight hours,\u201d says Lazaris. Then at night \u201cprovide safe spaces, like dens made of blankets and pillows where they can hide if they\u2019re scared. Close curtains to drown out loud noises and flashing lights, keep the telly on or play relaxing music.\u201d You can also try natural calming supplements in the lead-up. \u201cMy go-to for dogs is <a href=\"https://yourpetnutrition.com/products/relax-restore?srsltid=AfmBOopeY2_8go2Gf299ciZITKopEFDxr6p6ByIBaY4bAUtxyzHMUTTe\">Relax + Restore</a> by Your Pet Nutrition (\u00a334.95). Calming sprays and plug-in pheromone diffusers (like <a href=\"https://www.feliway.co.uk/\">Feliway</a>) work wonders for kitties, while if your dog has severe noise phobias, your vet can dispense prescription options.\u201d Animals in hutches? \u201cTurn them inwards against a wall during the night and cover them with blankets. Better still, move them inside, adding lots of hay and blankets to help them feel safe and warm.\u201d Distraction is also useful. \u201cPuzzle feeders, slow feeders and new chew toys allow your pet to focus on something else. Ignoring the fireworks yourself can help, as dogs play off their owner\u2019s actions and emotions.\u201d Finally, says Lazaris, \u201cEscape-proof your house as some cats and dogs will do anything to get away, including digging under fences, jumping over gates and even out of windows.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Keep walkies safe</strong></p> <p>\u201cVery cold conditions can lead to frostbite or dry, chapped skin for your pets,\u201d says Lazaris. If the mercury falls below zero, keep walks short, and remember that \u201cif it\u2019s too cold for you to be outside, it\u2019s probably too cold for your dog\u201d. Protect paws with either boots, a paw balm or Vaseline. \u201cDogs with short coats, such as greyhounds, staffies and French bulldogs, benefit from winter coats, as well as very young or old dogs, or those with underlying illnesses,\u201d says Lazaris. \u201cJust make sure they don\u2019t overexercise in a very warm coat, as this can lead to heatstroke \u2013 even in winter.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Be mindful with anti</strong><strong>freeze</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/cats/health/poisoning/antifreeze\">extremely toxic to dogs and cats</a>, says Lazaris, \u201cbut for some reason many pets find the flavour appetising. Even a few drops can cause kidney failure in a cat, so store it safely and clean up any spillages straight away.\u201d Also, remember that cats often seek refuge under warm car engines, so \u201cdouble-check before you start your car and drive off\u201d.</p>    <h2><strong>Get cosy at home</strong></h2> <p><strong>Turn off \u2018the big light\u2019</strong></p> <p>As Scandinavians know, having all overhead lights on in your house when it\u2019s dark and rainy outside is a no-no. \u201cThat contrast is exhausting to the eye,\u201d says Leibowitz. \u201cSo have low lights, twinkly lights and some candles. It\u2019s such a pleasant vibe in which to eat dinner, do chores, hang out with your kids, and is only possible in the winter.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Turn to some warming dishes</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt has become an annual test of our collective will to see how long we wait to turn on the heating, but I cheat by locking myself in next to the stove and setting myself to cook,\u201d says recipe writer and restaurateur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/thomasina-miers\">Thomasina Miers</a>. Her favourite winter warmers include a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/25/winter-vegetable-soup-recipes-ribollita-squash-and-pasta-thomasina-miers\"> squash and pasta soup with fried sage leaves</a>, which she says \u201clights some internal kindling\u201d. She also turns to chillies: \u201cNot only do they speed up our metabolism, I find the rich warming spice of dried chillies puts a gentle glow to mind as well as body. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/12/mutton-curry-red-cabbage-curry-recipes-thomasina-miers\">slow-cooked mutton with cardamom</a> was one of the first curries my father cooked us, and we were as amazed at his prowess in the kitchen as we were delighted to be eating a feast of such deliciousness.\u201d For those who can take the heat, Miers recommends her<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/06/thomasina-miers-gluten-free-ethiopian-lentil-spinach-soup-recipe\"> spicy Ethiopian lentil and spinach soup</a>. Not a fan of fiery food? \u201cFind comfort in more soothing flavours like a rich and silky <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/11/celeriac-potato-soup-white-pizza-jerusalem-artichokes-thomasina-miers\">celeriac and potato soup</a> with cheese toasties, or the blissfully simple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/08/barley-risotto-radicchio-chorizo-recipe-thomasina-miers-goats-cheese-salad-rhubarb-pickle\">barley, chorizo and radicchio risotto</a>.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Drink yourself toasty</strong></p> <p>Want to warm your cockles at the end of a long day? \u201cA hot whisky cocktail is always a delight \u2013 stir 1 tsp of honey into 150ml boiled water with 10ml of lemon juice, 50ml farmhouse apple juice and a generous slug of whisky,\u201d says Miers, who is also a fan of a hot chocolate. \u201cI whisk a heaped teaspoon of raw cacao and very dark chocolate either in full-fat milk or water. A hint of cinnamon, a touch of anise and a small scrunch of brown sugar, and I am in heaven with all the mood-boosting and reviving properties of this nutrient-dense drink.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Prepare for party season</strong></h2> <p><strong>Boss your diary, not the other way </strong><strong>round</strong></p> <p>If endless small talk and a calendar crammed with festive events fills you with dread, psychologist Dr Emma Hepburn suggests being more intentional with your precious RSVPs. \u201cThink about how particular activities or events make you feel. Do they energise you and make you feel good, or do you feel exhausted and worse afterwards? Are they meaningful to you, or are you saying yes because you feel you should, or don\u2019t want to miss out? Learning to turn down activities that don\u2019t work for you can be a powerful tool. Think of your time as a precious commodity.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t get Christmas overwhelm</strong></p> <p>Find the buildup to 25 December exhausting? \u201cTry not to get caught up in expectations,\u201d advises psychologist Dr Tara Quinn-Cirillo. \u201cWe may have different historical relationships with Christmas, for example it might be associated with grief, so we need to practise self-compassion and autonomy around how we navigate it. Engage in purposeful, value-based living by identifying the things that negatively impact your mental health \u2013 and things that help it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Survive the slump to </strong><strong>New </strong><strong>Year\u2019s Eve</strong></p> <p>There are many names for this period, ranging from the sublime (Betwixmas) to the ridiculous (Christmas perineum), but whatever you call it, it can feel notoriously flat. Guard against that, says Quinn-Cirillo: \u201cSpread seeing people over the whole festive period rather than squashing it all in before, which adds to the feeling of deflation after Boxing Day. Then think about some values and goals for the year ahead and use the time to pause \u2013 spending targeted downtime with yourself is different from isolation.\u201d</p> <p>Hepburn agrees, advising seeing \u201cthis as a time to recuperate, rest and regenerate. Having plans that lift your mood can be helpful, but these don\u2019t need to be big. It can be reading a book or taking a frosty walk exploring somewhere you\u2019ve always meant to visit. Also, make plans for later in the year, to have something to look forward to.\u201d</p>    <h2><strong>Give nature a helping hand</strong></h2> <p><strong>Keep houseplants alive</strong></p> <p>If you neglect your plants in winter, they can quickly go from lush to limp, or worse still, dead. Guardian houseplant expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gynelle-leon\">Gynelle Leon</a><strong> </strong>has a remedy:</p> <p><em>Avoid the windowsill</em><strong> </strong>If yours is shaded by heavy curtains, especially thick or blackout ones, it can turn into an icebox during the night when temperatures drop.</p> <p><em>Keep away from heat</em><strong> </strong>It\u2019s tempting to place your plants near a radiator or heat source, but the heat is dry and intense, which can lead to dehydration and stress. Natural sunlight, on the other hand, provides balanced warmth.</p> <p><em>Reduce watering</em><strong> </strong>Winter is a period of dormancy for many plants. Overwatering can lead to waterlogged soil, which can cause root rot \u2013 a common killer.</p> <p><em>Follow the 10C rule</em><strong> </strong>Most houseplants are not frost-tolerant. Prolonged exposure to temperatures below 10C can lead to damage and death. Move them to a warm spot.</p> <p><em>Stop fertilising</em><strong> </strong>During the winter, plants rest and slow their growth. Fertilising can cause more harm than good.</p> <h2><strong>Keep your garden looking cheerful</strong></h2> <p><em>Don\u2019t hack it back</em><strong> </strong>If your garden looks like a wasteland of sticks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alice-vincent\">Alice Vincent</a>, a Guardian gardening columnist, suggests a more laid-back approach. \u201cOne of the biggest winter gardening mistakes people make is tidying up their more structural perennials too early,\u201d she says. \u201cGrasses and sculptural plants such as <em>Phlomis russeliana</em>, fennel, sedum, hydrangea and echinacea conjure magical shadow play in low winter sunlight and leave seeds for the birds. I wouldn\u2019t touch them until late February at the earliest.\u201d</p> <p><em>Add evergreens</em> \u201cHolly and ivy inspire carolling for a reason, and in less traditional gardens, <em>Fatsia japonica</em> creates drama from its large, tropical-looking leaves even from small containers,\u201d says Vincent. \u201cCheck out beautiful and swift-growing <em>Clematis urophylla</em> \u2018Winter Beauty\u2019. It will scramble up a boundary and flower in the darkest days.\u201d</p> <p><em>Get bulbs in the ground </em>To feel hopeful as winter turns to spring, choose bulbs. \u201cYou can plant them as late as January,\u201d says Vincent. \u201cSticking to a loose colour palette will lend cohesion, and covering pots with a cloche will stop the squirrels.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Adapt your beauty approach</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sidestep rosacea flare-ups</strong><br>Think gentle, says Dr Anjali Mahto, consultant dermatologist at the <a href=\"https://selflondon.com/\">Self London clinic</a>. \u201cUse a mild, fragrance-free cleanser to avoid irritating your skin, and apply a hydrating moisturiser to combat dryness from cold air and indoor heating. Opt for a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF30 or higher, as UV rays can still affect your skin in winter.\u201d Lifestyle tweaks help too: \u201cDress warmly, using scarves to protect your face from harsh winds, but ensure the material is soft to prevent irritation. Avoid hot beverages and spicy foods, which can trigger flare-ups. If your rosacea is severe, consult a dermatologist.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Combat frizzy hair</strong><br>Misty rain (AKA mizzle), steamy buses \u2026 there are plenty of reasons for your hair to crinkle in winter. \u201cDepending on your hair type, texture and condition, there are a few options,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anita-bhagwandas\">Anita Bhagwandas</a>, a Guardian beauty columnist and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ugly-9781788704755\">Ugly: Giving Us Back Our Beauty Standards</a>. \u201cThe longest lasting is a keratin treatment, a chemical procedure that helps to smooth hair for three to six months, but it can be pricey. Blow-dry sprays such as <a href=\"https://beautykick.com/its-a-10-blow-dry-miracle-h20-shield-180ml/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw99e4BhDiARIsAISE7P89oUUsYzurckVciRkfZLpOnPXaxlJJqCINTKSFZwCEkdbf4qqkGJ8aAlbWEALw_wcB\">It\u2019s a 10 Blow Dry Miracle H20 Shield</a> (\u00a324) and<a href=\"https://www.lookfantastic.com/p/kerastase-styling-l-incroyable-blow-dry-150ml/11258166/\"> K\u00e9rastase Styling L\u2019Incroyable Blowdry</a> (\u00a334.85) also give you a little protection and help the hair to recover post-shower.\u201d If all else fails, \u201ckeep a chic clip on hand.

At night, layering serum or face oil with a heavy night cream can help protect your skin from central-heating induced dehydration.\u201d</p>    <h2><strong>Style solutions</strong></h2> <p><strong>Stop your glasses fogging up</strong><br>Jumped on the bus and feel as if you\u2019ve just opened the dishwasher? \u201cApply a high-quality anti-fog spray to your lenses,\u201d says Jamie Bartlett, co-founder of <a href=\"http://bantonframeworks.co.uk\">Banton Frameworks</a>. \u201cEnsure there\u2019s a small gap between the top of your scarf and the bottom rims of your glasses, which prevents warm, moist air from directly hitting the lenses and causing condensation.\u201d If the indoor temperature is vastly different from outdoors, \u201cclean your glasses with mild soap and warm water when you come in\u201d. Keep them clean with<strong> </strong>a microfibre cloth, and think about getting the frames adjusted as \u201cif they sit too close to your face, they are more prone to fogging. Or consider low-cost adhesive silicone nose pads if the bridge is too wide, which allow for better airflow around your lenses.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Layer up like a pro</strong></p> <p>Dwayne Fields advises a merino wool base layer \u201cbecause it dries quickly, allows your body to breathe, but also traps a bit of air to keep you warm\u201d. On top of that, \u201ca relatively thin fleece mid-layer with a zip to control how much air goes in and out\u201d. Pick an outer layer with vents, \u201cso you can open those to adjust to your own liking\u201d. And before choosing a one-piece, like a ski suit, \u201cconsider how often you might need to go to the loo\u201d, says Fields. Live by this motto: Be Bold, Start Cold. \u201cIt\u2019s what I was told when I was doing my mountain-leader training. Go out in your fleece layer before putting on your outer layer, because after five or 10 minutes of some light activity, you\u2019ll find that actually, it\u2019s not that cold \u2013 what you were feeling was the difference between the temperature in the house and outside.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Beat the rain in style</strong></p> <p>When you neither want to look like a drowned rat nor an overheating sweaty mess, choosing the right winter jacket is essential. \u201cThe perfect winter coat must possess one characteristic,\u201d says Guardian fashion editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jesscartnermorley\">Jess Cartner-Morley</a>. \u201cI am not going to insult your intelligence by pointing out that it needs to be warm, nor remind you that it needs to be waterproof. The magic is finding a coat that looks great. We spend so much time in them that they become our personality through the most depressing months of the year. A chic, elegant, fabulous one will do as much for your wellbeing as a flu shot. I love Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/checked-longline-trench-coat-with-wool/p/clp60681881\">checked longline trench coat with wool</a> (\u00a3109).\u201d</p> <p><strong>Handle whatever the weather throws at you</strong></p> <p>In the UK, we need a few key pieces to survive the daily smorgasbord of winter weather challenges. Cartner-Morley says: \u201cOne minute you\u2019re marching through wind and rain, the next jostling for oxygen on a packed train carriage. No one outfit will work for every moment, but key accessories will save your sanity.\u201d From top to toe, Cartner-Morley advises \u201ca waterproof scarf with integral hood\u201d such as a <a href=\"https://www.cos.com/en_gbp/women/accessories/hats-scarves-and-gloves/product.padded-hybrid-hooded-scarf-black.1252256001.html?utm_source=ShopForward%20CSS&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=478321252256001001&amp;amp;utm_content=15&amp;amp;utm_term=1481828&amp;amp;ranMID=47832&amp;amp;ranEAID=nz/xpRlxjVA&amp;amp;ranSiteID=nz_xpRlxjVA-lZ0SC93RrSx3AOdvHSKLdA\">padded hybrid hooded scarf</a> from Cos (\u00a365) and a pair of \u201csturdy, smart shoes that you can run from the bus to a meeting in.

      "bodyText": "Shift your mindset Question your \u2018winter blues\u2019 Convinced you suffer from seasonal affective disorder (Sad)? Don\u2019t be so quick, says Kari Leibowitz, winter psychology mindset expert and author of How to Winter: Harnessing Your Mindset to Thrive in Cold, Dark Or Difficult Times. \u201cSad is a subtype of clinical depression, and diagnosis relies on meeting the critria for this,\u201d she explains. \u201cBeyond that, people fall into two categories: those who feel more down in the winter, with worse mood in response to the lack of daylight; and those who are having a very normal, healthy response to a change in daylight but don\u2019t view it that way.\u201d Leibowitz argues that feeling more tired and less social is a normal response to the \u201c10-hour difference in the amount of daylight between the summer solstice and the winter solstice \u2013 yet people have this expectation that they\u2019ll have the same energy, the same interests, the same productivity year-round\u201d. She advocates tuning in to \u201cyour body and mind telling you to slow down, rest more, socialise in a low-key way\u201d. Socialise gently \u201cIn winter, I do more low-energy gatherings \u2013 I\u2019ll invite friends over to watch a movie, or if I\u2019m making a big pot of stew, it\u2019s easy to make it for a few extra people,\u201d says Leibowitz. \u201cIf you\u2019re a knitter, invite people over for a knitting night. If you\u2019re a baker, drop cookies off to friends and go in for a cup of tea.\u201d Don\u2019t want to socialise at all? \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between \u2018I don\u2019t feel like socialising so I\u2019m staying home feeling depressed\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t feel like socialising so I\u2019m staying at home and making myself a nice dinner and watching a show that I love and feeling cosy\u2019. If you don\u2019t feel like going out, be indulgent about staying in.\u201d Notice the actual weather Watch your negative winter weather bias. \u201cWe have this designation that if it has rained at all, it\u2019s a rainy day,\u201d says Leibowitz. Weather apps play into this; we see the dreaded double-raindrop icon and write off the day, but often the rain is only scheduled for part of the day. \u201cIf we start noticing the actual weather, we enjoy those times when the clouds part and you get that beautiful golden winter light.\u201d Find new ways to have fun When it\u2019s chucking it down outside, Leibowitz recommends asking yourself what things are actually more fun because of the weather. \u201cMaybe going to the pub for a roast with friends, maybe reading, painting or baking. Rather than saying, \u2018I\u2019m stuck inside because it\u2019s raining,\u2019 say, \u2018These are the things I get to do because it\u2019s raining\u2019.\u201d Three winters are better than one The idea is not to see winter as one eternal, dragging juggernaut. \u201cThe Sami, Indigenous people of the Nordic countries have eight seasons, so each season has what\u2019s called a \u2018shoulder season\u2019; they have autumn-winter, winter and spring-winter,\u201d says Leibowitz. It helps you to have realistic expectations, so in spring-winter you notice the days are getting longer, plants are starting to bud, but it\u2019s not yet T-shirt weather. \u201cA lot of people feel fatigued in February and March because they\u2019re ready for it to be over. Splitting winter into three can help.\u201d Look for the light Waking up in the dark, only to be shrouded in it again by 4pm is grim, so \u201cFind and create light,\u201d says Dr Emma Hepburn, clinical psychologist and author of A Toolkit for Your Emotions. \u201cMorning light can be particularly beneficial for your sleep/wake cycle, so try to get outside in the morning, even if briefly, or sit next to windows if you are stuck indoors. Creating light means bringing light indoors to create welcoming, cosy, comforting spaces that help us relax.\u201d Dr Tara Quinn-Cirillo, psychologist and co-author of Mental Health Micro Gains, agrees, also suggesting using mirrors to reflect the light at home and \u201cundoing your coat when you can to let the light fall on your skin\u201d. Get outside! Connect with winter nature To feel more upbeat, Leibowitz recommends that you, \u201cLook outside your window or step outside for a moment, and think: \u2018What looks nice in the winter?\u2019\u201d It could be patterns of rain and fog, the light reflected in the street, a robin perched on a window ledge. This changes our mindset because \u201cattention is a muscle and if we get used to opening the curtains every morning and noticing what we don\u2019t like, that becomes our default, but we can rewrite some of those scripts in our heads\u201d. Keep kids entertained in the rain Negativity towards \u201cbad weather\u201d is an adult thing, according to Linda Akeson McGurk, author of There\u2019s No Such Thing As Bad Weather. She recommends a bit of outdoor play every day, and Dr Yiannis Ioannou, paediatrician and founder of Childhealthy clinics in London, agrees. \u201cGetting outdoors has a huge effect on children\u2019s mood, mental health, sleep and appetite,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they\u2019re adequately wrapped up, children will be happy to play outdoors even if it\u2019s raining.\u201d Not sure what to do? \u201cFollow your child\u2019s lead,\u201d says McGurk. \u201cIf they need some nudging, younger children enjoy stomping in puddles, digging canals in the dirt or making mud pies.\u201d \u2026 and the snow Aside from whizzing down a hill on a kitchen tray (which, while tempting, isn\u2019t recommended), McGurk says that \u201cmany children love playing with ice, only when in a safe place, of course \u2013 sliding on it, stomping on it or excavating toys from it. Another fun activity is to follow animal tracks in the snow \u2013 see how many you can find and try to work out what has left which tracks. You can also pack up some tasty food and hot drinks for a winter picnic.\u201d Provide screen alternatives for little kids To avoid overreliance on screens among younger children, Ioannou suggests \u201creading, make-believe games, any kind of drawing, painting, arts and crafts. Dancing indoors means you\u2019re getting exercise in by stealth, which will help on with physical and mental health \u2013 it\u2019s hard to be grumpy when you\u2019re dancing. Involving children in cooking is a good way to instil good eating habits, and for older children, board games and anything that involves manipulating things are excellent. This could be doing puzzles, building blocks, drawing, colouring, painting, throwing and catching or climbing. There\u2019s some benefit in terms of hand-eye coordination with some video games as well,\u201d he adds, \u201cjust use them in balance and moderation.\u201d Tear teens away from their phones Struggling to keep your adolescent away from gaming or social media? Dr Nihara Krause, consultant clinical psychologist and founder of stem4, which provides training to support teenage mental health, suggests working out their \u201cindividual attraction to online activities, to then tap into the same need or reward\u201d. She advises parents to rotate these activities regularly to keep teens engaged, join in with them, and set screen time limits together and review them. Here are her favoured swaps: If they seek instant gratification \u201cReal-life alternatives to onscreen rewards might include playing an exciting board game, an organised treasure hunt or a science experiment.\u201d For those who crave social connection \u201cHaving friends over, or having a film-making competition with friends in real life\u201d might hit the spot instead of \u201conline gaming or chasing likes on a post or reel\u201d. For mastery and achievement \u201cFor teens who enjoy being the most skilled at a game out of a group of friends, introduce activities or sports that involve learning a new skill.\u201d To escape from boredom or stress \u201cProvide calming or mood-changing activities: collating an album of jokes, having a cosy reading corner, or cooking something special together.\u201d For teens who love fast-paced entertainment \u201cProvide real-life high-energy activities such as dance, exercise or an indoor obstacle course. Intersperse these activities with learning to get used to a slower pace in between.\u201d Stay fit when the weather sucks Find a challenge Unmotivated when it\u2019s gloomy? Matthew Bourke, research fellow at the Health and Wellbeing Centre for Research Innovation at the University of Queensland in Australia, says the research-backed antidote is \u201cto find something that brings you joy. People who sustain exercise during winter are more strongly motivated by enjoyment, challenge, competition and social affiliation.\u201d To that end, find a challenge. \u201cA mass participation event a few months down the track might be a great way to motivate yourself during winter.\u201d Stay social \u201cJoin a team, get a membership to a group exercise club, join community events like Parkrun, or find a friend or family member to exercise with,\u201d advises Bourke. Fire up a playlist, as \u201cresearch shows that people report more enjoyment during exercise when they are listening to music\u201d, says Bourke, who recommends high-tempo tracks to improve performance, but adds that \u201caudiobooks and podcasts can achieve the same thing\u201d. Replace willpower with habit \u201cWhen exercising becomes a habit, it takes less motivation and self-control to initiate,\u201d says Bourke, who suggests context-dependent repetition, ie doing the same thing in the same contexts, such as \u201cgoing to the gym during your lunchbreak every Tuesday. Habits can be strengthened by providing cues \u2013 this could include leaving a set of workout clothes at the office, leaving a pair of running shoes by the front door, or having workout equipment in the lounge.\u201d How to avoid slipping on the ice Appropriate footwear is the key, says chief scout Dwayne Fields, who in 2021 became the first Black Briton to reach the north pole. Start with proper insulated winter boots. If you\u2019re heading out alone, tell someone where you\u2019re going. \u201cUse a stick or a walking pole. Take your time, look and think about what could be underfoot, and take each step cautiously. Walk on grass, if that\u2019s an option, as concrete can be slippery when snow has melted and refrozen into a sheet of ice.\u201d If you need to walk on a pavement, \u201clook for fluffy, white snow\u201d. Keep the feeling in your fingers and toes Wear appropriate gloves and use handwarmers, says Fields. For a quick, simple warm-up, \u201cswing your arms like a windmill, as this movement forces blood to your fingertips\u201d. And to use your phone (though Fields always recommends carrying a paper map, too), \u201cchoose gloves made of electrostatic material\u201d. Fields has never got a blister, so follow his sock rules: \u201cWear a pair of thin, silky-type socks with a thick pair made of merino wool or something synthetic on top. It allows moisture to dissipate to keep your feet warm, but instead of the sock rubbing your foot, the boot will rub the sock and the sock will rub the other sock.\u201d Bolster your health Eat for energy Food-wise, dietitian Priya Tew suggests going for diversity, \u201cplanning as many plant foods and colours into your meals as you can\u201d, adding that \u201cwholegrains such as couscous, quinoa, wholemeal bread, oats and brown rice and pasta can provide great sources of energy, but this does not mean you can only eat the brown versions. Also take a vitamin D supplement in winter, as low vitamin D is linked to fatigue, and in the UK there is not enough sunshine to make it in our skin.\u201d Mix up your meals Winter food can get samey, but Tew says meal planning can help you avoid getting in a rut. \u201cI love roasting a tray of vegetables like courgette, peppers and aubergines, and then adding them to all sorts of meals; stir through pasta with chicken or chickpeas and pesto, make extra for lunches or as a side, or as a vegetable lasagne to bring a taste of summer.\u201d She also suggests some spice, via a ramen or noodle soup: \u201cSpices such as ginger and turmeric help fight against infections, and are a way to add extra plants into the diet.\u201d Tackle your perma-cold Constantly dripping nose or tickly cough? \u201cHydration is essential; warm teas with honey, ginger and lemon can be soothing, while using a humidifier can add moisture to the air and help ease respiratory symptoms, and saline nasal sprays can help clear nasal passages,\u201d says immunologist Dr Jenna Macciochi. \u201cZinc lozenges have been shown to reduce the duration of colds if taken within the first 24 hours of symptom onset. Additionally, adequate rest can help your body recover more quickly.\u201d Finally, check if you are a mouth breather, as \u201cthis can leave you more susceptible to infections\u201d. Either ask a partner to let you know how you breathe as you sleep or, look out for \u201ctelltale signs \u2013 drool on your pillow when you wake up, snoring, dry mouth upon waking, bad breath, thirst during the night or after sleep, feeling tired and irritable\u201d, says Macciochi. \u201cYour mouth doesn\u2019t filter the air like your nose does. The nose also humidifies and warms the air, making it less likely to dry and irritate the airways inside your lungs, which makes them more sensitive and makes it easier for infections to enter your cells.\u201d How can you become a nasal breather? With awareness and time, \u201cmaking a conscious effort to breathe through your nose during the day and bringing awareness to your breathing habits,\u201d says Macciochi. \u201cYou can also practise specific breathwork exercises, like diaphragmatic breathing.\u201d \u2026 and your kids\u2019 For children, Ioannou says handwashing is key to limiting spread. Feel as if your toddler is constantly ill? \u201cIn that age group, as many as 12 upper respiratory infections a year is normal \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a problem with their immune system.\u201d He reminds parents to keep up with vaccines, including the nasal flu spray, and says it\u2019s recommended that under-fives take a daily multivitamin. Weather-proof your pets Clean up muddy dogs \u201cIf your dog has a naturally long coat, keeping them well-groomed can help,\u201d says vet Michael Lazaris. \u201cSometimes even just clipping the fur around their paws is enough.\u201d If they get caked in muck, \u201cuse a coarse brush to comb out the majority before it dries and gets matted. Also, keep a microfibre towel at hand or in the car to dry and wipe off as much as possible before getting home.\u201d If pooch needs a shampoo, \u201cuse a mild product specifically for dogs once every one to two weeks, as it can dry out fur and wash away natural oils. Stick to warm water the rest of the time.\u201d If your dog just has dirty feet or underbelly, \u201conly wash these areas. For mucky paws, I\u2019ll either fill a paw cleaner with water and a touch of doggy shampoo, or I have a spray bottle with diluted shampoo at hand to wet paws and spray off any dirt. Paw washing is especially important as road grit can get stuck between your dog\u2019s paws and cause irritation. Finally, dry your dog properly, especially if it\u2019s cold.\u201d Keep pets calm for new year fireworks First prepare them: \u201cExercise and tire out your dog as much as possible during daylight hours,\u201d says Lazaris. Then at night \u201cprovide safe spaces, like dens made of blankets and pillows where they can hide if they\u2019re scared. Close curtains to drown out loud noises and flashing lights, keep the telly on or play relaxing music.\u201d You can also try natural calming supplements in the lead-up. \u201cMy go-to for dogs is Relax + Restore by Your Pet Nutrition (\u00a334.95). Calming sprays and plug-in pheromone diffusers (like Feliway) work wonders for kitties, while if your dog has severe noise phobias, your vet can dispense prescription options.\u201d Animals in hutches? \u201cTurn them inwards against a wall during the night and cover them with blankets. Better still, move them inside, adding lots of hay and blankets to help them feel safe and warm.\u201d Distraction is also useful. \u201cPuzzle feeders, slow feeders and new chew toys allow your pet to focus on something else. Ignoring the fireworks yourself can help, as dogs play off their owner\u2019s actions and emotions.\u201d Finally, says Lazaris, \u201cEscape-proof your house as some cats and dogs will do anything to get away, including digging under fences, jumping over gates and even out of windows.\u201d Keep walkies safe \u201cVery cold conditions can lead to frostbite or dry, chapped skin for your pets,\u201d says Lazaris. If the mercury falls below zero, keep walks short, and remember that \u201cif it\u2019s too cold for you to be outside, it\u2019s probably too cold for your dog\u201d. Protect paws with either boots, a paw balm or Vaseline. \u201cDogs with short coats, such as greyhounds, staffies and French bulldogs, benefit from winter coats, as well as very young or old dogs, or those with underlying illnesses,\u201d says Lazaris. \u201cJust make sure they don\u2019t overexercise in a very warm coat, as this can lead to heatstroke \u2013 even in winter.\u201d Be mindful with antifreeze It\u2019s extremely toxic to dogs and cats, says Lazaris, \u201cbut for some reason many pets find the flavour appetising. Even a few drops can cause kidney failure in a cat, so store it safely and clean up any spillages straight away.\u201d Also, remember that cats often seek refuge under warm car engines, so \u201cdouble-check before you start your car and drive off\u201d. Get cosy at home Turn off \u2018the big light\u2019 As Scandinavians know, having all overhead lights on in your house when it\u2019s dark and rainy outside is a no-no. \u201cThat contrast is exhausting to the eye,\u201d says Leibowitz. \u201cSo have low lights, twinkly lights and some candles. It\u2019s such a pleasant vibe in which to eat dinner, do chores, hang out with your kids, and is only possible in the winter.\u201d Turn to some warming dishes \u201cIt has become an annual test of our collective will to see how long we wait to turn on the heating, but I cheat by locking myself in next to the stove and setting myself to cook,\u201d says recipe writer and restaurateur Thomasina Miers. Her favourite winter warmers include a squash and pasta soup with fried sage leaves, which she says \u201clights some internal kindling\u201d. She also turns to chillies: \u201cNot only do they speed up our metabolism, I find the rich warming spice of dried chillies puts a gentle glow to mind as well as body. A slow-cooked mutton with cardamom was one of the first curries my father cooked us, and we were as amazed at his prowess in the kitchen as we were delighted to be eating a feast of such deliciousness.\u201d For those who can take the heat, Miers recommends her spicy Ethiopian lentil and spinach soup. Not a fan of fiery food? \u201cFind comfort in more soothing flavours like a rich and silky celeriac and potato soup with cheese toasties, or the blissfully simple barley, chorizo and radicchio risotto.\u201d Drink yourself toasty Want to warm your cockles at the end of a long day? \u201cA hot whisky cocktail is always a delight \u2013 stir 1 tsp of honey into 150ml boiled water with 10ml of lemon juice, 50ml farmhouse apple juice and a generous slug of whisky,\u201d says Miers, who is also a fan of a hot chocolate. \u201cI whisk a heaped teaspoon of raw cacao and very dark chocolate either in full-fat milk or water. A hint of cinnamon, a touch of anise and a small scrunch of brown sugar, and I am in heaven with all the mood-boosting and reviving properties of this nutrient-dense drink.\u201d Prepare for party season Boss your diary, not the other way round If endless small talk and a calendar crammed with festive events fills you with dread, psychologist Dr Emma Hepburn suggests being more intentional with your precious RSVPs. \u201cThink about how particular activities or events make you feel. Do they energise you and make you feel good, or do you feel exhausted and worse afterwards? Are they meaningful to you, or are you saying yes because you feel you should, or don\u2019t want to miss out? Learning to turn down activities that don\u2019t work for you can be a powerful tool. Think of your time as a precious commodity.\u201d Don\u2019t get Christmas overwhelm Find the buildup to 25 December exhausting? \u201cTry not to get caught up in expectations,\u201d advises psychologist Dr Tara Quinn-Cirillo. \u201cWe may have different historical relationships with Christmas, for example it might be associated with grief, so we need to practise self-compassion and autonomy around how we navigate it. Engage in purposeful, value-based living by identifying the things that negatively impact your mental health \u2013 and things that help it.\u201d Survive the slump to New Year\u2019s Eve There are many names for this period, ranging from the sublime (Betwixmas) to the ridiculous (Christmas perineum), but whatever you call it, it can feel notoriously flat. Guard against that, says Quinn-Cirillo: \u201cSpread seeing people over the whole festive period rather than squashing it all in before, which adds to the feeling of deflation after Boxing Day. Then think about some values and goals for the year ahead and use the time to pause \u2013 spending targeted downtime with yourself is different from isolation.\u201d Hepburn agrees, advising seeing \u201cthis as a time to recuperate, rest and regenerate. Having plans that lift your mood can be helpful, but these don\u2019t need to be big. It can be reading a book or taking a frosty walk exploring somewhere you\u2019ve always meant to visit. Also, make plans for later in the year, to have something to look forward to.\u201d Give nature a helping hand Keep houseplants alive If you neglect your plants in winter, they can quickly go from lush to limp, or worse still, dead. Guardian houseplant expert Gynelle Leon has a remedy: Avoid the windowsill If yours is shaded by heavy curtains, especially thick or blackout ones, it can turn into an icebox during the night when temperatures drop. Keep away from heat It\u2019s tempting to place your plants near a radiator or heat source, but the heat is dry and intense, which can lead to dehydration and stress. Natural sunlight, on the other hand, provides balanced warmth. Reduce watering Winter is a period of dormancy for many plants. Overwatering can lead to waterlogged soil, which can cause root rot \u2013 a common killer. Follow the 10C rule Most houseplants are not frost-tolerant. Prolonged exposure to temperatures below 10C can lead to damage and death. Move them to a warm spot. Stop fertilising During the winter, plants rest and slow their growth. Fertilising can cause more harm than good. Keep your garden looking cheerful Don\u2019t hack it back If your garden looks like a wasteland of sticks, Alice Vincent, a Guardian gardening columnist, suggests a more laid-back approach. \u201cOne of the biggest winter gardening mistakes people make is tidying up their more structural perennials too early,\u201d she says. \u201cGrasses and sculptural plants such as Phlomis russeliana, fennel, sedum, hydrangea and echinacea conjure magical shadow play in low winter sunlight and leave seeds for the birds. I wouldn\u2019t touch them until late February at the earliest.\u201d Add evergreens \u201cHolly and ivy inspire carolling for a reason, and in less traditional gardens, Fatsia japonica creates drama from its large, tropical-looking leaves even from small containers,\u201d says Vincent. \u201cCheck out beautiful and swift-growing Clematis urophylla \u2018Winter Beauty\u2019. It will scramble up a boundary and flower in the darkest days.\u201d Get bulbs in the ground To feel hopeful as winter turns to spring, choose bulbs. \u201cYou can plant them as late as January,\u201d says Vincent. \u201cSticking to a loose colour palette will lend cohesion, and covering pots with a cloche will stop the squirrels.\u201d Adapt your beauty approach Sidestep rosacea flare-ups Think gentle, says Dr Anjali Mahto, consultant dermatologist at the Self London clinic. \u201cUse a mild, fragrance-free cleanser to avoid irritating your skin, and apply a hydrating moisturiser to combat dryness from cold air and indoor heating. Opt for a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF30 or higher, as UV rays can still affect your skin in winter.\u201d Lifestyle tweaks help too: \u201cDress warmly, using scarves to protect your face from harsh winds, but ensure the material is soft to prevent irritation. Avoid hot beverages and spicy foods, which can trigger flare-ups. If your rosacea is severe, consult a dermatologist.\u201d Combat frizzy hair Misty rain (AKA mizzle), steamy buses \u2026 there are plenty of reasons for your hair to crinkle in winter. \u201cDepending on your hair type, texture and condition, there are a few options,\u201d says Anita Bhagwandas, a Guardian beauty columnist and author of Ugly: Giving Us Back Our Beauty Standards. \u201cThe longest lasting is a keratin treatment, a chemical procedure that helps to smooth hair for three to six months, but it can be pricey. Blow-dry sprays such as It\u2019s a 10 Blow Dry Miracle H20 Shield (\u00a324) and K\u00e9rastase Styling L\u2019Incroyable Blowdry (\u00a334.85) also give you a little protection and help the hair to recover post-shower.\u201d If all else fails, \u201ckeep a chic clip on hand. I like the ASOS clip claw with snake design in gold tone.\u201d Nourish chapped lips \u201cFirst, establish the cause,\u201d says Bhagwandas. \u201cIs it dehydration, lack of moisture in the lips, the climate, or have you been picking them? Get rid of any dead skin by giving them a gentle scrub with a flannel, or Refy Lip Buff (\u00a316), and follow with your chosen balm. I find the most long-lasting ones have a thick, ointment texture, such as La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume (\u00a38.50) or Aerin Rose Lip Conditioner (\u00a324), which genuinely lasts all day. Using a lip mask at night can also help \u2013 try Laneige (\u00a319).\u201d Conquer cold-beaten skin \u201cLayering moisturising products can help,\u201d says Bhagwandas. \u201cFirst apply a serum laden with moisturising ingredients like hyaluronic acid, followed by a heavy moisturising cream with ceramides such as CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion (\u00a316.50) and top up during the day with a ceramide-based spray like Cur\u00e9l Deep Moisture Spray (\u00a319.50). At night, layering serum or face oil with a heavy night cream can help protect your skin from central-heating induced dehydration.\u201d Style solutions Stop your glasses fogging up Jumped on the bus and feel as if you\u2019ve just opened the dishwasher? \u201cApply a high-quality anti-fog spray to your lenses,\u201d says Jamie Bartlett, co-founder of Banton Frameworks. \u201cEnsure there\u2019s a small gap between the top of your scarf and the bottom rims of your glasses, which prevents warm, moist air from directly hitting the lenses and causing condensation.\u201d If the indoor temperature is vastly different from outdoors, \u201cclean your glasses with mild soap and warm water when you come in\u201d. Keep them clean with a microfibre cloth, and think about getting the frames adjusted as \u201cif they sit too close to your face, they are more prone to fogging. Or consider low-cost adhesive silicone nose pads if the bridge is too wide, which allow for better airflow around your lenses.\u201d Layer up like a pro Dwayne Fields advises a merino wool base layer \u201cbecause it dries quickly, allows your body to breathe, but also traps a bit of air to keep you warm\u201d. On top of that, \u201ca relatively thin fleece mid-layer with a zip to control how much air goes in and out\u201d. Pick an outer layer with vents, \u201cso you can open those to adjust to your own liking\u201d. And before choosing a one-piece, like a ski suit, \u201cconsider how often you might need to go to the loo\u201d, says Fields. Live by this motto: Be Bold, Start Cold. \u201cIt\u2019s what I was told when I was doing my mountain-leader training. Go out in your fleece layer before putting on your outer layer, because after five or 10 minutes of some light activity, you\u2019ll find that actually, it\u2019s not that cold \u2013 what you were feeling was the difference between the temperature in the house and outside.\u201d Beat the rain in style When you neither want to look like a drowned rat nor an overheating sweaty mess, choosing the right winter jacket is essential. \u201cThe perfect winter coat must possess one characteristic,\u201d says Guardian fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley. \u201cI am not going to insult your intelligence by pointing out that it needs to be warm, nor remind you that it needs to be waterproof. The magic is finding a coat that looks great. We spend so much time in them that they become our personality through the most depressing months of the year. A chic, elegant, fabulous one will do as much for your wellbeing as a flu shot. I love Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s checked longline trench coat with wool (\u00a3109).\u201d Handle whatever the weather throws at you In the UK, we need a few key pieces to survive the daily smorgasbord of winter weather challenges. Cartner-Morley says: \u201cOne minute you\u2019re marching through wind and rain, the next jostling for oxygen on a packed train carriage. No one outfit will work for every moment, but key accessories will save your sanity.\u201d From top to toe, Cartner-Morley advises \u201ca waterproof scarf with integral hood\u201d such as a padded hybrid hooded scarf from Cos (\u00a365) and a pair of \u201csturdy, smart shoes that you can run from the bus to a meeting in. The Frankie chunky loafers by Office (\u00a365.99) have you covered, with a puddle-clearing chunky sole and retro tassel detail.\u201d Find a stylish boot \u201cA welly is practical, but unsuitable for the office, running errands or meeting someone for lunch,\u201d says the Guardian\u2019s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson, \u201cso I\u2019d recommend investing in Chelsea boots, such as the Grenson Milly (\u00a3380), which look great and will keep your feet bone dry, or Blundstone Chelsea (\u00a3210), which have sealed elastic seams to prevent even a drip of water getting in.\u201d For a slightly more affordable option, try the Tretorn boot from Arket (\u00a3145), which is \u201cmade from neoprene and rubber, so is a bit of a hybrid\u201d. \u2026 and a brolly that lasts Sick of your umbrella blowing inside out or collapsing? \u201cMy wet-weather game was hugely improved last year when my partner bought me an umbrella from London Undercover (\u00a339),\u201d says Wilkinson. \u201cSturdy, compact enough to fit in my bag and easily spotted thanks to the neon strap, it hasn\u2019t blown inside-out once.\u201d Remedy snagged tights \u201cA snag in your black opaques will quickly get worse if you don\u2019t address the problem immediately,\u201d warns Wilkinson, who always has a spare pair tucked in her handbag. \u201cDitto a bottle of clear nail varnish which, painted over the top, will stop ladders growing.\u201d However, her best tip is to \u201cinvest in a pair of ultimate opaque tights from Commando. They aren\u2019t cheap at \u00a340, but should last the season snag-free.\u201d Sidestep soggy trousers On those days when rain is coming in sideways, you need to up your trouser game. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Rains\u2019 waterproof trousers (\u00a365), which you could wear over your jeans for your commute, or on their own with a navy jumper and chunky black boots for instant Scandi cool,\u201d says Wilkinson. \u2026 and if all else fails Remember, it\u2019s only 124 days until spring.",

      "body": "<p>In the aftermath of a sudden eruption of violence or unrest, there is often a brief, vital window when the narrative about what actually happened is up for grabs. Last Friday, the day that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/nov/08/israeli-football-fans-attacked-match-amsterdam-video-report\">street violence</a> between Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans and local people in Amsterdam made headlines around the world \u2013 with reports of antisemitic <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgv4mdr9y8o\">\u201chit-and-run\u201d attacks</a> in the Dutch city \u2013 the decision of the Israeli state to <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/11/08/netanyahu-sends-rescue-planes-for-israeli-football-fans-in-amsterdam-after-violence-erupts_6732099_4.html\">send military planes</a> to airlift fans home, and of the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, to describe the events as an \u201cantisemitic pogrom\u201d, were crucial in cementing a particular story. So too were the words of the Dutch king, who said that his nation had \u201cfailed\u201d the Jewish community as it had during the second world war \u2013 when three-quarters of the Dutch Jewish population were murdered by the Nazis.</p> \n<p>But then, as more evidence emerged, a more complex picture came into view. It was revealed that from the night before the match onwards, hardline supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv \u2013 a club with a reputation for racism and hooliganism among some of its fans \u2013 had torn down a Palestinian flag from the facade of a building and burned it, <a href=\"https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/binnenland/artikel/5479291/hooligans-van-maccabi-tel-aviv-amsterdam-slaags-met\">attacked one taxi</a> with their belts, and vandalised others. Among the deplorable chants they saw fit to shout on the streets of Amsterdam, home to a large Muslim community, were: \u201cLet the IDF [Israeli army] win, we will fuck the Arabs\u201d, \u201cFuck you Palestine\u201d and \u201cWhy is there no school in Gaza? There are no children left there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Their words bring into focus the elephant in the room. Israel\u2019s brutal war in Gaza, which has now killed upwards of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker\">45,000 Palestinians</a>, mostly women and children, displaced most of the population and decimated the besieged territory with such ferocity as to render it uninhabitable. After a year in which many western politicians and commentators have seemed more concerned with, say, campus protests against the war than with the apocalyptic carnage in Gaza, historically illiterate pronunciations of a \u201cpogrom\u201d in the Dutch capital seemed to follow the same script: overlooking or downplaying Israeli violence.</p> \n<p>The worst manifestation of this was an Orwellian doublespeak in plain sight, when footage of Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters attacking local people near Amsterdam Central Station was captioned as the polar opposite: as a violent attack on Israeli Jews.

      "bodyText": "In the aftermath of a sudden eruption of violence or unrest, there is often a brief, vital window when the narrative about what actually happened is up for grabs. Last Friday, the day that street violence between Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans and local people in Amsterdam made headlines around the world \u2013 with reports of antisemitic \u201chit-and-run\u201d attacks in the Dutch city \u2013 the decision of the Israeli state to send military planes to airlift fans home, and of the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, to describe the events as an \u201cantisemitic pogrom\u201d, were crucial in cementing a particular story. So too were the words of the Dutch king, who said that his nation had \u201cfailed\u201d the Jewish community as it had during the second world war \u2013 when three-quarters of the Dutch Jewish population were murdered by the Nazis. But then, as more evidence emerged, a more complex picture came into view. It was revealed that from the night before the match onwards, hardline supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv \u2013 a club with a reputation for racism and hooliganism among some of its fans \u2013 had torn down a Palestinian flag from the facade of a building and burned it, attacked one taxi with their belts, and vandalised others. Among the deplorable chants they saw fit to shout on the streets of Amsterdam, home to a large Muslim community, were: \u201cLet the IDF [Israeli army] win, we will fuck the Arabs\u201d, \u201cFuck you Palestine\u201d and \u201cWhy is there no school in Gaza? There are no children left there.\u201d Their words bring into focus the elephant in the room. Israel\u2019s brutal war in Gaza, which has now killed upwards of 45,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, displaced most of the population and decimated the besieged territory with such ferocity as to render it uninhabitable. After a year in which many western politicians and commentators have seemed more concerned with, say, campus protests against the war than with the apocalyptic carnage in Gaza, historically illiterate pronunciations of a \u201cpogrom\u201d in the Dutch capital seemed to follow the same script: overlooking or downplaying Israeli violence. The worst manifestation of this was an Orwellian doublespeak in plain sight, when footage of Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters attacking local people near Amsterdam Central Station was captioned as the polar opposite: as a violent attack on Israeli Jews. (The Guardian made a correction to a package of video footage on Saturday 9 November.) The Dutch photographer who filmed these events is still imploring news sites to correct the error. Examining the issue in a segment dedicated to uncovering instances of fake news, France24 this Wednesday reported that the BBC, Wall Street Journal and CBS News were still running incorrectly captioned footage. What happened in Amsterdam \u2013 and, crucially, the media coverage and the political reactions \u2013 felt familiar, following the contours of our harmful and divisive conversations about antisemitism. Necessary rebuttals to prevailing one-sided portrayals sought to bring the overt anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism into view. But in doing so, the antisemitism that was one of the factors in the fray was often elided or glossed over. The initial, distorted coverage itself spawned an overcorrective, corralling us into polarised sides: either it was about thuggish anti-Palestinian hatred, or it was rampant antisemitism, but not both. Yet an appraisal more befitting a joined-up and coherent anti-racism would recognise that understandable hostility to the state of Israel during the ongoing war does sometimes get articulated through antisemitism, and expressed as violence. In Amsterdam, we saw this in the frightening invocation of a \u201cJew hunt\u201d in a chat coordinating an attack, and the use of a Dutch racial slur translating as \u201ccancer Jew\u201d; in the instances where people deemed to look Jewish were stopped and asked about their nationality, or allegedly forced to say \u201cFree Palestine\u201d in order to escape assault.

Having effectively received a global seal of approval for his hate- and bigotry-fuelled misreading of events, Wilders is now threatening to deport and strip the citizenship of those he deems to have instigated the violence: Dutch Moroccans. And so the far right\u2019s supposed concern about antisemitism is rerouted into using the power of the state to deprive another racialised other of citizenship. As for the Jewish and Muslim communities of Amsterdam, they have been left fearful, in shock and reeling from the repercussions of political forces intent on fomenting tensions in pursuit of a migrant- and Muslim-bashing agenda.

I&nbsp;say this as a kind of full disclosure announcement. Garth Gell in Snowdonia (or Eryri), works for me. Off-grid, off-wifi and awfully far from the bright lights.

I know there are people, and I\u2019m in close contact with some of them, who balk at the idea of a holiday that involves cooking their own food or washing up.

Those&nbsp;images had a formative effect on&nbsp;my idea of what makes the perfect winter cottage.</p> <p>At night outside Garth Gell, I can see one distant bulb. My partner, Sophie, confesses that arrival in such silent rural darkness always triggers irrational fears of mad axemen, a fear that I do my best to dispel, explaining that many brutal murders do not involve axes at all. We sit out on the stone bench under the stars. An owl hoots. Sophie begins to relax, but I&nbsp;don\u2019t suggest a ghost story \u2013 another great addition in a winter cottage.</p>    <p>Once we have established that there&nbsp;is nothing to fear, the next requirement for a winter cottage is definitely warmth. An Aga has the advantage of always being on, so those annoying folk \u2013 and I\u2019m one \u2013 who go through life opening windows and turning down thermostats are foiled. There is a slight planet-destroying aspect to all that oil-guzzling, but let\u2019s not be pernickety: in this instance, without mains electricity, gas or water, the household CO2 emissions are definitely well below average. That one&nbsp;warm kitchen works when the room is attractive and comfortable, and this one is: a cushioned settle down one side, scrubbed large table and plates on a dresser. Best of all is that the slabs of floor slate were clearly cleaved at the same time as Stonehenge was built and have been absorbing heat ever since. I walk around barefoot.</p> <p>Managing expectations with winter cottages is vital. An Aga and two log burners looks like belt and braces, but I&nbsp;have at times been misled by my own assumptions. When a friend offered to&nbsp;lend a cottage that was \u201cidyllic and remote, and we are going to do it up\u201d, I&nbsp;was so excited that I failed to register the&nbsp;all-important qualification, \u201c<em>going to</em>&nbsp;do it up\u201d and imagined my ideal: a cosy compilation of those Kristiansand homes and a forest cabin, where the mulled wine is warming on the range while outside the cold wind howls. My&nbsp;son and I trekked across the North York Moors in a snowstorm and arrived shivering to find a dodgy old kitchen range, draughty windows and a stock of damp firewood. We huddled in our sleeping bags round a&nbsp;faltering flame. The bottle of wine remained frozen solid.</p>    <p>If location and cosy warmth can be guaranteed, however, the next thing is&nbsp;to take a good look around the place. Somewhere inside that cottage, if it\u2019s worth its salt, will be the key to forging fantastic memories. One glance inside Garth Gell is enough to know that such&nbsp;a key must exist inside. I bang out&nbsp;a&nbsp;few chords on the guitar, it\u2019s not that; I&nbsp;read a couple of local guidebooks, no&nbsp;bells ring; I look through the pile of&nbsp;board games, nothing jumps out. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;take my head torch and search.</p> <p>The trick is to be open-minded. Some years ago on a US road trip, we trekked out to a cabin in Montana\u2019s Crazy Mountains. It was 19 miles from tarmac and 26 from the nearest shop, where they sold guns, ammunition and whistles that made duck noises. I&nbsp;asked the owner about bears. How best to deal with them? He eyed Sophie and our daughter, Maddy, critically. \u201cMake sure that you ain\u2019t the slowest runner.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Stretched out below us is all the riches we could want, the hammered gold of the Mawddach estuary and the Irish Sea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The mountain cabin was simple. In&nbsp;fact, the&nbsp;only luxury item was a battery-powered DVD player that had one disc in it, but we scorned such gadgetry, we were here for the complete backwoods experience, not Hollywood fakery. Maddy and I tried fly-fishing in the river and caught nothing. That night we played cards and next day we fished, failing miserably once again. After two more nights of cards, we gave in and watched the DVD. It was Robert Redford\u2019s A River Runs Through It, a tale of fly fishing in the great American wilderness. In one scene the&nbsp;two heroes sneer at some hapless loser who fishes with worms. Next morning Maddy and I tried worms and&nbsp;caught three beautiful big trout for&nbsp;dinner. The key to great memories, you see, is up on that high shelf.</p>    <p>In Garth Gell I find lots of those two-and-sixpence Penguin novels whose orange spines always pull me in. Among them I spot The Treasure of&nbsp;the Sierra Madre, a 1927 adventure story by the mysterious Bruno Traven. I might have ignored this volume except for having just read in the notes&nbsp;that Garth Gell is built on top of&nbsp;Wales\u2019s long-defunct gold seam. The Romans probably took the best of&nbsp;it, but there was a brief goldrush in the 1860s. I take down the book and am immediately hooked. Traven\u2019s stark tale of the hunt for gold and its&nbsp;effect on his trio of characters (Humphrey Bogart plays the worst of them, Dobbs, in the classic 1948 film) becomes the mood music of my stay.</p> <p>We hike uphill and inspect old mine workings. I search through piles of stones for lost nuggets, hissing, Gollum-like, \u201cCome here, my precious\u201d, then try panning in the river, inexplicably without success. Finally, we yomp to the top of Diffwys (750 metres), and at last strike pay dirt. There, stretched out below us is all the riches we could want, the hammered gold of the Mawddach estuary and the Irish Sea. We come down the ridge in gathering cloud, cross valleys where hidden streams gurgle, and finally spot our cottage. It&nbsp;looks, I have to say, just about perfect.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The stay was provided by <a href=\"https://www.kiphideaways.com/\">Kip H</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.kiphideaways.com/hideaways/garth-gell-farmhouse/\">ideaways</a></em><em>, which has </em><em>several&nbsp;properties in </em><em>north Wales.

If location and cosy warmth can be guaranteed, however, the next thing is to take a good look around the place. Somewhere inside that cottage, if it\u2019s worth its salt, will be the key to forging fantastic memories. One glance inside Garth Gell is enough to know that such a key must exist inside. I bang out a few chords on the guitar, it\u2019s not that; I read a couple of local guidebooks, no bells ring; I look through the pile of board games, nothing jumps out. So I take my head torch and search. The trick is to be open-minded. Some years ago on a US road trip, we trekked out to a cabin in Montana\u2019s Crazy Mountains. It was 19 miles from tarmac and 26 from the nearest shop, where they sold guns, ammunition and whistles that made duck noises. I asked the owner about bears. How best to deal with them? He eyed Sophie and our daughter, Maddy, critically. \u201cMake sure that you ain\u2019t the slowest runner.\u201d The mountain cabin was simple. In fact, the only luxury item was a battery-powered DVD player that had one disc in it, but we scorned such gadgetry, we were here for the complete backwoods experience, not Hollywood fakery. Maddy and I tried fly-fishing in the river and caught nothing. That night we played cards and next day we fished, failing miserably once again. After two more nights of cards, we gave in and watched the DVD. It was Robert Redford\u2019s A River Runs Through It, a tale of fly fishing in the great American wilderness. In one scene the two heroes sneer at some hapless loser who fishes with worms. Next morning Maddy and I tried worms and caught three beautiful big trout for dinner. The key to great memories, you see, is up on that high shelf. In Garth Gell I find lots of those two-and-sixpence Penguin novels whose orange spines always pull me in. Among them I spot The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, a 1927 adventure story by the mysterious Bruno Traven. I might have ignored this volume except for having just read in the notes that Garth Gell is built on top of Wales\u2019s long-defunct gold seam. The Romans probably took the best of it, but there was a brief goldrush in the 1860s. I take down the book and am immediately hooked. Traven\u2019s stark tale of the hunt for gold and its effect on his trio of characters (Humphrey Bogart plays the worst of them, Dobbs, in the classic 1948 film) becomes the mood music of my stay. We hike uphill and inspect old mine workings. I search through piles of stones for lost nuggets, hissing, Gollum-like, \u201cCome here, my precious\u201d, then try panning in the river, inexplicably without success. Finally, we yomp to the top of Diffwys (750 metres), and at last strike pay dirt. There, stretched out below us is all the riches we could want, the hammered gold of the Mawddach estuary and the Irish Sea. We come down the ridge in gathering cloud, cross valleys where hidden streams gurgle, and finally spot our cottage. It looks, I have to say, just about perfect. \u2022 The stay was provided by Kip Hideaways, which has several properties in north Wales. Garth Gell sleeps six, from \u00a3240 a night (minimum four-night stay)",

They moved to Durban the next year, attending a branch of the now-defunct evangelical His People church.</p> <p>Smyth was a respected church elder, giving theological advice to university students.</p> <p>\u201cNothing about his past, in terms of the scandals, was known,\u201d said a former church member who was a student at the time. \u201cHe was strict, [but] approachable. And the context was this is somebody really important, the church holds him in such high regard.\u201d</p> <p>After a few years, the Smyths moved to Cape Town. In 2013, the then bishop of Ely, Stephen Conway, wrote to the now-retired bishop of Table Bay, Garth Counsell, to warn him about Smyth.</p> <p>Counsell was told by St Martin\u2019s Church in Bergvliet that Smyth had worshipped there for \u201ca year or two when he came to Cape Town\u201d, the archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba, said in a <a href=\"https://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2024/11/statement-to-south-african-media-on.html\">statement</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSt Martin\u2019s reported that Smyth neither counselled young people, nor were any allegations of abuse or grooming made against Smyth by any member. I became aware of the matter in 2017, when Channel 4 in the UK broadcast an expose of Smyth\u2019s abuse.</p> <p>\u201cSince no allegations of abuse within the jurisdiction of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa were made, and Smyth had not been worshipping at an Anglican Church in South Africa for many years, no disciplinary action by the church or criminal complaint to the police was possible,\u201d he said, adding that Zimbabwe did not fall within his archdiocese.</p> <p>Makgoba said the church was seeking legal advice about setting up an inquiry into \u201cwhether the Diocese of Cape Town, and I personally, have acted in this matter in accordance with our obligations to keep our members safe.\u201d</p> <p>In February 2017, after the Channel 4 expose, Smyth was expelled from the non-Anglican church he and his wife were attending, Church On Main.</p> <p>The church <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/09/john-smyth-accused-of-heavy-handed-leadership-at-cape-town-church\">said at the time</a> that Smyth had been taking showers with young men and asking them unprompted about masturbation and pornography, but that there was no evidence of any crimes or physical contact.</p>",

The following day, he joined the queue nude. \u201cIt was horrendous,\u201d Leanders said. \u201c[Church of England leaders] categorically should have done more after the initial atrocities were reported prior to Smyth being exported with open arms to perpetrate the same things in Zimbabwe. \u201cThe church is directly responsible for my abuse as a 15-year-old boy.\u201d In December 1992, 16-year-old Guide Nyachuru was found drowned in a swimming pool the morning after skinny dipping at a camp. Smyth later called it an \u201cunfortunate incident\u201d. Smyth was charged in Zimbabwe in 1995 with culpable homicide and assaulting boys, including Leanders and his brother. The trial started in 1997, but collapsed when Smyth\u2019s team successfully argued the prosecutor had a conflict of interest. For Nyachuru\u2019s family, the pain is still immense. \u201cWe need closure as a family. We want to know how he died. We want to know if he was beaten to death,\u201d said Edith Nyachuru, his sister. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell my mum because this will hurt her again.\u201d \u201cWhy was he allowed to be in camps abusing vulnerable children?\u201d she said. \u201cAbuse is abuse whether in Zimbabwe, the UK or in Australia.\u201d The fact that corporal punishment was then common and legal in Zimbabwe and the reluctance of parents to embroil their children in court cases contributed to Smyth being able to abuse boys in Zimbabwe for so long, said David Coltart, the mayor of Bulawayo. Coltart, then a lawyer, was commissioned by a group of Bulawayo parents, including Leanders\u2019, and pastors to investigate Smyth\u2019s abuses: \u201cHe was a pretty arrogant British barrister, Queen\u2019s counsel and fairly aggressive \u2026 He threatened the pastors and parents with defamation actions.\u201d In 2001, Smyth and his wife, Anne, who Leanders said was on site at the camp, were barred from re-entering Zimbabwe. They moved to Durban the next year, attending a branch of the now-defunct evangelical His People church. Smyth was a respected church elder, giving theological advice to university students. \u201cNothing about his past, in terms of the scandals, was known,\u201d said a former church member who was a student at the time. \u201cHe was strict, [but] approachable. And the context was this is somebody really important, the church holds him in such high regard.\u201d After a few years, the Smyths moved to Cape Town. In 2013, the then bishop of Ely, Stephen Conway, wrote to the now-retired bishop of Table Bay, Garth Counsell, to warn him about Smyth. Counsell was told by St Martin\u2019s Church in Bergvliet that Smyth had worshipped there for \u201ca year or two when he came to Cape Town\u201d, the archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba, said in a statement. \u201cSt Martin\u2019s reported that Smyth neither counselled young people, nor were any allegations of abuse or grooming made against Smyth by any member. I became aware of the matter in 2017, when Channel 4 in the UK broadcast an expose of Smyth\u2019s abuse. \u201cSince no allegations of abuse within the jurisdiction of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa were made, and Smyth had not been worshipping at an Anglican Church in South Africa for many years, no disciplinary action by the church or criminal complaint to the police was possible,\u201d he said, adding that Zimbabwe did not fall within his archdiocese. Makgoba said the church was seeking legal advice about setting up an inquiry into \u201cwhether the Diocese of Cape Town, and I personally, have acted in this matter in accordance with our obligations to keep our members safe.\u201d In February 2017, after the Channel 4 expose, Smyth was expelled from the non-Anglican church he and his wife were attending, Church On Main. The church said at the time that Smyth had been taking showers with young men and asking them unprompted about masturbation and pornography, but that there was no evidence of any crimes or physical contact.",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has hailed \u201cinclusive trade and investment\u201d at a major Asia-Pacific economic forum in Peru where leaders are attempting to push against the protectionist policies favoured by US president-elect Donald Trump. Speaking at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders summit, which assembles 21 of the world\u2019s largest economies, Albanese told a press conference that Apec leaders consistently \u201cspoke about the importance of free and fair trade between our economies to lift up the living standards of people throughout this region\u201d. Albanese met the Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto, and Peruvian president, Dina Boluarte, on the sidelines of the summit in Lima as he attempted to promote and bolster Australia\u2019s trade interests ahead of Trump\u2019s return. Albanese also said he had a \u201cfriendly\u201d private discussion with the US president, Joe Biden, at the meeting who he said was \u201cin good form\u201d, while Albanese confirmed he did not speak to China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cI met with the Apec Business Advisory Council representatives, speaking about inclusive trade and investment, \u201d Albanese said. Asked about work to lift trade tariffs with China, Albanese said: \u201cI\u2019m not a commentator \u2026 but what I\u2019ve done with China is work in the way that we said we would before the election.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s coal, barley, wine, other products, including seafood and others, people are in employment in Australia today because of our trade,\u201d he said. The Australian Institute of International Affairs\u2019 chief executive, Bryce Wakefield, said \u201cthe election of Donald Trump has overshadowed everything\u201d at the forum. \u201c[Biden] is sort of a mega lame-duck president because not only is he going out of office, but the president following him, it\u2019s clear that his policies are going to be starkly different to Biden\u2019s,\u201d Wakefield said. Trump has flagged tariffs on imports to the US of between 10 and 20%, and up to 60% on Chinese goods. That has led nations to pivot their trade priorities, including potential shifts towards China but also among the middle nations in the region. \u201cYou can predict a lot more coordination between mid-sized economies as they attempt to diversify their relations away from the United States during such a fraught period,\u201d Wakefield said. Despite that, Australian trade might benefit should the incoming president scrap his predecessor\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which encourages green energy investment in the US. \u201cA lot of that investment may now be redirected towards countries with resources that are crucial to the green economy, and Australia is one of those countries with important resources like lithium that are used in batteries.\u201d Australia would be pushing to liberalise trade through measures such as digitising trade documents to increase efficiency, promoting its green agricultural products and building on trade cooperation, former trade minister and Australian Apec Study Centre director Craig Emerson said. \u201cWe are great champions of free and open trade, and it gives Australia an opportunity to reaffirm that,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s acting prime minister and minister for defence, Richard Marles, will host Japan\u2019s minister of defence, Gen Nakatani, and US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, for the 14th trilateral defence ministers\u2019 meeting on Sunday in Darwin. The ministers and secretary will discuss cooperation through exercises and operations, shared strategic capabilities, science and technology and defence industry cooperation. \u201c\u201cI am honoured to welcome Minister Nakatani and Secretary Austin \u2026 I look forward to discussing defence cooperation with two of our closest partners,\u201d Marles said.",

(Moore won by third-round knockout.)</p> <p>Paul, who tipped the scales at a career-high 227.2lbs at yesterday\u2019s weigh-in, will enjoy advantages in height (three inches) and reach (five inches). Tyson came in at 228.4lbs. That\u2019s about 10lbs heavier than his fighting weight during his imperial era (1987-89), but about 10lbs lighter than his career high of 239.75lbs for his 2001 fight with Brian Nielsen in Copenhagen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/tale-of-the-tape/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;title-a=Jake%20Paul&amp;description-a=Cleveland%2C%20Ohio%2C%20USA&amp;image-a=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F215086214ab0a696e4d352f0cbf18cc541b097f4%3Fcrop%3D875_71_651_651&amp;colour-a=Blue&amp;title-b=Mike%20Tyson&amp;description-b=Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York%2C%20USA&amp;image-b=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ffa756cd16fa0786723633a2dd7264d4d5a24f0b3%3Fcrop%3D287_124_1890_1890&amp;colour-b=Red&amp;row-1-label=Age&amp;row-1-value-a=27&amp;row-1-value-b=58&amp;row-2-label=W%2FL%2FD&amp;row-2-value-a=10%2F1%2F0&amp;row-2-value-b=50%2F6%2F0&amp;row-3-label=Knockouts&amp;row-3-value-a=7&amp;row-3-value-b=44&amp;row-4-label=Rounds%20boxed&amp;row-4-value-a=52&amp;row-4-value-b=215&amp;row-5-label=Height&amp;row-5-value-a=6ft%201in&amp;row-5-value-b=5ft%2010in&amp;row-6-label=Weight&amp;row-6-value-a=227.2lbs&amp;row-6-value-b=228.4lbs&amp;row-7-label=Reach&amp;row-7-value-a=76in&amp;row-7-value-b=71in&amp;row-8-label=Stance&amp;row-8-value-a=Orthodox&amp;row-8-value-b=Orthodox&amp;source=BoxRec\" data-alt=\"Tale of the tape: Jake Paul v Mike Tyson\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/tale-of-the-tape/index.html?opinion-tint=false&title-a=Jake%20Paul&description-a=Cleveland%2C%20Ohio%2C%20USA&image-a=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F215086214ab0a696e4d352f0cbf18cc541b097f4%3Fcrop%3D875_71_651_651&colour-a=Blue&title-b=Mike%20Tyson&description-b=Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York%2C%20USA&image-b=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ffa756cd16fa0786723633a2dd7264d4d5a24f0b3%3Fcrop%3D287_124_1890_1890&colour-b=Red&row-1-label=Age&row-1-value-a=27&row-1-value-b=58&row-2-label=W%2FL%2FD&row-2-value-a=10%2F1%2F0&row-2-value-b=50%2F6%2F0&row-3-label=Knockouts&row-3-value-a=7&row-3-value-b=44&row-4-label=Rounds%20boxed&row-4-value-a=52&row-4-value-b=215&row-5-label=Height&row-5-value-a=6ft%201in&row-5-value-b=5ft%2010in&row-6-label=Weight&row-6-value-a=227.2lbs&row-6-value-b=228.4lbs&row-7-label=Reach&row-7-value-a=76in&row-7-value-b=71in&row-8-label=Stance&row-8-value-a=Orthodox&row-8-value-b=Orthodox&source=BoxRec\">Interactive</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6737c25c8f087357b4829c6f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-16T04:39:56.651Z\">4.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>How much are Tyson and Paul getting paid for this?</strong> It\u2019s another one of the most frequently asked questions around tonight\u2019s event. It has been rumored that Paul will earn $40m (\u00a331.6m) for Friday\u2019s event while Tyson is said to be making $20m (\u00a315.8m). </p> <p>Taylor will reportedly bring in $6.1m (\u00a34.8m) for her co-feature rematch with Serrano, whose takehome is thought to be around $8m (\u00a36.3m). That would be an extraordinary come-up for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/amanda-serrano-ready-for-crowning-glory-in-historic-duel-katie-taylor\">Nuyorican seven-weight champion</a>, who once was paid $1,500 for a world title defense. And good lordy, did they earn every last penny.</p> <p>We tried to confirm these figures on Thursday with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR), the state commission regulating the card, but they denied our open records request under the Texas Public Information Act (PIA) for the pay sheet in the fight contract and referred us to the promoters. The rumors must suffice for now.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6737c76c8f08916386e22ff5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-16T04:32:03.639Z\">4.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Next up is the main event: Jake Paul v Mike Tyson.</strong> There\u2019s still <em>so</em> much to unpack from that instant classic between Taylor and Serrano, but the card doesn\u2019t stop for us to catch our breath and we\u2019ll pass along Donald McRae\u2019s ringside report as soon as it\u2019s published. </p> <p>Tyson has not been in the mood for trash talk in the final run-up to tonight\u2019s fight. He\u2019s maintained a stoic quietude throughout the events of fight week (with the occasional exception), which at times has frustrated Paul. Here\u2019s McRae\u2019s dispatch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3g-W7v-52Q\">from the final press conference</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Paul was frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s cute,\u201d he initially said of Tyson\u2019s reticence. But then the YouTuber declared: \u201cI fear no man. I want him to be that old savage Mike \u2026 I want there to be no excuses when I knock him out.\u201d</p> <p>Paul then complained directly to Tyson: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shit-talk online saying you\u2019re going to kill me, and just nothing in person. Is that what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p> <p>Tyson shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just ready.\u201d</p> <p>Paul looked irate. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty fucking boring,\u201d he whined.</p> <p>He rose from his seat to challenge the fighters on the undercard who had picked Tyson to beat him. Nine of those 12 fighters sided with Tyson and Paul goaded many of them into taking bets on the outcome.</p> <p>Tyson knows that, closing on 60 and having been out of the ring so long, none of this matters. He has little left but so many terrible things have happened in his life, or been meted out to others by him, that there is nothing new to say. He sank deeper into silence.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/15/silence-before-the-charade-tyson-lets-money-talk-before-fight-with-paul\">Silence before the charade: Tyson lets money talk before fight with Paul</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67381e768f08916386e23196\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-16T04:24:28.758Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u201cEveryone said the judges was going to be a little shady, but listen, I came here, I chose to be great,\u201d Serrano says.</strong> \u201cI went up three divisions.

Their knockout percentages make it clear this is a match between the fighter and the boxer: Serrano has stopped 62% of her opponents inside the distance compared to 25% for Taylor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/tale-of-the-tape/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;title-a=Katie%20Taylor&amp;description-a=Bray%2C%20Ireland&amp;image-a=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F8ae5539fd9a2fd57001c9b7729901171b4663f7d%3Fcrop%3D1767_404_1141_1140&amp;colour-a=Blue&amp;title-b=Amanda%20Serrano&amp;description-b=Carolina%2C%20Puerto%20Rico&amp;image-b=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fe2675644b741a4f5e214252bf913ed20f0ce6892%3Fcrop%3D1205_176_667_667&amp;colour-b=Red&amp;row-1-label=Age&amp;row-1-value-a=38&amp;row-1-value-b=36&amp;row-2-label=W%2FL%2FD&amp;row-2-value-a=23%2F1%2F0&amp;row-2-value-b=47%2F2%2F1&amp;row-3-label=Knockouts&amp;row-3-value-a=6&amp;row-3-value-b=31&amp;row-4-label=Rounds%20boxed&amp;row-4-value-a=204&amp;row-4-value-b=236&amp;row-5-label=Height&amp;row-5-value-a=5ft%205in%20&amp;row-5-value-b=5ft%205%C2%BDin&amp;row-6-label=Weight&amp;row-6-value-a=137.4lbs&amp;row-6-value-b=137.4lbs&amp;row-7-label=Reach&amp;row-7-value-a=66in&amp;row-7-value-b=65%C2%BDin&amp;row-8-label=Stance&amp;row-8-value-a=Orthodox&amp;row-8-value-b=Southpaw&amp;source=BoxRec\" data-alt=\"Tale of the tape: Katie Taylor v Amanda Serrano\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/tale-of-the-tape/index.html?opinion-tint=false&title-a=Katie%20Taylor&description-a=Bray%2C%20Ireland&image-a=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F8ae5539fd9a2fd57001c9b7729901171b4663f7d%3Fcrop%3D1767_404_1141_1140&colour-a=Blue&title-b=Amanda%20Serrano&description-b=Carolina%2C%20Puerto%20Rico&image-b=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fe2675644b741a4f5e214252bf913ed20f0ce6892%3Fcrop%3D1205_176_667_667&colour-b=Red&row-1-label=Age&row-1-value-a=38&row-1-value-b=36&row-2-label=W%2FL%2FD&row-2-value-a=23%2F1%2F0&row-2-value-b=47%2F2%2F1&row-3-label=Knockouts&row-3-value-a=6&row-3-value-b=31&row-4-label=Rounds%20boxed&row-4-value-a=204&row-4-value-b=236&row-5-label=Height&row-5-value-a=5ft%205in%20&row-5-value-b=5ft%205%C2%BDin&row-6-label=Weight&row-6-value-a=137.4lbs&row-6-value-b=137.4lbs&row-7-label=Reach&row-7-value-a=66in&row-7-value-b=65%C2%BDin&row-8-label=Stance&row-8-value-a=Orthodox&row-8-value-b=Southpaw&source=BoxRec\">Interactive</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6737f6548f08462ddd0c5f61\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-16T03:21:31.509Z\">3.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The stars are out in Big D!</strong> It might not be Frank Sinatra in the photo pit at Madison Square Garden for the first Ali-Frazier scrap.

At stake: the undisputed women\u2019s super lightweight championship held by Taylor, the 2012 Olympic gold medalist widely regarded as one of the greatest female boxers to ever take up the gloves. </p> <p>It was the night that women\u2019s boxing has desperately sought and deserved for years: the first summit meeting between the consensus No 1 and No 2 on the men\u2019s or women\u2019s pound-for-pound list since the second fight between Manny Pacquiao and Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez in 2008. Organizers planned for a crowd of about 10,000, then were forced to reconfigure the seating to open the entire arena due to unanticipated demand. In the end Taylor and Serrano became the first women to headline a boxing event at the storied venue.</p> <p>And the fight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/30/katie-taylorn-amanda-serrano\">managed to exceed the breathless hype</a> that preceded it.

He definitely hasn\u2019t lived the cleanest life since then but I think over the last few years he\u2019s cleaned himself up. We\u2019re hoping that shows through on the night, but he obviously has amazing experience and nothing is going to faze Mike Tyson.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor is an ambassador for the old-school boxing company, Everlast, which has been making fight clothing and equipment since 1910, and aligns herself firmly with traditionalists of the ring. Taylor clearly loves the sport with an enduring fervour and sounds hopeful when I ask if Tyson could beat his much younger rival. \u201cI think so. I\u2019ve seen clips of him training recently and he looks very good on the pads. But Jake is a fit man, a young man and a good athlete as well. He seems to have an OK punch and he\u2019s starting to prove himself as a fighter. It\u2019s very interesting, but I have a real soft spot for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mike-tyson\">Mike Tyson</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI think if you\u2019re a boxing person, it really matters that he does well and hopefully wins because Mike Tyson is an absolute legend in sport. He was once known as the baddest man on the planet. He\u2019s super exciting to watch, a real iconic boxer. I have so much respect for him for what he did in the sport and I\u2019d hate for a legend like him to lose a matchup like this.

It sells a myth that wasn\u2019t even close to being a reality in 2004, let alone 2024: namely that Tyson is one of the most ferocious warriors alive, not a 58-year-old who lost 26lb in May after an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/31/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-postponed-taylor-serrano\">ulcer flare-up</a> that left him throwing up blood and defecating tar. It risks Tyson\u2019s boxing reputation and his health. And, Netflix\u2019s lavish promotion aside, it feels more like a sham or a circus than a genuine sporting event.</p> <p>But I may be wrong. Certainly [legendary British publicist Mark] Borkowksi thinks so. He believes the fight is straight out of the playbook of PT Barnum, the greatest showman of all and a curator of the absurd and extraordinary, who instinctively knew what the public wanted long before they did. And that it will cut through to the masses.</p> <p>\u201cBarnum understood how to engage the crowd \u2013 the great herd, the great unwashed,\u201d he says. \u201cThis fight is about opportunism. It\u2019s about creative thinking. And it is already generating the oxygen of publicity, which is always an indication that something is going to be very successful.\u201d</p> <p>As Borkowski points out, it taps into two big markets: Boomers and Gen Xers, who grew up watching Tyson, as well as the younger generations who worship Jake Paul, many of whom will want to watch.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people, particularly boys, project themselves into male influencers like Paul,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways, they are their best mates \u2013 whether it\u2019s watching them play Call of Duty, or seeing the Jackass-influenced generation of pranksters doing outrageous things on social. So they will be watching this. And so will those who grew up with Tyson in his prime. So while purists might sneer, there\u2019s a market for this.

Like Bryan, I was at Madison Square Garden in April 2022 when they produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/30/katie-taylorn-amanda-serrano\">one of the great fights in recent memory</a>. The atmosphere in the Garden that night was incredible, as the Puerto Rican and Irish fans whipped up an exhilarating racket that matched the fight itself.</p> <p>My memory might be playing tricks and perhaps it was pretty quiet two hours before Serrano and Taylor fought in the Garden. But I seem to remember that the joint was jumping with anticipation all through the build-up.</p> <p>Here in the AT&amp;T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys of course, the mood is a mellow hum. People seem chilled out and the arena is about a quarter full at the moment. But, so far, there is no real sign of any influx of Taylor supporters either from Ireland or across America. There are also no songs or chants from either the Irish or Puerto Rican contingents. I am sure they will arrive in full voice soon, but most people I\u2019ve seen look like they\u2019re here for the circus of Jake Paul and Mike Tyson.</p> <p>But give it another two hours and I think this stunning stadium will be so much noisier and more fevered than it is now \u2026</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-16T01:29:39.971Z\">at 1.29am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6737f4648f08916386e230f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-16T01:26:06.155Z\">1.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Time for some boxing.</strong> India\u2019s Neeraj Goyat and Brazil\u2019s Whindersson Nunes have made their way to the ring for a six-round middleweight fight following a flashy performance by the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders to AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6737f1118f08916386e230e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-16T01:15:49.396Z\">1.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far. </strong>Let\u2019s do a little housekeeping before going any further and pass along the results from the non-televised undercard. We\u2019ve had three fights so far before a mostly empty AT&amp;T Stadium crowd:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Bruce \u2018Shu Shu\u2019 Carrington</strong>, a blue-chip featherweight prospect from Brooklyn signed with Top Rank Promotions, improved to 14 wins in 14 fights with an eight-round unanimous-decision win over late replacement <strong>Dana Coolwell</strong>. The Brownsville native dropped his opponent two times including in the final round, but Coolwell beat the count and made it to the final bell. Carrington won in a complete shutout with all three ringside judges handing down scores of 80-70.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Lucas Bahdi</strong> moved closer to a world title shot after the unbeaten lightweight prospect handed Italy\u2019s <strong>Armando Casamonica</strong> his first defeat with a disputed majority-decision win in a closer-than-expected 10-rounder. The heavy-handed Canadian was met with stiff resistance by the late replacement Casamonica, who took the fight on 10 days\u2019 notice when Corey Marksman dropped out with a training injury. One judge had it a reasonable 95-95 while the other two handed down risible scores of 96-93 and 98-92 for Bahdi.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Shadasia Green</strong>, the former basketball player from Patterson, New Jersey, is a world champion at the second time of asking after winning a razor-thin 10-round split decision over Toronto\u2019s <strong>Melinda Watpool</strong> for the WBO women\u2019s super middleweight championship. Two of the three judges scored it for the 35-year-old known as the Sweet Terminator, overruling the third who had it 96-94 for Watpool in a fight where there was little to separate the two. Green had falled short in her first title shot last year, dropping a unanimous decision to Franchon Crews Dezurn for the vacant WBC strap.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6735acf08f08fc3bf2f7f5b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-16T00:46:03.358Z\">12.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hello and welcome to AT&amp;T Stadium for a night at the fights unlike any we can immediately remember.</strong> Mike Tyson is ending a 7,097-day layoff from professional fighting to face the boxer-influencer Jake Paul in a non-title heavyweight bout scheduled for eight rounds at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.</p> <p>If you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s unlikely Tyson needs any introduction. In 1986, at 20 years old, the Brooklyn native became the youngest heavyweight champion in history, laying waste <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OfkdOcU0Q\">to Trevor Berbick inside two rounds</a> to win the World Boxing Council title. After unifying the other major title belts, the nominal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaqfd0h2bZQ\">Baddest Man on the Planet</a> made six defenses of the undisputed heavyweight championship before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QZowFD8Zzk\">losing in a historic upset</a> to James \u2018Buster\u2019 Douglas by 10th-round knockout in February 1990. Convicted of rape in 1992 and sentenced to six years in prison, Tyson served three years before being released on parole and was never again the same destructive force, closing his professional ledger with six wins and five defeats with two no-contests.</p> <p>While Tyson remains one of the most recognizable people in the world nearly two decades after his last official fight, there are few people under the age of 30 who don\u2019t know Paul. After cultivating an enormous public profile on Vine and YouTube alongside elder brother Logan, the Cleveland native has managed to develop into a competent boxer since taking up the sport and turning professional in 2020. He\u2019s had 11 paying fights since then, mostly against former mixed martial arts fighters and journeyman boxers with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/nov/28/mike-tyson-v-roy-jones-jr-boxing-exhibition-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-5fc31f908f087d8bdb349e29#block-5fc31f908f087d8bdb349e29\">the odd retired NBA player</a> thrown in. His lone setback <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/26/tommy-fury-edges-youtuber-turned-boxer-jake-paul-by-split-decision\">came by split decision to Tommy Fury</a> last year, but he\u2019s won four on the trot since then including a July knockout of Mike Perry, a veteran of the MMA and bare-knuckle boxing circuits.</p> <p>Some have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/11/mike-tyson-v-jake-paul-this-is-the-apex-event-of-content-masquerading-as-sport-boxing-ufc\">called it a circus</a>. But with two world title fights on the TV undercard, including Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in a hotly anticipated rematch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/taylor-v-serrano-delivers-on-the-breathless-hype-to-join-boxing-classics\">of their 2022 classic</a>, there\u2019s plenty of value on offer for viewers who aren\u2019t keen on watching two men with 31 years between them exchange leather.</p> <p>The live Netflix broadcast starts in 15 minutes and there will be three preliminary bouts ahead of the main event.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to read Donald McRae\u2019s report from ringside at AT&amp;T Stadium. Mike Tyson\u2019s professional boxing record drops to 50 wins and seven losses with two no-contests. But will it stay that way for good? Surprisingly, the 58-year-old is not so sure. Asked whether he\u2019s officially finished with boxing, Tyson pauses before saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then he adds: \u201cIt depends on the situation.\u201d Pressed on the question, to say what his gut tells him right now, Tyson says: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Asked what situation might bring him back for a 60th professional fight, Tyson looks over Jake Paul\u2019s shouder at his brother Logan. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Tyson says. \u201cMaybe his brother.\u201d Almost as if on cue, Logan Paul\u2019s eyes go wide: \u201cMotherfucker. I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Good lord. It\u2019s like if Platoon had a post-credits scene teasing the sequel. \u201cHe\u2019s exactly what I thought,\u201d says Paul when he\u2019s asked whether Tyson was better than he\u2019d anticipated. \u201cOne of the greatest to ever do it. He\u2019s an icon. He\u2019s a legend. But this night\u2019s not about me, man. I wanted to give a thanks to all the real heroes, the US military, the doctors, the nurses in the ER, the cops, the firefighters, the farmers, the truck drivers, all the people who make this world go right. Thank you, America. It\u2019s the era of truth. It\u2019s the era of good. There\u2019s a shift in the world, and good is rising.\u201d Tyson is asked about the brace on his right knee, specifically whether he was dealing with an injury going into the fight. \u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t use that for excuses,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I did, I wouldn\u2019t be in there.\u201d He is then asked about why he persisted in gnawing at his glove throughout the fight during breaks in the action. \u201cI have a habit of biting my gloves when I fight, yes,\u201d he says. When asked why, his response prompts audible laugher from the crowd: \u201cI have a biting fixation.\u201d \u201cFirst and foremost, Mike Tyson: It\u2019s such an honor,\u201d Jake Paul says. \u201cLet\u2019s give it up for Mike. Bro, this is ... he\u2019s a legend. He\u2019s the greatest to ever do it. He\u2019s the Goat. I look up to him, I\u2019m inspired by him and we wouldn\u2019t be here today without him. This man is an icon and it\u2019s just an honor to be able to fight him. And he\u2019s obviously the toughest, baddest man on the planet.\u201d Tyson is asked whether he\u2019s happy with his performance (he is) and whether he\u2019s surprised it went the distance: \u201cNo. I knew he was a good fighter. I knew he was prepared. But I came to fight.\u201d Asked whether he felt he proved his doubters wrong, Tyson disputes the premise. \u201cI didn\u2019t prove nothing to anybody, only to myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those guys that looks to please the world. I\u2019m just happy with what I can do.\u201d To no one\u2019s surprise Jake Paul has beaten Mike Tyson by an eight-round unanimous decision. Ringside judges Laurence Cole and Jesse Reyes handed down scores of 79-73, while David Iacobucci had it an 80-72 shutout (as did the Guardian). Round 8 The fighters touch gloves at the center of the ring to start the eighth and final round. Paul throws six straight jabs, landing most of the them, but not firing punches with killer instinct. Mercy? Paul floating soft jabs over the final minute, one after another, carrying his 58-year-old foe through the tape. Jake Paul might not be undefeated, but Father Time certainly is. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Paul 10-9 Tyson (Paul 80-72 Tyson) Round 7 Tyson showing flashes of life at the start of the seventh but the burst is short-lived. Paul simply going through the motions now. The audience is unhappy, with audible booing from pockets of the crowd. One more round of this. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Paul 10-9 Tyson (Paul 70-63 Tyson) Round 6 Paul\u2019s hands are low in these exchanges but it probably doesn\u2019t matter. He looks as loose and confident as ever, peppering away from the outside and seemingly content to box to a points win. A very low-activity round for Paul but Tyson, having trouble with his balance, either won\u2019t or can\u2019t let his hands go. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Paul 10-9 Tyson (Paul 60-54 Tyson) Round 5 Paul is boxing nicely against the opponent in front of him. He lands a one-two combination upstairs. Tyson can\u2019t do much of anything; he looks lost under the lights. The Compubox punch statistics won\u2019t be kind. Tyson catches Paul with a flush left hand coming inside, prompting a reaction from the crowd, but Paul seems to walk right through it. Paul is throwing and landing more. Another easy round for the younger man. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Paul 10-9 Tyson (Paul 50-45 Tyson) Round 4 Tyson looks tentative as the fighters meet in the center of the ring to start the fourth. Paul is circling his opponent, throwing punches sparingly. He looks confident and composed. Tyson trying to use upper-body movement to slip Paul\u2019s shots but Paul lands a left hook. Tyson looking very much like a 58-year-old with a bad knee. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Paul 10-9 Tyson (Paul 40-36 Tyson) Round 3 Tyson comes out aggressively in the third, but Paul evades his flailing efforts. Paul lands three straight left hands and Tyson is wobbled. Tyson looks hurt. Paul lands a crisp left hook to Tyson\u2019s temple. Tyson is in trouble. He\u2019s in bad trouble. The referee should take a very close look. The 58-year-old Tyson looks exhausted, continuing to gnaw on his left glove during breaks in the action. Sad to watch. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Paul 10-9 Tyson (Paul 30-27 Tyson) Round 2 Paul lands a right hand to the body. Tyson legs look like they\u2019re already stiff after giving it all in the opening frame. Paul misses with a vicious right uppercut. A lull in the action. Not much being landed by either guy in this frame. Paul catches Tyson with a left coming inside. Tyson already looks devoid of a plan, standing right in front of Paul and following him around. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Paul 10-9 Tyson (Paul 20-18 Tyson) Round 1 There\u2019s the bell! The meet inthe center of the ring. Tyson lunges forward, bobbing and weaving. Tyson lands a left hand. And overhand right by Tyson. Neither bother Paul, who ties up Tyson on his next burst inside. The fighters go into the clinch once again. Paul begins circling Tyson, using the jab to try and press his five-inch reach advantage. Paul lands a crisp right hand. Tyson tries to barrel in and trap Paul against the ropes but Paul pirouettes out of harm\u2019s way. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Paul 10-9 Tyson (Paul 10-9 Tyson) The waiting is over. The final instructions have been given by referee Mark Calo-oy, the seconds are out and we\u2019ll pick it up with round-by-round coverage from here! ... and here comes Mike Tyson. The former heavyweight champion methodically walks to the ring wearing a simple black towel. Murdergram by Murder Inc plays over the speaker. He\u2019s into the ring. The audience is going wild. This is a Tyson crowd. The fighters are making their entrances for the main event. First out is Jake Paul. Lots of initial boos from the crowd as he rolls out of the tunnel inside a customized Chevy low rider seated in the backseat alongside brother Logan. In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins plays on the stadium soundsystem. Paul is wearing an studded silver robe with matching gloves. He exits the car and daps up the fans along the runway while making the final approach to the ring. Then the sound goes down ... Hot off the presses: Donald McRae\u2019s report off Katie Taylor\u2019s controversial win over Amanda Serrano is live. Anthem time at AT&amp;T Stadium. Former American Idol contender and two-time Grammy winner Tori Kelly is out to perform the Star-Spangled Banner. Not much longer now. Here\u2019s a look at how Tyson and Paul measure up ahead of tonight\u2019s main event. The 31-year age gap between the fighters is said to be the largest in the history of professional boxing and by some distance, eclipsing the 24 years that separated Archie Moore, who was 49, and Mike DiBiase, who was 25, when they met in 1963. (Moore won by third-round knockout.) Paul, who tipped the scales at a career-high 227.2lbs at yesterday\u2019s weigh-in, will enjoy advantages in height (three inches) and reach (five inches). Tyson came in at 228.4lbs. That\u2019s about 10lbs heavier than his fighting weight during his imperial era (1987-89), but about 10lbs lighter than his career high of 239.75lbs for his 2001 fight with Brian Nielsen in Copenhagen. How much are Tyson and Paul getting paid for this? It\u2019s another one of the most frequently asked questions around tonight\u2019s event. It has been rumored that Paul will earn $40m (\u00a331.6m) for Friday\u2019s event while Tyson is said to be making $20m (\u00a315.8m). Taylor will reportedly bring in $6.1m (\u00a34.8m) for her co-feature rematch with Serrano, whose takehome is thought to be around $8m (\u00a36.3m). That would be an extraordinary come-up for the Nuyorican seven-weight champion, who once was paid $1,500 for a world title defense. And good lordy, did they earn every last penny. We tried to confirm these figures on Thursday with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR), the state commission regulating the card, but they denied our open records request under the Texas Public Information Act (PIA) for the pay sheet in the fight contract and referred us to the promoters. The rumors must suffice for now. Next up is the main event: Jake Paul v Mike Tyson. There\u2019s still so much to unpack from that instant classic between Taylor and Serrano, but the card doesn\u2019t stop for us to catch our breath and we\u2019ll pass along Donald McRae\u2019s ringside report as soon as it\u2019s published. Tyson has not been in the mood for trash talk in the final run-up to tonight\u2019s fight. He\u2019s maintained a stoic quietude throughout the events of fight week (with the occasional exception), which at times has frustrated Paul. Here\u2019s McRae\u2019s dispatch from the final press conference. Paul was frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s cute,\u201d he initially said of Tyson\u2019s reticence. But then the YouTuber declared: \u201cI fear no man. I want him to be that old savage Mike \u2026 I want there to be no excuses when I knock him out.\u201d Paul then complained directly to Tyson: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shit-talk online saying you\u2019re going to kill me, and just nothing in person. Is that what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d Tyson shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just ready.\u201d Paul looked irate. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty fucking boring,\u201d he whined. He rose from his seat to challenge the fighters on the undercard who had picked Tyson to beat him. Nine of those 12 fighters sided with Tyson and Paul goaded many of them into taking bets on the outcome. Tyson knows that, closing on 60 and having been out of the ring so long, none of this matters. He has little left but so many terrible things have happened in his life, or been meted out to others by him, that there is nothing new to say. He sank deeper into silence. \u201cEveryone said the judges was going to be a little shady, but listen, I came here, I chose to be great,\u201d Serrano says. \u201cI went up three divisions. I dared to be great tonight. I am the featherweight champion of the world and I want to be great.\u201d Serrano adds: \u201c[Taylor] kept headbutting me. But we knew that from the very beginning, from the first fight. That\u2019s what they do. She did not only my fight she did it with Chantelle Cameron. Listen, I\u2019m a Boricua. I\u2019m going to die in this ring no matter how many cuts I have in my face.\u201d Asked whether she believed Taylor\u2019s headbutts were intentional, Serrano is to the point. \u201cI think 100%, because she does it in every fight. It\u2019s not the first fight.\u201d Controversy! Katie Taylor has retained her undisputed junior welterweight title by a unanimous-decision win over a brave Amanda Serrano. All three judges handed down scores of 95-94. Round 10 An absolute war. Difficult to watch. Two fighters throwing everything at one another, leaving defense at the door. Taylor nicks it on our card with Serrano narrowly winning a decision, the referee\u2019s highly one-point deduction making the difference. Unbelieveable fight. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 10-9 Serrano (Taylor 94-95 Serrano) Round 9 A strong ninth from Serrano, who is in the fight of her life. Both fighters trading punches in high frequency, blinding two-way action, so little to separate them. Serrano takes in our card, just. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 9-10 Serrano (Taylor 84-86 Serrano) Round 8 A sensational fight, equally as dramatic as the first. Serrano is blinded in her right eye from the blood gushing from that cut, but she is moving forward and throwing punches in combination. At the end of the round, the referee deducts a point from Taylor for a head butt. That\u2019s a very questionable call in a close fight where it might make the difference. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 8-10 Serrano (Taylor 75-76 Serrano) Round 7 These two are leaving it all in the ring! A fact-paced round with more two-way action. Serrano is nothing short of a warrior for fighting through this gruesome cut, but Taylor is winning on the inside owing to her blinding handspeed. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 10-9 Serrano (Taylor 67-66 Serrano) Round 6 Serrano is landing more punches but Taylor is landing at a better percentage. Suddenly the cut bursts wide open from a punch. The referee stops the action and calls for the ringside physicial to inspect the cut, which is an massive gash on her right eyebrow from an accidental headbutt. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 9-10 Serrano (Taylor 57-57 Serrano) Round 5 Who\u2019s leading this fight depends if you prefer Taylor\u2019s boxing or Serrano\u2019s pressure. But this cut over Serrano\u2019s eye is a horrorshow and very dangerous. They may have to stop the fight before the scheduled 10 rounds. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 10-9 Serrano (Taylor 48-47 Serrano) Round 4 Serrano is cut over the right eye from head butt in the fourth round. Lots of two-way action with Taylor getting the better of the firefights. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 10-9 Serrano (Taylor 38-38 Serrano) Round 3 Taylor is boxing better in the third, showing good hand speed as Serrano continues to stalk her around the ring. The champion is moving almost exclusively in reverse with a worried look on her face. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 10-9 Serrano (Taylor 28-29 Serrano) Round 2 As reports of Netflix server outages swallow up the internet, we\u2019re playing catchup with our own technical issues. Serrano continues to sit down on her punches in the second round, getting the better of Taylor as she continues to box and move. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 9-10 Serrano (Taylor 18-20 Serrano) Round 1 And we\u2019re off! They meet in the center of the ring. Taylor looks to establish the left jab with several offerings before Serrano throws a punch. Serrano looks to trap Taylor in a corner but Taylor lands a crisp counter upstairs. Taylor fighting off the back foot as Serrano comes forward, the champion looking to set traps. Serrano lands a left hand. Taylor is using lateral movement to remain an elusive target. Then in the closing seconds Serrano lands a massive left hand! A left hand flush to Taylor\u2019s jaw that wobbles the champion! Taylor was hurt but she is saved by the bell! Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Taylor 9-10 Serrano (Taylor 9-10 Serrano) The fighters have been announced by the emcee. The final instructions have been given by the referee, the seconds are out and we\u2019ll pick it up with round-by-round coverage from here! Serrano and Taylor are making their entrances. It\u2019s Serrano first as she strides to the squared circle down a long runway flanked by the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. She\u2019s wearing a bulletproof vest, a statement that she\u2019s ready for war. And now here comes Taylor! She is making her entrance to Hillsong Worship\u2019s Awake My Soul. It might seem like a unusual choice if it\u2019s your first time watching her, but it was her ringwalk song for the first Serrano fight at Madison Square Garden and provided a positively spine-tingling moment ahead of the fight of her life. No surprise she\u2019s tapping into that energy once again. There are pockets of empty seats but this magnificent stadium is pretty full and it\u2019s starting to rock. The atmosphere is still different to the first Serrano-Taylor fight at MSG as it lacks that remarkable outpouring of partisan support from passionate, yet friendly, armies of Puerto Rican and Irish fans. Footage of these great female fighters going through their final preparations in the locker room a few minutes ago did not elicit the noise that greeted the earlier arrival of Mike Tyson. But I still expect Serrano and Taylor to provide compelling viewing \u2026 and for the noise to rise with them. Here\u2019s a look at how Taylor and Serrano measure up ahead of tonight\u2019s co-feature attraction. Physically, there\u2019s not much to separate them. They both tipped the scales at an identical 137.4lbs at yesterday\u2019s weigh-in, a clean 2.6lbs below the division limit. Serrano has a slight half-inch edge in height, while Taylor has the same advantage in reach. Their knockout percentages make it clear this is a match between the fighter and the boxer: Serrano has stopped 62% of her opponents inside the distance compared to 25% for Taylor. The stars are out in Big D! It might not be Frank Sinatra in the photo pit at Madison Square Garden for the first Ali-Frazier scrap. But a cadre of celebs have made the trip to Arlington for tonight\u2019s fights, among them Jeff Ross, Mike Epps, Joey Fatone and Haliey Welch (aka the Hawk Tuah girl). Next up is the eagerly awaited rematch between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano. It\u2019s a replay of a disputed split decision won by Taylor in a slugfest at sold-out Madison Square Garden two years ago. At stake: the undisputed women\u2019s super lightweight championship held by Taylor, the 2012 Olympic gold medalist widely regarded as one of the greatest female boxers to ever take up the gloves. It was the night that women\u2019s boxing has desperately sought and deserved for years: the first summit meeting between the consensus No 1 and No 2 on the men\u2019s or women\u2019s pound-for-pound list since the second fight between Manny Pacquiao and Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez in 2008. Organizers planned for a crowd of about 10,000, then were forced to reconfigure the seating to open the entire arena due to unanticipated demand. In the end Taylor and Serrano became the first women to headline a boxing event at the storied venue. And the fight managed to exceed the breathless hype that preceded it. My heart was pounding so much I had a headache. Our Donald McRae caught up with Taylor earlier in the week ahead of tonight\u2019s rematch. Taylor listens to my misgivings about the night at the AT&amp;T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys, and the fact that Tyson should not be allowed back in the ring for a competitive fight. \u201cI do definitely have those same concerns,\u201d she admits, \u201cbut he did look very good against Roy Jones [in a drawn eight-round exhibition in November 2020]. He definitely hasn\u2019t lived the cleanest life since then but I think over the last few years he\u2019s cleaned himself up. We\u2019re hoping that shows through on the night, but he obviously has amazing experience and nothing is going to faze Mike Tyson.\u201d Taylor is an ambassador for the old-school boxing company, Everlast, which has been making fight clothing and equipment since 1910, and aligns herself firmly with traditionalists of the ring. Taylor clearly loves the sport with an enduring fervour and sounds hopeful when I ask if Tyson could beat his much younger rival. \u201cI think so. I\u2019ve seen clips of him training recently and he looks very good on the pads. But Jake is a fit man, a young man and a good athlete as well. He seems to have an OK punch and he\u2019s starting to prove himself as a fighter. It\u2019s very interesting, but I have a real soft spot for Mike Tyson. \u201cI think if you\u2019re a boxing person, it really matters that he does well and hopefully wins because Mike Tyson is an absolute legend in sport. He was once known as the baddest man on the planet. He\u2019s super exciting to watch, a real iconic boxer. I have so much respect for him for what he did in the sport and I\u2019d hate for a legend like him to lose a matchup like this. He\u2019s a hero to many of us fighters.\u201d What a fight! Mario Barrios has retained his WBC welterweight title by the skin of his teeth, fighting to a split draw with heavy underdog Abel Ramos. One judge had it 114-112 for Ramos, another scored it 116-110 for Barrios while the third had it 113-113. (The Guardian scored it 115-111 for Barrios.) \u201cI know it was a close fight,\u201d Barrios says. \u201cI knew Abel was going to come with everything. I knew I had a hard task in front of me. I was finding success in the early rounds, but he made the adjustments to where he committed a war. After that I started feeling like I couldn\u2019t really find my rhythm, how I wanted to. \ufeff\u201cAnd then the fight ended up how it did. Hat\u2019s off to him. It was a hell of a performance. I hope everybody Here in the AT&amp;T Stadium was happy with the fight.\u201d Why is Paul v Tyson? The 27-year-old influencer, who has managed to develop into a competent boxer since taking up the sport and turning professional in 2020, winning 10 of 11 bouts against mostly faded MMA fighters and fellow YouTubers, insists it\u2019s another step toward his quixotic goal of winning a world title, saying: \u201cMy sights are set on becoming a world champion, and now I have a chance to prove myself against the greatest heavyweight champion ever, the baddest man on the planet and the most dangerous boxer of all time.\u201d True as that may be, the short money is no small incentive. Paul closed a lucrative deal with Netflix last November to stream one of his upcoming fights before Tyson was even in the frame. The interest (and money) only ballooned with the addition of the former heavyweight champion, who had not fought in an official bout since quitting on his stool after six rounds against Irish journeyman Kevin McBride in June 2005. The atmosphere was building slowly and then, around 8.20pm local time, footage of Jake Paul\u2019s arrival was greeted with a little roar. Nothing dramatic but noisy enough to divert my attention from the early stages of the bout between Mario Barrios and Abel Ramos. But then, in the moment of the night so far, we saw live pictures of Mike Tyson walking to his locker room. The massive and sustained roar was strangely moving. It was much, much louder than the reception for Paul and suggests that this is going to be a very-pro Tyson crowd. It felt like a real moment \u2026 Upset alert! Abel Ramos went off as a nearly 8-1 underdog in his title fight with Mario Barrios. But Ramos just detonated a massive right hand on the champion\u2019s chin that dropped him to the canvas in the sixth round of an already close fight. The WBC welterweight title hangs in the balance ... This week our Sean Ingle wrote about his personal disdain for Paul v Tyson, saying it \u201cfeels more like a sham or a circus than a genuine sporting event\u201d. That said, he can\u2019t deny there\u2019s a robust market for it. Most boxing fans [hate the idea of Paul v Tyson]. It sells a myth that wasn\u2019t even close to being a reality in 2004, let alone 2024: namely that Tyson is one of the most ferocious warriors alive, not a 58-year-old who lost 26lb in May after an ulcer flare-up that left him throwing up blood and defecating tar. It risks Tyson\u2019s boxing reputation and his health. And, Netflix\u2019s lavish promotion aside, it feels more like a sham or a circus than a genuine sporting event. But I may be wrong. Certainly [legendary British publicist Mark] Borkowksi thinks so. He believes the fight is straight out of the playbook of PT Barnum, the greatest showman of all and a curator of the absurd and extraordinary, who instinctively knew what the public wanted long before they did. And that it will cut through to the masses. \u201cBarnum understood how to engage the crowd \u2013 the great herd, the great unwashed,\u201d he says. \u201cThis fight is about opportunism. It\u2019s about creative thinking. And it is already generating the oxygen of publicity, which is always an indication that something is going to be very successful.\u201d As Borkowski points out, it taps into two big markets: Boomers and Gen Xers, who grew up watching Tyson, as well as the younger generations who worship Jake Paul, many of whom will want to watch. \u201cA lot of people, particularly boys, project themselves into male influencers like Paul,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways, they are their best mates \u2013 whether it\u2019s watching them play Call of Duty, or seeing the Jackass-influenced generation of pranksters doing outrageous things on social. So they will be watching this. And so will those who grew up with Tyson in his prime. So while purists might sneer, there\u2019s a market for this. And Netflix knows it.\u201d Moving right along. Next up is the first of two world title fights on the televised undercard: Mario Barrios and Abel Ramos in a scheduled 12-round fight for Barrios\u2019 World Boxing Council welterweight championship. It\u2019s worth mentioning the 29-year-old from San Antonio never earned his title in the ring, instead being declared champion by the WBC after previous holder Terence Crawford (who\u2019d unified all four belts at 147lbs) moved up a weight class to fight Israil Madrimov. Some of the most illustrious names in the history of boxing have owned the WBC welterweight belt over the years, among them Crawford, Floyd Mayweather Jr, Oscar De La Hoya, Felix Trinidad, Pernell Whitaker, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran and Emile Griffith. Barrios, a former beltholder at 140lbs, has a long way to go before joining that elite class, but he can take his first step tonight by getting through Ramos, a sizable underdog who has lost three of his past five outings. A random thought as we await the next fight. Paul getting top billing over Tyson in all of the the promotional materials for tonight\u2019s main event may seem strange given the chasm between their boxing accomplishments, but it\u2019s not as unusual as it seems. The matter of whose name comes first on the poster, and other issues like the order the fighters make their ring entrances, are usually sorted out during the contract negotiations. The so-called A-side of a promotion typically calls the shots and it\u2019s no surprise that Paul, whose Most Valuable Promotions company is organizing the event, fills that role. What is unusual is seeing the fight listed on the primary ticket vendor\u2019s website as Jake Paul w/ Mike Tyson, which appears to further downgrade Tyson from B-side to something of a backing singer. Ultimately, it\u2019s not a big deal. But it\u2019s certainly a choice given the larger-than-normal skepticism around the competitive merit of tonight\u2019s feature attraction. Is Jake Paul v Mike Tyson for real? It\u2019s the most common question we\u2019ve fielded over the past few weeks. And the answer is, technically, yes. Unlike many of the similar novelty bouts throughout boxing history, the fight between Paul and Tyson is not an exhibition. Despite concerns over the fighters\u2019 three-decade age difference, along with Tyson\u2019s inactivity and track record of health issues, the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) determined the former champion\u2019s physical condition met the criteria for the fight to be officially sanctioned. That means there will be three judges at ringside, an official winner will be declared and the result will count on their records. (It also means that sportsbooks can taking betting action on it, although at least six US states have deemed the event too untraditional to allow wagering.) The Texas commission has taken some precautions. The fight will be scheduled for eight rounds instead of the typical 10 or 12, with two-minute rounds instead of the customary three. Tyson and Paul will also use 14oz gloves instead of the usual 10oz in order to lessen the power of the punches. The first televised undercard bout is in the books. Neeraj Goyat has won a clean six-round unanimous decision over Whindersson Nunes. It was nearly a total shutout with the three ringside judges handing down scores of 59-55 and 60-54 (twice). As expected, tonight\u2019s card has shattered the record for the largest US boxing gate outside of Las Vegas. The promoters say the live gate for Paul v Tyson has surpassed $17.8 (\u00a314.1), nearly twice the previous state record for a boxing or MMA event of $9m from Canelo \u00c1lvarez\u2019s fight with Billy Joe Saunders in 2021. Organizers said they are expecting more than 70,000 fans for tonight\u2019s fights at AT&amp;T Stadium, the 80,000-home of the NFL\u2019s Dallas Cowboys in Arlington, Texas. As the Netflix telecast began at 7pm local time, thousands of box-office and resale tickets priced as low as $40 were still available, meaning any walk-up crowd may further raise the gate total. It\u2019s still early here and at least two hours before Amanda Serrano and Katie Taylor make their ringwalks. They are in the best and most meaningful fight of the night. Like Bryan, I was at Madison Square Garden in April 2022 when they produced one of the great fights in recent memory. The atmosphere in the Garden that night was incredible, as the Puerto Rican and Irish fans whipped up an exhilarating racket that matched the fight itself. My memory might be playing tricks and perhaps it was pretty quiet two hours before Serrano and Taylor fought in the Garden. But I seem to remember that the joint was jumping with anticipation all through the build-up. Here in the AT&amp;T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys of course, the mood is a mellow hum. People seem chilled out and the arena is about a quarter full at the moment. But, so far, there is no real sign of any influx of Taylor supporters either from Ireland or across America. There are also no songs or chants from either the Irish or Puerto Rican contingents. I am sure they will arrive in full voice soon, but most people I\u2019ve seen look like they\u2019re here for the circus of Jake Paul and Mike Tyson. But give it another two hours and I think this stunning stadium will be so much noisier and more fevered than it is now \u2026 Time for some boxing. India\u2019s Neeraj Goyat and Brazil\u2019s Whindersson Nunes have made their way to the ring for a six-round middleweight fight following a flashy performance by the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders to AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far. Let\u2019s do a little housekeeping before going any further and pass along the results from the non-televised undercard. We\u2019ve had three fights so far before a mostly empty AT&amp;T Stadium crowd: \u2022 Bruce \u2018Shu Shu\u2019 Carrington, a blue-chip featherweight prospect from Brooklyn signed with Top Rank Promotions, improved to 14 wins in 14 fights with an eight-round unanimous-decision win over late replacement Dana Coolwell. The Brownsville native dropped his opponent two times including in the final round, but Coolwell beat the count and made it to the final bell. Carrington won in a complete shutout with all three ringside judges handing down scores of 80-70. \u2022 Lucas Bahdi moved closer to a world title shot after the unbeaten lightweight prospect handed Italy\u2019s Armando Casamonica his first defeat with a disputed majority-decision win in a closer-than-expected 10-rounder. The heavy-handed Canadian was met with stiff resistance by the late replacement Casamonica, who took the fight on 10 days\u2019 notice when Corey Marksman dropped out with a training injury. One judge had it a reasonable 95-95 while the other two handed down risible scores of 96-93 and 98-92 for Bahdi. \u2022 Shadasia Green, the former basketball player from Patterson, New Jersey, is a world champion at the second time of asking after winning a razor-thin 10-round split decision over Toronto\u2019s Melinda Watpool for the WBO women\u2019s super middleweight championship. Two of the three judges scored it for the 35-year-old known as the Sweet Terminator, overruling the third who had it 96-94 for Watpool in a fight where there was little to separate the two. Green had falled short in her first title shot last year, dropping a unanimous decision to Franchon Crews Dezurn for the vacant WBC strap. Hello and welcome to AT&amp;T Stadium for a night at the fights unlike any we can immediately remember. Mike Tyson is ending a 7,097-day layoff from professional fighting to face the boxer-influencer Jake Paul in a non-title heavyweight bout scheduled for eight rounds at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. If you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s unlikely Tyson needs any introduction. In 1986, at 20 years old, the Brooklyn native became the youngest heavyweight champion in history, laying waste to Trevor Berbick inside two rounds to win the World Boxing Council title. After unifying the other major title belts, the nominal Baddest Man on the Planet made six defenses of the undisputed heavyweight championship before losing in a historic upset to James \u2018Buster\u2019 Douglas by 10th-round knockout in February 1990. Convicted of rape in 1992 and sentenced to six years in prison, Tyson served three years before being released on parole and was never again the same destructive force, closing his professional ledger with six wins and five defeats with two no-contests. While Tyson remains one of the most recognizable people in the world nearly two decades after his last official fight, there are few people under the age of 30 who don\u2019t know Paul. After cultivating an enormous public profile on Vine and YouTube alongside elder brother Logan, the Cleveland native has managed to develop into a competent boxer since taking up the sport and turning professional in 2020. He\u2019s had 11 paying fights since then, mostly against former mixed martial arts fighters and journeyman boxers with the odd retired NBA player thrown in. His lone setback came by split decision to Tommy Fury last year, but he\u2019s won four on the trot since then including a July knockout of Mike Perry, a veteran of the MMA and bare-knuckle boxing circuits. Some have called it a circus. But with two world title fights on the TV undercard, including Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in a hotly anticipated rematch of their 2022 classic, there\u2019s plenty of value on offer for viewers who aren\u2019t keen on watching two men with 31 years between them exchange leather. The live Netflix broadcast starts in 15 minutes and there will be three preliminary bouts ahead of the main event. The order of play will be as follows: Neeraj Goyat v Whindersson Nunes, six rounds, middleweights Mario Barrios v Abel Ramos, 12 rounds, for Barrios\u2019 WBC welterweight title Katie Taylor v Amanda Serrano, 10 (two-minute) rounds for Taylor\u2019s undisputed women\u2019s junior welterweight championship Jake Paul v Mike Tyson, eight (two-minute) rounds, heavyweights It\u2019s uncertain when Paul and Tyson will make their entrances for the main event, but it won\u2019t happen before 10pm local time. That\u2019s 11pm on the US east coast and 4am in the UK. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s his explainer with everything you need to know about tonight\u2019s event. Mike Tyson is returning to professional boxing for the first time in nearly two decades on Friday night in Texas. The 58-year-old former undisputed heavyweight champion is fighting YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in a made-for-Netflix showdown expected to draw a global audience of around 300m viewers. But is that all you really need to know? What about the rules, how much they\u2019re getting paid and the *checks notes* 31-year age difference. Read on for all the answers ... Where and when is the fight? The seven-fight card is being held at the 80,000-capacity AT&amp;T Stadium, the $1.2bn home of the NFL\u2019s Cowboys in Arlington, about 20 miles west of Dallas. It\u2019s hard to pin down an exact time for the main event, but Paul and Tyson will not make their entrances before 11pm ET (4am GMT). Where can I watch it? The broadcast will stream live globally on Netflix starting at 8pm ET (1am GMT) at no additional cost to subscribers. There will be three televised preliminary fights, including Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in a hotly anticipated rematch of their 2022 classic, leading up to the main event. The stream will feature options for live commentary in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French and German. The first three undercard bouts not carried by the Netflix stream will be available free on Most Valuable Promotions\u2019 YouTube, Netflix Sports YouTube and Tudum starting at 5.30pm ET (10.30pm GMT). Who else is fighting? Hearn isn\u2019t alone in calling it a circus. But with two world title fights on the TV undercard, there\u2019s plenty of value on offer for viewers who aren\u2019t keen on watching two men with more than 30 years between them exchange blows. The order of play is as follows: Neeraj Goyat v Whindersson Nunes, six rounds, middleweights Mario Barrios v Abel Ramos, 12 rounds, for Barrios\u2019 WBC welterweight title Katie Taylor v Amanda Serrano, 10 (two-minute) rounds for Taylor\u2019s undisputed women\u2019s junior welterweight championship Jake Paul v Mike Tyson, eight (two-minute) rounds, heavyweights The best fight on the card by some distance is Taylor\u2019s rematch with Serrano in defense of all four major title belts at 140lbs. Their first encounter before a sold-out Madison Square Garden two years ago was a contest of extreme physical and psychological intensity that somehow exceeded the breathless hype that preceded it. My heart was pounding so much I had a headache. If Friday night\u2019s second installment matches it for drama, don\u2019t be surprised if they close out the trilogy with a third before 90,000 at Croke Park.",

      "bodyText": "Sarah on Max What were you hoping for? To be ambushed by a young Oliver Reed and charioted through London on a golden carriage. First impressions? I\u2019m glad we both ordered a cocktail called El Coraz\u00f3n (meaning \u201cthe heart\u201d) because we were, indeed, both dealing with matters of the heart. What did you talk about? The impact of the Swedish midnight sun on circadian rhythm. Why vampires are sexier than other ghouls. Most awkward moment? Perhaps I was too interested in the fact he had an EU passport. Good table manners? I felt the Guardian was gunning for mishaps with the small-plates-on-a-first-date format \u2013 but we avoided them due to his gracefulness. Both being older siblings, we agreed that the \u201cone person cuts the portions and the other chooses\u201d is a noble way of sharing. Best thing about Max? Contagious smile. Would you introduce Max to your friends? I\u2019d introduce Max to my dog, which may rank higher than my friends. They\u2019re both Australians (she\u2019s a mini Aussie shepherd). Describe Max in three words. Easy on the eyes. What do you think Max made of you? I suspect he\u2019s still figuring that out. Did you go on somewhere? Yes, on many, many tangents. And \u2026 did you kiss? My mum reads this column! If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? I would\u2019ve made the guacamole a teensy bit spicier to match our vibe. Marks out of 10? 8 \u2013 but he only loses two points because neither the golden chariot nor the young Oliver Reed materialised at any point in the evening! Would you meet again? Are you offering to sponsor another date? Max on Sarah What were you hoping for? On the surface level, not a whole lot. But deep down, hopefully to have a real connection. First impressions? As Sarah walked into the restaurant. I thought: \u201cPlease be her, please be her!\u201d What did you talk about? Feels like damn near everything! Conversation went by in an absolute blur! To pick a few I would say: Our jobs. Families. Music festivals. Bad jokes. Movies (how good is The Death of Stalin?). Hiking spots. Our favourite recipes. How concerning it is that one in three UK adults can\u2019t swim. Most awkward moment? The beginning, trying to suss each other out. Good table manners? As good as they can be with Mexican food that you eat with your hands. We shared our dishes. Best thing about Sarah? Halfway through she said: \u201cI think we\u2019re definitely seeing each other again, right?\u201d I really like that directness. Would you introduce Sarah to your friends? I\u2019d introduce her to friends, family and whoever I can grab off the street. Describe Sarah in three words. Vivacious, exuberant, hilarious. What do you think Sarah made of you? A fellow chatty, passionate person who can match her crazy with my own. Did you go on somewhere? No. We wanted to, but she was staying at her parents\u2019 that night and I had to catch a train out of London. And \u2026 did you kiss? We certainly did, rather enthusiastically. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Moved it to the weekend so it could have gone on longer. Marks out of 10? 10 out of 10, felt positively giddy on the train ride home. One of the best dates I\u2019ve been on in a long, long time. Would you meet again? I definitely hope so. We traded numbers and Instagram handles, and have made tentative plans to meet up again. Max and Sarah ate at Zapote, London EC2. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com",

Blythe was cared for by a circle of friends he called \u201cdear ones\u201d until he died peacefully at home in January 2023. His friends were then amazed to discover that Blythe, who never lived with anyone, never learned to drive and rarely travelled, left a fortune of \u00a3500,000 squirrelled away in 20 savings accounts. This will help fund the urgent repairs required on the house. \u201cFrom the moment he was working as a writer \u2013 from 1955 \u2013 he paid his way,\u201d said Collins. \u201cAll his life he was in fear of the workhouse and he never spent anything.\u201d Yates added: \u201cWe want to make sure the house continues as Ronnie\u2019s life force. It can be a force for everything that he represented. We need that now more than ever.\u201d",

You can go down a science-fiction route but iyou ultimately where will it leave us?\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt feels to me as if there is pressure for this Labour government to deliver growth at all costs. My fear is that it will lead us into taking shortcuts to deliver that growth at a rapid rate and we may regret what we have done.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An NGO has called for an investigation into five far-right members of the European parliament, warning of a potential failure to declare expenses for a trip to attend a gala dinner in New York headlined by Donald Trump. Transparency International\u2019s EU office has written to the parliament\u2019s watchdog on MEP conduct requesting an inquiry into five politicians over a potential failure to declare travel and tickets to the black-tie gala hosted by the New York Young Republican Club (NYYRC) in December 2023. According to the NGO, two of the MEPs may also have failed to declare expenses for attending the NYYRC gala in 2022, and one may have breached the rules over a discussion panel organised by the same group in New York. The complaint concerns two Hungarian lawmakers who are key members of the country\u2019s ruling Fidesz party, Kinga G\u00e1l and Ern\u0151 Schaller-Baross; the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland MEP Maximilian Krah, who stood down as his party\u2019s lead candidate after saying the SS were \u201cnot all criminals\u201d; a former mayor in Italy\u2019s far-right League party, Susanna Ceccardi; and a leading figure in Austria\u2019s anti-migrant, anti-Islam Freedom party, Harald Vilimsky. In responses to the Guardian, four of the five lawmakers \u2013 G\u00e1l, Schaller-Baross, Krah and Ceccardi \u2013 rejected any suggestion of breaking rules and said variously that their travel had been funded by their government, political party, European parliament group, or their own funds, which is in line with the rules. Vilimsky did not respond to questions. The complaint highlights the links between Trump\u2019s Maga universe and Europe\u2019s far right, who share hostility towards liberal rules-based institutions, climate action, and refugees and migrants. Two of the MEPs, Ceccardi and Vilimsky, are listed as members of the NYYRC. It is understood this does not breach European parliament rules. All five MEPs were photographed at the NYYRC gala in 2023, where delegates paid between $699 and $1,399 to be addressed by Trump over a \u201cmulti-course French-service\u201d dinner with an open bar featuring \u201ctop-shelf liquor\u201d. In a rambling speech over 80 minutes, Trump told diners he wanted to be \u201ca dictator for one day because I want a wall, and I want to drill, drill, drill\u201d. Other guests of honour included the far-right former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who was jailed for defying multiple congressional subpoenas related to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol; the Trump acolyte Rudy Giuliani, who was ordered to pay $148.1m in damages for lies about the 2020 US presidential elections; and the extremist commentator and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec. G\u00e1l, a veteran MEP who co-leads Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s far-right Patriots for Europe group in the European parliament, also attracted scrutiny from Transparency International over who paid for her to attend an NYYRC panel event called Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2013 Defender of Europe on 15 November 2023 in New York. Transparency International, an NGO dedicated to integrity in public life, called on the European parliament\u2019s advisory committee, which vets potential breaches of the code of conduct, to investigate how the MEPs funded their attendance, \u201cto exclude any wrongdoing\u201d. Shari Hinds, a policy officer at Transparency International, said: \u201cFor us it\u2019s very important that there should be complete and full transparency regarding the funding source [of any travel].\u201d The group made the appeal to the advisory committee after it became aware that the MEPs had attended the 2023 gala and other events but failed to find any reference to how their travel was funded in their public declarations. Under the European parliament\u2019s code of conduct, which was tightened up in 2023 after the Qatargate scandal, MEPs are obliged to declare when a third party pays for them to attend an event, including travel, accommodation and other expenses. There are exemptions for attending events funded by a long list of third parties, such as EU national and regional governments and European political parties. Nor are MEPs expected to declare trips made at their own expense. G\u00e1l said the costs of her attendance at both events was paid for by Fidesz and her participation was \u201cin no way related\u201d to her MEP duties. Schaller-Baross said he was invited and attended the 2023 gala as the Hungarian government\u2019s ministerial commissioner for foreign relations at the prime minister\u2019s office. He said his travel, accommodation and related expenses \u201cwere covered by the prime minister\u2019s office\u201d. Ceccardi said her attendance at the gala was paid for by the far-right Identity and Democracy group, a European parliament group superseded by the Patriots alliance. The MEP, a member of the parliament\u2019s US relations delegation, said her trip to the US from 8 to 10 December 2023 was covered by the European parliament\u2019s additional travel allowance, which allows MEPs to claim for reimbursement of foreign travel that is not part of official parliament meetings. The allowance is worth \u20ac5,500 a year. Transparency International said it had made a freedom of information request to the parliament that found \u201cSusanna Ceccardi had not used the additional travel allowance in the period from October to December 2023\u201d. Asked about the discrepancy, Ceccardi\u2019s office said it stood by its earlier statement, while Transparency International said: \u201cWe were clear in our request that we were seeking documents for travel that took place during those dates, not documents submitted on those dates.\u201d Asked about the discrepancy, a European parliament spokesperson said: \u201cThe EP cannot not comment on individual cases and the ongoing work of the advisory committee, as it is strictly confidential.\u201d Ceccardi\u2019s office said: \u201cAny insinuation that MEP Ceccardi received financial contributions or other benefits from third parties is factually incorrect.

According to two sources, Wiles was briefed Wednesday night about an allegation that Hegseth had acted inappropriately with a woman. One of the sources said the alleged incident took place in Monterey, California in 2017.</p> <p>According to the transition source, the allegation is serious enough that Wiles and Trump\u2019s lawyers spoke to Hegseth about it on Thursday. A source with knowledge of the meeting said that Hegseth said the allegation stemmed from a consensual encounter and characterized the episode as he-said, she-said.</p> <p>On Thursday evening, Hegseth\u2019s lawyer Timothy Parlatore said: \u201cThis allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s communications director <strong>Steven Cheung</strong> said: \u201cPresident Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration.

There are hundreds of decisions made at HHS every day that either lead our nation toward a respect for life or away from it, and HHS under our administration always stood for life,\u201d Pence said in a statement released by his conservative nonprofit, Advancing American Freedom.</p> <p>\u201cI believe the nomination of RFK Jr. to serve as Secretary of HHS is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration and should be deeply concerning to millions of Pro-Life Americans who have supported the Republican Party and our nominees for decades.\u201d</p> <p>During his presidential campaign, which he ended in August and announced his support for Trump, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rfkjr/videos/2747714242055909/\">Kennedy said</a> he is in favor of abortion being legal up to a certain point.</p> <p>Pence fell out with Trump after refusing to go along with his attempts to stop <strong>Joe Biden</strong> from taking office after the 2020 election. Nonetheless, his words may hold some sway with conservative senators opposed to abortion. Here\u2019s the rest of his statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the majority of his career, RFK Jr. has defended abortion on demand during all nine months of pregnancy, supports overturning the Dobbs decision and has called for legislation to codify Roe v Wade. If confirmed, RFK, Jr. would be the most pro-abortion Republican appointed secretary of HHS in modern history.</p> <p>The pro-life movement has always looked to the Republican party to stand for life, to affirm an unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.</p> <p>On behalf of tens of millions of pro-life Americans, I respectfully urge Senate Republicans to reject this nomination and give the American people a leader who will respect the sanctity of life as secretary of Health and Human Services.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-673760ca8f08916386e22937\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-15T14:59:01.569Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>John Thune, the South Dakota lawmaker who earlier this week was elected leader of the Senate Republicans, will be at the center of the confirmation hearings for Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks.</strong></p> <p>He has said little about the nominees themselves, but emphasized that he is squarely on the president-elect\u2019s side.

And it illustrates the challenges he\u2019s going to face in defending the Senate as an institution.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump 2.0 era on Capitol Hill is already here, with the president-elect pushing his party\u2019s lawmakers to fall in line regardless of their individual concerns. And the coming Senate confirmation fights over his advisers will be the first act in that drama.</p> <p>Collins is one of several more centrist Republicans whose votes Trump cannot necessarily count on for more contentious nominees; she made no secret this week of her shock over the Gaetz pick and said she wasn\u2019t sure Kennedy would even get a Senate-confirmed role.</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>Thune\u2019s personal confirmation battle next year will require him to bridge the gaps between more establishment-aligned Republicans like Collins, who are already skeptical about one or more of Trump\u2019s choices, and more MAGA-friendly GOP senators.</p> <p>The South Dakotan won the leadership battle in part by emphasizing his rebuilt relationship with the incoming president. And there\u2019s a substantial bloc of Senate Republicans who are eager to see Thune do whatever it takes to confirm Trump\u2019s advisers.</p> <p>\u201cI was struck [Wednesday] by how far he went and saying that \u2018there\u2019s no daylight between me and President Trump, we\u2019ll advance his agenda,\u2019\u201d said one Republican senator, noting Thune\u2019s openness to using recess appointments on Trump\u2019s picks.</p> <p>\u201cIf he tries to walk that back,\u201d this senator added, \u201cI think there will be hellfire and brimstone.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67375bc48f087357b482958a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-15T14:36:43.837Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/15/trump-treasury-secretary-lutnick-bessent/\">The Washington Post reports</a> that among the candidates for Treasury secretary are the co-chair of Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, Howard Lutnick, as well as hedge fund founder Scott Bessent.</strong></p> <p>Other names being tossed around are <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong>, a prominent White House economist during his first administration, or <strong>Robert Lighthizer</strong>, who served as a trade advisor.

Bessent is expected to be interviewed by Trump on Friday \u2014 as a rival contender for the post, the Trump transition co-chair and Wall Street banker Howard Lutnick, makes his own bid to become the most senior economic official in the U.S. government, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private meetings.</p> <p>The internal jockeying could have major repercussions not just for Trump\u2019s administration, but the trajectory of the U.S. economy over the next four years. The treasury secretary is responsible for a huge range of policy decisions, from taxes to tariffs to bank regulation, and will be tasked with executing some of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/16/trump-tariffs-impact-economy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5\">promises central</a> to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign.</p> <p>Trump, however, has not yet announced his choice for the pick even as he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/14/trump-lawyers-justice-department-blanche-bove-sauer/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f001&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_8\">fills out much of his Cabinet</a>. The impasse has prompted speculation among transition officials that Trump could still pick a third candidate for treasury secretary, such as former White House economist Larry Kudlow or top trade adviser Robert E. Lighthizer, although Bessent or Lutnick are still viewed as the favorites, according to two other people, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private deliberations.

      "bodyText": "This blog is closing now but you can continue to read our latest US political coverage here. Thank you for reading. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Donald Trump named Karoline Leavitt as his pick for White House press secretary. Leavitt, who would be the youngest White House press secretary in history, was the Trump campaign\u2019s national press secretary and served as assistant press secretary during his last administration. \u201cKaroline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,\u201d Trump said in a statement. Donald Trump said in a statement that he will appoint Doug Burgum as both interior secretary and the head of a new National Energy Council. Trump announced that the North Dakota governor would head up the department that handles oil and gas drilling on federal lands, rattling environmentalists who fear Burgum will pursue policies that will exacerbate the climate crisis. The Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, said he is against the ethics committee releasing its report into drug use and sexual misconduct by Matt Gaetz, the former representative nominated by Donald Trump to serve as attorney general. Donald Trump has appointed his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung as the next White House communications director. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary nominee, was reportedly involved in a sexual assault investigation in 2017 \u2013 a surprise to Trump\u2019s transition team \u2013 but no charges were filed. Dick Durbin, the outgoing Senate judiciary committee chair, warned that Trump\u2019s justice department will use its powers to \u201cseek vengeance\u201d. Mike Pence came out against Robert F Kennedy Jr to lead the health department, citing the nominee\u2019s support for abortion. Scott Bessent, a hedge fund founder, and Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, are reportedly in the running to head up the treasury. Rudy Giuliani surrendered a Mercedes-Benz, watches and a ring on Friday to two Georgia election workers who successfully sued him for defamation, according to PoliticoO. The former New York City mayor is still refusing to turn over other property to comply with a $148m judgment against him. The car and other valuables are the first pieces of property, aside from access to his New York City apartment, Giuliani has been forced to hand over to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, who won the $148m defamation verdict against him in 2023. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Matt Gaetz was an \u201cabsurd\u201d choice for Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general, during an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper: This is an absurd choice given that he has been outwardly under investigation by the House Ethics Committee, and then he resigned right before the report is to be released on charges of everything and allegations of sex trafficking and illicit drug use, and it appears as though a number of House members on both sides of the aisle has information about this. Justin Trudeau recalled that the last time Donald Trump took office, he pledged to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to Reuters. Trudeau made these comments among leaders of Pacific rim countries including the US and China on Friday, as they gathered in Peru for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Instead, Canada\u2019s prime minister said, the nations worked hard to find ways to forge new terms, known as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, that served as proof trade can be beneficial to all parties. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. And nothing is going to be easy this time,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cLittle secret: there is no American administration that is automatically easy for a Canadian government. They take a very robust look at their own interests, and Canada adjusts.\u201d Karoline Leavitt, who would be the youngest White House press secretary in history, ran for election to the US House to represent New Hampshire\u2019s 1st congressional district in 2022, losing in the general election, according to Iowa State University\u2019s Archives of Women\u2019s Political Communication. Leavitt graduated from Saint Anselm College in the state in 2019, earning a degree in politics and communication. As a student during the 2016 election, she began working for Fox News. After graduating, she worked for Donald Trump and served as a presidential writer and assistant press secretary in the press office. In June, CNN abruptly ended a live interview with Leavitt after she criticized the network\u2019s debate moderators, Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, both of whom had hosted the debate between Trump and Joe Biden in Atlanta. Leavitt described the debate as a \u201chostile environment on this very network\u201d and accused the moderators of having a biased history with Trump. This led to a heated exchange with CNN presenter Kasie Hunt. Karoline Leavitt was the Trump campaign\u2019s national press secretary and served as assistant press secretary during his last administration. \u201cKaroline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cI have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of North Dakota\u2019s Republican governor, Doug Burgum, as the interior secretary has prompted swift backlash from environmental advocacy groups alarmed at the incoming administration\u2019s plans to use federal lands for oil and gas drilling. Trump also announced in a statement on Friday his intention to make Burgum chair of a National Energy Council he intends to form to \u201coversee the path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE\u201d and to focus on \u201cthe battle for AI superiority\u201d. Burgum, a former businessman, has been governor since 2016 of North Dakota, which is the third largest oil and natural gas producer in the country. Burgum, if confirmed by the Senate, would manage US federal lands including national parks and wildlife refuges, as well as oversee relations with 574 federally recognized Native American tribes. Major concerns have loomed over the country\u2019s wildlife refuges and public lands as Trump prepares to enter the White House for a second term. Throughout his campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly said \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d and has vowed to carve up the Arctic national wildlife refuge in Alaska\u2019s northern tundra for oil and gas drilling. The Sierra Club, the country\u2019s largest non-profit environmental organization, said: \u201cIt was climate skeptic Doug Burgum who helped arrange the Mar-a-Lago meeting with wealthy oil and gas executives where Donald Trump offered to overturn dozens of environmental rules and regulations in exchange for $1bn in campaign contributions.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Maya Yang and Maanvi Singh wrote all about it: Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said that former representative Tulsi Gabbard, president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for national intelligence director, is \u201clikely a Russian asset.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no question I consider her someone who is likely a Russian asset,\u201d Wasserman Schultz told MSNBC on Friday. \u201cTulsi Gabbard is someone who has met with war criminals, violated the Department of State\u2019s guidance and secretly, clandestinely went to Syria and met with [Syrian President Bashar al-]Assad, who gassed and attacked his own people with chemical weapons,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s considered to be, essentially, by most assessments, a Russian asset.\u201d Members of the Democratic National Committee are already bracing for a fight to reorder the primary contests in the next presidential election. \u201cThe 2024 calendar will absolutely not be the calendar for 2028,\u201d Nebraska state party chair Jane Kleeb told NBC News. At least half a dozen DNC members, state chairs and DNC officials said there will be a full reexamination of the order of the states before the 2028 Democratic primary. Whatever calendar is settled on is a major factor to those presidential primary contenders, who spend most of their time and resources in states like South Carolina and Nevada, which serve to winnow down the pack before moving on to Super Tuesday. Donald Trump\u2019s transition team has bypassed standard background checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on some of the president-elect\u2019s cabinet nominees, it has been reported, minimising the chances of them being rejected for Senate confirmation based on any past transgressions or conflicts of interest. Such background checks \u2013 a longstanding tradition for incoming presidential nominations dating back decades to the early cold war \u2013 have instead been outsourced to private investigators. The revelation, first reported by CNN, comes as shock waves reverberate in Washington from at least three of Trump\u2019s proposed appointees: Matt Gaetz, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F Kennedy Jr for attorney general, director of national intelligence and health secretary, respectively. Moves to cut out the FBI appear to be in line with a pre-election memo drafted by his legal advisers and fit with Trump\u2019s enduring suspicion that the agency is part of what, without evidence, he believes to be a \u201cdeep state\u201d machine within the federal government bent on undermining him. The bureau\u2019s checks, based on convention rather than legislation, are intended to review nominees\u2019 track records for criminal histories, conflicts of interest or personal liabilities that might disqualify a candidate from being given security clearance. Here\u2019s more context: Wall Street ended a turbulent week with its biggest weekly losses in more than two months, as post-election optimism faded. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.3% on Friday and 2.1% for the week, while the Nasdaq declined 3.15% for the week. Early gains fueled by Donald Trump\u2019s pro-business election win and a Federal Reserve rate cut gave way to concerns over slower future rate cuts and inflation risks. Stocks in tech, healthcare and consumer-staples sectors slid, while vaccine makers dipped upon Trump\u2019s nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The FBI said that the racist text messages being sent to Black people across the country are now targeting high school students and Latino and LGBTQ+ communities. \u201cSome recipients reported being told they were selected for deportation or to report to a re-education camp,\u201d reads a statement from the FBI released Friday. \u201cThe messages have also been reported as being received via email communication.\u201d In the wake of the presidential election, college students and working professionals have received mass texts from unrecognized phone numbers. The hate-filled rhetoric has been reported in at least 30 states. People of color in states including Alabama, South Carolina, Georgia, New York, New Jersey, Nevada, the DC area and elsewhere reported receiving the messages. The messages were sent to Black adults and students, including to high schoolers in Massachusetts and New York, and students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), such as Alabama State University and other schools, including ones across Ohio, Clemson University, the University of Alabama and Missouri State. President Joe Biden praised the cooperation among South Korea, Japan and the US in countering what he described as North Korea\u2019s \u201cdangerous and destabilizing cooperation with Russia\u201d, according to the Associated Press. Biden spoke at the start of a meeting in Peru on Friday with Yoon Suk Yeol, the South Korean president, and Shigeru Ishiba, the Japanese prime minister, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The talks came amid heightened concerns about North Korea\u2019s growing military partnership with Russia and Pyongyang\u2019s stepped-up cadence of ballistic missile tests. Biden celebrated the partnership between Japan and South Korea, two countries that have historical enmity but that under Biden\u2019s presidency are now tightening security and economic ties as their corner of the world becomes more complicated. Biden noted that it would be his last meeting with them but that the trilateral partnership should be preserved for years to come. \u201cI\u2019m proud of how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhatever the issue, we\u2019ve taken it on together.\u201d The meeting comes as North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized earlier this year. Iran sent a message to the Biden administration in October stating it was not attempting to kill Donald Trump, aiming to reduce tensions with the US, according to the Wall Street Journal. The message, delivered through an intermediary, followed a September warning from the Biden administration that any Iranian attempt to kill Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate, would be considered \u201can act of war\u201d. Since Trump\u2019s election victory last week, some Iranian former officials, analysts and media figures have encouraged Tehran to engage with the president-elect and adopt a more cooperative stance, despite Trump allies\u2019 promises to reintroduce a hardline approach against Iran. The news comes the same week Elon Musk, whom Trump named as one of the heads of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, reportedly met with Iran\u2019s UN ambassador to discuss how to defuse tensions between Iran and the United States. A former Virginia lawmaker has pleaded guilty to felony gun and drug charges and been sentenced to time already served in jail, according to the Associated Press. Matt Fariss, who had served in the House of Delegates as a Republican since 2012 before running unsuccessfully last year as an independent, pleaded guilty Wednesday to meth possession and having a firearm while possessing an illegal drug, the Lynchburg News and Advance reported. Judge Dennis Lee Hupp sentenced Fariss in Campbell circuit court to three years in prison and suspended all but 20 days, according to the News and Advance. The appointment of a US health secretary with anti-vaccine views could cause deaths and have profound consequences around the world, global health experts fear. Robert F Kennedy Jr, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the position, has a history of spreading misinformation on vaccines and questioning the science of HIV and Aids. His nomination has been greeted with bemusement and alarm. One global health activist, speaking on background, said the move was akin to making the disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield, who falsely claimed that the MMR vaccine caused autism, the UK\u2019s health secretary. Prof Sir Simon Wessely, a regius professor of psychiatry at King\u2019s College London, said of the move: \u201cThat sound that you just heard was my jaw dropping, hitting the floor and rolling out of the door.\u201d Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said there was real concern that Kennedy might use the platform \u201cto pursue the same anti-science positions on life-saving public health interventions that he has advanced previously\u201d. He added: \u201cIf this makes families hesitate to immunise against the deadly diseases that threaten children, the consequence will be fatal for some.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Kat Lay and Kate Connolly explain what the latest appointment could mean: After Donald Trump nominated him to lead the interior department and the new National Energy Council, Doug Burgum, North Dakota\u2019s governor, wrote on X: I\u2019m deeply grateful to President @RealDonaldTrump for this amazing opportunity to serve the American people and achieve ENERGY DOMINANCE! Expect that energy dominance to involve a lot of fossil fuels. Here\u2019s more on what environmentalists fear Burgum as interior secretary could portend for fighting the climate crisis: The Guardian\u2019s Alice Herman has more on defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, who concerns experts for his adherence to a number of rightwing ideologies: Extremism experts are sounding the alarm about Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of defense, whose writings and online presence reveal someone immersed in a culture of rightwing Christianity, political extremism and violent ideation. The Fox &amp; Friends host, who has served in the US army but has no experience in government, drew shock from Pentagon officials when Trump nominated him. Hegseth\u2019s books on American culture and the military, his commentary on Fox and his frequent posts on social media showcase his far-right ideology. On these platforms, Hegseth telegraphs paranoia and anger toward \u201cleftists\u201d, an ultra-masculine Maga persona and apparent revulsion toward service members who do not fit his vision \u2013 including women. \u201cThe thing that really worries me, is both the ideology of Christian nationalism and what that\u2019s going to mean for the kind of policies he tries to put in place for the defense department,\u201d said Thomas Lecaque, a historian focusing on religion and political violence. Donald Trump said in a statement that he will appoint Doug Burgum as both interior secretary and the head of a new National Energy Council. Trump announced the North Dakota governor would head up the department that handles oil and gas drilling on federal lands, rattling environmentalists who fear Burgum will pursue policies that will exacerbate the climate crisis. \u201cI am thrilled to announce that Doug Burgum, the Governor of North Dakota, will be joining my Administration as both Secretary of the Interior and, as Chairman of the newly formed, and very important, National Energy Council, which will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis Council will oversee the path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE by cutting red tape, enhancing private sector investments across all sectors of the Economy, and by focusing on INNOVATION over longstanding, but totally unnecessary, regulation. With U.S. Energy Dominance, we will drive down Inflation, win the A.I. arms race with China (and others), and expand American Diplomatic Power to end Wars all across the World.\u201d Much can change between now and whenever the Senate begins considering Matt Gaetz\u2019s nomination for attorney general, likely after Donald Trump is sworn in on 20 January. But the Wall Street Journal reports that perhaps as many as 30 Republican senators will not support the former representative\u2019s nomination: Trump can afford to lose the support of no more than three GOP senators on his most contentious picks, assuming all Democrats are opposed, in a chamber that will be split 53-47 in the new Congress. People familiar with discussions among Senate Republicans said that far more than three of them are prepared to vote no if the matter comes to a vote, and some said there was already talk of trying to convince Trump to pull Gaetz, or get Gaetz to voluntarily withdraw his name. \u2018It\u2019s simply that Matt Gaetz has a very long, steep hill to get across the finish line,\u2019 said Sen Kevin Cramer (R, ND). \u2018And it will require the spending of a lot of capital, and you just have to ask: if you could get him across the finish line, was it worth the cost?\u2019 Cramer said he didn\u2019t think Gaetz would have the votes to be approved by the Judiciary Committee, much less to be confirmed by the full Senate. One person familiar with the conversations among Republican senators said \u2018significantly more than four\u2019 of them are opposed, which would be enough to tank Gaetz\u2019s chances. \u2018People are pissed,\u2019 the person said. Other estimates ranged from more than a dozen Republican \u2018no\u2019 votes to more than 30. \u2018It won\u2019t even be close,\u2019 another person said. \u2018It\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u2019 said Sen Markwayne Mullin (R, Okla), when asked if Gaetz could win the votes necessary for confirmation. Mullin, a close Trump ally, said he would keep an open mind because he trusts Trump to pick his cabinet. But he said Gaetz will have to go through the vigorous vetting process required of any nominee, and said the former Florida congressman might decide to opt out and withdraw. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of nominees, when they go through the process, they\u2019re like, \u2018You know, it\u2019s not going to happen,\u2019 and they pull out,\u201d Mullin said. In an interview with CNN, Mike Rounds, a Republican senator from South Dakota, said that the chamber should be able to see the House ethics committee\u2019s report into Matt Gaetz. \u201cWe do have a process in place which includes the ability to get that type of information, in many cases. And what we want to do is make good decisions based upon all the relevant facts and information that we can get,\u201d Rounds said. \u201cWe should be able to get a hold of it, and we should have access to it one way or another, based on the way that we do all of these nominations.\u201d Politico reports that the Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, said he is against the ethics committee releasing its report into drug use and sexual misconduct by Matt Gaetz, the former representative nominated by Donald Trump to serve as attorney general. \u201cI\u2019m going to strongly request that the ethics committee not issue the report, because that is not the way we do things in the House,\u201d Johnson said, hours after returning from a visit to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. \u201cAnd I think that would be a terrible precedent to set.\u201d The committee had reportedly been near to releasing its inquiry, but Gaetz\u2019s resignation has thrown into question whether such a report can be made public once a lawmaker exits the House. Some senators from both parties have said it should be shared with them, so they can assess Gaetz\u2019s candidacy to serve as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer. Donald Trump has also appointed his top ally Sergio Gor as assistant to the president and director of the presidential personnel office. Gor was the CEO of Winning Team Publishing while also serving for the pro-Trump Super Pac Right for America, the Trump-Vance campaign said. Commenting on the nominations of Steven Cheung (as White House communications director) and Gor, Trump said: Steven Cheung and Sergio Gor have been trusted advisors since my first presidential campaign in 2016, and have continued to champion American First principles throughout my first term, all the way to our historic victory in 2024 \u2026 I am thrilled to have them join my White House as we, Make America Great Again. Donald Trump has appointed his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung as the next White House communications director. Replacing Ben LaBolt, Cheung will be tasked with steering Trump\u2019s strategy of selling his presidency to the American people. In a statement on Friday, the Trump-Vance campaign said: Steven Cheung will return to the White House as assistant to the president and director of communications. Cheung was director of communications on the Trump-Vance 2024 presidential campaign and previously served in the Trump White House as director of strategic response. Donald Trump will appoint his main campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, as the White House communications director, Politico reports, citing someone familiar with the matter. Throughout the 2024 presidential campaign, Cheung was Trump\u2019s primary vessel to mainstream media outlets, frequently defending the president-elect and remaining close to his side at campaign events and rallies. Environmental groups are sounding the alarm over Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of North Dakota\u2019s governor, Doug Burgum, as interior secretary. Since 2016, the former businessman has been governor of North Dakota, which is the third-largest oil and natural gas producer in the country. Burgum, if confirmed by the Senate, would manage US federal lands including national parks and wildlife refuges, as well as oversee relations with 574 federally recognized Native American tribes. The Sierra Club, the country\u2019s largest non-profit environmental organization, said: \u201cIt was climate skeptic Doug Burgum who helped arrange the Mar-a-Lago meeting with wealthy oil and gas executives where Donald Trump offered to overturn dozens of environmental rules and regulations in exchange for $1bn in campaign contributions.\u201d Similarly, the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation policy organization focused on land and energy issues across the western states, said: \u201cDoug Burgum comes from an oil state, but North Dakota is not a public lands state. His cozy relationship with oil billionaires may endear him to Donald Trump, but he has no experience that qualifies him to oversee the management of 20% of America\u2019s lands.\u201d For the full story, click here: Donald Trump has not nominated anyone new for his cabinet yet today, but many names are flying around for top posts. Larry Kudlow could reportedly return to his old job heading the National Economic Council, or even the treasury, while Mike Rogers, who just lost election to the Senate from Michigan, may be tapped to lead the FBI. Meanwhile, we have learned more about Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary nominee. He was reportedly involved in a sexual assault investigation in 2017 \u2013 a surprise to Trump\u2019s transition team \u2013 but no charges were ever filed. The president-elect has taken to announcing his nominations in the later half of the day, so perhaps we will hear from him this afternoon. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Dick Durbin, the outgoing Senate judiciary committee chair, warned that Trump\u2019s justice department will use its powers to \u201cseek vengeance\u201d. Mike Pence came out against Robert F Kennedy Jr to lead the health department, citing the nominee\u2019s support for abortion. Scott Bessent, a hedge fund founder, and Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, are also reportedly in the running to head up the treasury. The outgoing Democratic chair of the Senate judiciary committee Dick Durbin warned that Donald Trump\u2019s appointees to top justice department posts are a sign that he will direct prosecutors and law enforcement to retaliate against his political opponents. Durbin singled out the president-elect\u2019s nomination of Todd Blanche, who defended Trump in his hush-money trial in New York, as deputy attorney general, and John Sauer, who argued before the supreme court in his immunity case, as solicitor general: Coupled with the announcement that he intends to nominate former Congressman Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, these selections show Donald Trump intends to weaponize the justice department to seek vengeance. Donald Trump viewed the justice department as his personal law firm during his first term, and these selections \u2013 his personal attorneys \u2013 are poised to do his bidding. The American people deserve a justice department that fights for equal justice under the law. This isn\u2019t it. Democrats are losing control of the Senate at the beginning of next year, and it will be up to the incoming Republican majority to confirm Trump\u2019s appointees. It is ultimately up to the Senate, and in particular its incoming Republican majority, to decide the fate of Donald Trump\u2019s nominees for cabinet posts. For a taste of the sentiment among congressional Republicans towards Trump\u2019s picks, here is the comment Steve Scalise, the Republican majority leader in the House of Representatives, gave to Punchbowl News when asked about Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s anti-vaccine views: Look, ultimately, he\u2019s going to be carrying out President Trump\u2019s agenda. You know, everybody comes in, with their own ideas, whether it\u2019s going to be RFK, whether it\u2019s Marco Rubio and foreign policy, but ultimately, when you take on a position like that, you\u2019re there to carry out President Trump\u2019s agenda for all the Cabinet Secretaries, and I have no doubt that they\u2019re all going to be focused on that mission and carrying out the mandate the voters gave us. Donald Trump may be bringing Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser during his first term, back to his administration, the Wall Street Journal reports. Kudlow is under consideration to perhaps lead the treasury department or the National Economic Council, which he led during Trump\u2019s first term. In that job, he was often on television downplaying the severity of the economic collapse caused by Covid-19 and predicting a rapid recovery. Kudlow has since become a host on Fox Business Network. Here\u2019s more, from the Journal: Donald Trump is considering tapping Fox Business Network host Larry Kudlow for a senior economic policy role in his administration, according to people familiar with the matter, amid the president-elect\u2019s mounting frustration with jockeying for top jobs. Kudlow met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect\u2019s private Florida club, late this week, the people said. Trump\u2019s advisers see Kudlow as a contender to lead the National Economic Council and possibly the Treasury Department. Kudlow and a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s transition team didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Kudlow, 77, served as NEC director for nearly three years, remaining in the role until the end of Trump\u2019s time in office. He has kept in regular touch with Trump. Kudlow has made regular appearances on Fox Business since leaving the White House. On his weekday show, Kudlow regularly touts Trump\u2019s economic policy proposals. His allies have made appeals directly to Trump to bring him back into the administration, the people said. Kudlow\u2019s stock has risen in Trump\u2019s orbit amid what one adviser to the president called a \u201ccold war\u201d between two other leading candidates for senior economic roles in the second term: billionaire Cantor Fitzgerald Chief Executive Howard Lutnick and investor Scott Bessent. Mike Rogers, a Republican former representative who just narrowly lost election to the Senate representing Michigan, is in the running to be FBI director under Donald Trump, Fox News reports. Citing sources familiar with the situation, the broadcaster reports Rogers met with Trump\u2019s transition team yesterday at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Rogers is a former FBI special agent, who was under consideration to lead the bureau during Trump\u2019s first term, a job that ultimately went to Christopher Wray. Here\u2019s more, from Fox: Will the second time be the charm for one-time Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent and former Rep Mike Rogers? Rogers, the 2024 Republican Senate nominee in Michigan who lost his election last week by a razor-thin margin, met Thursday with President-elect Trump\u2019s transition team regarding potentially serving as FBI director in the former and future president\u2019s second administration, sources familiar tell Fox News. The meeting took place at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. Rogers worked as a special agent with the FBI in its Chicago office and who served as chair of the House Intelligence Committee during the final four years of his decade-long tenure in Congress, was interviewed in 2017 during Trump\u2019s first administration to serve as FBI director after James Comey was dismissed. But Trump at the time decided to appoint Christopher Wray to the traditional ten-year term steering the federal law enforcement agency. Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House represents a setback for women who say he sexually assaulted them, the Guardian\u2019s Victoria Bekiempis reports: When Donald Trump was elected to a second term last week, women who say he sexually assaulted them, and other victims of sexual abuse, voiced disappointment that a man repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct could once again become president, with one of them describing this win as a \u201cgut punch\u201d. More than two dozen women have made such claims against Trump, including E Jean Carroll, who was awarded nearly $90m total in two civil trials after jurors found that Trump sexually abused and defamed her. She said on X: \u201cI tried to tell you.\u201d Several survivors of sexual assault interviewed by the Guardian, as well as advocates for persons who have suffered abuse, said they were not surprised by Trump\u2019s win. They felt it was another example of how sexual abuse is not taken seriously, or pointed to the fact that powerful people who perpetrate abuse seem to be able to avoid repercussions. Stacey Williams, who said she met Trump through Jeffrey Epstein about three decades ago, and told the Guardian that the now president-elect groped her at Trump Tower in 1993 in what seemed to be a \u201ctwisted game\u201d with the late sex predator, is among the many processing election results. \u201cI think what we were all hoping was that [the] truth would come through and the stories would affect people\u2019s vote once they had [them] in front of them.\u201d But, she said: \u201cDisinformation won this election at the end of the day, and if we don\u2019t figure out an answer for that, I don\u2019t have a lot of hope for this country.\u201d Fox News host Pete Hegseth, who Donald Trump nominated to be defense secretary, was involved in a sexual assault investigation in California seven years ago, but no charges were filed against him, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The incident happened in 2017 at a hotel and golf course in the city of Monterey, but there were few details of how Hegseth was involved, or what happened. Here\u2019s more, from the Chronicle: In a brief statement late Thursday, the city manager\u2019s office in Monterey confirmed the sexual assault investigation, but provided few details. The city said the incident was reported to have happened between almost midnight on Oct. 7, 2017, and 7 a.m. the next morning at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa on Del Monte Golf Course, less than a mile from Monterey Bay and across Highway 1 from the Naval Postgraduate School. \u201cThe Monterey Police Department investigated an alleged sexual assault at 1 Old Golf Course Road,\u201d the city said. It said the victim\u2019s name was confidential and that the alleged assault was reported on Oct. 12, 2017. The city said no weapons were involved, but that there was a report of \u201ccontusions to right thigh.\u201d The city declined to release the police report, saying it was exempt from public disclosure, and said it would not make any further remarks on the probe. The Monterey County District Attorney\u2019s Office did not reply to a request for comment late Thursday, but an online database indicated no criminal charges had been filed against Hegseth in that county. Vanity Fair reports that news of the allegation sent Trump\u2019s transition team scrambling over the past few days: Donald Trump\u2019s transition team scrambled Thursday after Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles was presented with an allegation that former Fox &amp; Friends cohost Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s nominee to be Defense Secretary, had engaged in sexual misconduct. According to two sources, Wiles was briefed Wednesday night about an allegation that Hegseth had acted inappropriately with a woman. One of the sources said the alleged incident took place in Monterey, California in 2017. According to the transition source, the allegation is serious enough that Wiles and Trump\u2019s lawyers spoke to Hegseth about it on Thursday. A source with knowledge of the meeting said that Hegseth said the allegation stemmed from a consensual encounter and characterized the episode as he-said, she-said. On Thursday evening, Hegseth\u2019s lawyer Timothy Parlatore said: \u201cThis allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it.\u201d Trump\u2019s communications director Steven Cheung said: \u201cPresident Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed. We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defense so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again.\u201d Mike Pence, who served as vice-president during Donald Trump\u2019s first term, announced his opposition to appointing Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health and human services, citing his views on abortion. \u201cThe Trump-Pence administration was unapologetically pro-life for our four years in office. There are hundreds of decisions made at HHS every day that either lead our nation toward a respect for life or away from it, and HHS under our administration always stood for life,\u201d Pence said in a statement released by his conservative nonprofit, Advancing American Freedom. \u201cI believe the nomination of RFK Jr. to serve as Secretary of HHS is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration and should be deeply concerning to millions of Pro-Life Americans who have supported the Republican Party and our nominees for decades.\u201d During his presidential campaign, which he ended in August and announced his support for Trump, Kennedy said he is in favor of abortion being legal up to a certain point. Pence fell out with Trump after refusing to go along with his attempts to stop Joe Biden from taking office after the 2020 election. Nonetheless, his words may hold some sway with conservative senators opposed to abortion. Here\u2019s the rest of his statement: For the majority of his career, RFK Jr. has defended abortion on demand during all nine months of pregnancy, supports overturning the Dobbs decision and has called for legislation to codify Roe v Wade. If confirmed, RFK, Jr. would be the most pro-abortion Republican appointed secretary of HHS in modern history. The pro-life movement has always looked to the Republican party to stand for life, to affirm an unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. On behalf of tens of millions of pro-life Americans, I respectfully urge Senate Republicans to reject this nomination and give the American people a leader who will respect the sanctity of life as secretary of Health and Human Services. John Thune, the South Dakota lawmaker who earlier this week was elected leader of the Senate Republicans, will be at the center of the confirmation hearings for Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks. He has said little about the nominees themselves, but emphasized that he is squarely on the president-elect\u2019s side. The Senate will \u201cdo the normal thing in vetting and confirmations hearings, etc. And it\u2019s a process. And we\u2019ll adhere to it, but try and expedite it,\u201d Thune told Semafor in a piece looking at the dynamics around Thune and the confirmation process. The upshot of the story: there\u2019s no reason to think that Senate Republicans are gearing up to block Trump\u2019s nominees, or at least not many of them. Here\u2019s more: \u201cJohn is talented at bringing people together and trying to find a path forward,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told Semafor. \u201cBut to have the Matt Gaetz nomination on the very day that he became chosen as leader was certainly unfortunate timing. And it illustrates the challenges he\u2019s going to face in defending the Senate as an institution.\u201d The Trump 2.0 era on Capitol Hill is already here, with the president-elect pushing his party\u2019s lawmakers to fall in line regardless of their individual concerns. And the coming Senate confirmation fights over his advisers will be the first act in that drama. Collins is one of several more centrist Republicans whose votes Trump cannot necessarily count on for more contentious nominees; she made no secret this week of her shock over the Gaetz pick and said she wasn\u2019t sure Kennedy would even get a Senate-confirmed role. \u2026 Thune\u2019s personal confirmation battle next year will require him to bridge the gaps between more establishment-aligned Republicans like Collins, who are already skeptical about one or more of Trump\u2019s choices, and more MAGA-friendly GOP senators. The South Dakotan won the leadership battle in part by emphasizing his rebuilt relationship with the incoming president. And there\u2019s a substantial bloc of Senate Republicans who are eager to see Thune do whatever it takes to confirm Trump\u2019s advisers. \u201cI was struck [Wednesday] by how far he went and saying that \u2018there\u2019s no daylight between me and President Trump, we\u2019ll advance his agenda,\u2019\u201d said one Republican senator, noting Thune\u2019s openness to using recess appointments on Trump\u2019s picks. \u201cIf he tries to walk that back,\u201d this senator added, \u201cI think there will be hellfire and brimstone.\u201d The Washington Post reports that among the candidates for Treasury secretary are the co-chair of Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, Howard Lutnick, as well as hedge fund founder Scott Bessent. Other names being tossed around are Larry Kudlow, a prominent White House economist during his first administration, or Robert Lighthizer, who served as a trade advisor. Whoever Trump picks will likely be tasked with implementing the tariffs he has threatened to impose on US trade partners, in order to bend them to his will on issues such as immigration and reshoring jobs. Here\u2019s more, from the Post: When Scott Bessent left President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach, Florida, last Friday, his allies were optimistic that the hedge fund executive was virtually certain to be named the next treasury secretary. On Thursday, however, Bessent again flew to Florida with his bid for the Cabinet post still hanging in the balance. Bessent is expected to be interviewed by Trump on Friday \u2014 as a rival contender for the post, the Trump transition co-chair and Wall Street banker Howard Lutnick, makes his own bid to become the most senior economic official in the U.S. government, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private meetings. The internal jockeying could have major repercussions not just for Trump\u2019s administration, but the trajectory of the U.S. economy over the next four years. The treasury secretary is responsible for a huge range of policy decisions, from taxes to tariffs to bank regulation, and will be tasked with executing some of the promises central to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign. Trump, however, has not yet announced his choice for the pick even as he fills out much of his Cabinet. The impasse has prompted speculation among transition officials that Trump could still pick a third candidate for treasury secretary, such as former White House economist Larry Kudlow or top trade adviser Robert E. Lighthizer, although Bessent or Lutnick are still viewed as the favorites, according to two other people, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private deliberations. (Kudlow has said Bessent is his own top pick for the position.) Might Donald Trump\u2019s allies in the Senate wind up rejecting some of his most controversial picks to lead federal departments, such as Robert F Kennedy Jr for health secretary? Perhaps, but we will probably only find that out for sure in the weeks to come, and particularly once confirmation hearings for the nominees begin early next year. Despite Kennedy\u2019s peddling of conspiracy theories and misinformation about vaccines, Republican senators appeared open to considering him for the job leading the country\u2019s health policy and research. Louisiana\u2019s Bill Cassidy who, it should be noted, is himself a doctor, said Kennedy \u201chas championed issues like healthy foods and the need for greater transparency in our public health infrastructure. I look forward to learning more about his other policy positions and how they will support a conservative, pro-American agenda.\u201d News that Donald Trump had nominated conspiracy theorist and vaccine critic Robert F Kennedy Jr as his health secretary sent shares of major pharmaceutical companies lower in European trading today, the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney and Graeme Wearden report. US markets have not opened yet, but we\u2019ll see if the bloodletting continues: Investors in pharmaceutical companies are selling off stock after Donald Trump nominated the anti-vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy Jr to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services. RFK Jr has embraced numerous health-related conspiracy theories, and is one of the most persistent and influential vaccine deniers in the US. Trump\u2019s announcement sent shares in some of the world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical companies \u2013 including Moderna, AstraZeneca and GSK \u2013 falling on Friday morning. RFK Jr has said vaccines are linked to autism in children, that HIV is not the cause of Aids and that some antidepressants are linked to a rise in school shootings. RFK Jr \u2013 and Trump \u2013 are mulling banning fluoride in drinking water, while he has also called for bans on hundreds of food additives and chemicals and wants to cut ultra-processed foods from school lunches as part of a plan to reduce diet-related chronic diseases. Announcing his choice, Trump said the health department would play a \u201cbig role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming health crisis in this country\u201d. Republicans are set to take control of the Senate next year, where one of their first jobs will be to confirm Donald Trump\u2019s nominees for cabinet posts. Should they object to the president-elect\u2019s picks, he has threatened to make use of recess appointments, an archaic tactic that would allow him to circumvent the chamber and its objectors. Here\u2019s more on how that would work, from the Guardian\u2019s Joan E Greve: Several Republican senators expressed shock on Wednesday when Donald Trump announced he would nominate Matt Gaetz, the hard-right congressman known for instigating fights with members of his own party, as attorney general. \u201cThe president obviously has the right to nominate whomever he wants, but I think this is an example of why it\u2019s so important that we have the advice and consent provisions in the constitution,\u201d the Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m sure that there will be many, many questions raised at Mr Gaetz\u2019s hearing, if in fact the nomination goes forward.\u201d But the president-elect has proposed an archaic and in recent years little-used mechanism to get his nominees installed without Senate confirmation: recess appointments. \u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,\u201d Trump said on Sunday. \u201cWe need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\u201d If Trump pursues a strategy of recess appointments, it could severely curtail the Senate\u2019s power to serve as a check on the new president\u2019s nominations and allow controversial picks such as Gaetz to move forward. Here\u2019s everything to know about recess appointments: Donald Trump has made several nominations to his cabinet, including Robert F Kennedy Jr for health secretary and Matt Gaetz for attorney general, both picks that have drawn objections from Democrats. But many roles remain unfilled. Among these is Treasury secretary, a key role when it comes to managing the economy and government expenditures, and energy secretary, which could have huge influence on fighting the climate crisis (to the extent that Trump is interested in that) and regulating oil and gas production. Here\u2019s a look at who he has picked so far, and which nominees we are still waiting for: Betting markets had a great election. With billions of dollars wagered on who would take the White House, their projections proved closer to the actual result than many opinion polls. Now the operators behind them want the US to wager on almost everything else. Forget Trump or Harris. Is Billie Eilish going to win album of the year at the Grammys? How many federal government employees are about to lose their jobs? Will mpox be declared a pandemic this year? All these markets, and hundreds more, were available this week on Kalshi \u2013 the platform which, just five weeks before polling day, won approval in a federal appeals court to legally host election betting in the US for the first time. The result was \u201castronomical\u201d, according to its CEO, Tarek Mansour, with more than $1bn worth of trades in a single month. But by the next presidential election, in November 2028, he wants hundreds of billions of dollars worth of trades in a single month. Members of Congress and other US public officials targeted for \u201cretribution\u201d by Donald Trump say they are taking extraordinary security precautions for themselves and their families and are now bracing for scenarios as extreme as the possibility of being rounded up and arrested, after Trump returns to the White House. Two Democratic House members who have been vocal in their criticisms of Trump and his policy agenda told the Guardian they and their colleagues are preparing for \u201csome pretty surreal and dystopic scenarios\u201d. They range from bogus investigations or tax audits of present and former members of the federal government to out-and-out violence inspired by Trump\u2019s rhetoric of revenge. \u201cI hope none of my Democratic colleagues become American corollaries to Alexander Navalny,\u201d said congressman Jared Huffman of California, referring to the Russian opposition leader and outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin who survived being poisoned before dying in an Arctic prison. \u201c[My colleagues in the House] are thinking about legal defenses against a weaponized Department of Justice,\u201d Huffman added. \u201cThey may have to be ready to be arrested and rounded up. They have to have family plans protecting themselves in ways I don\u2019t even like to talk about publicly \u2026 \u201cI have so many colleagues living under constant violent threats toward them and their families and their staff \u2026 These are dark times. We all have our eyes wide open.\u201d When Donald Trump was elected to a second term last week, women who say he sexually assaulted them, and other victims of sexual abuse, voiced disappointment that a man repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct could once again become president, with one of them describing this win as a \u201cgut punch\u201d. More than two dozen women have made such claims against Trump, including E Jean Carroll, who was awarded nearly $90m total in two civil trials after jurors found that Trump sexually abused and defamed her. She said on X: \u201cI tried to tell you.\u201d Several survivors of sexual assault interviewed by the Guardian, as well as advocates for persons who have suffered abuse, said they were not surprised by Trump\u2019s win. They felt it was another example of how sexual abuse is not taken seriously, or pointed to the fact that powerful people who perpetrate abuse seem to be able to avoid repercussions. Stacey Williams, who said she met Trump through Jeffrey Epstein about three decades ago, and told the Guardian that the now president-elect groped her at Trump Tower in 1993 in what seemed to be a \u201ctwisted game\u201d with the late sex predator, is among the many processing election results. \u201cI think what we were all hoping was that [the] truth would come through and the stories would affect people\u2019s vote once they had [them] in front of them.\u201d But, \u201cdisinformation won this election at the end of the day, and if we don\u2019t figure out an answer for that, I don\u2019t have a lot of hope for this country.\u201d Emails to Trump\u2019s camp did not receive an immediate response. Trump has previously denied all allegations of misconduct. US president-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday that a government efficiency panel headed up by billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk will issue reports in its work to streamline the US government. \u201cThey will be coming out with individual reports and a big one at the end,\u201d Trump said in a speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, providing the first new detail on the panel\u2019s output since it was announced earlier this week. Trump on Tuesday said the panel would \u201cprovide advice and guidance from outside government,\u201d on slimming down the government, cutting regulations, reducing spending and restructuring federal agencies, Reuters reported. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday that North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, a wealthy former software company executive, will be his pick for interior secretary. \u201cHe\u2019s going to head the Department of Interior, and it\u2019s going to be fantastic,\u201d a tuxedo-wearing Trump said at a gala at his Mar-a-Lago Florida retreat, adding that he would make an official announcement on Friday. Burgum, 68, has portrayed himself as a traditional, business-minded conservative. He ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination before quitting and becoming a loyal Trump supporter, appearing at fundraisers and advocating for Trump on television, Reuters reported. At the gala, which featured tech billionaire Elon Musk, actor Sylvester Stallone and members of his incoming administration, Trump praised his latest cabinet picks and made some of his longest remarks since his presidential election victory speech. \u201cNobody knew we were going to win it the way we won it,\u201d Trump said. He teased Musk about his ongoing post-election stay at Mar-a-Lago. Musk is involved in some of Trump\u2019s meetings at the oceanfront property. \u201cI can\u2019t get him out of here. He just loves this place. And I like having him here,\u201d said Trump. At the end of the event, Musk mounted the stage. \u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear. The people have spoken, the people want change,\u201d he said. Fears that Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency will be more extreme than his first have intensified amid a flurry of senior nominations that opponents have criticised as going from bad to worse. Dismay over some of the president-elect\u2019s early picks escalated to outrage after the far-right Florida congressman Matt Gaetz was unveiled as his selection to be attorney general \u2013 a position Trump has previously said he views as the most important in his administration. The choice provoked disbelief, even among Republicans, and has fueled concerns that Trump is intent on carrying out mass firings at the Department of Justice in retribution for criminal investigations it instigated against him. Trump reportedly chose Gaetz, 42, after the congressman \u2013 who himself was subject to a two-year justice department investigation into suspected sex-trafficking that ended without charges \u2013 told Trump: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go over there and start cuttin\u2019 fuckin\u2019 heads.\u201d Others considered for the post were dismissed as too concerned with legal concepts or constitutional niceties. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are asking Americans who are \u201chigh-IQ small-government revolutionaries\u201d and willing to work over 80 hours a week to join their new Department of Government Efficiency \u2013 at zero pay. In a new X post on Thursday that doubled as a job announcement and another one of Musk\u2019s trolling attempts, the account for the newly formed Doge wrote: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more part-time idea generators. We need super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\u201d The name of the department, which is not part of the federal government, harkens back to a meme of an expressive shiba inu dog. \u201cIf that\u2019s you, DM this account with your CV. Elon &amp; Vivek will review the top 1% of applicants,\u201d the statement added. In a separate post, Musk chimed in on the callout, saying: \u201cIndeed, this will be tedious work, make lots of enemies &amp; compensation is zero.\u201d \u201cWhat a great deal!\u201d Musk, the richest man in the world, wrote with a laughing emoji. He has promised to reduce federal bureaucracy by a third and cut $2tn from US government spending, an endeavor he said \u201cnecessarily involves some temporary hardship\u201d. Earlier this week, Donald Trump announced the appointment of Musk and Ramaswamy to Doge, saying: \u201cTogether, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies \u2013 essential to the \u2018Save America\u2019 movement.\u201d Trump went on to describe the newly formed department as the \u201c\u2018Manhattan Project\u2019 of our time,\u201d referring to the US-led research program during the second world war that sought to create the nuclear bomb, which killed an estimated 214,000 people in Japan in 1945. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest news from Washington over the next few hours. We start with the news that Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr as US secretary of health and human services has prompted widespread criticisms towards Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist who has embraced a slew of other debunked health-related conspiracy theories. In a Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump claimed that Americans have been \u201ccrushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies\u201d and that Kennedy \u201cwill restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!\u201d In response to Kennedy\u2019s nomination, Public Citizen, a progressive nonprofit organization focusing on consumer advocacy, said: \u201cRobert F Kennedy Jr is a clear and present danger to the nation\u2019s health. He shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the building at the department of health and human services (HHS), let alone be placed in charge of the nation\u2019s public health agency.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s bungling of public health policy during the Covid pandemic cost hundreds of thousands of lives. By appointing Kennedy as his secretary of HHS, Trump is courting another, policy-driven public health catastrophe,\u201d the organization added. For more on that, see our full report here: In other news: The FBI should investigate both Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard before they are confirmed for their cabinet posts, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton has said. Gabbard, who Trump nominated as director of national intelligence, is known for her tolerant view of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Elon Musk reportedly met Iran\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations on Monday, and discussed how to defuse tensions between Iran and the US, two Iranian officials told the New York Times. As Trump prepares to address conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, has been assisting in discussions with foreign officials, establishing himself as the country\u2019s most influential civilian come January. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are seeking Americans who are \u201chigh-IQ small-government revolutionaries\u201d and willing to work over 80 hours a week to join their new department, at zero pay. Trump named Musk to co-lead the newly created government efficiency department that sits outside the federal government. Advocates have urged state governments to find new ways to defend immigrants and block Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan. California shielded many non-citizen residents from removal in Trump\u2019s first term but immigrants rights groups warn an aggressive, multi-pronged response will be needed. A Democratic lawmaker will file a motion specifically mentioning Trump can only serve two terms, after the president-elect joked he would be willing to serve an unconstitutional third term as president while meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday. Trump announced his former Georgia congressman Doug Collins as secretary of veterans affairs. Collins ran for Senate in 2020, finishing third in the primary. He also \u201cprovided counsel to Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election as Trump sought to challenge Georgia\u2019s election results\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Buying a home in a national park comes at a 25% price premium, with the New Forest the most expensive of the 13 parks in England and Wales, according to Britain\u2019s biggest building society. Nationwide said properties in a national park enjoy a valuation almost \u00a367,000 more than a similar property elsewhere, based on the average UK house price of \u00a3266,640. The building society found the premium attached to national park living was not only due to the great outdoors factor but also to restrictions on new housing developments within the borders of parks. \u201cNational parks continue to be highly desirable areas to live in, thanks to the beautiful countryside,\u201d said Andrew Harvey, a senior economist at Nationwide. \u201cThose living in such areas are ideally placed to make the most of the great outdoors and take advantage of a range of activities and amenities.

The cheapest is Dorset at \u00a3323,000.
