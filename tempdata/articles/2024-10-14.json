      "bodyText": "Canadian police accused Indian diplomats and consular staff of \u201cclandestine\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d activities in the country on Monday night, hours after senior diplomats were expelled from both countries in an escalating geopolitical row. Speaking to reporters at a hastily organised press conference, the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted police (RCMP) said the force had evidence of \u201cagents\u201d acting on behalf of the Indian government engaging in extortion, intimidation, coercion and harassment. Commissioner Mike Duheme told reporters: \u201cInvestigations have revealed that Indian diplomats and consular officials based in Canada leveraged their official positions to engage in clandestine activities, such as collecting information for the government of India, either directly or through their proxies; and other individuals who acted voluntarily or through coercion.\u201d The revelations from the RCMP are the first official glimpse from police into the scope and depth of India\u2019s alleged activities in Canada, which have rocked the country\u2019s politics ever since the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, accused India of assassinating the prominent Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in the province of British Columbia last year. Trudeau said on Monday night: \u201cWe will never tolerate the involvement of a foreign government threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil. India has made a monumental mistake in choosing to use their diplomats and organised crime to attack Canadians.\u201d The government now has \u201cclear and compelling evidence that agents of the government of India have engaged in, and continue to engage in, activities that pose a significant threat to public safety,\u201d he added. These activities involved clandestine information gathering techniques, coercive behaviour, targeting South Asian Canadians and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including murder, he said. Canada\u2019s foreign minister, M\u00e9lanie Joly, said the RCMP had gathered \u201cample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case\u201d. She said India was asked to waive diplomatic and consular immunity and cooperate in the investigation but refused to cooperate. \u201cRegrettably, as India did not agree, and given the ongoing public safety concerns for Canadians, Canada served notices of expulsion to these individuals,\u201d Joly said. She asked that India\u2019s government support the ongoing investigation \u201cas it remains in both our countries\u2019 interest to get to the bottom of this\u201d. In recent months, activists have accused India of a carefully orchestrated campaign of \u201ctransnational terrorism\u201d that targets Sikhs. Duheme did not indicate how many killings Indian officials had been linked to in Canada, but said the \u201cbreadth and depth of criminal activity\u201d was a threat to the safety of Canadians. Senior Canadian national security and intelligence officials presented their Indian counterparts with their findings over the weekend, including evidence that allegedly implicated India\u2019s high commissioner, Sanjay Kumar Verma, in the killing of Nijjar, a source familiar with the investigation said. Assistant Commissioner Brigitte Gauvin told reporters the actions of Indian diplomats were \u201ca contravention of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, but also it goes against Canada\u2019s values as a society\u201d. In a statement earlier on Monday, India\u2019s foreign ministry said it had no faith in the Canadian government\u2019s ability to assure the security of its top diplomats and had \u201cdecided to withdraw the high commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials\u201d. However, Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail newspaper and the Associated Press quoted unnamed Canadian officials alleging that it was Canada that had expelled the Indian diplomats first, after evidence implicated Verma and six top diplomats in the assassination of Nijjar. Nijjar, a Canadian Sikh, was gunned down outside a gurdwara in the city of Surrey in June last year. He had been a vocal advocate for the Khalistan movement, which advocates for an independent homeland for Sikhs and is banned in India. The Indian government had accused Nijjar of involvement in Khalistani terrorism. In the aftermath of Nijjar\u2019s killing, Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, took the unusual step of publicly announcing there were \u201ccredible allegations\u201d that the Indian government was involved in Nijjar\u2019s assassination. India denied the charges, calling them \u201cabsurd\u201d. On Monday, India\u2019s foreign ministry strongly rejected the allegations against its diplomats and said they were \u201cludicrous and deserve to be treated with contempt\u201d. They later announced that six top Canadian diplomats would be expelled from New Delhi in within five days. Contrary to the RCMP\u2019s statements, the Indian ministry spokesperson claimed Canada had not shared any further evidence about Indian state involvement in the fatal shooting since Trudeau had made the allegations in September 2023. \u201cThis leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains,\u201d the Indian ministry said. Nijjar\u2019s murder prompted officials and activists to accuse the Modi government of carrying out a campaign of transnational killings against those it considered to be threats to the state. The accusations were further fuelled last November after US agencies said they had thwarted an assassination attempt by an Indian government official to murder Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a firebrand Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the US and Canada. Other prominent Sikh Khalistani activists in the US, Canada and the UK also said they had also been given warnings of threats to their lives. According to intelligence officials who spoke to the Guardian this year, India had also ordered the assassination of dozens of individuals in Pakistan, including Sikhs, as part of a wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil. Last year, the White House said it took the allegations of India\u2019s involvement in attempted killings on US soil \u201cwith utmost seriousness\u201d and confirmed it had been raised at the highest levels of the Indian government. The Indian government set up its own investigation into Pannun\u2019s killing. According to the US state department, Indian officials are due to visit Washington DC this week as part of the inquiry. However, the post about the visit was removed hours later.",

Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>More than 20 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Christian town in northern Lebanon on Monday</strong>,<strong> </strong>far from Hezbollah\u2019s power centres in Beirut and the south and east of the country.<strong> </strong>The bombing struck Aitou, a Maronite village near the northern city of Tripoli, hit a small apartment building, killing 21 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross. The village\u2019s mayor told Reuters that the building had been rented to families displaced by the war.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Israeli strike on Aitou was one of several over the past two weeks targeting areas thought to be \u201csafe\u201d</strong>, including the bombing of a displacement centre in the southern town of Wardaniyeh last week. Israel is facing international criticism for at least three violations that have injured five members of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>It was also a particularly bloody 24 hours in the Gaza Strip.</strong> Four people were killed in an Israeli bombing of a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, another strike on a nearby school used as a shelter killed at least 20 people, and a drone strike killed five children playing on the street in al-Shati camp in Gaza City, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties in the three incidents on Sunday and Monday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>At least four people were killed after an Israeli airstrike hit near the grounds of al-Aqsa hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah early on Monday</strong>. The bombing triggered a large fire, leaving 25 people with severe burns. Footage showed people desperately trying to extinguish the flames as explosions could be heard within the camp.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>An Israeli airstrike killed at least 20 people, including children, at the Al-Mufti school in central Gaza on Sunday night, </strong>medics said. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war when it was struck by a volley of artillery, killing entire families and wounding dozens more.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>An Israeli airstrike killed at least eight Palestinians and wounded many others in Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood</strong>, medics said on Monday. At least 10 Palestinians were killed and at least 30 injured in Israeli airstrikes on a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza,<strong> </strong>Palestinian medics said. Five children in al-Shati camp in Gaza City were also killed on Sunday in a drone strike, Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>At least 42,289 Palestinians have been killed and 98,684 wounded in Israeli strikes since 7 October 2023</strong>,<strong> </strong>the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas</strong>, according to a report. The plan proposed by a group of retired generals would give Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone.

While the system has taken down drones repeatedly, many have penetrated Israel\u2019s airspace and sidestepped its defences, in some cases with deadly results.<br><br>An Israeli security official said Israel was still investigating how the drone made it through Israel\u2019s air defences. A pair of drones initially entered Israeli airspace, but while one was shot down, the other one continued to its target.</p> \n  <p>Air raid sirens had blared in northern Israel as the aircraft flew overhead. But no sirens sounded at the base, giving the soldiers no advance warning and indicating that the drone may have fallen off Israel\u2019s radar.<br><br>Hezbollah said the drone was \u201cable to penetrate the Israeli air defence radars without being detected\u201d and reach its target.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has hit out at the United Nations for failing to prevent Israel from firing at its peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. Erdogan said on Monday the UN was also to blame for failing to sanction Israel over its wars with Hezbollah and with Hamas in Gaza. AFP reports: \u201cThe image of the UN which cannot protect its own personnel is shameful and worrying,\u201d Erdogan, a fierce critic of Israel, said in a televised address. \u201cFrankly, we ask ourselves what the (UN) security council is waiting for to stop Israel. \u201cCan you believe it? The Israeli tanks penetrate into the Unifil zone, attack peacekeeping soldiers, even wounding some of them, but the UN security council decides to just watch all this criminality from its stands -- that\u2019s what we call powerlessness.\u201d The UN condemned the attacks with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saying they \u201cmay constitute a war crime\u201d. There are reports in Israeli media that rocket sirens are sounding in the northern town of Shtula near the western Galilee. The alert comes minutes after a rocket alarm sounded in Margaliyot near Kiryat Shmona in the eastern Galilee Panhandle. There were no immediate reports of impacts or injuries. The United Nations security council voiced \u201cstrong concerns\u201d Monday after incidents in which UN peacekeepers in Lebanon have been injured, AFP reports, as Israel presses its campaign against Hezbollah militants in its northern neighbour. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of ongoing hostilities along the Blue Line, the members of the Security Council expressed their strong concerns after several Unifil positions came under fire in the past days. Several peacekeepers have been wounded,\u201d said the council\u2019s rotating presidency, currently Switzerland\u2019s UN ambassador Pascale Baeriswyl. In the statement, which did not single out Israel, the 15 council members \u201curged all parties to respect the safety and security of Unifil personnel and premises. They recalled that UN peacekeepers and UN premises must never be the target of an attack.\u201d The council\u2019s intervention followed two closed meetings on the deteriorating situation in Lebanon. It\u2019s 1am in Gaza, Beirut and Tel Aviv. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: More than 20 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Christian town in northern Lebanon on Monday, far from Hezbollah\u2019s power centres in Beirut and the south and east of the country. The bombing struck Aitou, a Maronite village near the northern city of Tripoli, hit a small apartment building, killing 21 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross. The village\u2019s mayor told Reuters that the building had been rented to families displaced by the war. The Israeli strike on Aitou was one of several over the past two weeks targeting areas thought to be \u201csafe\u201d, including the bombing of a displacement centre in the southern town of Wardaniyeh last week. Israel is facing international criticism for at least three violations that have injured five members of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. It was also a particularly bloody 24 hours in the Gaza Strip. Four people were killed in an Israeli bombing of a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, another strike on a nearby school used as a shelter killed at least 20 people, and a drone strike killed five children playing on the street in al-Shati camp in Gaza City, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties in the three incidents on Sunday and Monday. At least four people were killed after an Israeli airstrike hit near the grounds of al-Aqsa hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah early on Monday. The bombing triggered a large fire, leaving 25 people with severe burns. Footage showed people desperately trying to extinguish the flames as explosions could be heard within the camp. An Israeli airstrike killed at least 20 people, including children, at the Al-Mufti school in central Gaza on Sunday night, medics said. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war when it was struck by a volley of artillery, killing entire families and wounding dozens more. An Israeli airstrike killed at least eight Palestinians and wounded many others in Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, medics said on Monday. At least 10 Palestinians were killed and at least 30 injured in Israeli airstrikes on a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Palestinian medics said. Five children in al-Shati camp in Gaza City were also killed on Sunday in a drone strike, Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said. At least 42,289 Palestinians have been killed and 98,684 wounded in Israeli strikes since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas, according to a report. The plan proposed by a group of retired generals would give Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants \u2013 meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them \u2013 and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to the Associated Press. Lebanese officials said an Israeli airstrike hit near an aid convoy in Lebanon on Monday, wounding a driver and lightly damaging the trucks. The humanitarian aid, which reached Beirut on Monday, was marked with the flags of Turkey and the United Arab Emirates as well as the Red Cross insignia. Hezbollah appeared to respond to the strike on Aitou by firing a salvo of at least three rockets at Israel\u2019s commercial and diplomatic centre, Tel Aviv, on Monday. Air raid sirens were triggered across vast swathes of central and northern Israel, but the attack was intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence systems. Hezbollah inflicted the deadliest attack so far on Israel during the two-week-old war on Sunday, in a drone strike on a military base near Binyamina that killed four soldiers and severely wounded another seven. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, vowed \u201ca forceful response\u201d to the attack during a phone call with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Monday. Netanyahu vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy. \u201cWe will continue to mercilessly strike Hezbollah in all parts of Lebanon \u2013 including Beirut,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said on Monday. Israel\u2019s military said that three projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, and that all of them had been intercepted, following reports that sirens were sounding across the country. The Israeli military said it also intercepted two drones approaching from Syria, a day after a drone attack by Hezbollah on a base killed four soldiers. The UN\u2019s secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, condemned the \u201clarge number of civilian casualties in the intensifying Israeli campaign in northern Gaza\u201d, his spokesperson said on Monday. The UN chief \u201cstrongly urges all parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and emphasises that civilians must be respected and protected at all times,\u201d spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric said. The UN\u2019s human rights office said it was appalled by more than a week of heavy Israeli strikes on northern Gaza, where it said tens of thousands of civilians are trapped without food or supplies. It said the Israeli army \u201cappears to be cutting off north Gaza completely from the rest of the Gaza Strip and conducting hostilities with absolute disregard for the lives and security of Palestinian civilians\u201d. Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Monday, the Palestinian health ministry said. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, one of the men was 17 years old. Four others were injured by Israeli fire during the raid, it said. Italy, Britain, France and Germany released a joint statement on Monday condemning Israel for repeatedly attacking UN peacekeepers. \u201cThese attacks must stop immediately,\u201d they said, adding deliberate attacks were against international law.. Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said there would be \u201cno withdrawal\u201d of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Unifil\u2019s work \u201cis very important. It\u2019s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.\u201d Netanyahu said accusations Israeli troops had deliberately harmed peacekeepers were \u201ccompletely false\u201d, as he repeated a call for them to withdraw from combat zones close to the border. The Israeli leader said Hezbollah used Unifil positions as cover for attacks that have killed Israelis. Israel\u2019s infrastructure minister, Eli Cohen, accused Unifil of being a \u201cshield for Hezbollah\u201d and called on Guterres to remove the force. The UN\u2019s peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said peacekeepers would stay in all positions in Lebanon despite Israel\u2019s calls for them to move. Unifil earlier said Israeli tanks forcibly entered the gates of one position early Sunday and destroyed the main gate. They later fired smoke rounds near peacekeepers, causing skin irritation. The UN peacekeeping mission called the incident a \u201cfurther flagrant violation of international law\u201d. Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin, accused Israel of trying to prevent the world from seeing what its troops are doing in Lebanon and Gaza, and of working to undermine the UN. Asked what Israel\u2019s aim might be in demanding that UN peacekeepers leave their bases in Lebanon after a series of attacks, Martin said: \u201cessentially to drive the eyes and ears out of south Lebanon and to give itself free rein\u201d. Germany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, and economics minister Robert Habeck, are said to have blocked German arms exports to Israel over concerns as to what the weapons would be used for, according to German media reports. No military exports to Israel have been approved since March according to the reports. Officials from the US\u2019s main humanitarian agency attend daily meetings on an Israeli military base that also hosts a notorious prison for Palestinian detainees where torture reportedly runs rampant, the Guardian has learned. Australia has warned its citizens not to travel to Israel and urged Australians there to leave the country while commercial flights remained available. In a post on Twitter/X on Monday reported by Reuters, the Australian foreign minister Penny Wong wrote: The Australian government has serious concerns the security situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories could deteriorate rapidly. There continues to be a high threat of military and terrorist attacks against Israel and Israeli interests across the region, according to the Australian government\u2019s travel advisory. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, has told the Biden administration he is willing to strike military rather than oil or nuclear facilities in Iran, according to a report. Citing sources, the Washington Post writes that this suggests that Netanyahu is considering a more limited counterstrike in retaliation for Iran\u2019s missile barrage launched on 1 October. UN peacekeepers will stay in all positions in Lebanon, the UN\u2019s peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said on Monday, despite Israeli calls for them to withdraw from areas of southern Lebanon. Israel is facing international criticism for at least three violations in the past week that have injured five members of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, Unifil. On Sunday, two Israeli tanks destroyed a gate and forcibly entered a Unifil base. As we reported earlier, Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated a call for peacekeepers to withdraw from combat zones close to the border. Lacroix said: The decision was made that Unifil would currently stay in all its positions in spite of the calls that were made by the Israel Defense Forces to vacate the positions that are in the vicinity of the Blue Line. Here are some of the latest images sent from the newswires from the city of Deir al Balah in central Gaza: Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected accusations that Israeli forces deliberately targeted UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. \u201cThe charge that Israel deliberately attacked Unifil personnel is completely false,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said in a video posted on Monday. It\u2019s exactly the opposite. Israel repeatedly asked Unifil to get out of harm\u2019s way. It repeatedly asked them to temporarily leave the combat zone, which is right next to Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon. He said the military did its utmost to avoid harming Unifil personnel, while striking Hezbollah fighters. \u201cIsrael has every right to defend itself against Hezbollah and will continue to do so,\u201d he said, adding: But the best way to assure the safety of Unifil personnel is for Unifil to heed Israel\u2019s request and to temporarily get out of harm\u2019s way. As Israel\u2019s conflict with Hezbollah and Iran has escalated, it has begun to show a degree of vulnerability. A Hezbollah drone evaded Israel\u2019s much vaunted air defences on Sunday and struck a military canteen when it was busy with soldiers eating dinner. Four were killed and 58 wounded, seven seriously, at a location 40 miles south of the Lebanese border. The drone that hit the canteen of the Golani base near Binyamina appears to have been part of a synchronised attack that allowed it to elude the country\u2019s well organised air defences. Hezbollah has been refining its attack strategy, and timing the drone attack with rockets helped complicate the picture for the defenders. It is not the first time in recent days that a drone has got through. A retirement home in Herzliya was struck by a drone on Friday during the Yom Kippur holiday \u2013 one of two that crossed the border from Lebanon. The other was shot down successfully by a fighter jet, but the second struck the building a few miles north of Tel Aviv. Read the full story here: US intervention points to growing concerns over Israel\u2019s air defences The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) has called for Lebanon\u2019s heathcare system to be protected after reports that Israeli strikes hit medical staff during fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. \u201cI really ... appeal for the protection of healthcare workers, for ambulances, for hospitals, for primary health centres,\u201d Nicolas Von Arx, the ICRC\u2019s regional director for the Near and Middle East, said on Monday, AFP reported. \u201cAttacks on health facilities are deeply worrying,\u201d he added. Such strikes mean \u201ca hospital that doesn\u2019t function any more. That means thousands, tens of thousands of people who cannot get healthcare, who cannot deliver in a safe place, who cannot get their wounds treated. Of the 207 primary health care centres in Lebanon\u2019s conflict areas, 100 are now closed due to the escalating violence, according to the World Health Organization (Who). Von Arx said: We are very, very concerned about the displacements, about the functioning of health care systems, about the continuous suffering now in Lebanon. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said one of its workers was killed by shrapnel injuries suffered to the legs and chest in Jabalia in northern Gaza, which has come under \u201crelentless attacks\u201d by Israeli forces. Nasser Hamdi Abdelatif Al Shalfouh, 31, died of his injuries on 10 October in Kamal Adwan hospital, the medical charity said. It said he was \u201cunable to receive the necessary level of care due to the hospital\u2019s lack of capacity and an overwhelming number of patients in the facility\u201d. In a statement on Monday, MSF said it was \u201chorrified\u201d by the killing and called again for the \u201crespect and protection of civilians\u201d. It added: Nasser is the seventh MSF colleague killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war. This bloodshed needs to end. As we reported earlier, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a volley of artillery at a school used to shelter displaced Palestinians in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza on Sunday. At least 22 people were killed, including 15 children, as well as dozens others injured by the Israeli attack, according to the Palestinian territory\u2019s civil defence authority. The school-turned-shelter in Nuseirat had been intended for use as a polio vaccination site on Monday, but a spokesperson for the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) told the BBC that Sunday\u2019s attack left the site unusable for vaccines today. Unrwa spokesperson Louise Wateridge told the UN: Throughout the night, I spoke to a colleague sheltering in the compound who told me, \u2018We miraculously survived, the fire caught everywhere even the tent where we were sleeping burnt. The scene is terrifying.\u2019 The German government has sharply criticised the shelling of UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. A spokesperson for Germany\u2019s foreign office, Sebastian Fischer, told reporters on Monday: All parties to the conflict, including the Israeli army, are obliged to direct their combat operations exclusively against military targets of the other party to the conflict He added that a comprehensive investigation is expected and that discussions on the matter were being held with the Israeli side. The situation in southern Lebanon is causing growing concern, Fischer added, saying: The shelling of UN peacekeepers and the intrusion into their bases is in no way acceptable. It\u2019s just past 9pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: The death toll from an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in northern Lebanon on Monday has risen to at least 21 people. The strike targeted the Christian-majority village of Aitou, far from the Hezbollah group\u2019s main areas of influence in the south and east of Lebanon. The Lebanese health ministry said DNA tests were being conducted to identify body parts. So far the main focus of Israel\u2019s military operations in Lebanon has been in the south, the eastern Bekaa valley and the suburbs of Beirut. An Israeli airstrike killed at least 20 people including children at the Al-Mufti school in central Gaza on Sunday night, medics said. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war when it was struck by a volley of artillery, killing entire families and wounding dozens more. An Israeli airstrike killed at least eight Palestinians and wounded many others in Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, medics said on Monday. At least 10 Palestinians were killed and at least 30 injured in Israeli airstrikes on a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Palestinian medics said. At least four people were killed after an Israeli airstrike hit near the grounds of al-Aqsa hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, causing a fire that engulfed several tents housing displaced Palestinians. Footage showed people desperately trying to extinguish the flames as explosions could be heard within the camp. At least 42,289 Palestinians have been killed and 98,684 wounded in Israeli strikes since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy following the drone strike on a military base in Israel on Sunday that killed four people. \u201cWe will continue to mercilessly strike Hezbollah in all parts of Lebanon \u2013 including Beirut,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said on Monday.

Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Monday, the Palestinian health ministry said. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, one of the men was 17 years old. Four others were injured by Israeli fire during the raid, it said. Israeli attacks on the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon (Unifil) are contrary to international humanitarian law and must stop at once, according to a joint statement by Italy, Britain, France and Germany on Monday. The four nations reaffirmed \u201cthe essential stabilising role\u201d played by Unifil in southern Lebanon, adding that Israel and other parties had to ensure the safety of the peacekeepers at all times. Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said there would be \u201cno withdrawal\u201d of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave.

Israeli attacks on the United Nations\u2019 peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are contrary to international humanitarian law and must stop at once, Italy, Britain, France and Germany said, Reuters reports. In a joint statement, the four nations reaffirmed \u201cthe essential stabilising role\u201d played by UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, adding that Israel and other parties had to ensure the safety of the peacekeepers at all times. The UNIFIL mission, which includes hundreds of European soldiers, has said it has repeatedly come under attack from the Israeli military in recent days. Israel has called on the UN to move troops out of the area as it targets Hezbollah forces. CCTV caught the moment a Hezbollah rocket hit a northern Israeli town. Israeli ambulances and firefighters rushed to the northern Israeli town of Karmiel on 14 October after Hezbollah launched a rocket barrage into Israel. Firefighters struggled to extinguish a car that caught fire in the middle of the street, while medics treated one lightly wounded woman, Israel\u2019s ambulances service MDA said. United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres condemned the \u201clarge number of civilian casualties in the intensifying Israeli campaign in northern Gaza,\u201d his spokesperson said. \u201cHe strongly urges all parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and emphasises that civilians must be respected and protected at all times,\u201d UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. At least 10 people were reportedly killed by Israeli fire at a food distribution centre at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where Israeli tanks and troops are continuing a ground offensive. Some more on the two Palestinians reportedly shot and killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank earlier today. The governor of Jenin, Kamal Abu al-Rub, said Israeli soldiers surrounded a house in the Jenin refugee camp adjacent to the city. \u201cThe occupation (Israeli) soldiers climbed on the roofs of the houses and started shooting at anything that moved, resulting in the martyrdom of a minor and a young man in his 20s,\u201d he told AFP. The Palestinian news agency Wafa said one of the dead was a 17-year-old boy. The Israeli military said it was \u201clooking into the reports\u201d. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy following the drone strike on a military base in Israel on Sunday that killed four. He said retaliation would extend to targets in Beirut, AFP reports. \u201cWe will continue to mercilessly strike Hezbollah in all parts of Lebanon \u2013 including Beirut. All this according to operational considerations. We have proven it recently and we will continue to prove it in the days to come,\u201d he said while visiting the military base. An Israeli airstrike has killed at least eight Palestinians and wounded many others in Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, medics told Reuters on Monday. We will provide more details as we get them. Hezbollah said it launched a barrage of rockets at the north Israeli town of Safed, AFP reports. Hezbollah fighters fired a \u201cbig rocket salvo\u201d at Safed, the group said in a statement, adding it was \u201cin defence of Lebanon\u201d and in response to Israeli attacks on Lebanese \u201ccities, villages and civilians\u201d. Some analysis from AP on the drone strike that killed four Israeli soldiers last night: One of the worst mass casualty strikes on Israel in a year of war came not from dozens of Iranian ballistic missiles nor the repeated barrages of rocket fire launched by Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead, it was a single drone. The unmanned aerial vehicle, laden with explosives, evaded Israel\u2019s multilayered air-defence system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding over 60. It shined a light on Israel\u2019s struggle over the past year of war to knock down unmanned aircraft incoming from as far away as Yemen, Iraq and Iran. Over the years, Israel has built up its aerial defence array to provide broad protection against short-range rocket fire and medium- and long-range missiles, although experts caution it is not airtight. While the system has taken down drones repeatedly, many have penetrated Israel\u2019s airspace and sidestepped its defences, in some cases with deadly results. An Israeli security official said Israel was still investigating how the drone made it through Israel\u2019s air defences. A pair of drones initially entered Israeli airspace, but while one was shot down, the other one continued to its target. Air raid sirens had blared in northern Israel as the aircraft flew overhead. But no sirens sounded at the base, giving the soldiers no advance warning and indicating that the drone may have fallen off Israel\u2019s radar. Hezbollah said the drone was \u201cable to penetrate the Israeli air defence radars without being detected\u201d and reach its target. It claimed it had outsmarted Israel\u2019s air defences by simultaneously launching dozens of missiles and \u201csquadrons\u201d of drones. It was the second deadly drone strike in just two weeks. Earlier this month, a drone launched from Iraq killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded roughly two dozen, according to Israeli media. On Friday, during a major Jewish holiday, a Hezbollah drone slammed into a nursing home in central Israel, causing damage. Israel said it allowed 30 trucks of aid to reach northern Gaza, breaking a 2-week-long stretch during which the UN said aid levels fell precipitously in the area, AP reports. The Israeli body managing aid crossings into the territory, COGAT, said 30 trucks carrying flour and food from the UN\u2019s main food agency traveled through the northern crossing after inspection. The UN has not yet confirmed Israel\u2019s claims. For the last two weeks, nearly no food, water, fuel or supplies have reached the north, the UN said, with both major crossings closed since 1 October. The cutoff, combined with a renewed Israeli offensive in the area, has raised fears that Israel is pursuing an extreme plan proposed to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that would besiege the northern third of the strip in an effort to prompt a Hamas surrender. News agency AFP has spoken to volunteer rescuers in Lebanon. When rescue worker Aya Wehbeh was called to respond to a rare Israeli strike in central Beirut last week, she was terrified it had hit her family home. \u201cThis period is really tough,\u201d the 25-year-old said days after the twin strikes on the Nweiri and Basta districts of the capital left at least 22 dead. \u201cI could have ended up pulling my mother, father, aunt or neighbour from the rubble,\u201d she said. Across the country, rescue workers are struggling to respond to Israeli air strikes, with their resources already depleted by five years of economic crisis and fearing that they could be killed like dozens of colleagues over the past year. Wissam al-Qubeissi, 29, said he was determined to continue trying to save people despite the challenges. \u201cWe\u2019re many and highly motivated,\u201d said the volunteer, wearing a grey uniform he paid for himself. \u201cBut what\u2019s the point if we lack bulldozers, equipment and protective gear?\u201d he asked. In the storage room, he showed AFP rusty helmets, worn-out fire hoses and extinguishers about to reach their expiry dates. In the south of the country, the job is even more tiring. Israeli air strikes have pounded the area, while Israeli troops have clashed with Hezbollah on the frontier in recent days. Anis Abla, civil defence chief in the southern border town of Marjayoun, said he suffered severe burns to his face and hands two months ago while extinguishing a fire caused by Israeli shelling. \u201cOur rescue missions are becoming more and more difficult, because the strikes are never-ending and target us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re exhausted.\u201d The Lebanese Red Cross says the death toll from the Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in northern Lebanon is now at least 21. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military and it was not clear what the target was. The strike on Monday hit a small apartment building in the majority-Christian village of Aitou, far from the Hezbollah militant group\u2019s main areas of influence in the south and east of Lebanon. Hezbollah released a new video showcasing their drone fleet on Monday afternoon, with the message \u201cour capabilities are fine\u201d. The slickly produced slip showed fighters preparing several drones for flight with pictures of late secretary general Hassan Nasrallah and slain military chief of staff Fouad Shukur. The video was released the day after Hezbollah\u2019s deadliest attack on Israel since the beginning of fighting one year prior, killing four soldiers and injuring over 60 in a drone attack on Haifa. It was one of 64 attacks carried out on Sunday by the group, according to the Israeli Alma Research and Education Center. Hezbollah has insisted that its military capabilities and structure remain intact and ready to fight Israel, despite the massive aerial campaign carried out against it since 23 September and the elimination of almost all of its senior military leadership. In a speech on Friday, head of Hezbollah\u2019s military office Mohammed Afif said that the group\u2019s fighters on the border with Israel were \u201cfine\u201d and ready for \u201cfierce fighting.\u201d Fighting in Lebanon\u2019s south over the last two weeks has killed over a dozen Israeli soldiers and an unknown amount of Hezbollah fighters \u2013 the Lebanese group stopped releasing death notices of its fighters last month. Israel carried out a strike on an apartment building hosting displaced people in Zgharta, north Lebanon, on Monday, killing at least 18. Israel said that it had targeted the head of Hezbollah\u2019s Radwan force\u2019s anti-tank unit, Mohammed Kamel Naim. Monday\u2019s strike was one of several over the last two weeks targeting residences hosting displaced people in areas of Lebanon thought to be \u2018safe\u2019, including a strike on a displacement center in Wardaniyeh, south Lebanon, on Wednesday. Israel\u2019s military said that three projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, and that all of them had been intercepted, following reports that sirens were sounding across the country. Israeli fighter jets struck the launcher from which the projectiles were fired, the military added. It said no injuries had been reported. Israel\u2019s deadly air strike in northern Lebanon earlier today marked a departure from the usual pattern of its attacks, AFP reports. The strike hit far from the main combat area of the country and in a mostly Christian area. Israel has focused its firepower mostly on Hezbollah strongholds in Shiite Muslim-majority areas in the country and in the southern suburbs of Beirut. An AFP photographer at the site of the strike in Aitou said it had levelled a residential building at the entrance to the village. Body parts were scattered in the rubble, with Red Cross volunteers searching for survivors while ambulances evacuated wounded people. AFP provides a report on the latest clashes between Hezbollah and Israel. Hezbollah said it battled Israeli troops in south Lebanon, and claimed several new attacks on Israel after a drone strike on an Israeli base near Binyamina, south of Haifa, killed four soldiers on Sunday night. Israeli forces launched a string of new air strikes on targets in Lebanon today, including one on the north of the country which killed at least 18 people, according to the Lebanese Red Cross. Israel also faced new criticism over their alleged attacks on United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. The IDF said millions of Israelis were rushing to shelters as sirens sounded across central Israel, including Tel Aviv, in response to projectiles fired from Lebanon. The Israeli military says it has sent out 1.7 million text messages, 3.4 million voice messages and made 3,700 voice calls notifying civilians in Lebanon to evacuate as it continues its ground invasion there, AP reports. Some 2,300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since last October, more than three-quarters of them in the past month, according to the Lebanese government. At least 1.2 million people have been displaced \u2014 the vast majority since Israel ramped up airstrikes across the country last month. Israel says it is making an effort to communicate with civilians ahead of airstrikes, but people interviewed by the the AP news agency say that they don\u2019t receive the warnings \u2013 or that they come in the middle of the night or don\u2019t adequately cover the area that is struck. Lebanese sources say the orders often come at very short notice, and it\u2019s not clear where people can go or when they will be able to return home. One quarter of Lebanese territory is now under Israeli military displacement orders, according to the UN\u2019s human rights division. The United Nations human rights office has said it was appalled by more than a week of heavy Israeli strikes on northern Gaza where it said tens of thousands of civilians are trapped without food or supplies, Reuters reports. \u201cIn the shadow of the escalation of hostilities across the Middle East, the Israeli military appears to be cutting off North Gaza completely from the rest of the Gaza Strip and conducting hostilities with absolute disregard for the lives and security of Palestinian civilians,\u201d the rights office said. It added in a statement that it had received reports that Israeli forces had erected sand mounds at a key juncture, effectively \u201csealing off north Gaza\u201d and firing on those attempting to flee. The US embassy in Lebanon said its citizens were strongly encouraged to leave Lebanon \u201cnow\u201d, Reuters reports. The embassy added that additional flights it organised for its citizens traveling out of Beirut would not continue indefinitely. Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the northern West Bank city of Jenin, the Palestinian Health Ministry said, AP reports. Commenting on the incident, the Israeli army official said its troops exchanged fire with armed militants during what it termed a \u201ccounterterrorism operation\u201d in the Jenin area, killing one of the gunmen. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, one of the men was 17 years old. Four others were injured by Israeli fire during the raid, it said. Wafa reported that Israel had deployed their snipers on the roofs of a number of tall buildings in the city. Officials said an Israeli airstrike hit near an aid convoy in Lebanon, wounding a driver and lightly damaging the trucks, AP reports. The humanitarian aid, which reached Beirut on Monday, was marked with the flags of Turkey and the United Arab Emirates as well as the Red Cross insignia. Governor of the Baalbek-Hermel region, Bachir Khodr accompanied the convoy. He said the airstrike hit as it was passing through northeastern Lebanon. He shared a picture on X taken from inside a vehicle showing a large cloud of smoke on the road ahead. It was not clear how badly the driver was wounded. The Guardian could not independently verify the image. Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant briefed his US counterpart Lloyd Austin on the deadly Hezbollah drone attack on a military base in Israel yesterday and vowed \u201ca forceful response.\u201d The attack near the city of Binyamina killed four soldiers and wounded 61. It was the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon two weeks ago. In his talk with Austin, Gallant \u201chighlighted the severity of the attack and the forceful response that would be taken against Hezbollah,\u201d his office said. He also \u201creiterated the measures\u201d taken by the military to coordinate with UNIFIL peacekeepers in southern Lebanon and to avoid harming them, after mounting criticism of Israel for repeatedly firing on UN soldiers. Gallant\u2019s office said he expressed his appreciation to Austin and the US administration for deciding to send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery \u2013 used to shoot down ballistic missiles \u2013 to Israel \u201cin the coming days.\u201d Ireland\u2019s prime minister Simon Harris has spoken to the Israeli president Isaac Herzog to speak about the security of Irish and other peacekeeping troops in southern Lebanon. He relayed the government\u2019s \u201cserious concern about the deteriorating situation\u201d in southern Lebanon as well as emphasising the expectation that Unifil\u2019s mandate was respected. The Irish government statement said: The Taoiseach was clear that the deliberate firing at UNIFIL posts is an outrageous and totally unacceptable breach of international law, and a cause of the deepest concern to the Irish people, especially the families of the Irish Defence Forces personnel serving in Lebanon. He also told Herzog Irish people taken \u201cenormous pride\u201d in their role and their safety was a matter of \u201cthe highest priority\u201d for the government. He also spoke about Gaza, expressing solidarity with the families of hostages, but warning the \u201cscale of a humanitarian catastrophe is unimaginable and that children and civilians are starving and dying\u201d. The Israeli military said it has intercepted two drones approaching from Syria, a day after a drone attack by Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah on a base killed four soldiers. The military said in a statement: A short while ago, two UAVs that approached Israeli territory from Syria were successfully intercepted by the IAF (air force). The UAVs were intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory. Israel is fighting a war on two fronts, one on its northern border with Lebanon, the other with Hamas in Gaza, while it also faces attacks from Iran-backed militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Earlier on Monday, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq - a loose alliance of armed groups backed by Iran - said it had fired drones at Israel in two separate attacks. The group said in a statement before later announcing a second salvo: The Islamic Resistance in Iraq attacked at dawn... a vital target in the Jordan Valley in our occupied lands, using drones. Israel has expanded its targets in its war with the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 18 people in its first strike on the Christian-majority town of Aitou in the north, the Lebanese Red Cross said. Reuters reports: So far the main focus of Israel\u2019s military operations in Lebanon has been in the south, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the suburbs of Beirut. The strike in the northern region hit a house that had been rented to displaced families, Aitou Mayor Joseph Trad told Reuters. In addition to the deaths, four people were injured, the Red Cross said. Israel on Monday ordered residents of 25 villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali River, which flows through southern Lebanon, as it intensifies its attacks in the region. An Israeli strike killed Muhammad Kamel Naim, the commander of the anti-tank missile unit of Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan Force, in the Nabatieh area of south Lebanon, the military said. Britain has imposed sanctions against Iranian individuals and organisations following Iran\u2019s attack on Israel on 1 October, Britain\u2019s Foreign Office said on Monday. The sanctions target senior figures in Iran\u2019s army, air force and organisations linked to Iran\u2019s ballistic and cruise missile development. Hezbollah said its fighters were battling Israeli troops inside a Lebanese border village on Monday, and that they had launched a guided missile at an Israeli troop carrier in the same area. Hezbollah fighters \u201care engaged in violent clashes with the Israeli enemy forces... in the village of Aita al-Shaab with... machine guns, rockets and artillery shells,\u201d the group said, later adding it targeted an \u201cIsraeli troop carrier with a guided missile\u201d in the village. Separately, at least nine people were killed and one person was injured on Monday in an initial toll following an Israeli air strike on the Christian-majority region of Aitou in north Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry said. The Lebanese Red Cross has put the death toll at 18. Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s defence minister Yoav Gallant told his US counterpart Lloyd Austin that Israel would deliver a strong response to Hezbollah after the Lebanese armed group struck an Israeli army base killing four soldiers. Gallant spoke to Austin overnight and \u201chighlighted the severity of the attack and the forceful response that would be taken against Hezbollah\u201d, the minister\u2019s office said in a statement. Israel\u2019s infrastructure minister has responded to the UN in a post on X. Eli Cohen accused the UN forces of contributing \u201cnothing to maintaining stability and security in the region\u201d but denied Israel was deliberately targeting peacekeepers. He wrote: UN Secretary-General Guterres, it\u2019s time for you to respond to the request sent to you, remove UNIFIL from the conflict areas, and stop playing into Iran\u2019s hands. AP provides some background \u2026 The UN Interim Force in Lebanon was created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops after Israel invaded and occupied southern Lebanon. Israel invaded again in 1982, and it wasn\u2019t until 2000 that it withdrew. In the absence of an agreed-upon border, the U.N. drew up a boundary between Lebanon and Israel known as the Blue Line, which UNIFIL monitors and patrols. The United Nations expanded UNIFIL\u2019s mission following the monthlong 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Israeli border to monitor the cessation of hostilities and patrol a buffer zone along the border. The force currently has around 10,000 peacekeepers in southern Lebanon drawn from around 50 countries, including 16 European Union countries. The largest contributors of troops are Indonesia, with 1,231 peacekeepers, and Italy with 1,068. They are lightly armed, and while they have the right to self-defense under certain circumstances, their role is mainly observational. This includes patrols, monitoring and reporting violations of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 fighting. The force also provides support to local communities. France has joined the chorus of EU voices rejecting demands made by Israel\u2019s prime minister for UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon to pull back from its position in the country. \u201cThe protection of peacekeepers is an obligation incumbent on all parties\u201d, the foreign ministry in Paris said. Iran has stopped indirect talks with the United States in Oman as tensions remain high over a possible Israeli retaliatory strike on Tehran, AP reports. Oman has long has been an interlocutor between Iran and the US, particularly in the secret talks that birthed Tehran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. \u201cFor the time being, the Muscat process is stopped because of special situation in the region,\u201d Foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told Iranian state media while still in Muscat, Oman. \u201cWe do not see any ground for the talks until we can pass the current crisis.\u201d The health ministry in the Gaza Strip said it launched the second round of a polio vaccination campaign in the war-ravaged territory. It said that a second does of the vaccine will be administered to children under 10 in the central part of the territory over the next three days before the campaign is expanded to the north and south. The campaign began last month after the territory registered its first polio case in 25 years \u2014 a 10-month-old boy, now paralysed in one leg. Health workers succeeded in administering the first dose of the vaccine to around 560,000 children despite challenges, including ongoing fighting, the breakdown of law and order and widespread damage to roads and infrastructure. The World Health Organization said humanitarian pauses to facilitate the campaign last month were largely observed. The European Union condemned attacks on UN peacekeepers by Israel in Lebanon and rejected allegations that UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is responsible for obstructing the Israeli army, AP reports. Sixteen EU countries are contributing to the UNIFIL peacekeeping force. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that \u201ctheir work is very important. It\u2019s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.\u201d Five peacekeepers have been wounded in recent attacks, with most blamed on Israeli forces. Speaking in Luxembourg before chairing talks between EU foreign ministers, Borrell underlined that the UN security council decides whether UNIFIL peacekeepers should be moved, \u201cso stop blaming Secretary Guterres.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called for UNIFIL to heed Israel\u2019s warnings to evacuate, accusing them of \u201cproviding a human shield\u201d to Hezbollah. In a video addressed to Guterres, who has been banned from entering Israel, Netanyahu told the UN chief \u201cto get (UNIFIL) out of the danger zone.\u201d Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg, whose country is one of Europe\u2019s strongest backers of Israel, said the attacks are \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d and that UNFIL will not be leaving. \u201cNo, they will not withdraw. Yes, they will continue to fulfil the mandate. And yes, we demand on each and every party to respect this mandate and respect the security and safety of our blue helmets,\u201d he told reporters. Israel\u2019s Shin Bet domestic security agency said police had charged two Israelis on accusations that they planned to carry out an assassination at the behest of Iran, AP reports. The agency said Vladislav Victorson, 30, was approached online by a person called Mari Hossi and was instructed to carry out missions that ranged from petty vandalism to torching cars, and paid more than $5,000. The Shin Bet said Victorson was asked to damage communications infrastructure and ATMs, although a statement did not say whether he carried out these acts. It also did not name the Israeli figure he allegedly agreed to assassinate. The Shin Bet said he also sought to acquire weapons, including a sniper rifle, guns and grenades. According to the agency, Victorson enlisted two other people, including his girlfriend, Anna Bernstein, 18, to assist in his missions. The Shin Bet said Iranian agents are known to use social media and promises of cash in efforts to recruit Israelis to carry out such attacks. Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin accused Israel of trying to prevent the world from seeing what its troops are doing in Lebanon and Gaza, and of working to undermine the UN, AP reports. Asked what Israel\u2019s aim might be in demanding that UN peacekeepers leave their bases in Lebanon after a series of attacks, Martin said: \u201cessentially to drive the eyes and ears out of south Lebanon and to give itself free rein.\u201d \u201cWe cannot have an undermining and a chipping away of the status or the credibility or structures of the United Nations and particularly its peacekeeping forces,\u201d Martin said in Luxembourg, where EU foreign ministers are meeting. \u201cWe see what\u2019s happening in northern Gaza, for example, in terms of the necessity of eyes and ears on the ground. The world has really no full picture of what\u2019s happening in Gaza,\u201d he told reporters. Five peacekeepers have been wounded in attacks that struck their positions in Lebanon since Israel began a ground campaign against the Hezbollah militant group in the country. The Associated Press provides some more detail on the Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital earlier today: The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah was already struggling to treat a large number of wounded from an earlier strike on a school-turned-shelter that killed at least 20 people when the early morning airstrike hit and fire engulfed many of the tents. Several secondary explosions could be heard after the initial strike, but it was not immediately clear if they were caused by weapons or fuel tanks. Associated Press footage showed children among the wounded. A man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed hospital. Hospital records showed that four people were killed and 40 wounded. Twenty-five people were transferred to the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among civilians, without providing evidence. In recent months it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks. The UN has stressed the urgent need for ceasefires in both Lebanon and Gaza to avert a broader regional conflict with ramifications for the whole world, AFP reports. \u201cA ceasefire that is sustained by a meaningful peace process ... is the only way to break the cycle of violence, of hatred, of misery,\u201d said UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi. Speaking at the start of the UNHCR refugee agency\u2019s annual executive committee meeting in Geneva, he insisted that only a ceasefire could \u201cstem the tide to a major regional war with global implications\u201d. \u201cYou will have seen the images and heard the numbers; hundreds of thousands of displaced inside Lebanon, seeking reprieve from Israeli airstrikes,\u201d Grandi said. \u201cOnce again, the distinction made between civilians and combatants has almost become meaningless.\u201d Grandi paid tribute to two UNHCR workers killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon last month, and also highlighted the 226 staff working for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, killed in Gaza in the past year. \u201cWe cannot accept that lives of humanitarians are dismissed as mere collateral damage, or worse, maligned as somehow culpable or complicit,\u201d he said. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday said there would be \u201cno withdrawal\u201d of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave. Spain condemns Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s call on Sunday for the force to pull back \u201cbecause there will be no withdrawal of UNIFIL\u201d, Sanchez told a forum in Barcelona. A former senior officer at the UN peace keeping forces in southern Lebanon has said that Unifil troops should not leave their posting. John Durnin, who works in Lebanon and in Iraq, told RTE he believed Israel wanted them to move out of the way as part of an escalatory mission designed to be disproportionate. Of course, Benjamin Netanyahu is going to say that the UN are in the way or human shields \u2013 in fact, they\u2019re an obstacle or a constraint for the Israeli troops who are moving into the area. Commentators from various [media] have noted that these attacks that have been taking place in Gaza seem to fulfil that use of overwhelming force by the Israelis to get the civilians to turn their backs on the militants - I think that that\u2019s what Israel wants to do in southern Lebanon, and at the moment, the UN are in their way. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas militants, according to the Associated Press news agency. If implemented, this could trap hundreds of thousands of Palestinians unwilling or unable to leave their homes. The plan proposed to Netanyahu and the Israeli parliament by a group of retired generals would escalate the pressure, giving Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants \u2014 meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them - and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to The Associated Press by its chief architect, who says the plan is the only way to break Hamas in the north and pressure it to release the remaining hostages. The plan calls for Israel to maintain control over the north for an indefinite period to attempt to create a new administration without Hamas, splitting the Gaza Strip in two. There has been no decision by the government to fully carry out the so-called \u201cGenerals\u2019 Plan,\u201d and it is unclear how strongly it\u2019s being considered. When asked if the evacuation orders in northern Gaza marked the first stages of the \u201cGenerals\u2019 Plan,\u201d Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said: We have not received a plan like that. But one official with knowledge of the matter said parts of the plan are already being implemented, without specifying which parts. A second official, who is Israeli, said Netanyahu \u201chad read and studied\u201d the plan, \u201clike many plans that have reached him throughout the war,\u201d but didn\u2019t say whether any of it had been adopted. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, because the plan isn\u2019t supposed to be discussed publicly. Human rights groups say the plan would likely starve civilians and that it flies in the face of international law, which prohibits using food as a weapon and forcible transfers. Accusations that Israel is intentionally limiting food to Gaza are central to the genocide case brought against it at the International Court of Justice, charges Israel denies. A coalition of Israeli NGOs on Monday urged the international community to act, noting that \u201cthere are alarming signs that the Israeli military is beginning to quietly implement\u201d the plan. They wrote: States have an obligation to prevent the crimes of starvation and forcible transfer. Continuing a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach will enable Israel to liquidate northern Gaza. An AFP alert says the Israeli army has intercepted two drones approaching Israel from Syria. The Israeli military said it intercepted two drones approaching from Syria on Monday, a day after a drone attack by the Lebanese group Hezbollah on an Israeli military base killed four soldiers. A statement read: A short while ago, two UAVs that approached Israeli territory from Syria were successfully intercepted by the IAF (air force). The UAVs were intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory. Here are the latest images coming out of Gaza: Here\u2019s a round up of the key events from overnight: On Sunday night, an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed at least 20 people including children at the Al-Mufti school, according to two local hospitals. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war. Explosions hit early Monday outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, killing three people and injuring about 50 others, the hospital said. Tents caught fire, and residents of the Central Gaza community carried the injured into the hospital. Palestinian medics have said that at least 10 people were killed and at least 30 injured in Israeli airstrikes on a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, with casualties including women and children. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday urged other members of the European Union to respond to Madrid and Ireland\u2019s request to suspend the bloc\u2019s free trade agreement with Israel over its actions in Gaza and Lebanon. For months, both Spain and Ireland have been in talks with other EU countries who want a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the basis that Israel may be breaching the agreement\u2019s human rights clause. The Guardian\u2019s middle east correspondent Bethan McKernan has interviewed Gazans and aid workers in the strip, who say \u201cno one is talking about\u201d the bloodshed there and ceasefire hopes are receding as focus shifts to Lebanon. Mai al-Afifa, 24, was teaching a workshop about how to identify unexploded ordnance in a school turned shelter in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday when an Israeli missile hit the next building in the compound. Twenty-eight people were killed and 54 injured, according to medics at the scene. Through the smoke and rubble dust Afifa saw the body parts of two women and a male aid worker as she stumbled to safety. The Israeli military said it had used a precise strike to target Hamas fighters using the school as a command centre. She said: We are very sad about what is happening now in Lebanon \u2026 We have experienced this pain and loss. But we also fear that Gaza will be forgotten: the massacres have increased here and no one is talking about it. All the TV channels are talking about the regional war, Iran, Israel and what is happening in Lebanon. Germany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, and economics minister Robert Habeck, both of the Greens party, are said to have blocked German arms exports to Israel over concerns as to what the weapons would be used for, according to reports in German media. No military exports to Israel have been approved since March according to the reports, which initially emerged in the tabloid Bild, citing government sources, and are now being reported more widely in German media. According to these, the leading Greens are said to have insisted transports of weapons and spare parts could only go ahead once the Israeli government signed a guarantee that it would not use the weapons to commit acts of genocide. If confirmed, this would effectively put the German government at odds with Washington. Despite its clear criticism of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, the US government has made clear it sees no indication that it has carried out genocide. By even raising the question, via the Federal Security Council, observers say, Baerbock and Habeck are implicitly expressing a suspicion over Israel\u2019s intentions which has not been voiced by the government of Olaf Scholz. Germany\u2019s government holds the belief that due to the Nazi-perpetrated crimes of the Holocaust, Israel\u2019s security is Germany\u2019s \u201creason of state\u201d. Military experts point out that Germany has no comparable conditions for sending arms to countries such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia, despite misgivings about the intended use of hundreds of millions of Euros worth of weapons that have recently been exported to them. Some close to the weapons export process have reportedly described the position adopted by Baerbock and Habeck, as \u201cabsurd\u201d, suggesting that it was questionable the extent to which any written guarantee would be either practical or legally-binding. As recently as September the German economics ministry denied that there was an arms export boycott to Israel. Instead, a spokesman said that every application for weapons was examined on a \u201ccase by case basis\u201d. According to Bild, Israel gave Germany the required written agreement last week. Between 2019 and 2023, almost a third of weapons imports Israel has received have come from Germany, which after the USA is its most important supplier of arms. In particular Israel has stressed the importance of submarines and warships built in Germany which it says it needs to defend itself from constant threats, especially from Iran. The second round of a polio vaccination campaign has been launched in the Gaza strip. The Health Ministry has said that a second does of the vaccine will be administered to children under 10 in the central part of the territory over the next three days before the campaign is expanded to the north and south. The campaign began last month after the territory registered its first polio case in Gaza in 25 years \u2014 a 10-month-old boy, now paralysed in one leg. Health workers succeeded in administering the first dose of the vaccine to around 560,000 children despite myriad challenges, including ongoing fighting, the breakdown of law and order and widespread damage to roads and infrastructure. The World Health Organization said humanitarian pauses to facilitate the campaign last month were largely observed. Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 42,289 Palestinians and wounded 98,684 since 7 October 2023 the, Palestinian enclave\u2019s health ministry said on Monday. Here is video footage of the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike hit near the grounds of al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza, which caused a fire that engulfed several tents housing displaced Palestinians. Footage from Deir al-Balah showed people desperately trying to extinguish the flames as explosions could be heard within the camp. According to reports, the strike hit while emergency services were receiving scores of injured people from an earlier bombardment in nearby Nuseirat A Reuters snap says that sirens sounded in central Israel due to a number of projectiles fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory, the Israeli military said Meanwhile AFP is reporting that Hezbollah says it has targeted Israeli troops in a south Lebanon village. AFP is also reporting that the Israeli army says it has intercepted projectiles from Lebanon over central Israel. One of its journalists has heard blasts over the Israel army base hit by a Hezbollah drone. More to follow. Hezbollah said it targeted an Israeli naval base near north Israel\u2019s Haifa on Monday, a day after claiming a drone attack near the city that the Israeli military said killed four soldiers. Hezbollah fighters launched \u201ca rocket salvo\u201d at the \u201cStella Maris\u201d naval base near Haifa, the Lebanese group said in a statement, adding the attack was at the \u201cservice\u201d of Hassan Nasrallah, the group\u2019s longtime leader who was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs last month. Attacks by Israel on the United Nations\u2019 peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are \u201cunacceptable\u201d and contrary to UN rules, Spain\u2019s Foreign minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Monday. He told reporters ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers held in Luxembourg: It is contrary to what we expect from any member state of the United Nations, which is ultimately an organisation that protects world peace. EU countries, led by Italy, France and Spain, have thousands of troops in the 10,000-strong peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has said it has repeatedly come under attack from Israeli forces in recent days. Israel has called on the UN to move the troops out of the combat zone. Albares said only the UN can order the withdrawal of UNIFIL. More now on the Hezbollah strike on an IDF training base we reported on earlier (see post 7.33BST) The drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others on Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It later said it targeted Israel\u2019s elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defence systems during the assault by \u201csquadrons\u201d of drones. Israel\u2019s national rescue service said the attack wounded 61. With Israel\u2019s advanced air-defence systems, it is rare for so many people to be hurt by drones or missiles. Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire almost daily in the year since the war in Gaza began, and fighting has escalated. Here are the latest images coming out of Gaza: An Israeli attack on a school used to shelter displaced Palestinians has killed at least 20 people in central Gaza, officials say. Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency said the site in Nuseirat camp was struck by a volley of artillery on Sunday, killing entire families and wounding dozens more, the BBC reported. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it was looking into these reports. Earlier, five children were reportedly killed by a drone strike while playing on a street corner in northern Gaza. A civil defence spokesman said the attack on al-Mufti school, where hundreds of displaced people from around Gaza were sheltering, had injured at least 50 people and more than a dozen were killed. The five children in northern Gaza were reportedly killed in an Israeli air strike while playing on a street corner in al-Shati camp. Graphic images from the scene in the aftermath show the bloodied bodies of what appeared to be young teenage boys. One of them looked to be clutching several glass marbles in his hand. According to a report from the scene, told to a BBC correspondent, a drone strike hit a person walking down the street, which killed the children and injured seven other people. Later images showed the bodies of the five boys wrapped in white shrouds and laid out on the floor side-by-side. An aunt of one of the boys, named Rami, wrote a moving tribute to him on social media. She said the family had moved to al-Shati after being forced to leave their homes in Jabalia to a \u201csafer area\u201d because of the war. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has met with Mohammed Abdelsalam, a senior official from Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Huthi movement, in Muscat, according to his office. The foreign ministry released pictures of the pair holding talks during Araghchi\u2019s visit to the Omani capital, the latest in a series of diplomatic trips in the region following Israel\u2019s vow to retaliate against an Iranian missile attack. Palestinian medics have said that at least 10 people were killed and at least 30 injured in Israeli airstrikes on a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, with casualties including women and children. The European Union\u2019s member states have taken too long to condemn Israel\u2019s attacks on UNIFIL soldiers in Lebanon, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday, describing the attacks as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Speaking at an EU ministerial meeting in Luxembourg, he said: We should be against Israeli attacks against UNIFIL. Our soldiers are there, many soldiers are there. EU countries, led by Italy, France and Spain, have thousands of troops in the 10,000-strong peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has said it has repeatedly come under attack from Israeli forces in recent days. Israel has called on the United Nations to move the troops out of the combat zone. The European Union has condemned all attacks against United Nations missions, the union\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a response to targeting of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, by the Israel Defence Forces. Borrell said in a statement on behalf of the EU published on Sunday night: Such attacks against UN peacekeepers constitute a grave violation of international law and are totally unacceptable. The EU condemns all attacks against UN missions. It expresses particularly grave concern regarding the attacks by the Israeli Defence Forces against UNIFIL, which left several peacekeepers wounded. We urgently await explanations and a thorough investigation from the Israeli authorities about the attacks against UNIFIL, which plays a fundamental role in the stability of South Lebanon. Israel\u2019s army chief has described a Hezbollah drone strike on a military training base that killed at least four soldiers at the weekend as \u201cdifficult and painful\u201d. Lieutenant Geneal Herzi Halevi told soldiers during a visit to the Golani Brigade training base that was hit Sunday night in the area of Binyamina, south of the city of Haifa: We are at war, and an attack on a training base on the home front is difficult and the results are painful. An Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip early Monday killed at least four people and sent flames sweeping through a packed tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns, according to Palestinian medics. Associated Press reports: The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among civilians, without providing evidence. In recent months it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah was already struggling to treat a large number of wounded people from an earlier strike on a school-turned-shelter nearby that killed at least 20 people when the early morning airstrike hit and fire engulfed many of the tents. Associated Press footage showed children among the wounded. A man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed hospital. Hospital records showed that four people were killed and 40 wounded. Twenty-five people were transferred to the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. On Sunday night, an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed at least 20 people including children at a school, according to two local hospitals. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war. Meanwhile, explosions hit early Monday outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, killing three people and injuring about 50 others, the hospital said. Tents caught fire, and residents of the Central Gaza community carried the injured into the hospital. The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon known as UNIFIL said Israeli tanks forcibly entered the gates of one position early Sunday and destroyed the main gate. They later fired smoke rounds near peacekeepers, causing skin irritation. UNIFIL called the incident a \u201cfurther flagrant violation of international law.\u201d US vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has said Israel must \u201curgently do more to facilitate the flow of aid to those in need\u201d in northern Gaza. Civilians must be protected and must have access to food, water, and medicine. International humanitarian law must be respected.\u201d In recent days Israeli forces have widened their raid into northern Gaza forcing many families to leave their homes. The territory\u2019s ministry of health appealed on Friday for medical teams to be allowed access to the northern half of the strip to evacuate the wounded, and for fuel deliveries to the north\u2019s struggling hospitals, warning that civilians caught up in the intense shelling and airstrikes are running out of food and water. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said Israeli shelling late on Sunday had killed at least 15 people at a school serving as a shelter for displaced Palestinians in central Gaza\u2019s Nuseirat camp. The Al-Mufti school was bombarded with a large volley of Israeli artillery, resulting in an initial death toll of 15 martyrs, including children, women and entire families, and 50 wounded,\u201d the officials said. The Israeli military said it was \u201clooking into the reports\u201d. A Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others on Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It later said it targeted Israel\u2019s elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defence systems during the assault by \u201csquadrons\u201d of drones. The US will send an antimissile system to Israel as well as a crew of US military personnel to operate the system. In a statement released on Sunday, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said that the US will also send an \u201cassociated crew of US military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel\u2019s air defenses\u201d. Sixteen people have been killed during Israel\u2019s raid on Al Ma\u2019asara in Lebanon\u2019s Keserwan district. In a post on Sunday updating the death toll from yesterday\u2019s attacks, the Lebanese health ministry said that in addition to the 16 people killed, 21 people were injured. United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned on Sunday that any attacks against peacekeepers \u201cmay constitute a war crime\u201d, his spokesperson said, after Israeli tanks burst through the gates of a peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon. Reuters reports it was the latest accusation of Israeli violations and attacks against the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, in recent days. In a statement released late on Sunday, the Israeli military said a Merkava tank had been trying to evacuate injured soldiers and had backed into the Unifil post accidentally while under fire amid a smokescreen. In a videoed statement addressed to Guterres on Sunday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated Israeli calls for Unifil troops to evacuate. \u201cThe time has come for you to withdraw Unifil from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields.\u201d French president Emmanuel Macron urged his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian to support a \u201cgeneral de-escalation\u201d in the Middle East during a phone conversation on Sunday, the presidential office said. Reuters reports that in a separate discussion, Macron reiterated to Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati the \u201cabsolute necessity\u201d of obtaining a ceasefire in Lebanon without further delay.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is at risk of experiencing a repeat of the sharp increase in energy costs which has fuelled the continuing cost of living crisis because it relies too heavily on gas, according to an expert panel of industry leaders. The Energy Crisis Commission has warned that the UK is still \u201cdangerously underprepared\u201d for another crisis because it continues to rely on gas for its power plants and home heating. The newly formed commission, made up of representatives from business groups Energy UK and the CBI, and the consumer groups Citizens Advice and National Energy Action, used its first report to warn that too little progress has been made in insulating homes and scaling up the installation of heat pumps since the UK economy was rocked by record high gas prices. The energy crisis began in late 2021 as rising gas prices led to 29 household suppliers failing and Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 sent bills soaring, forcing the UK government to step in to subsidise bills. Adam Scorer, the head of National Energy Action, a fuel poverty charity, said the \u201crisk of future crises is real\u201d and would \u201chit hardest those less able to withstand price shocks\u201d. The report found the crisis had a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact on British households. Energy bill payers were hit harder than in many other European countries because the UK ranks as the second most dependent on gas for heating, and the fifth most dependent on gas for electricity, it said. The report also took aim at the government\u2019s \u201cpoorly targeted\u201d support scheme which cost the exchequer more than \u00a378bn, according to the Office for National Statistics, but left about 7.5m households in fuel poverty and bill payers in \u00a33.5bn of debt to energy companies. Gillian Cooper, an executive director at Citizens Advice, said: \u201cUnderpreparedness and missed opportunities helped drive the energy market crisis. Sluggish action on green upgrades, supplier failures, poor practices like forced prepayment meter installations, and inaction on targeted bill support has left millions of households feeling the devastating impacts of the crisis first-hand.\u201d David Laws, Energy UK\u2019s chair and the chair of the commission, said: \u201cThe UK has experienced regular energy price shocks over the last 50 years, which have damaged economic growth and hit both households and businesses. Future oil and gas shocks seem inevitable, but the UK remains poorly prepared to absorb these.\u201d The commission called on the government to prioritise shifting the UK away from a reliance on gas to help protect households and the economy from future energy price shocks.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a real possibility that Donald Trump sees no distinction between the terms \u201cstrongman\u201d and \u201cstrong man\u201d. At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/prosecutor-kamala-harris-put-trump-on-trial-but-the-court-of-public-opinion-can-be-fickle\">presidential debate last month</a>, Kamala Harris said world leaders were \u201claughing\u201d at Trump. In response, Trump brought up his endorsement from the autocratic Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n: \u201cOne of the most respected men \u2013 they call him a strong man. He\u2019s a tough person, smart.\u201d</p> <p>Two months before that debate, the Republican national convention played host to a strong man \u2013 or, at least, to a man who exemplified a certain 80s-kitsch version of strength. Hulk Hogan, the former standard-bearer of the then World Wrestling Federation (WWF), rose to fame as a human cartoon character, a pumped-up avatar for American determination and supremacy. During his time in the spotlight, Hogan did battle against stereotypes of America\u2019s enemies \u2013 the proudly Iranian Iron Sheik, the proudly Russian Nikolai Volkoff and Sgt Slaughter, a former US marine who had turned against his own country to sympathise with Saddam Hussein. On this night, Hulk Hogan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/jul/19/hulk-hogan-hypes-up-donald-trump-and-tears-shirt-off-at-republican-national-convention-video\">was at the RNC </a>to throw his support behind the third presidential campaign of Trump, a figure who has tapped into a potent vein of nostalgia for a mythologised 1980s, an era characterised by muscular action movie heroes, wrestlers, and unapologetic displays of machismo.</p> <p>Donald Trump and Hulk Hogan had already crossed paths at least once. This was back in Trump\u2019s 80s real estate heyday, long before he entered politics \u2013 the Trump era captured in the new biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/the-apprentice-review-cartoon-version-of-chump-in-chief-donald-trumps-early-years\">The Apprentice</a>. In 1989, Atlantic City\u2019s Trump Plaza played host to WrestleMania V, the second straight WrestleMania event to take place in Trump\u2019s gilded gambling temple. As Trump watched from the front row, Hogan defeated his former tag team partner \u201cMacho Man\u201d Randy Savage to win the WWF (now WWE) Championship. At the RNC, Hogan flashed back to that moment: \u201cI was bleeding like a pig, and I won the world title right in front of Donald J Trump! And you know something? <em>He\u2019s</em> gonna win in November, and we\u2019re all gonna be champions again when he wins!\u201d</p> <p>Hulk Hogan has been playing some version of that character for decades. When he breaks character, bad things emerge, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/26/hulk-hogan-wrestling-racism-gawker\">leaked 2007 video </a>of him spouting racial slurs while in bed with a friend\u2019s wife. But Hogan has always found an audience for his DayGlo 80s persona, and that\u2019s what he brought to the stage at the RNC. Hogan pulled out all the stops. He walked out to Real American, his old&nbsp;theme song. He reeled off his catchphrases. He ripped open one T-shirt \u2013 the one that showed his shirtless younger self waving an American flag \u2013 to reveal the Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath. </p> <p>A few days before Hogan\u2019s speech at the RNC, someone tried to shoot Trump. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/trump-shooting-report-secret-service\">would-be assassin</a> fired at him, killing one supporter and critically injuring two others. In a performance worthy of prime Hulk Hogan, Trump stood before his crowd in the immediate aftermath, shaking his fist and screaming. The image \u2013 blood splashed across Trump\u2019s face, secret service agents huddled all around him, American flag blowing behind \u2013 was the kind of thing that could have been on Hogan\u2019s T-shirt. Indeed, bootleg shirts of post-shooting Trump immediately proliferated at America\u2019s beach town boardwalk stands.</p> <p>That simplified image of strongman heroism has long attracted Trump. In a 1997 New Yorker profile, the writer Mark Singer depicts Trump flying to his Mar-a-Lago estate on his own 727 aircraft, with solid fixtures. (Ghislaine Maxwell, later convicted of child sex trafficking, was one of the passengers.) En route, Trump tries to watch Michael, the 1996 Norah Ephron film where John Travolta plays an angel descended to Earth. But Trump gets bored, so he switches over to a VHS copy of the 1988&nbsp;Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle Bloodsport. Trump\u2019s son Eric, then 13,&nbsp;gets the important job of fast-forwarding past the exposition, straight to the fight scenes.

Van Damme plays Frank Dux, a US army captain who wins the Kumite, a secret, illegal fighting tournament. The film was based on stories told by the real Frank Dux, which were discredited as soon as the movie came out. But it didn\u2019t matter that the Bloodsport narrative was made up.

      "bodyText": "The claim that Australian gas exports are \u201cclean\u201d and needed to drive the transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions has become an article of faith for significant parts of the country\u2019s industry, media and political classes \u2013 often repeated, only occasionally challenged. It has buttressed a massive expansion of the liquified natural gas (LNG) industry in the north of the continent over the past decade, with major new developments in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Actually, \u201cmajor\u201d doesn\u2019t really cut it in describing the scale of the LNG facilities at Gladstone, in the Pilbara and near Darwin. They hoover up about 80% of the gas extracted in Australia, either using it on-site or shipping it to Japan, China, Taiwan or South Korea. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email It\u2019s a highly lucrative business. Revenue across the Australian LNG industry last financial year was nearly A$70bn. Infamously, the federal government\u2019s tax take has not kept pace with the industry\u2019s extraordinary growth. This sort of income is a pretty powerful incentive to justify what your industry does, especially when what it does leads to accusations it is damaging the planet and people\u2019s lives and livelihoods. The Australian gas industry has excelled in asserting that it is helping in the fight against the climate crisis. Mainly, it argues that its LNG exports are replacing and displacing coal in Asia \u2013 and that gas has roughly half the emissions of coal when burned to create electricity. Ergo, Australian gas must be cutting global climate pollution. This line has been swallowed and repeated by politicians from the major parties in federal and state governments. Former Coalition energy and emissions reduction minister, and current shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor claimed in parliament that the gas industry was cutting global emissions by 150m tonnes a year \u2013 an extraordinary amount if true, equivalent to about a third of Australia\u2019s annual climate pollution. The current resources minister, Madeleine King, argues Australia\u2019s Asian trading powers \u201cdepend on our gas to meet their commitments to net zero\u201d. The Western Australian premier, Roger Cook, has probably been the most audacious, declaring that gas from his state was leading to a \u201cdramatic reduction in global emissions\u201d and it had a responsibility to continue to sell it or people may die. Over the past five years, Guardian Australia has asked industry leaders and MPs for specific evidence showing that Australian LNG is substantially displacing coal in Asian countries, or that LNG has substantially lower emissions than coal across its lifecycle. We are yet to receive any. That failure to produce data to support these claims looks more conspicuous after a peer-reviewed study published in the journal Energy Science and Engineering earlier this month. Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at New York\u2019s Cornell University, calculated the total emissions from the US LNG industry, which exports to Europe and Asia. Once all upstream stages were factored in \u2013 extraction, piping to a processing facility, compression from gas into liquid form, shipping, decompression back to gas and burning for energy \u2013 he estimated the total climate pollution from LNG was 33% greater than that from coal over a 20-year period. This is not an entirely new idea \u2013 previous studies have suggested the gas industry is dirtier than often claimed \u2013 but it is nevertheless a potentially extraordinary finding. It should have major ramifications for how policymakers think about what is necessary to cut emissions to as near zero as possible. A key finding of Howarth\u2019s study is that more gas leaks into the atmosphere before it is burned than is usually assumed. This has been successfully spun over decades as \u201cnatural gas\u201d, which sounds harmless. In reality it is methane \u2013 a short-lived but potent fossil fuel that has about 80 times the atmospheric heat-trapping power of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. The Guardian asked Howarth whether he thought his US findings were likely to apply to the Australian LNG industry. He replied: \u201cThere is no fundamental reason to believe LNG exports from Australia would differ much in terms of greenhouse gas emissions from those from the US.\u201d There are caveats, of course. No two fossil fuel developments are exactly the same, and there are differences in both the fugitive emissions (those that escape from a mine, well or pipeline) and the combustion emissions resulting from different sites. Some will be worse than others. But the clear overarching message from the study is bigger than site-specific variation. As Prof Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University, told my colleague Oliver Milman, the issue isn\u2019t really whether gas is slightly better or worse than coal. It\u2019s that both are terrible for the climate and \u201cwe need to get rid of both of them\u201d. In other words: we need to kill the idea that gas is clean, even in relative terms, and should use as little as possible as quickly as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean just turning off the tap. Some gas will be needed in Australia for at least the medium-term to back up the electricity supply. It won\u2019t be much.

      "bodyText": "Ministers are struggling to shake off claims that they pressed the Metropolitan police into giving Taylor Swift a motorbike escort as she travelled to Wembley for her sold-out summer shows. Downing Street and Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, have repeatedly insisted the Met makes decisions independently from politicians. How much of a problem is this for Labour? What\u2019s the background? For weeks, senior Labour politicians have been dogged by criticism over gifts and hospitality declared by Keir Starmer and other frontbenchers.

It looked as though Labour had managed to finally draw a line under the accusations with a vow to close a loophole that meant different rules applied to what ministers had to declare. But last week the Sun reported that Khan and the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, had been involved in talks over providing extra security for Swift\u2019s Eras Tour shows at Wembley, after initial reservations from the police. The Met is reported to have thought such a move would breach its longstanding protocols. The talks came after Swift had pulled out of three planned concerts in Vienna after Austrian police foiled a terror plot. It is understood that Swift\u2019s mother, who doubles as her manager, wanted a police escort from where the singer was staying to Wembley and threatened to cancel the London concerts if one was not provided. The newspaper claimed that the Met\u2019s special escort group were at first reluctant to give Swift a blue-light escort, usually given to senior royalty and politicians. It is VVIP protection that even Prince Harry was repeatedly denied. Cooper attended one of the concerts with her husband, Ed Balls. This weekend the Sunday Times reported that the attorney general, Richard Hermer, told the Met he would provide it with \u201clegal cover\u201d to provide an escort. He is not known to have attended one of Swift\u2019s concerts. All this has led to claims that the Met was pressed into giving Swift the security because of \u201cundue influence\u201d from senior politicians who attended the concerts. Do celebrities routinely get police escorts? It is not unusual for event organisers who oversee events on the scale of Swift\u2019s summer tour to work with police forces on security arrangements. Whether or not the celebrities get police escorts is linked to the current threat level and how many people are due to attend a specific event. Transport for London (TfL) data shows that exits at Wembley Park tube station between June and August, around the time of Swift\u2019s shows, were up 18.2% on the same period in summer 2019. Wembley Park ranked in the top 5% out of 434 stations operated by TfL, ahead of many prime central London locations. Swift\u2019s concerts are said to have generated approximately \u00a3300m from tourists, meaning any cancellation would have represented a huge loss to London\u2019s economy. What was the evidence of a threat against Swift? Swift was forced to cancel three shows in Vienna in August after two people were arrested on suspicion of planning attacks inspired by Islamic State. Weeks before this threat was revealed, Swift expressed her \u201ccomplete shock\u201d when three children were killed and seven people were left in a critical condition in an attack at a dance and yoga class inspired by her music in Southport, Merseyside. A Downing Street source told the Sun that Swift\u2019s August concerts were \u201ca major event for the country\u201d. What role did the home secretary and attorney general play? Given the number of security incidents linked to Swift at the time, there were high-level meetings held between government, police and event organisers to discuss safety. The government has insisted it is right for ministers to work closely with other agencies to ensure major events can take place securely. The Times reported on Monday night that Scotland Yard had sought legal advice from the attorney general about providing a blue-light escort. He was asked to intervene after the Met warned that granting the US pop star \u201cVVIP\u201d protection would breach its longstanding protocols. A spokesperson for Lord Hermer previously said the decision was \u201csolely an operational decision for the police\u201d. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, defended Cooper\u2019s involvement. \u201cWhen you have major events, whether in London or in other parts of the UK, the home secretary will be involved in a conversation where there is a security risk,\u201d she said. Nandy rejected the suggestion there had \u201cbeen any kind of wrongdoing or undue influence\u201d. Is this a storm in a teacup?

The EEA said solutions to the poor state of Europe\u2019s water included reducing demand, releasing fewer harmful substances, and restoring rivers and wetlands. The scientists pointed to the floods that ravaged central Europe last month as examples of weather events that have made action more urgent. \u201cHaving a healthy aquatic ecosystem helps mitigate the impacts we\u2019re seeing of climate change,\u201d said Trine Christiansen, a co-author of the report. \u201cThe better the [water] situation we have, the more capable we are of handling these more extreme events.\u201d The EEA partly attributed the lack of improvement in the chemical status of surface water to pollutants with long lifespans such as mercury and brominated flame retardants. Prof Dietrich Borchardt, a water scientist from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research who was not involved in the report, said he welcomed the inclusion of nature restoration and climate change in the assessment but wished it had explicitly considered climate projections. He said: \u201cI would also have liked to have seen a more detailed examination of why the water situation in Europe has hardly improved for two decades \u2013 and what the key factors are for not only maintaining the status quo but also achieving substantial improvements.\u201d The lobby group Water Europe called on Monday for \u20ac255bn (\u00a3213bn) in water investments by 2030 to protect Europe\u2019s economy and ensure environmental sustainability. It warned that water scarcity, which affects one in three Europeans, also threatened key industries such as the production of semiconductors, datacentres, renewable hydrogen, and electric vehicle batteries.",

Israel is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/unifil-israeli-tanks-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran\">also facing international criticism</a> for at least three violations that have injured five members of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Italy, the UK, France and Germany released a joint statement condemning Israel for repeatedly attacking UN peacekeepers. \u201cThese attacks must stop immediately,\u201d they said, adding deliberate attacks were against international law.</p> \n<p>The UN security council expressed strong concern about the attacks. In a statement adopted by consensus, the 15-member council urged all parties \u2013 without naming them \u2013 to respect the safety and security of the personnel and premises of the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil. \u201cUN peacekeepers and UN premises must never be the target of an attack,\u201d said the council, reiterating its support for Unifil and the operation\u2019s importance for regional stability.</p> \n<p>The security council also called for the full implementation of its resolution 1701, which was adopted in 2006 with the aim of keeping peace on the border between Lebanon and Israel.</p> \n<p>Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday evening that accusations Israeli troops had deliberately harmed peacekeepers were \u201ccompletely false\u201d, as he repeated a call for them to withdraw from combat zones close to the border.</p> \n<p>He said Hezbollah used Unifil positions as cover for attacks that have killed Israelis, including on Sunday, when a drone attack on a military base killed four soldiers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIsrael has every right to defend itself against Hezbollah and will continue to do so,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding that he regretted any harm to Unifil personnel but the best way to ensure their safety was \u201cto heed Israel\u2019s request and to temporarily get out of harm\u2019s way\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UN\u2019s peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said later that peacekeepers would stay in all positions in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe decision was made that Unifil would currently stay in all its positions in spite of the calls that were made by the Israel Defense Forces [IDF] to vacate the positions that are in the vicinity of the blue line,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Five peacekeepers have been wounded in attacks that struck their positions since Israel began a ground campaign against the Hezbollah militant group, with most blamed on Israeli forces. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said: \u201cTheir work is very important. It\u2019s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was no immediate comment from the IDF or Hezbollah on the Aitou strike or its target. The IDF said it had targeted the head of the powerful Lebanese militia\u2019s anti-tank unit, Muhammad Kamel Naim, in a strike on Monday in the southern city of Nabatieh.</p> \n<p>On Monday evening, Hezbollah appeared to respond to the Aitou attack by firing a salvo of at least three rockets at Israel\u2019s commercial and diplomatic centre, Tel Aviv. Air raid sirens were triggered across vast swathes of central and northern Israel, but the attack was intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence systems.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ede62d66-8e88-485a-9cf3-2029e836acce\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4vloxw-Xr6M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Sunday Hezbollah inflicted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/hezbollah-drone-attack-on-israel-army-idf-base\">deadliest attack so far on Israel</a> during the two-week-old war, a drone strike on a military base near Binyamina that killed four soldiers and severely wounded another seven.

      "bodyText": "More than 20 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Christian town in northern Lebanon, prompting Hezbollah to fire rockets at Tel Aviv, as Israel\u2019s multifront war continues to escalate. It was also a particularly bloody 24 hours in the Gaza Strip. Four people were killed in an Israeli bombing of a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, another strike on a nearby school used as a shelter killed at least 20 people, and a drone strike killed five children playing on the street in al-Shati camp in Gaza City, according to local health authorities. Rights groups say Israel is seeking to forcibly expel the remaining population of northern Gaza in a ferocious renewed campaign on the besieged Palestinian territory. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties in the three incidents on Sunday and Monday. The bombing in Lebanon on Monday afternoon that struck Aitou, a Maronite village near the northern city of Tripoli, hit a small apartment building, killing 21 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross. Footage from the scene broadcast by Lebanese TV channels showed a heavily damaged building, destroyed cars, and dead and injured people lying on the street as people dug through the rubble. Aitou is far from Hezbollah\u2019s power centres in Beirut and the south and east of the country. The village\u2019s mayor, Joseph Trad, told Reuters the building had been rented to families displaced by the war. The strike was one of several over the past two weeks targeting areas thought to be \u201csafe\u201d, including the bombing of a displacement centre in the southern town of Wardaniyeh last week. Israel is also facing international criticism for at least three violations that have injured five members of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. On Monday, Italy, the UK, France and Germany released a joint statement condemning Israel for repeatedly attacking UN peacekeepers. \u201cThese attacks must stop immediately,\u201d they said, adding deliberate attacks were against international law. The UN security council expressed strong concern about the attacks. In a statement adopted by consensus, the 15-member council urged all parties \u2013 without naming them \u2013 to respect the safety and security of the personnel and premises of the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil. \u201cUN peacekeepers and UN premises must never be the target of an attack,\u201d said the council, reiterating its support for Unifil and the operation\u2019s importance for regional stability. The security council also called for the full implementation of its resolution 1701, which was adopted in 2006 with the aim of keeping peace on the border between Lebanon and Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday evening that accusations Israeli troops had deliberately harmed peacekeepers were \u201ccompletely false\u201d, as he repeated a call for them to withdraw from combat zones close to the border. He said Hezbollah used Unifil positions as cover for attacks that have killed Israelis, including on Sunday, when a drone attack on a military base killed four soldiers. \u201cIsrael has every right to defend itself against Hezbollah and will continue to do so,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding that he regretted any harm to Unifil personnel but the best way to ensure their safety was \u201cto heed Israel\u2019s request and to temporarily get out of harm\u2019s way\u201d. The UN\u2019s peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said later that peacekeepers would stay in all positions in Lebanon. \u201cThe decision was made that Unifil would currently stay in all its positions in spite of the calls that were made by the Israel Defense Forces [IDF] to vacate the positions that are in the vicinity of the blue line,\u201d he said. Five peacekeepers have been wounded in attacks that struck their positions since Israel began a ground campaign against the Hezbollah militant group, with most blamed on Israeli forces. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said: \u201cTheir work is very important. It\u2019s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.\u201d There was no immediate comment from the IDF or Hezbollah on the Aitou strike or its target. The IDF said it had targeted the head of the powerful Lebanese militia\u2019s anti-tank unit, Muhammad Kamel Naim, in a strike on Monday in the southern city of Nabatieh. On Monday evening, Hezbollah appeared to respond to the Aitou attack by firing a salvo of at least three rockets at Israel\u2019s commercial and diplomatic centre, Tel Aviv. Air raid sirens were triggered across vast swathes of central and northern Israel, but the attack was intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence systems. On Sunday Hezbollah inflicted the deadliest attack so far on Israel during the two-week-old war, a drone strike on a military base near Binyamina that killed four soldiers and severely wounded another seven. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, vowed \u201ca forceful response\u201d to the attack during a phone call with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Monday. In Gaza, four people were killed in an Israeli strike on the courtyard of al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the centre of the territory early on Monday. The bombing triggered a large fire, leaving 25 people with severe burns. The hospital was already struggling to cope with treating the wounded from a strike on Sunday night on a school turned shelter in the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp that killed at least 20 people. Five children in al-Shati camp in Gaza City were also killed on Sunday in a drone strike, Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said. Later on Monday, the IDF said a soldier had been killed in combat in southern Gaza. The renewed aerial attacks come amid Israel\u2019s latest campaign in Jabaliya, a district of Gaza City, now in its second week. An estimated 400,000 people are trapped by the fighting and Israel has not allowed any food to enter the north since the start of the month, leading the UN World Food Programme to once again raise the alarm of imminent famine. The entirety of northern Gaza is now under Israeli evacuation orders. Among those who have remained in the north are disabled or elderly people and their families, who say it is too dangerous and difficult to move. Israel has not allowed anyone from above what is now known as the Netzarim corridor bisecting the strip to return home; those clinging on in the north fear that if they leave, they will face the same fate. On Monday, the Israeli-Palestinian rights groups B\u2019Tselem, Gisha, Yesh Din and Physicians for Human Rights called on the international community to prevent Israel from carrying out the \u201cgenerals\u2019 plan\u201d, described as a \u201cstarve or surrender\u201d strategy that could amount to war crimes. In a statement, the rights groups said there were \u201calarming signs\u201d that Israel was beginning to implement the plan in Jabaliya, and warned that states \u201chave an obligation to prevent the crimes of starvation and forcible transfer\u201d. The IDF says it has not received such orders. However, citing \u201csenior defence officials\u201d, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Sunday that the Israeli government had given up on stalled ceasefire and hostage release talks in the year-old war, and the political leadership was instead \u201cpushing for the gradual annexation of large parts of Gaza\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Ben Fisher was in Cardiff tonight, and his verdict has landed. Here it is! Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night. A radiant Craig Bellamy, smiling in cat-cream mode, is asked what made him happy by S4C. \u201cBeing able to control the tempo of the second half \u2026 now, we still need improvement on it \u2026 obviously you\u2019ll get breaks when you go forward and you feel like you can score from every opportunity \u2026 but then they\u2019re dangerous then for the counter \u2026 it\u2019s that transitional game that becomes a little bit complicated \u2026 in the first half they sat deeper \u2026 at this present moment that really suits us \u2026 we were able to control it a little bit better than we have [previously] been able to do \u2026 this Nations League is so good, so competitive \u2026 but it allows you to play players who need game time \u2026 it\u2019s going to take 20-plus players to have a real good go at qualifying for a major tournament \u2026 so to get the minutes in \u2026 expose the players \u2026 it\u2019s really beneficial to us in the long run \u2026 there are still bits of improvement we need but that was better.\u201d Let\u2019s bing-bong, like a pixel in a game of Pong, back to Reykjavik, and two emails sent by Iceland fan K\u00e1ri Tulinius. The first came when the score was Iceland 1-2 Turkey, the second after full time, with the Turks having run out 4-2 winners. The lead was nice while it lasted, but at least Kahveci\u2019s equalizer was a beautiful strike from well outside the penalty box. Worth looking up. Admittedly, the Icelandic defenders might well have pressed him a bit, but I\u2019ll be generous and say they played the percentages. \u00c7alhano\u011flu\u2019s penalty was his second, as he\u2019d slipped and kicked a previous penalty into his leg, leading to an indirect free kick. Iceland v Turkey was indeed an emotional roller coaster. I was up when Iceland scored, higher when \u00c7alhano\u011flu miskicked a penalty, still up when Turkey equalized because it was a beautiful long-range goal by Kahveci, down when \u00c7alhano\u011flu scored from a second penalty, back up when Iceland equalized, and then down in the dumps when a tired Icelandic defense capitulated at the last. I need sleep. David Brooks speaks to S4C. \u201cIt was a very dominant performance in the first half \u2026 second half we let off a little bit \u2026 we need to work on that \u2026 we need to get used to putting teams to bed \u2026 it was a good performance \u2026 the main thing is the win \u2026 we were all pretty excited to be playing \u2026 we like to be fluid \u2026 I need to hit the target a bit better \u2026 it was good in the first half but we need to kick on a bit \u2026 you never know with a new gaffer but the style of play looked really good [watching the first two games of the group] \u2026 plenty to build on!\u201d Yep, it\u2019s full time in Reykjavik: Iceland 2-4 Turkey. All of which means Group B4 looks like this heading into the November international break. The top team will win promotion to League A, while the second-placed side will qualify for the promotion play-offs. The third-placed team will go into the relegation play-offs, while the bottom side will be relegated to League C. The next round of games see Wales travel to Turkey while Montenegro host Iceland. Turkey P4 W3 D1 L0 F8 A3 Pts 10 Wales P4 W2 D2 L0 F5 A3 Pts 8 Iceland P4 W1 D1 L2 F7 A9 Pts 4 Montenegro P4 W0 D0 L4 F1 A6 Pts 0 The other game in Group B4 has been quite the ride. Turkey have surely settled it thanks to Kerem Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu\u2019s goal in the fifth minute of added time. It\u2019s Iceland 2-4 Turkey. The whistle goes, and Wales retain hope of promotion from Group B4! Not only that, Craig Bellamy becomes the first Wales manager to remain unbeaten after his first four matches. 90 min +4: \u2026 but it almost certainly won\u2019t matter, because Sheehan wins a clock-eating free kick out on the Wales left. This is all but over. 90 min +3: Thomas hits the corner long. Moore tries to trundle it in at the far stick, but can only run it out for a goal kick. Montenegro launch it, but to little effect, and soon enough Thomas is skedaddling down the left flank. He\u2019s free! He reaches the box but instead of shooting from a tight angle looks for either Moore or Cooper in the middle. An accurate cross would lead to a tap-in. The cross is not accurate. 90 min +2: From the middle of the D, Williams sends a vicious sidefoot towards the bottom-left corner. Not quite low enough, and it\u2019s an easy height for Niki\u0107 to palm around the post. Corner. 90 min +1: Moore latches onto a loose ball and dribbles his way down the inside-right channel. Hecould shoot from the edge of the D, but seems happy enough to pause and draw a clumsy, desperate foul from \u0160ip\u010di\u0107. The Montenegro defender goes into the book. Williams and Thomas consider the free kick. 90 min: There will be four additional minutes. 89 min: A double change for Wales, as Cooper and Moore come on for Cullen and Harris. 88 min: It\u2019s been a cracker in Reykjavik. The young superstar Arda G\u00fcler looks to have settled a five-goal thriller in Turkey\u2019s favour! It\u2019s 2-3. 87 min: Both teams are looking pretty ragged now, presumably aware that joy and misery are both very live possibilities for everyone involved. 85 min: Krstovi\u0107 storms into acres of space down the right, then cuts back for Joveti\u0107, who cocks to shoot only to be blocked bravely by Williams. Then the flag goes up for offside anyway. The stadium fell silent for a split second there, as the Welsh lead momentarily looked in serious danger. 83 min: Iceland have equalised against Turkey in Reykjavik. Andri Gudjohnsen makes it 2-2! 82 min: Jankovi\u0107 is replaced by Ku\u010d. 81 min: \u2026 and it nearly costs Wales dearly, as Jovovi\u0107 whips in a cross from the left, Krstovi\u0107 meeting it with a powerful header that only just clears the bar. Not sure Darlow was stopping that had it been on target. 79 min: Harris powers down the middle from deep and is upended. He springs up quickly and takes the free kick without faffing around. Williams is sent scampering down the right into acres of space. He curls infield for Broadhead, who chests down adroitly on the edge of the box and has to shoot \u2026 but hesitates, getting his feet in an awful muddle, and the chance is gone. That should have been a second goal for Wales. 77 min: Cullen and Williams combine well down the right to earn another corner. Thomas wanders across to take it. It\u2019s half cleared to Williams, who considers shooting first time from stupid distance, but sensibly, albeit slightly disappointingly, decides against it. He advance a few steps and eventually pulls the trigger, but his shot is easily blocked. What could have been. 75 min: Vuk\u010devi\u0107 chops his way past Thomas down the right flank and is brought down by the corner flag. A free kick that\u2019s effectively a corner. Jankovi\u0107 batters it straight into Thomas, and now it is an actual corner. Wales clear it easily enough, but the visitors are well in this game now. 73 min: Joveti\u0107 reminds everyone this is very much still in the balance by flaying a shot over the bar from 25 yards. There\u2019s a bit of tension in the Cardiff City Stadium. 72 min: Back in Cardiff, Wales turn it up a notch. Williams wins a corner down the right. That comes to nothing, but Thomas probes down the inside-left, before swinging a long cross towards Williams, who lashes a fierce drive over the bar from a tight angle. In truth it was never anywhere near, but this is better after a slightly ragged period. 70 min: Turkey have turned it around in Reykjavik. Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu\u2019s penalty gives the Euro 2024 quarter-finalists a 2-1 lead against Iceland. 69 min: Craig Bellamy responds to this state of affairs by replacing Burns and Wilson with Thomas and Broadhead. 68 min: For the first time this evening, Wales are beginning to look a little stretched. Are we witnessing another second-half downturn? 66 min: So much for the danger. Joveti\u0107 sends a hysterical effort, presumably meant for the top-right corner, high into the stand behind. 65 min: A ball comes in from the Montenegro left. Jankovi\u0107 shapes like Zinedine Zidane in the 2002 Champions League final, but isn\u2019t able to cream a shot goalwards, as he\u2019s clipped mid-volley by Harris. It will be a free kick just to the left of the Wales D, though. A very dangerous position. 63 min: Turkey have equalised in Reykjavik, \u0130rfan Kahveci levelling against Iceland. It\u2019s all to play for in Group B4 all right. 62 min: Radulovi\u0107 is beginning to cause problems for Wales down the inside-right channel. He should probably tee up Vuk\u010devi\u0107, haring in on the overlap, for a shot from a tight angle, but overcooks the pass. Vuk\u010devi\u0107 hooks back from the byline but the chance is gone and Wales clear up. 60 min: Burns makes good down the left and crosses low for Cullen, who instigates an almighty scramble in the Montenegro box but can\u2019t get a shot away. The visitors eventually clear their lines. The second half took a while to get going, but it\u2019s good fun now. 59 min: Brooks makes way for the equally popular Allen, who returns to international football after his self-imposed exile. 58 min: Baki\u0107 is booked for a fairly agricultural lunge on Cullen. Montenegro are beginning to lose it. 56 min: Oh my goodness. Montenegro have done nothing so far, but now they nearly equalise in sensational style. Radulovi\u0107 cuts in from the right, seeing off Davies with ease, before sending a power-curler across and over Darlow, towards the top left, and off the crossbar. The resulting TWANG can be heard in Swansea. That would have been a peach. Presumably the aesthete Bellamy, preaching his art-for-art\u2019s-sake doctrine, would have rather that had gone in? You\u2019d like to think so, wouldn\u2019t you. 55 min: Williams, Brooks and Wilson paint some pretty triangles at high speed down the right-hand side of the pitch. The flowing move eventually breaks down, but full marks for both aesthetic effect and ambition, and you can be sure Craig Bellamy approves. 53 min: Another sub goes into the book. This time it\u2019s Vuk\u010devi\u0107, for brazenly kneeing Davies up the fundament, then throwing the ball away upon being penalised for it. Robert Prosinecki\u2019s half-time hairdrying technique needs some recalibration. 51 min: It\u2019s been an admin-infused start to the second half, but otherwise, there\u2019s nothing much going on. \u201cHarry Wilson is such a good footballer, but has just never had the consistency,\u201d writes Matt Dony of today\u2019s Player of the Match So Far. \u201cAs a youngster at Liverpool, it looked like he could be a top, top, top player. Ultimately, though, he\u2019s never put it all together for any length of time. (See also: Dan James) I love watching him play, and he\u2019s had some brilliant moments in a Welsh shirt. He\u2019s never going to be the player he threatened to be, but hey, he\u2019s hardly unique in that respect.\u201d 49 min: A cross comes into the Welsh box. Joveti\u0107 sticks up a leg, is penalised for a high boot, and complains about it. He goes into the book, and will miss Montenegro\u2019s next match, at home against Iceland, as a result. Not the immediate impact his coach would have been looking for. 47 min: Thick smoke pours from the fourth-official\u2019s numbers board. OK, not really, but in a parallel universe, etc. Wales get the second half underway. Montenegro have made four changes. Joveti\u0107 replaces Mugo\u0161a and gets his armband back. Meanwhile Radunovi\u0107, Radulovi\u0107 and Marko Vuk\u010devi\u0107 come on for Andrija Vuk\u010devi\u0107, Camaj and Maru\u0161i\u0107. In the other Group B4 match, it\u2019s Iceland 1-0 Turkey at half-time. Orri \u00d3skarsson with a third-minute goal. Should both matches end like this, we\u2019ll have quite the battle for promotion to League A on our hands. And quite the scrap to avoid third spot and the relegation play-offs. It promises to be a lot of fun! (And let\u2019s try our best to remember that when we all start moaning ahead of the November international break.) Wales P3 W2 D2 L0 F5 A3 Pts 8 Turkey P3 W2 D1 L1 F4 A2 Pts 7 Iceland P3 W2 D1 L1 F6 A5 Pts 7 Montenegro P3 W0 D0 L4 F1 A6 Pts 0 Half-time advertisement. Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now! Wales have the lead they deserve, and for the most part, had the control their new boss Craig Bellamy desires. 45 min +2: A careless Burns backpass down the Montenegro right forces Sheehan into the concession of a corner. Some unnecessary pressure for Wales to deal with late in the half. But Rodon rises highest to head the corner clear. 45 min: There will be two additional first-half minutes. 44 min: Cullen latches onto a loose ball in the centre circle. He\u2019s got options with Montenegro light at the back, but gets over-excited and plays a premature pass down the middle in the hope of finding Harris, who is never getting to the ball. The crowd groan as the chance of a dangerous counter-attack passes by. 42 min: That man Wilson shifts the ball between his feet on the edge of the Montenegro D, seeing off \u0160ip\u010di\u0107 before whipping a crisp drive inches wide of the right-hand post. 41 min: Wilson is everywhere at the moment. He slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Brooks, who can\u2019t get a meaningful shot away on the edge of the box. Shame, because Burns had started that move with a clever turn and surge. 40 min: Another free kick on the right, though this one\u2019s up the other end, Jankovi\u0107 being clipped by Cullen. Montenegro line up on the edge of the Welsh area. Wilson, a hero right now at both ends, heads the free kick powerfully clear. 38 min: Brooks is skittled by Vuk\u010devi\u0107 out on the right wing. Wilson swings a dangerous free kick into the mixer, but the whistle goes after some overly excited Welsh engagement. 37 min: Krstovi\u0107 tries to respond immediately, powering his way past Williams down the left and shooting low and hard towards the bottom left. Darlow gets down at his near post and handles well. Especially as the shot took a very slight deflection en route to the keeper. There\u2019s the usual pre-penalty faff, the defenders doing their best to drag things out. But it doesn\u2019t put Wilson off. He waits patiently, before giving Niki\u0107 the eyes, and passing into the bottom left, the keeper having been sent the wrong way. Wales deservedly lead! 34 min: Wilson attempts a Cruyff Turn just inside the box on the right. He\u2019s nicked by the utterly foxed Jovovi\u0107, and though the referee takes his sweet time, he eventually points to the spot! 33 min: \u2026 so having said that (again) \u2026 Brooks shoots from distance. Niki\u0107 turns the shot around the post for a corner. It\u2019s sent in from the right, and \u2026 32 min: Wales have been the better team, but Montenegro keeper Niki\u0107 hasn\u2019t had to be a hero, and the match is beginning to drift a little. All a bit tepid. Which is ironic, as Peter Oh points out: \u201cWales\u2019 fire-breathing dragon meets Montenegro\u2019s double-headed eagle. As far as clashes of mythical creatures on federation crests go, this is about as a hot as it gets.\u201d 30 min: Burns wins a corner down the left. He sends it in for Davies, who competes for a header in the six-yard box, but with too much vigour. A free kick releases the pressure on Montenegro. 28 min: \u2026 so having said that, Davies absent-mindedly ships possession 30 yards out, allowing Jovovi\u0107 a whack at goal from the edge of the D. The Wales captain is fortunate Sheehan races back to slide and block. 26 min: Wilson plays another ball down the inside-right channel, this time for Harris, who wins a corner. Wilson swings it in to little effect, Vuja\u010di\u0107 clearing with confidence. But the hosts continue to dominate. Darlow, in the Welsh goal, has had absolutely nothing to do. His defenders haven\u2019t exactly been pushed either. 24 min: Brooks, calling the shots from a deep position on the right flank, pearls a glorious crossfield pass towards Burns, on the edge of the box. Burns can\u2019t bring it down, which is such a shame, because he\u2019d have been clear, albeit facing a tight angle, and that ball would have been one hell of an assist. 22 min: Wilson rolls a cute pass down the inside-right channel for Cullen to latch onto. Niki\u0107 comes racing to the edge of his box, and is fortunate that Cullen\u2019s attempted lob clears the bar of the now-unguarded goal. 20 min: \u201cThe Icelandic opener was a bit odd,\u201d reports K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cin that Orri Steinn \u00d3skarsson was put through at the half-way line, and ran all the way into the penalty box with a defender at his heels the whole time, yet the Turkish player made no attempt to foul him. The purist in me was appalled at the lack of poor sportsmanship, but as an Icelander I can\u2019t but applaud such fair play.\u201d Jesse Pennington would surely have approved. 19 min: Nothing comes of the set piece, but an opening goal for Wales feels little more than a matter of time. 18 min: Wales have the run of this right flank. Williams tears down it and looks for Cabango in the middle. The ball only just evades Harris\u2019s toe. Maru\u0161i\u0107 is forced to turn the ball out for a corner. 17 min: Wilson \u2013 again from the right \u2013 strides into the box and takes a whack at goal. Niki\u0107 makes a stop. Wales well on top. 16 min: Wales are also enjoying the dragon\u2019s share of possession. Exactly as control-obsessed Craig Bellamy demanded in his pre-match interview. Williams probes down the right; Brooks tries to sort his feet to shoot on the edge of the D; Cullen attempts to thread a pass through the middle of the Montenegro defence to release Wilson. Not quite (x3). But it\u2019s got the crowd going. 14 min: Brooks dances in from the right and shoots through a pair of legs. Easy for the keeper. Wales are enjoying plenty of joy down this flank. 12 min: Wilson cuts in from the right and crosses deep. It\u2019s a sensational cross, and Montenegro\u2019s defence is all over the place. Burns arrives on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box and should score, especially as keeper Niki\u0107 is on walkabout, but he flashes a header wide. 10 min: Iceland have taken the lead against Turkey in the other Group B4 game. Orri \u00d3skarsson, who gave Wales the runaround in the second half last Friday, gets an early reward. \u201cShame Milutin Osmaji\u0107 is banned for this match,\u201d chatters Matthew Lawrenson. \u201cNo doubt he\u2019d be champing at the bit to sink his teeth into the Wales defence.\u201d 8 min: Brooks dribbles elegantly in from the right. He nearly makes it all the way to the corner of the six-yard box, but can\u2019t get a shot away before \u0160ip\u010di\u0107 comes across to slide out for a corner. That\u2019s fine play all round. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. 6 min: Vuk\u010devi\u0107 chops inside from the left touchline and is clipped by Williams, who is told in no uncertain terms by the referee to stop it. One more foul by a Welsh defender and the official\u2019s patience could snap early doors. 5 min: Camaj hoicks a dismal diagonal into the crowded Welsh area, allowing Darlow, winning his second cap at the age of 34, to calmly usher the ball out for a goal kick. 4 min: Yes, so scrub that. Jovovi\u0107 embarks on a powerful dribble down the left and draws a foul from Sheehan. A chance for the visitors to load the box. 2 min: Brooks wins a corner down the right. It comes to nothing, but all signs point to another confident fast start by Bellamy\u2019s showmen. 3 sec: Montenegro dummy the kick-off, and make an almighty balls of it, losing possession almost immediately. Not an auspicious start for the visitors. Here we go, then; Montenegro kick off. The home fans in full voice. The teams are out! An amazing atmosphere at the Cardiff City Stadium. Wales in red, Montenegro in second-choice white. We\u2019ll be off in a few minutes, once the hymns and arias are sung. As if anyone will stop. Ar hyd y nos. Craig Bellamy speaks to S4C. \u201cMark Harris has trained really well \u2026 and has been playing well for Oxford \u2026 he definitely fits in to how we do things \u2026 we need to keep the ball and have control \u2026 we cannot get involved in a basketball game \u2026 that would suit Montenegro \u2026 we need control of the game.\u201d He\u2019s then asked if he\u2019ll be \u201ckeeping an extra eye on what happens after half-time tonight\u201d in the wake of recent fast starts and comparatively subdued second-half performances. \u201cNo.\u201d [broad smile] \u201cNo!\u201d [exits stage right] As for the Montenegro team \u2026 they make two changes from their one-goal defeat in Turkey on Friday night. Star man and captain Stevan Joveti\u0107, the country\u2019s leading scorer with 36 goals, drops to the bench, both place and armband taken by Stefan Mugo\u0161a. Marko Jankovi\u0107 meanwhile replaces Edvin Ku\u010d in midfield. A reminder of how Group B4 stands after the third round of matches. Group leaders Turkey travel to Iceland tonight. Turkey P3 W2 D1 L0 F4 A1 Pts 7 Wales P3 W1 D2 L0 F4 A3 Pts 5 Iceland P3 W1 D1 L1 F5 A5 Pts 4 Montenegro P3 W0 D0 L3 F1 A5 Pts 0 Should tonight\u2019s game end goalless, at least we\u2019ll have witnessed some history. Which is probably overselling things a tad, but facts are facts. Wales\u2019 last two home matches have ended 0-0 (against Poland and Turkey) and they\u2019ve never had three home goalless draws in a row before. Hmm. This is a little bit more inspiring, though: should Craig Bellamy avoid defeat, he\u2019ll become the first Wales manager to remain unbeaten after his first four matches. Bellamy may be all about the entertainment, but the man gets results as well. Wales have won the last two of their four meetings with Montenegro, having lost both of the first two. We didn\u2019t MBM the most recent, played last month under rainy skies in Nik\u0161i\u0107, but the game did get the Clockwatch treatment, which amounted to nearly the same. So reliving that success is still possible. That success is Wales\u2019 only win in their past nine Nations League matches, the others ending in three draws and five defeats. Wales make seven changes to the starting XI named for the 2-2 draw in Iceland. Neco Williams, Harry Wilson, Joe Rodon and captain Ben Davies are the only players to keep their place. Joe Allen, out of international retirement, is named on the bench, alongside uncapped defender Owen Beck. Oxford striker Mark Harris makes his first start. Wales: Darlow, Cabango, Rodon, B Davies, Burns, Wilson, Sheehan, N Williams, Cullen, Harris, Brooks. Subs: Ward, Davies, Mepham, Norrington-Davies, Allen, Koumas, Cooper, Moore, Roberts, Beck, Thomas, Broadhead. Montenegro: Niki\u0107, A Vuk\u010devi\u0107, \u0160ip\u010di\u0107, Vuja\u010di\u0107, Maru\u0161i\u0107, V Jovovi\u0107, Jankovi\u0107, M Baki\u0107, Camaj, Mugo\u0161a, N Krstovi\u0107. Subs: Mijatovi\u0107, Petkovi\u0107, Radunovi\u0107, Vuk\u010devi\u0107, Tu\u0107i, Joveti\u0107, Ku\u010d, Vukoti\u0107, Rube\u017ei\u0107, Vukoti\u0107, Radulovi\u0107. Referee: Filip Glova (Slovakia). All together now \u2026 \u266b Meet the gang cos the boys are here The boys to entertain you! B! O! B-O-Y-S! Boys to entertain yooooooou! \u266a\u266b Kick-off is at 7.45pm BST. It\u2019s on!",

She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work,\u201d <a href=\"https://barackobama.medium.com/my-statement-on-the-passing-of-lilly-ledbetter-6f2c7d2d04af\">wrote Barack Obama</a>, who in 2009 signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.</p> <p>Ledbetter worked at a Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber plant in Alabama and learned that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/30/obama-lilly-ledbetter-equal-pay\">earned less than</a> her male colleagues who did the same job.</p> <p>Ledbetter filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer in 1998 after discovering that her annual salary was $6,500 less than the lowest-paid male supervisor. The case reached the US supreme court, which ruled in 2007 that she filed her lawsuit too late. That meant she never received the $3.8m in backpay and damages slated for her as part of a lower-court ruling.</p> <p>The lawsuit attracted national attention. Obama co-sponsored legislation that allowed workers greater latitude to sue their employers for unequal pay and gave women six months after receiving any discriminatory pay cheque to seek redress.</p> <p>Republicans, including then president George W Bush, opposed the bill, but once Obama took office, Congress approved the legislation, and Obama signed it into law. It was his first approval of legislation.</p> <p>Ledbetter joined Obama, his wife Michelle, and labor activists at the White House for the ceremony.</p> <p>\u201cThis one\u2019s for Lilly,\u201d Obama said at the time, handing Ledbetter a pen. \u201cMaking our economy work means making sure it works for everyone. That there are no second-class citizens in our workplaces, and that it\u2019s not just unfair and illegal \u2013 but bad for business \u2013 to pay someone less because of their gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion or disability.\u201d</p> <p>Ledbetter continued to advocate for workers\u2019 rights. She spoke at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9YTvOXAkWc\">Democratic national convention</a> in 2012.</p> <p>\u201cI was shortchanged, but this fight became bigger than Lilly Ledbetter. Today it\u2019s about my daughter. It\u2019s about my granddaughter. It\u2019s about women and men. It\u2019s about families. It\u2019s about equality and justice.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, she again appeared at the White House as Obama approved executive actions which barred federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss their salaries and instructed the labor department to collect statistics from such contractors on pay for men and women, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/us/politics/obama-signs-measures-to-help-close-gender-gap-in-pay.html\">New York Times reported</a>.</p> <p>Ledbetter also wrote an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/opinion/lilly-ledbetter-metoo-equal-pay.html\">opinion piece in the Times</a> in 2018, during the height of the #MeToo movement, in which she detailed the sexual harassment she faced at Goodyear.</p> <p>\u201cSexual harassment isn\u2019t about sex, just like pay discrimination isn\u2019t just about pay. Both are about power. They are clear evidence that too many workplaces value women less,\u201d Ledbetter wrote.</p> <p>Just last week, a movie about Ledbetter, <a href=\"https://www.lillymovie.com/\">Lilly</a>, starring Patricia Clarkson, premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival.</p> <p>\u201cThis was the privilege of my life to play this great woman,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.today.com/video/patricia-clarkson-talks-new-movie-and-lilly-ledbetter-s-legacy-221180997865\">Clark said</a> on Today. \u201cThis woman who had so much grace and grit and glory. She was remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Ledbetter\u2019s efforts, a gender pay gap in the USs persists. The <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2024/womens-earnings-were-83-6-percent-of-mens-in-2023.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics reported</a> in March that women earned 83% of what men made last year.</p>",

Ledbetter worked at a Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber plant in Alabama and learned that she earned less than her male colleagues who did the same job. Ledbetter filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer in 1998 after discovering that her annual salary was $6,500 less than the lowest-paid male supervisor. The case reached the US supreme court, which ruled in 2007 that she filed her lawsuit too late. That meant she never received the $3.8m in backpay and damages slated for her as part of a lower-court ruling. The lawsuit attracted national attention. Obama co-sponsored legislation that allowed workers greater latitude to sue their employers for unequal pay and gave women six months after receiving any discriminatory pay cheque to seek redress. Republicans, including then president George W Bush, opposed the bill, but once Obama took office, Congress approved the legislation, and Obama signed it into law. It was his first approval of legislation. Ledbetter joined Obama, his wife Michelle, and labor activists at the White House for the ceremony. \u201cThis one\u2019s for Lilly,\u201d Obama said at the time, handing Ledbetter a pen. \u201cMaking our economy work means making sure it works for everyone. That there are no second-class citizens in our workplaces, and that it\u2019s not just unfair and illegal \u2013 but bad for business \u2013 to pay someone less because of their gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion or disability.\u201d Ledbetter continued to advocate for workers\u2019 rights. She spoke at the Democratic national convention in 2012. \u201cI was shortchanged, but this fight became bigger than Lilly Ledbetter. Today it\u2019s about my daughter. It\u2019s about my granddaughter. It\u2019s about women and men. It\u2019s about families. It\u2019s about equality and justice.\u201d In 2014, she again appeared at the White House as Obama approved executive actions which barred federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss their salaries and instructed the labor department to collect statistics from such contractors on pay for men and women, the New York Times reported. Ledbetter also wrote an opinion piece in the Times in 2018, during the height of the #MeToo movement, in which she detailed the sexual harassment she faced at Goodyear. \u201cSexual harassment isn\u2019t about sex, just like pay discrimination isn\u2019t just about pay. Both are about power. They are clear evidence that too many workplaces value women less,\u201d Ledbetter wrote. Just last week, a movie about Ledbetter, Lilly, starring Patricia Clarkson, premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival. \u201cThis was the privilege of my life to play this great woman,\u201d Clark said on Today. \u201cThis woman who had so much grace and grit and glory. She was remarkable.\u201d Despite Ledbetter\u2019s efforts, a gender pay gap in the USs persists. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in March that women earned 83% of what men made last year.",

      "body": "<p>Mr Loverman, adapted from the Booker prize-winning author Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s novel, is about what it means to have a good life built on lies. A good life, but a half-life. Written by Nathaniel Price, it stars Lennie James as Barrington, the Mr Loverman of the title, Barry to his friends. Barry is a charming 75-year-old dandy (we move with him through the decades and the costume department plays a&nbsp;blinder throughout) and a successful businessman, husband, beloved father and grandfather.</p> <p>He is also the secret lover, for 50 years and counting, of Morris De La Roux (Ariyon Bakare). They have been friends since their boyhood in Antigua and soulmates since they were old enough to know what the word meant. Their relationship is a beautiful thing. When they are together, their happiness is almost palpable.</p> <p>But the 50 misspent years are tragic and their effects corrosive. Not least, of course, on Barry\u2019s wife, Carmel \u2013 played magnificently and heartbreakingly by Sharon D Clarke, to whom awards should and must be coming. Carmel has long suspected her husband of being unfaithful, although she thinks it has been with a string of women over the years. The joy she felt at being chosen by, as her cousin admiringly puts it decades on, \u201cthe most popular man on the island\u201d has curdled. She has immersed herself more and more in the church community, especially after giving up work and the various chances for happiness it and her colleagues&nbsp;offered. </p> <p>It is only the church, and perhaps her daughter Donna (Sharlene Whyte) and her grandchild, that keep despair banished to the periphery. But at her core is a yearning to be loved by Barry and her incomprehension&nbsp;at how that has failed to happen, despite the life they have built together. It is not true, as Barry claims during a night out with Morris, that \u201cnobody can stay&nbsp;depressed around me\u201d.</p>    <p>Barry is coming to a point of no return. At 75, he knows time is running out and regrets are rushing in. He tells Morris he is finally ready to leave Carmel and be with him, if still covertly. Morris looks at him with weary tenderness. They have been here before. Flashbacks gradually reveal how many times \u2013 and what&nbsp;they have cost Barry\u2019s patient, self-effacing lover.&nbsp;But Barry swears that this time it\u2019s true. He will tell her when she comes back from church. No, tomorrow. No, as he drives her to the airport to fly to Antigua to tend to her abusive, now dying father whom she has not seen for 30 years. He does not manage it. But there is a scene in the car that tears your heart open&nbsp;nevertheless.</p> <p>While they are apart, Carmel and Barry taste a different, more authentic life. Carmel\u2019s own secrets and some of her internal world are revealed, while, in London, Barry begins to realise that nothing can be hidden for ever.</p> <p>I am making it sound like a miseryfest. It is not. There is plenty of light as well as shade (much of it provided by Barry and Carmel\u2019s high-maintenance drama queen of a younger daughter, Maxine \u2013 played by Tamara Lawrance, who has funny bones), which is helped by each episode being a tight 30 minutes rather than the full hour you might expect such a drama to be&nbsp;given. But it never shies away from reality, including the homophobia of the family\u2019s community, which is especially prevalent among Carmel\u2019s posse of&nbsp;Christian&nbsp;ladies.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t shy away, either, from Barry\u2019s many flaws. Through his actions and inner monologue, viewers see life unfold around him; he is selfish, embittered and lacking in compassion. But Mr Loverman asks how you can avoid being any of these things when the world you grew up in forbade you to express yourself freely and you are discriminated against for your sexuality and your skin colour.</p> <p>This is a different, spikier, much braver tale about the Windrush generation than usually makes it on to our screens. There is closeness, vibrancy, violence and sorrow in the mix, plus an examination of many forms of love and how they can either strengthen or warp under pressure. It is more of a mood piece than an action-packed drama, with closeups of human life, with all its exquisite agonies and joys, portrayed by actors at the top of their game.</p> <p>\u2022 Mr Loverman aired on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer </p> <p><em>Mr Loverman by Bernardine Evaristo (Penguin Books Ltd, \u00a39.99).

      "body": "<p>When Dr Michael Mosley died in June, while on holiday in Greece, he was working on Just One Thing, a television version of his hugely popular BBC podcast/radio series of the same name, which had been running since 2021. He filmed enough for just two episodes, and this look at the benefits of cold showers is the first. Each instalment of the podcast was a short slice of simplicity. In less than 15 minutes, usually, Mosley would examine the idea that one easy shift in habits could improve your health. From doing yoga to eating nuts, from dancing to scoffing (a small amount of) dark chocolate and drinking coffee, his warm approach to discussing body and mind made change seem easy, understandable and, crucially, possible.</p> <p>Here, he sticks to the Just One Thing format, but it\u2019s longer and has visuals, so we get to see the effects of his single, simple change \u2013 what he refers to as a Just One Thing Challenge \u2013 on the volunteers who have signed up to try it out. First, he takes a classic early podcast episode about cold showers and uses single mother Jayne, from north Wales, as his guinea pig. Jayne explains that she is \u201cpermanently knackered\u201d and that she is recovering from a year of colds and infections that saw her end up in hospital. The scare was, she explains, the \u201ckick up the bum\u201d she needed to pay more attention to her health.</p> <p>Which is why she ends up agreeing to turn her usual hot shower to cold, initially for 10 to 15 seconds, with the aim of building up to 30 seconds. Unless you\u2019ve already done it, Mosley advises, this can be \u201cquite hardcore\u201d, and the shrieks from Jayne\u2019s bathroom suggest she is certainly feeling the chill. She ropes in three of her friends to join her in the challenge, and as well as the home-chilled method, they also try cold showers on the beach, water tubing in the River Dee, and, eventually, inevitably, wild swimming (presumably in a rare stretch of water not currently polluted by the sewage that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/13/sewage-english-spring-water-village-suffers-supected-unlawful-spills\">water companies are dumping into them</a> at a staggering rate).</p> <p>Does it work? Well, as anyone who swims outdoors on a regular basis will be eager to tell you, it is very likely that it does indeed do you good. The daily cold shower proves to be energising, the women\u2019s bodies slowly adjust to regular immersion in cold water, and the resulting stress relief is exactly what Jayne has been looking for. The prospect of a cold shower might be a hard sell in October, when the jumpers are coming out and the heating is going on, but overall, this is just as convincing as the podcast, and it is nice to see the sheer joy that Jayne and her friends get from splashing around in the great outdoors.</p>    <p>Sara Cox does the voiceover that Mosley was never able to record. Whenever you hear her voice, delivering the safety information, the disclaimers and the summaries of studies which suggest this impressive statistic or that potential area of future research, you are reminded, by way of Mosley\u2019s absence, that this is an unfinished project. It is surprisingly poignant. So, too, is the scene in which Mosley immerses himself in a bin filled with ice water in his garden, where he is filmed by his wife, Dr Clare Bailey. \u201cIn theory this is doing me all sorts of good but it doesn\u2019t feel that way,\u201d he shivers, smiling at his wife as she points her phone in his direction.</p> <p>Mosley\u2019s brand of broadcasting was always so upbeat and can-do. I first came across him when he took psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, on television as part of a BBC Four documentary about the brain, and it was so fascinating that I kept up with his work ever since. Over on Channel 4\u2019s Secrets of Your Big Shop, earlier this year, he would test out internet health trends with an impressive level of dedication, only to report back that, hmm, perhaps TikTok\u2019s insistence on shoving raw garlic cloves up your nose to stave off a cold isn\u2019t all that effective, or that upping your beetroot intake is probably as good an idea as everyone says it is.</p> <p>We are bombarded with fads and faux-science today, particularly when it comes to the wellness industry, and Mosley had an invaluable ability to cut through the noise.

Write it down, because you\u2019re going to see it in the coming months.\u201d</p> <p>The complaint says Fifa\u2019s monopoly on decisions regarding the calendar is an abuse of dominance, violating European competition law. It alleges that Fifa has refused to engage meaningfully with players and leagues on the topic and that it has misused its regulatory power in prioritising its commercial interests.</p> <p>Mathieu Moreuil, the Premier League\u2019s director of international relations, said a tipping point had been reached. \u201cThe message we have together is very similar: enough is enough, we can\u2019t take it any more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where we have no choice. Legal action is the only option and that\u2019s unfortunate. We want to protect domestic football and the ecosystem. We want agreement between social partners and Fifa: not only consultation, real agreement.\u201d</p> <p>There is no intention to challenge Fifa\u2019s position as the global regulator nor is the complaint seen as an exercise in seeking compensation. Additionally, there is little prospect that it will lead to the next Club World Cup being cancelled. The desired endgame is that Fifa agrees to a meaningful consultation procedure regarding the calendar\u2019s format at a time when domestic competitions are being squeezed and high-profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/17/rodri-players-close-to-striking-volume-games-manchester-city\">players such as Rodri</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/16/nobody-asks-the-players-liverpool-alisson-hits-out-at-new-champions-league-format\">Alisson have warned</a> of the impact packed schedules have on their bodies.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the feeling that football is eating itself,\u201d said Umberto Calcagno, president of the Italian Footballers\u2019 Association. \u201cThe players know this situation very well. They know how important it is not only to protect their health but also the merit of their national championship.\u201d</p> <p>The 32-team Club World Cup, which will take place in the US between mid-June and mid-July, has exasperated many of football\u2019s stakeholders. In May, Fifpro and World Leagues wrote to Fifa requesting that it be rescheduled until agreement on the shape of the international calendar could be reached.

      "bodyText": "The La Liga president, Javier Tebas, hailed \u201cone of the most important days in football\u201d after Europe\u2019s domestic leagues joined forces with the global players\u2019 union to file a formal complaint against Fifa\u2019s imposition of the sport\u2019s match calendar. European Leagues, Fifpro and La Liga accused Fifa of \u201cabusive and anti-competitive\u201d conduct by expanding the schedule in a manner they believe endangers players and domestic competitions, pointing to the enlarged 2026 World Cup and the controversial new-look Club World Cup that will take place next summer. The complaint was submitted on Monday morning to the European Commission, which must now decide whether to officially open proceedings against football\u2019s governing body. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a very important step in changing the governance of football institutions and we\u2019re not going to let it get away,\u201d said Tebas, who spoke alongside representatives from the Premier League and Belgium\u2019s top flight, as well as union leaders from France, Italy and Norway. \u201cIt is a decisive day for football in Europe and the world. Write it down, because you\u2019re going to see it in the coming months.\u201d The complaint says Fifa\u2019s monopoly on decisions regarding the calendar is an abuse of dominance, violating European competition law. It alleges that Fifa has refused to engage meaningfully with players and leagues on the topic and that it has misused its regulatory power in prioritising its commercial interests. Mathieu Moreuil, the Premier League\u2019s director of international relations, said a tipping point had been reached. \u201cThe message we have together is very similar: enough is enough, we can\u2019t take it any more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where we have no choice. Legal action is the only option and that\u2019s unfortunate. We want to protect domestic football and the ecosystem. We want agreement between social partners and Fifa: not only consultation, real agreement.\u201d There is no intention to challenge Fifa\u2019s position as the global regulator nor is the complaint seen as an exercise in seeking compensation. Additionally, there is little prospect that it will lead to the next Club World Cup being cancelled. The desired endgame is that Fifa agrees to a meaningful consultation procedure regarding the calendar\u2019s format at a time when domestic competitions are being squeezed and high-profile players such as Rodri and Alisson have warned of the impact packed schedules have on their bodies. \u201cWe have the feeling that football is eating itself,\u201d said Umberto Calcagno, president of the Italian Footballers\u2019 Association. \u201cThe players know this situation very well. They know how important it is not only to protect their health but also the merit of their national championship.\u201d The 32-team Club World Cup, which will take place in the US between mid-June and mid-July, has exasperated many of football\u2019s stakeholders. In May, Fifpro and World Leagues wrote to Fifa requesting that it be rescheduled until agreement on the shape of the international calendar could be reached. No deal was forthcoming and a tournament whose finer details are still to be ironed out, with clubs still not certain of the financial benefits involved, looks likely to go ahead as planned. Moreuil rejected any suggestion of hypocrisy in the Premier League\u2019s place at the table in Brussels. England\u2019s top clubs are rarely shy to put in the air miles for lucrative summer tournaments and friendlies even though these risk taking their own toll on players. \u201cIndividual club tours are a club issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s their decision, not a league decision.\u201d It is the latest potentially seismic legal wrangle to engulf Fifa after the court of justice of the EU found earlier this month that key rules governing the transfer system were \u201ccontrary to EU law\u201d, after a long-running case brought by the former Chelsea, Arsenal and Portsmouth player Lassana Diarra.

      "body": "<p>The professional dancer Katya Jones has defended her Strictly Come Dancing partner, Wynne Evans, saying he has been \u201cportrayed as someone he is not\u201d after an incident during Saturday\u2019s show when she moved his hand from her waist.</p> <p>Appearing on BBC spin-off show It Takes Two on Monday alongside Evans, Jones said she wanted to \u201cget something out of the way that I feel overshadowed our performance for absolutely no reason\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cQuite frankly I can\u2019t bear sitting here watching this man being portrayed as someone he is not,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in fact it couldn\u2019t be further away from the truth, so I have to make this absolutely clear, that this whole incident with the hand and the high-five on Saturday night, it was an inside joke between Wynne and I. Was it a silly joke? Yes. Was it a bad joke? Yes.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cEven the idea that it made me feel uncomfortable or offended in any way is total nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>Evans said he had watched the moment back and he \u201ccould see how people may have misinterpreted it\u201d.</p> <p>On Saturday\u2019s show, Jones had brushed Evans\u2019 hand away as he moved it across her waist, before snubbing his attempt at a high-five.</p> <p>The incident, caught on the show\u2019s cameras, caused some people to ask if it was evidence of inappropriate behaviour by the male contestant towards his female dance partner. The BBC said its welfare team had looked into the matter and was not planning to take further action.</p> <p>Speaking to BBC Radio Wales earlier on Monday, Evans said: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely heartbroken by the things that have been written about me in the last day. It\u2019s not nice to live in that time, but basically Katya and I are really, really close and we\u2019re really good friends, and on Saturday night we made a stupid joke.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a stupid joke that went wrong, OK? We thought it was funny. It wasn\u2019t funny. It has been totally misinterpreted.\u201d</p> <p>He added that Jones had \u201cexplained that it was a joke\u201d, saying: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t offended in the least. She doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>Evans said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a brilliant friendship, an absolutely tight friendship, and I\u2019m sorry if anybody was offended by it, but it was a joke.\u201d</p> <p>In an Instagram post on Sunday in which she appeared alongside Evans, Jones had said: \u201cThe hand incident that happened on Saturday night was an inside \u2013 a very silly, very silly \u2013 inside joke between Wynne and I. So even the idea that it made me feel uncomfortable or offended me in any way is complete nonsense.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite absurd actually. Now, can we just focus on how brilliantly he\u2019s doing and what an amazing dancer he\u2019s becoming?\u201d</p> <p>Footage showed Evans standing behind and to the side of Jones during a segment of the show referred to as the Clauditorium \u2013 in which the host Claudia Winkleman talks to the dancers. His hand is initially on her waist and, without breaking her smile, Jones is seen to push it away as he moves it frontwards.</p> <p>In another segment, Evans holds his hands up to initiate a high-five with Jones, whose back is to the camera. But she turns away from him, this time without a smile.</p> <p>A Strictly source told the PA news agency: \u201cWynne and Katya have confirmed that their interactions in the Clauditorium were silly jokes they had planned together and have apologised to anyone who may have misinterpreted them.</p> <p>\u201cThey addressed them on Wynne\u2019s Instagram, where their apology can be found.

      "bodyText": "The professional dancer Katya Jones has defended her Strictly Come Dancing partner, Wynne Evans, saying he has been \u201cportrayed as someone he is not\u201d after an incident during Saturday\u2019s show when she moved his hand from her waist. Appearing on BBC spin-off show It Takes Two on Monday alongside Evans, Jones said she wanted to \u201cget something out of the way that I feel overshadowed our performance for absolutely no reason\u201d. \u201cQuite frankly I can\u2019t bear sitting here watching this man being portrayed as someone he is not,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in fact it couldn\u2019t be further away from the truth, so I have to make this absolutely clear, that this whole incident with the hand and the high-five on Saturday night, it was an inside joke between Wynne and I. Was it a silly joke? Yes. Was it a bad joke? Yes.\u201d She added: \u201cEven the idea that it made me feel uncomfortable or offended in any way is total nonsense.\u201d Evans said he had watched the moment back and he \u201ccould see how people may have misinterpreted it\u201d. On Saturday\u2019s show, Jones had brushed Evans\u2019 hand away as he moved it across her waist, before snubbing his attempt at a high-five. The incident, caught on the show\u2019s cameras, caused some people to ask if it was evidence of inappropriate behaviour by the male contestant towards his female dance partner. The BBC said its welfare team had looked into the matter and was not planning to take further action. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales earlier on Monday, Evans said: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely heartbroken by the things that have been written about me in the last day. It\u2019s not nice to live in that time, but basically Katya and I are really, really close and we\u2019re really good friends, and on Saturday night we made a stupid joke. \u201cIt was a stupid joke that went wrong, OK? We thought it was funny. It wasn\u2019t funny. It has been totally misinterpreted.\u201d He added that Jones had \u201cexplained that it was a joke\u201d, saying: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t offended in the least. She doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable.\u201d Evans said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a brilliant friendship, an absolutely tight friendship, and I\u2019m sorry if anybody was offended by it, but it was a joke.\u201d In an Instagram post on Sunday in which she appeared alongside Evans, Jones had said: \u201cThe hand incident that happened on Saturday night was an inside \u2013 a very silly, very silly \u2013 inside joke between Wynne and I. So even the idea that it made me feel uncomfortable or offended me in any way is complete nonsense. \u201cIt\u2019s quite absurd actually. Now, can we just focus on how brilliantly he\u2019s doing and what an amazing dancer he\u2019s becoming?\u201d Footage showed Evans standing behind and to the side of Jones during a segment of the show referred to as the Clauditorium \u2013 in which the host Claudia Winkleman talks to the dancers. His hand is initially on her waist and, without breaking her smile, Jones is seen to push it away as he moves it frontwards. In another segment, Evans holds his hands up to initiate a high-five with Jones, whose back is to the camera. But she turns away from him, this time without a smile. A Strictly source told the PA news agency: \u201cWynne and Katya have confirmed that their interactions in the Clauditorium were silly jokes they had planned together and have apologised to anyone who may have misinterpreted them. \u201cThey addressed them on Wynne\u2019s Instagram, where their apology can be found. Katya would like to clarify further that she was not offended by Wynne and was not made to feel uncomfortable in the least. The welfare team have checked in on the pair and there are no further actions planned.\u201d Strictly returned in September this year for its 20th anniversary with a new cast of celebrities and some changes, including the presence of chaperones during rehearsals. It followed a review launched by the corporation after the Sherlock actor Amanda Abbington made complaints about her 2023 Strictly professional dance partner, Giovanni Pernice.",

The interview with Fox News\u2019s chief political anchor, Bret Baier, comes as Democrats have increased their presence on Fox News, part of an outreach to undecided voters and after CBS News\u2019s 60 Minutes became embroiled in a controversy after rightwing critics said they edited an interview to make Harris appear more succinct. In a press release, Fox said the interview with the vice-president would take place on Wednesday 16 October and hit the airwaves on Special Report with Bret Baier at 6.00pm. Harris\u2019s appearance comes after weeks of criticism that she was avoiding all but the softest of sit-downs, including with Oprah Winfrey, ABC\u2019s morning talk-in The View, with the former shock jock Howard Stern and with Late Night\u2019s Stephen Colbert. Harris has also appeared on the podcast Call Me Daddy. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is reported to be going on Joe Rogan\u2019s Full Send before election day.

With at least three times the viewership of CNN and MSNBC, candidates looking for votes often make Fox a pragmatic choice. Nielsen Media Research shows Fox News is the highest-rated network in all swing states. According to a recent YouGov poll \u2013 54% of Republicans, 22% of Democrats and 28% of independent voters had watched the cable station in the past month. Jessica Loker, vice-president of politics at the network, told Bloomberg that the network saw ratings go up when Democrats are on.

So too have the Democratic governors Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro, Wes Moore and Gretchen Whitmer, and the senators Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, John Fetterman and Chris Coons also dropped in on the network. Harris appearance points to an effort to escape Democrats\u2019 ideologically aligned media bubbles in the effort for votes. \u201cWe have so many hyper-close elections in swing states that even if you only get a point or two that you take away from Republicans and put in your column that can be the 10,000 votes that give you that swing state,\u201d the University of Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato told the Guardian last month.",

      "bodyText": "Rail passengers could be entitled to compensation after Northern was accused of breaking its fare evasion rules to prosecute commuters. The train operator said on Monday all prosecutions of people accused of using a 16-25 railcard to obtain a discount at the wrong time of day were being withdrawn \u2013 with less than 25 previous cases being reviewed. The company was criticised for prosecuting young people after they used their railcards in a way that would have saved a few pounds on morning journeys. Under Northern rules, passengers with a railcard travelling on the wrong train must be offered the chance to pay back the deficit on the spot, the Telegraph reported. A Northern spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand that fares and ticketing across the railway can, at times, be difficult to understand, and we are reviewing our processes for ensuring compliance with ticket and railcard terms and conditions.

However, there are exceptions to this rule: railcards can be used on early morning trains at a weekend, or during the months of July and August.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump has provoked an angry backlash from Democrats after calling for the US armed forces to be turned against his political adversaries when voters go to the polls at next month\u2019s presidential election.</p> \n<p>In comments that further fuelled fears of an authoritarian crackdown if he recaptures the White House, the Republican nominee said the military or national guard should be deployed against opponents that he called \u201cthe enemy within\u201d when the election takes place on 5 November.</p> \n<p>He singled out the California congressman, Adam Schiff, who was the lead prosecutor in the ex-president\u2019s first impeachment trial, as posing a bigger threat to a free and fair election than foreign terrorists or illegal immigrants, his usual prime target for abuse.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s comments, to Fox News in response to a question on possible election \u201cchaos\u201d, triggered an angry reaction from Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign, which likened them to previous remarks that he would be a dictator \u201con day one\u201d of a second presidency and his suggestions that the US constitution should be terminated to overturn the 2020 election result, which he falsely claims was stolen by Joe Biden.</p> \n<p>Trump and the vice-president are locked in a tight contest as election day looms. Most national polls put Harris narrowly ahead, but in the crucial swing states which will decide the election, the contest appears much tighter and offers Trump numerous paths to a potential victory.</p> \n<p>After initially saying election chaos would not come from his side, Trump launched a vituperative attack on his opponents when the interviewer, Maria Bartiromo, raised the possibility of outside agitators or immigrants who had committed crimes.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people,\u201d he said on Fox\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures programme.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night, Harris slammed Donald Trump for his comments and showed a clip of the former president making the remarks.</p> \n<p>\u201cA second Trump term would be a huge risk for America, and dangerous. Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged,\u201d Harris told the crowd after playing the clip.</p> \n<p>Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian and expert on fascism at New York University, told NBC that Trump was flagging up what he planned to do as president, which she compared to the \u201c\u2018strongman\u2019 ruling templates of Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin, the leaders of Hungary, India and Russia respectively.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually rehearsing, in a sense, what he would be doing as head of state, which is what Orb\u00e1n does, Modi is doing, Putin has long done,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Trump turned his fire on Schiff, who is a candidate for the US Senate in next month\u2019s poll.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has provoked an angry backlash from Democrats after calling for the US armed forces to be turned against his political adversaries when voters go to the polls at next month\u2019s presidential election. In comments that further fuelled fears of an authoritarian crackdown if he recaptures the White House, the Republican nominee said the military or national guard should be deployed against opponents that he called \u201cthe enemy within\u201d when the election takes place on 5 November. He singled out the California congressman, Adam Schiff, who was the lead prosecutor in the ex-president\u2019s first impeachment trial, as posing a bigger threat to a free and fair election than foreign terrorists or illegal immigrants, his usual prime target for abuse. Trump\u2019s comments, to Fox News in response to a question on possible election \u201cchaos\u201d, triggered an angry reaction from Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign, which likened them to previous remarks that he would be a dictator \u201con day one\u201d of a second presidency and his suggestions that the US constitution should be terminated to overturn the 2020 election result, which he falsely claims was stolen by Joe Biden. Trump and the vice-president are locked in a tight contest as election day looms. Most national polls put Harris narrowly ahead, but in the crucial swing states which will decide the election, the contest appears much tighter and offers Trump numerous paths to a potential victory. After initially saying election chaos would not come from his side, Trump launched a vituperative attack on his opponents when the interviewer, Maria Bartiromo, raised the possibility of outside agitators or immigrants who had committed crimes. \u201cI think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people,\u201d he said on Fox\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures programme. \u201cIt should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d At a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night, Harris slammed Donald Trump for his comments and showed a clip of the former president making the remarks. \u201cA second Trump term would be a huge risk for America, and dangerous. Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged,\u201d Harris told the crowd after playing the clip. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian and expert on fascism at New York University, told NBC that Trump was flagging up what he planned to do as president, which she compared to the \u201c\u2018strongman\u2019 ruling templates of Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin, the leaders of Hungary, India and Russia respectively. \u201cHe\u2019s actually rehearsing, in a sense, what he would be doing as head of state, which is what Orb\u00e1n does, Modi is doing, Putin has long done,\u201d she said. Trump turned his fire on Schiff, who is a candidate for the US Senate in next month\u2019s poll. He said: \u201cThe thing that\u2019s tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside, like Adam Schiff.\u201d It was his second attack in two days on Schiff, who earned Trump\u2019s enmity when he was the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives\u2019 intelligence committee during his presidency, when he said there was evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia during the 2016 election. The House later voted, under Republican leadership, to censure Schiff over his comments. At a rally in Coachella, California \u2013 a state he has virtually no chance of winning \u2013 on Saturday, Trump mocked Schiff\u2019s physical characteristics and labelled him a bigger threat than foreign adversaries, including the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. \u201cHe [Xi] is somebody that we can handle,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe worst people are the enemies from within, the sleaze bags, the guy that you\u2019re going to elect to the Senate, shifty Adam Schiff. He\u2019s a major low-life.\u201d He claimed, without providing evidence, that Schiff was engaged in mass voter fraud. \u201cThey send millions and million of ballots all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201c[In] California, you don\u2019t have anything like a voting booth. They take ballots and they just send them all over the place. They come back and they say, oh, somebody won by 5m votes.\u201d Schiff responded on Twitter/X by accusing Trump of inciting violence in the same manner as he was widely accused of doing on 6 January 2021, when a mob attacked the US Capitol in an effort to stop certification of Biden\u2019s election win. \u201cToday, Trump threatened to deploy the military against the \u2018enemies from within.\u2019 The same thing he has called me,\u201d Schiff wrote. \u201cJust as he incited a mob to attack the Capitol, he again stokes violence against those who oppose him.\u201d Harris\u2019s campaign issued a more extensive condemnation. \u201cDonald Trump is suggesting that his fellow Americans are worse \u2018enemies\u2019 than foreign adversaries, and he is saying he would use the military against them,\u201d a campaign spokesperson, Ian Sams, said. \u201cTaken with his vow to be a dictator on \u2018day one\u2019, calls for the \u2018termination\u2019 of the constitution, and plans to surround himself with sycophants who will give him unchecked, unprecedented power if he returns to office, this should alarm every American who cares about their freedom and security. \u201cWhat Donald Trump is promising is dangerous, and returning him to office is simply a risk Americans cannot afford.\u201d While Trump, being out of power, will be in no position to deploy troops on election day, his call for military power to quell political opposition is familiar, recalling his demand that soldiers be deployed in the streets of Washington DC in 2020 to disperse thousands of demonstrators protesting against the death of George Floyd. Gen Mark Milley, the then chairperson of the joint chiefs of staff, reportedly came close to resigning over the demand. Milley, who has since fallen foul of Trump, is quoted in a new book by Bob Woodward \u2013 the journalist who, along with Carl Bernstein, helped to expose the Watergate scandal of the 1970s \u2013 as calling the ex-president \u201ca total fascist\u201d and has voiced fears that he could be recalled to service and court-martialled if he returns to office.",

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves has dropped her strongest hint yet that she is planning to raise employer national insurance contributions in the budget, prompting accusations Labour is about to break a manifesto promise. The chancellor used the government\u2019s international investment summit at London\u2019s Guildhall on Monday to warn of tax rises to come in this month\u2019s announcement, insisting that business would understand the need for fiscal stability. After days of rumours that Reeves is planning to increase employer national insurance contributions, the chancellor refused to rule out doing so, adding that executives would understand the need for such decisions. \u201cWe will stick to the commitments we made in our manifesto,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you know there is a \u00a322bn black hole over and above anything we knew about going into the election that we need to fill, and that\u2019s not just a one year, that persists throughout the forecast period. \u201cSo we are going to need to sort of close that gap between what government is spending and bringing in through tax receipts.

But critics say that hiking employers\u2019 national insurance contributions would directly violate Labour\u2019s manifesto commitment not to raise income tax, VAT or national insurance. Paul Johnson, the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told Times Radio on Monday that such a move would count as a \u201cstraightforward breach\u201d of the manifesto. \u201cI went back and read the manifesto and it says very clearly, we will not raise rates of national insurance,\u201d he said.

Fewer jobs and lower pay is not the way forward.\u201d Labour ministers, however, say the pledge referred to taxes on working people, and therefore did not cover employer contributions. Labour was also accused of watering down its manifesto commitment to invest \u00a37.3bn in the national wealth fund, which it has set up to invest in green projects, after confirming the fund would only get \u00a35.8bn. Officials said the remaining \u00a31.5bn had been allocated elsewhere. Reeves\u2019s comments on tax formed part of a careful balancing act the chancellor tried to maintain on Monday as she wooed international corporations to invest more in Britain while also being clear about the tax decisions to come. The summit was attended by high-level executives from a number of global companies, including Google, BlackRock and GlaxoSmithKline. Andrea Rossi, the chief executive of M&amp;G, a headline sponsor of the investment summit, said he expected Reeves\u2019s budget would be \u201cpragmatic\u201d and focused on growth. However, he warned large tax rises risked \u201ckilling the economy\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to grow the economy if you tax the economy much, much more,\u201d he said. It was the attendance of the Dubai-owned DP World that caused the most attention however, after the company originally threatened to pull out after Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, called P&amp;O Ferries, which it owns, a \u201crogue operator\u201d. DP World confirmed it would spend \u00a31bn on the London Gateway port project in Essex, despite the row, after Starmer publicly rebuked his transport secretary. Haigh also attended the summit, although did not make any public comments. Other investments were focused on green energy, such as a \u00a32bn commitment to new solar farms from Octopus Energy, and on technology, including \u00a310bn from Blackstone for a new datacentre in Northumberland. As the final part of the government\u2019s business charm offensive, Elton John was brought in to serenade guests at a reception at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral also attended by King Charles.",

A Hezbollah drone evaded Israel\u2019s much vaunted air defences on Sunday and struck a military canteen when it was busy with soldiers eating dinner. Four were killed and 58 wounded, seven seriously, at a location 40 miles south of the Lebanese border.</p> <p>The drone that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/hezbollah-drone-attack-on-israel-army-idf-base\">hit the canteen of the Golani base</a> near Binyamina appears to have been part of a synchronised attack that allowed it to elude the country\u2019s well organised air defences. Three drones flew from Lebanon over the Mediterranean, and though they were all initially spotted, and two shot down, the other was able to reach its target.</p> <p>Why the third drone got away, eluding fighter jets, helicopters and the Iron Dome defence system, is a subject of urgent inquiry by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Hezbollah has been refining its attack strategy, and timing the drone attack with rockets helped complicate the picture for the defenders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/hezbollah-drone-attack-on-israel-army-idf-base\">Hezbollah drone attack kills four IDF soldiers as US prepares to send missile system to Israel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Drones may fly more slowly than missiles, but the Iranian-designed carbon-fibre models used by Hezbollah are hard to see and difficult for radar to pick up, a task made more complicated because they are flown deliberately low. Manoeuvrable, this drone, said to be Sayyad 107, resisted GPS guidance jamming, possibly because it used Russian or Chinese alternatives.</p> <p>It is not the first time in recent days that a drone has got through. A retirement home in Herzliya was struck by a drone on Friday during the Yom Kippur holiday \u2013 one of two that crossed the border from Lebanon. The other was shot down successfully by a fighter jet, but the second struck the building a few miles north of Tel Aviv.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s air force said on Monday it intercepted more than 80% of incoming drones \u2013 221 out of 1,200 that have been fired at the country during the war so far have got through. But an increase in the number of attacks and the growing sophistication of what remain relatively cheap to produce weapons will increase the risk of Israeli casualties as the fighting continues. However, the number of civilian and military casualties caused by Israeli attacks in Lebanon and Gaza remains far greater.</p> <p>In the past 24 hours, 18 people were reported killed in strikes hitting the northern Lebanese town Aitou on Monday, while 22 people \u2013 including 15 children \u2013 were killed on Sunday in an attack on a school in central Gaza. But such is the asymmetry of the conflict that repeated successful strikes on Israel will raise questions about the completeness of the country\u2019s air defences.</p> <p>Though Iran\u2019s large-scale ballistic missile attack on Israel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/iranian-strikes-on-israel-what-happened-why-did-iran-attack-missiles-damage-what-next\">at the beginning of the month</a> was of a different order of magnitude, it too appears to have been more damaging than was initially acknowledged. It was judged at first by the number of casualties it caused \u2013 only one person, a Palestinian in the West Bank, was believed to have been killed. But the impact on buildings was greater than initially acknowledged.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s tax authority said on Sunday it had received 2,200 damage claims relating to civilian buildings following the 1 October attack, and a further 300 for vehicles and contents, taking the total damage estimate to 150m to 200m shekels (\u00a331m to \u00a341m). In Hod Hasharon, north-east of Tel Aviv, more than 1,000 homes were damaged, some impacted by a shockwave from a missile that smashed into an open area nearby.</p> <p>Against such a backdrop, and with Israel expected to retaliate against Iran soon, it is not surprising that the US announced it would deploy one of its seven specialised Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (Thaad) systems in Israel, and a crew of nearly 100 US troops. Thaad is designed to defend against ballistic missiles, and will line up alongside Israel\u2019s Arrow 2 and 3 and David\u2019s Sling long and medium range defence systems.</p> <p>Bringing Thaad to bear suggests the US believes that whatever Israel is planning to do will invite a fresh response from Iran, and that it could test existing air defences seriously. With Hezbollah also appearing to be causing problems of a different order for Israel\u2019s air defences with its drone attacks, the overall situation is at risk of becoming more dangerous and fraught as the conflict turns into its second year.</p>",

The drone that hit the canteen of the Golani base near Binyamina appears to have been part of a synchronised attack that allowed it to elude the country\u2019s well organised air defences. Three drones flew from Lebanon over the Mediterranean, and though they were all initially spotted, and two shot down, the other was able to reach its target. Why the third drone got away, eluding fighter jets, helicopters and the Iron Dome defence system, is a subject of urgent inquiry by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Hezbollah has been refining its attack strategy, and timing the drone attack with rockets helped complicate the picture for the defenders. Drones may fly more slowly than missiles, but the Iranian-designed carbon-fibre models used by Hezbollah are hard to see and difficult for radar to pick up, a task made more complicated because they are flown deliberately low. Manoeuvrable, this drone, said to be Sayyad 107, resisted GPS guidance jamming, possibly because it used Russian or Chinese alternatives. It is not the first time in recent days that a drone has got through. A retirement home in Herzliya was struck by a drone on Friday during the Yom Kippur holiday \u2013 one of two that crossed the border from Lebanon. The other was shot down successfully by a fighter jet, but the second struck the building a few miles north of Tel Aviv. Israel\u2019s air force said on Monday it intercepted more than 80% of incoming drones \u2013 221 out of 1,200 that have been fired at the country during the war so far have got through. But an increase in the number of attacks and the growing sophistication of what remain relatively cheap to produce weapons will increase the risk of Israeli casualties as the fighting continues. However, the number of civilian and military casualties caused by Israeli attacks in Lebanon and Gaza remains far greater. In the past 24 hours, 18 people were reported killed in strikes hitting the northern Lebanese town Aitou on Monday, while 22 people \u2013 including 15 children \u2013 were killed on Sunday in an attack on a school in central Gaza. But such is the asymmetry of the conflict that repeated successful strikes on Israel will raise questions about the completeness of the country\u2019s air defences. Though Iran\u2019s large-scale ballistic missile attack on Israel at the beginning of the month was of a different order of magnitude, it too appears to have been more damaging than was initially acknowledged. It was judged at first by the number of casualties it caused \u2013 only one person, a Palestinian in the West Bank, was believed to have been killed. But the impact on buildings was greater than initially acknowledged. Israel\u2019s tax authority said on Sunday it had received 2,200 damage claims relating to civilian buildings following the 1 October attack, and a further 300 for vehicles and contents, taking the total damage estimate to 150m to 200m shekels (\u00a331m to \u00a341m). In Hod Hasharon, north-east of Tel Aviv, more than 1,000 homes were damaged, some impacted by a shockwave from a missile that smashed into an open area nearby. Against such a backdrop, and with Israel expected to retaliate against Iran soon, it is not surprising that the US announced it would deploy one of its seven specialised Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (Thaad) systems in Israel, and a crew of nearly 100 US troops. Thaad is designed to defend against ballistic missiles, and will line up alongside Israel\u2019s Arrow 2 and 3 and David\u2019s Sling long and medium range defence systems. Bringing Thaad to bear suggests the US believes that whatever Israel is planning to do will invite a fresh response from Iran, and that it could test existing air defences seriously. With Hezbollah also appearing to be causing problems of a different order for Israel\u2019s air defences with its drone attacks, the overall situation is at risk of becoming more dangerous and fraught as the conflict turns into its second year.",

Eastern box turtles are a protected species and have vivid, orange and yellow markings atop a dark brown shell. They are sold on the black market in China for $1,000, the Associated Press reported.

In addition, there was complexity in operating in a country that is not accustomed to delivering large scale green field events. This led to a 35% increase in operating costs compared to Paris 2018.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, strong increases in revenue across all key Ryder Cup revenue streams (ticketing, sponsorship, merchandise, digital and media rights) helped to offset these cost pressures.\u201d</p>",

The cost of attending Bethpage Black in New York, where Europe are seeking to defend the trophy won in Rome last year, is only likely to increase the sense the Ryder Cup is pricing out ordinary golf fans as it moves towards the corporate classes. The online backlash has proved fierce. Those who have not already bought Bethpage tickets can register for free via the Ryder Cup\u2019s official site for the random allocation. Successful applicants for the event next September will be informed by early next month. Only single tickets for each day have been made available although those picked via the ballot may be able to buy up to four, if they can afford them. Practice days on Tuesday and Wednesday are priced at $255.27. That figure leaps to $423.64 for Thursday, on the apparent basis it includes the Junior Ryder Cup, celebrity matches and the opening ceremony. For Friday, Saturday and Sunday the cost is $749.51 per day. Organisers are kind enough to point out the price is inclusive of fees and New York sales taxes. Standard competition day tickets for Rome cost just over \u00a3200. Covered this time via what has been branded a Ryder Cup+ package is food and non-alcoholic drinks. Terms and conditions state: \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready for a meal, simply redeem one entree, one snack, and one non-alcoholic drink per visit to any market concessions \u2013 and feel free to return as often as you\u2019d like. Alcoholic beverages are also available for purchase.\u201d The Ryder Cup is typically a cash cow for either the PGA of America or the European Tour Group, depending on host venue. However, in his strategic report to accompany recently published accounts, the European Tour Group\u2019s chair, Eric Nicoli, specifically addressed Ryder Cup challenges, despite attendance of more than 270,000 in Rome. Nicoli said: \u201cThe staging budget for the Ryder Cup experienced significant macroeconomic pressures, driven by post-Covid supply chain challenges and disruption caused by the war in Ukraine, with inflation running at +22% compared to Paris 2018. In addition, there was complexity in operating in a country that is not accustomed to delivering large scale green field events. This led to a 35% increase in operating costs compared to Paris 2018. \u201cNevertheless, strong increases in revenue across all key Ryder Cup revenue streams (ticketing, sponsorship, merchandise, digital and media rights) helped to offset these cost pressures.\u201d",

Rather than curbing immigration and <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/8GiBV/https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/woke-broke-culture-brands-money-advertising-b2613219.html\">challenging wokery</a>, it presided over record levels of immigration and accepted too much of the equality and diversity agenda.</p> \n   <p>However, an examination of the timeline of the Conservatives\u2019 standing in the polls during the last parliament reveals that the party\u2019s precipitous fall from grace was not occasioned by a failure to be <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/8GiBV/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-leadership-contest-farage-cleverly-b2626576.html\">truly Conservative</a>.</p> \n   <p>The first key event that cost the party support was Partygate, which cast doubt on the honesty and ethics of <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/8GiBV/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/boris-johnson-sue-gray-chris-pincher-downing-street-vote-leave-b2627525.html\">those who had been leading the party</a>.

No 10 has now sent out the full text. Much of it would have fitted quite happily into a speech by a mainstream Conservative PM (apart from the bit about how the Tories turned government into a \u201ccircus\u201d after Brexit) and the most interesting passage was the bit dealing with regulation. Here are the key quotes.</p> \n  <p>(This is the text as released by No 10, and including ellipses, which I use to indicate missing text, but No 10 uses to indicate a pause in the speech as it was delivered.

On anxiety and autism it says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is a positive thing our society is now more open around mental health. However, the socialisation of mental health, whereby mental health moved from something that people worked on for their own benefit, to something where everyone had to treat you differently, has both created costs and failed to improve people\u2019s mental health outcomes \u2026.</p> \n   <p>[A change in the perception of harm] helps explains why people who had suffered events once seen as non-traumatic now feel entitled to support. This increases demand for psychologists and therapists, required to help people previously seen as able to cope. As will be set out in the forthcoming book [based on the essay] across the psychological and psychotherapy professions, numbers have risen from 102,000 in 2002 to 223,700 in 2023.</p> \n   <p>Being diagnosed as neuro-diverse was once seen as helpful as it meant you could understand your own brain, and so help you to deal with the world. It was an individual focused change. But now it also offers economic advantages and protections. If you have a neurodiversity diagnosis (e.g. anxiety, autism), then that is usually seen as a disability, a category similar to race or biological sex in terms of discrimination law and general attitudes.</p> \n   <p>If you are a child, you may well get better treatment or equipment at school \u2013 even transport to and from home. If you are in the workforce, you are protected in employment terms from day 1, you can more easily claim for unfair dismissal, and under disability rules you can also require your employer makes \u2018reasonable adjustments\u2019 to your job (and you can reveal your disability once you have been employed rather than before).</p> \n   <p>In short, whereas once psychological and mental health was seen as something that people should work on themselves as individuals, mental health has become something that society, schools and employers have to adapt around.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As <strong>Eleanor Langford</strong> reports in<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/badenoch-pamphlet-stigmitises-autistic-tory-3322013\"> a story for the i</a>, these comments have been strongly criticised by Robert Buckland, a former Tory justice secretary who has an autistic daughter and who conducted a review of employment opportunities for autistic people for the last government, after he left ministerial office. <strong>Buckland</strong> told the i that it was wrong for the Badenoch report to be \u201cstigmatising or lumping certain categories in with each other\u201d. He added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Anxiety is not a neurodiverse condition \u2026 autism is not a mental health condition.</p> \n   <p>That part of the report didn\u2019t seem to me to be based on any evidence, and mixing up autism with mental health is not right. It\u2019s not the correct approach to be taken into this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>A spokesperson for <strong>Badenoch</strong> said she only wrote the foreward to the report published at the Tory conference and that it was wrong to says it was stigmatising people.

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has told business leaders that regulation policy will be primarily determined by what\u2019s best for growth, and that he wants to to \u201crip out\u201d the planning bureaucracy holding up investment. (See 1.01pm.) The government is claiming that \u201cnearly 38,000 UK jobs are set to be created across the UK after a total of \u00a363bn of investment was announced around today\u2019s international investment summit\u201d. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has told GB News that Labour\u2019s manifesto promise not to raise national insurance did not refer to employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, only employees\u2019. This is what Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, indicated in an interview yesterday, but Reeves was even more explicit today. This is seen as her strongest hint yet that she will raise employees\u2019 national insurance in the budget. The Tory leadership candidate Kemi Badenoch has been criticised for a campaign pamphlet that said autistic people received \u201cbetter treatment\u201d and \u201ceconomic privileges and protections\u201d. Ellie Reeves, the Cabinet Office minister, has confirmed that the government will tighten the rules about the declaration of gifts given to ministers. She described this as closing \u201cthe Tory freebies loophole\u201d. (See 4.30pm.) MPs have paid tribute to Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister who died suddenly at the weekend. Robert Jenrick has accepted an offer from the BBC to hold a Question Time debate for the two Tory leadership candidates \u2013 while Kemi Badenoch it is not for her to decide, but the party. Jenrick was responding to a letter from Gerry Gay, the Question Time editor, who proposed a QT \u201cConservative Leadership Special\u201d on Thursday 24 October, hosted by Fiona Bruce, the programme\u2019s regular presenter. Gay said there would just be two guests debating, Jenrick and Badenoch, with an audience roughly 50% Conservative supporters, broadly split between supporters of each candidate, and 50% people with other political loyalties, some of whom may have voted Tory in the past. The letter was sent after Jenrick yesterday released an open letter to Tim Davie, the BBC director general, saying the BBC should organise a debate in the public interest. Jenrick has accepted. Originally Jenrick and Badenoch had been due to take part in a debate organised by the Sun on Thursday 24 October, but that was cancelled because of a dispute about who was going to chair it. In a post on social media Jenrick said: I\u2019m disappointed that @TheSun debate won\u2019t be going ahead. I was looking forward to answering their readers\u2019 characteristically tough questions. However, I am delighted to accept the BBC\u2019s invitation to a head-to-head special Conservative leadership Question Time at 8pm on the 24th October. A source from Badenoch\u2019s campaign said they were considering the BBC\u2019s offer, but that, under the rules of the contest, it was for CCHQ to decide what debates the candidates took part in. This is not the first time the BBC has been in talks with the Tories about holding a debate. But previous negotiations broke down because CCHQ wanted to choose the audience itself, BBC sources claim. Badenoch and Jenrick are both participating in an event on GB News on Thursday night this week. But they won\u2019t be debating each other head to head, just taking questions from an audience one after the other. According to bookmakers, Badenoch is the favourite in the contest \u2013 and favourites in elections are almost always reluctant to take part in debates, because they have most to lose. Veterans minister Al Carns has confirmed that the financial redress scheme for LGBT veterans will launch in 2025, Rosie Anfilogoff reports. She writes: Carns was speaking during defence questions in the Commons, where the Labour\u2019s Chris Ward, MP for Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven, raised the \u201cappalling injustice and ingratitude\u201d that LGBT veterans have suffered, and asked about the \u201cfinancial redress and compensation\u201d recommended in the 2023 Etherton review. Lord Etherton\u2019s report looked into LGBT veterans\u2019 experiences during the 1967 to 2000 military ban on LGBT personnel, which was described as \u201can appalling failure of the British state\u201d by the then prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Carns sought to assuage concerns among veterans regarding the report\u2019s cap of \u00a350m on the total value of compensation payments, meaning the average payment per veteran might be as low as \u00a312,500, saying the government was working on \u201can appropriate financial redress scheme\u201d. He also said the scheme would be ready by the end of this year, with the roll-out starting in January. Ellie Reeves, the Cabinet Office minister, has confirmed that the government will tighten the rules about the declaration of gifts given to ministers. In response to an urgent question tabled by John Glen, a shadow minister, she said the \u201cTory freebies loophole\u201d was being closed. She explained: Transparency is a critical part of restoring public faith in politics and the government recognizes the changes are needed. Under the last government, the rules for ministers declaring hospitality were less transparent than for other MPs. Lists of hospitality received by ministers were only published by Whitehall departments once a quarter and did not include the value. In contrast, MPs\u2019 and shadow ministers\u2019 interests must be declared within 28 days and include the cost of the hospitality. Tory ministers used this loophole even when events appeared to have little connection to their government roles. Both House of Commons committee on standards and the committee on standards in public life called for this disparity to be removed. Under the last government, Labour frontbenchers who went to events and ended sitting next to their Tory counterparts, and Labour MPs, had to declare details on their MP register \u2013 importantly, including value \u2013 while Tory ministers did not on the equivalent ministerial process. The government will correct this imbalance. The Tory freebies loophole will be closed. In the future, the government will publish a register of ministers\u2019 gifts and hospitality on a broadly equivalent basis to that which is published in registers of members and Lords interests. This will bring publication of ministerial transparency data more closely in light of the parliamentary regime for gifts and hospitality. The government intends that these arrangements should be in place as soon as possible, and will set out further details in due course. Reeves also said Keir Starmer will \u201cshortly\u201d issue an updated version of the ministerial code setting out \u201chis expectations for the conduct of all who serve in government and ministers\u201d. It will include \u201cadditional guidance to ministers on the principles they should apply when considering whether to accept gifts or offers of hospitality, as part of the government\u2019s work to restore public faith in politics as a force for good\u201d, she said. The tributes to Alex Salmond are over. MPs from all sides said they were shocked by his death, and praised his talents, particularly as a debater and a parliamentarian. The mini-speeches were moving and generous. I will post some highlights later. Last week the Guardian reported that the Treasury has been looking at the impact of raising capital gains tax, including taking it up potentially to 39%. In an interview today with Bloomberg TV, Keir Starmer said that reports that capital gains tax could go up to as much as 39% were \u201cwide of the mark\u201d. He also suggested that potential tax increases were not what worried businesses most anyway. He said: Contrary to perhaps what people might think, tax is not the first thing that businesses and investors are raising with me. In the Commons the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has allowed the SNP leader at Westminster, Stephen Flynn, to use a point of order to make a tribute to Alex Salmond, the former first minister who died suddenly at the weekend. Flynn described Salmond as \u201cthe most talented, formidable and consquential politician of his generation\u201d. Ian Murray, the Scottish secretary, is speaking now. He describes Salmond as a formidable opponent who left an \u201cindelible mark on Scottish public life\u201d. The Royal Social for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which describes itself as the UK\u2019s largest nature conservation charity, has described Keir Starmer\u2019s speech this morning, in which he said he wanted to \u201crip out\u201d planning laws blocking growth (see 1.01pm) as \u201cunsettling\u201d. Its chief executive, Beccy Speight, said: An unsettling speech from the PM this morning for those who love and value nature. Deregulation done in the wrong way is effectively dropping standards, at a time when the natural world desperately needs better protection. It\u2019s a short-sighted tactic that could have ramifications for us all in years to come, undermining our long term prosperity - better methods, such as nature-friendly planning, would give businesses the certainty they need. We support growth and we support the badly-needed energy transition, but not at the expense of our precious wildlife and wild places. His very own secretary of state [Steve Reed] said recently that \u201cnature is dying\u201d \u2013 uncontrolled deregulation is tantamount to hammering the final nail into its coffin. The Green party has expressed similar concerns. This is from Ellie Chowns, one of the four Green MPS. Starmer\u2019s pledge to investors that he will \u201ccut red tape\u201d is a tired cliche that, in practice, too often means harming environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights. We\u2019ve had 14 years of successive Conservative governments promising to \u201ccut red tape\u201d, and all we have to show for it is a flatlining economy and falling living standards. Britain has imposed sanctions against senior Iranian military figures and organisations following the country\u2019s 1 October attack on Israel, PA Media reports. PA says: Members of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army, Iran\u2019s air force and the IRGC Intelligence Organisation have been targeted with travel bans and asset freezes, the Foreign Office said in a statement. Farzanegan Propulsion Systems Design Bureau (FPSDB), which designs and manufactures parts that can be used in cruise missiles, has also been designated as part of the package of measures. The Iranian Space Agency, which develops technologies that have applications in ballistic missile development, will be subject to an asset freeze. Iran launched around 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel on 1 October. Most were intercepted but a number hit central and southern Israel, the country\u2019s military said. Here is a clip of Keir Starmer speaking at the investment summit this morning. Turning back to the Conservatives, in an article for the Independent Prof Sir John Curtice, Britain\u2019s leading psephologist, says there is no evidence to show that either Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick has the ability to take the Tories back to power. The main problem, he says, is that they do not realise why their party lost. Both candidates appear to believe the fault lies in a failure of the last government to be true to Conservative values. Rather than seeking to limit the size of the state, it presided over the biggest expansion since 1945 \u2013 thanks, of course, to the pandemic and the cost of living crisis. Rather than curbing immigration and challenging wokery, it presided over record levels of immigration and accepted too much of the equality and diversity agenda. However, an examination of the timeline of the Conservatives\u2019 standing in the polls during the last parliament reveals that the party\u2019s precipitous fall from grace was not occasioned by a failure to be truly Conservative. The first key event that cost the party support was Partygate, which cast doubt on the honesty and ethics of those who had been leading the party. The second was the Liz Truss fiscal event, which severely damaged the party\u2019s reputation for economic competence. No reversion to \u201ctrue\u201d Conservative values is going to erase these stains on the party\u2019s copybook. Curtice also says, although Conservative members want to see a smaller state, voters at large seem to want the opposite. He says that, although Badenoch and Jenrick are \u201clargely unknown quantities\u201d, to win the next election they would both have to \u201creveal a wider range of political talents than they have so far\u201d. To coincide with today\u2019s international investment summit, the government has published Invest 2035, its industrial strategy green paper. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has said that the budget she is delivering at the end of the month will take the most from the richest. As the Telegraph reports, speaking on the New Statesman\u2019s podcast, Reeves said: I said during the election campaign we\u2019re not going to be introducing a wealth tax. But I think people will be in no doubt when we do the budget that those with the broadest shoulders will be bearing the largest burden. You saw that in our manifesto campaign. You know, non-doms, private equity, the windfall tax on the big profits the energy companies are making and putting VAT and business rates on private schools. At the start of business in the Commons Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, pays tribute to Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, who died suddenly at the weekend. Hoyle says Salmond served the people of Scotland for more than 30 years as an MP, MSP and as first minister. He says there will be a short period set aside for tributes after defence questions, at 3.30pm. Later there are also two urgent questions, on \u201cthe reporting and acceptance of Ministerial gifts and hospitality\u201d and on recent events at the Spanish border with Gibraltar, and a statement on the relocation of refugees from Afghanistan. UPDATE: Hoyle said: [Salmond] served the people of Scotland for over 30 years as a member of this House, a member of the Scottish parliament and, of course, two terms as first minister of Scotland. He was a tireless campaigner for Scottish independence, securing the UK government\u2019s agreement for the 2014 referendum and playing a leading role in the Yes campaign. His final departure from this house was in 2017. It marked the first occasion in more than three decades when he was not serving in an elected role at either here or Holyrood. He leaves a deep and lasting legacy behind him. His sudden death at the weekend came as a complete shock and the thoughts of this whole House are with his family and friends at this difficult time. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson insisted Keir Starmer has full confidence in Louise Haigh, the transport secretary. The question was prompted by Starmer says on Friday that Haigh was not setting out government policy when she suggested that customers should boycott P&amp;O Ferries. Asked if Haigh had Starmer\u2019s full confidence, the spokesperson replied: Yes, absolutely. The transport secretary in the run-up to the summit delivered significant investment in electric buses. She\u2019s put an end to industrial disruption seen for the past two-and-a-half years that has cost the economy and commuters dearly, and she\u2019s been driving forward reform and bringing rail services back into public ownership. No 10 always says the PM has full confidence in ministers \u2013 until the point where they get sacked. But this sounded like a genuine, sincere endorsement. Starmer is reported to have made up with Haigh after having to disown part of what she said last week. And here are some more lines from Keir Starmer\u2019s speech to the investment summit. Starmer told business leaders that increasing growth was \u201ca cause that binds us together\u201d and he explained why he had made it a priority. He said: Growth is higher wages. Growth is more vibrant high streets. Growth is public services back on their feet. It\u2019s less poverty, more opportunity, more meals out, more holidays, more precious moments with your family, more cash in your pocket. And of course, for any business \u2026 It means a bigger market. Higher demand. He said Labour\u2019s large majority meant he was in a position to offer stability. The stability that comes with a large majority in our system \u2026 That is a unique advantage. He said Labour\u2019s industrial strategy was not about \u201cpicking winners\u201d, but providing \u201cthe best conditions to succeed\u201d. He explained: Well, we\u2019re not in the business of individual picking winners. But we are in the business of building on our strengths. Mowing the grass on the pitch \u2026 Making sure the changing rooms are clean and comfortable \u2026 That the training ground is good. So that when our businesses compete \u2026 They are match fit \u2026 That, to put it simply \u2026 We give the businesses of this country the best conditions to succeed. He said people were less willing to trust Britain as a \u201cstable, trusted, rule-abiding partner\u201d after \u201cthe whole circus that followed Brexit\u201d. Labour has \u201cturned the page on that \u2013 decisively\u201d, he said. Graeme Wearden covered Keir Starmer\u2019s speech at the investment conference this morning in the business live blog. No 10 has now sent out the full text. Much of it would have fitted quite happily into a speech by a mainstream Conservative PM (apart from the bit about how the Tories turned government into a \u201ccircus\u201d after Brexit) and the most interesting passage was the bit dealing with regulation. Here are the key quotes. (This is the text as released by No 10, and including ellipses, which I use to indicate missing text, but No 10 uses to indicate a pause in the speech as it was delivered. Normally I would tidy up the text, but that would involve quite a lot of rejigging, which would start to change the emphasis, and so I have left it in the version provided by Downing Street.) Starmer said that, for him, the most important test for regulation was whether or not it helped growth. He said: Now, I don\u2019t see regulation as good or bad. That seems simplistic to me. Some regulation is life-saving \u2026 We have seen that in recent weeks here, with the report on the tragedy of Grenfell Tower. But across our public sector \u2026 I would say the previous government hid behind regulators. Deferred decisions to them because it was either too weak or indecisive \u2026 Or simply not committed enough to growth. Planning is a very real example of that \u2026 Or \u2013 for our friends from across the pond \u2026 \u2018Permitting\u2019 is a really clear example of that ... The global language \u2026 But anyway \u2013 the key test for me on regulation \u2026 Is of course \u2013 growth. Is this going to make our economy more dynamic? Is this going to inhibit or unlock investment? Is it something that enables the builders not the blockers? He said the employment rights\u2019 bill published last week was a \u201cpro-growth\u201d measure that would help businesses. Now \u2013 I know some people may be wondering about our labour market policies introduced last week. Let me be clear \u2013 they are pro-growth. Workers with more security at work \u2026 With higher wages \u2026 That is a better growth model for this country. It will lead to more dynamism in our labour market. Graeme summarises this as Starmer telling bosses: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the workers\u2019 rights bill.\u201d Starmer said Britain had to break out of an economic model that was too reliant on low-paid, low-skilled workers. A nation\u2019s position in the world is changing all the time \u2026 As must its growth model. So while I know this is a room full of businesses who take investing in their human capital seriously \u2026 When I look at the British economy as a whole\u2026 It does seem as if sometimes, we are more comfortable hiring people to work in low paid, insecure contracts\u2026 Than we are investing in the new technology that delivers for workers, for productivity and for our country. And so we\u2019ve got to break out of that trap. He said he wanted to \u201crip out\u201d the planning bureaucracy holding up growth. But we\u2019ve also got to look at regulation \u2013 across the piece. And where it is needlessly holding back the investment we need to take our country forward \u2026 Where it is stopping us building the homes \u2026 The data centres, the warehouses, grid connectors, roads, trainlines, you name it \u2026 Then mark my words \u2013 we will get rid of it. Take the East Anglia 2 wind farm. A \u00a34bn investment. One Gigawatt of clean energy. An important project \u2013 absolutely. But also the sort of thing a country as committed to clean energy as we are \u2026 Needs to replicate again and again. Now regulators demanded over 4,000 planning documents for that project\u2026 Not 4,000 pages \u2013 4,000 documents. And then six weeks after finally receiving planning consent \u2026 It was held up for a further two years by judicial review. I mean \u2013 as an investor \u2026 When you see this inertia \u2026 You just don\u2019t bother do you? And that \u2013 in a nutshell \u2026 Is the biggest supply-side problem we have in our country. So it\u2019s time to upgrade the regulatory regime \u2026 Make it fit for the modern age.. Harness every opportunity available to Britain. We will rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment \u2026 We will march through the institutions \u2026 And we will make sure that every regulator in this country \u2026 Especially our economic and competition regulators \u2026 Takes growth as seriously as this room does. Starmer also invited the business leaders in the room to contact him, or his ministers, if regulations were holding up their investments. What is interesting about this passage is that it implies reforms to planning laws that would go far beyond what has been announced by Angela Rayner, the housing secretary, or what was outlined in Labour\u2019s manifesto. The plans, set out by Rayner in July, were mostly about streamlining processes, not ripping out laws. The Alba party will seek to continue Alex Salmond\u2019s legacy, its acting leader and a lifelong friend of the former first minister has said. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland this morning, Kenny MacAskill \u2013 who served in Salmond\u2019s cabinet and defected with him to his new party in 2021 \u2013 said Alba would continue despite Salmond\u2019s surprise death at the weekend. He said: Of course, the party continues, we owe it to Alex. It was never the Alex Salmond party, it was Alex Salmond\u2019s inspiration and Alex Salmond\u2019s driving force, but the party is made up of thousands more and, as I say, that legacy will continue. Writing to Alba party members on Monday, MacAskill paraphrased Salmond\u2019s resignation speech, saying: \u201cThe dream he cherished so closely and came so close to delivering will never die. We will honour him.\u201d The Autism Centre of Excellence at Cambridge, a charity that works with Cambridge University\u2019s Autism Research Centre, has put out a post on social media strongly criticising Kemi Badenoch for the comments about autism released earlier this month in an essay put out under her name. (See 9.40am.) The centre says: We fully agree with @iburrell in @theipaper that @KemiBadenoch\u2019s comments are \u2018an offensive claim far removed from the grim reality of many despairing citizens and families struggling for support.\u2019 We need leaders who take the time to understand the complexity of the issues they are commenting on \u2013 and who bring workable solutions to the table. The best way to do both is to talk to people with lived experience. We believe that #autistic people and parents would agree that the Government has failed to provide a good education, employment opportunities and the right care. Anyone with an interest in running our country would ask themselves why this is. The centre is referring to this article by Ian Birrell, the journalist and former Independent deputy editor who at one point wrote speeches for David Cameron. In his article for the i, Birrell says: Another key issue is the low status of carers in society. And this was demonstrated by his rival Kemi Badenoch during the conference hustings, when she talked about focusing on the future \u201cnot just who\u2019s going to wipe bottoms for us today.\u201d No wonder social care never gets fixed and carers are left badly paid when a prominent politician sneers so dismissively at workers performing a public service. And now Badenoch, in a report called \u201cConservatism in Crisis\u201d released this month, argues that autism diagnosis can give children \u201cbetter treatment at school\u201d and \u201coffers economic advantages and protection\u201d \u2013 an offensive claim far removed from the grim reality of many despairing citizens and families struggling for support. Such is the tragic state of today\u2019s Conservative party. Arrogant, blustering, heartless and out of touch with concerns of ordinary people. There is hollow talk of renewal, but we see again why this historically formidable election fighting machine crashed and burned. Kemi Badenoch is the member of the shadow cabinet with the highest approval ratings amongst Conservative members, according to the regular monthly survey by the ConservativeHome website. She has been top for a while. James Cleverly, who was unexpectedly knocked out of the Tory leadership contest, is in second place. Robert Jenrick, Badenoch\u2019s rival for the leadership, does not feature in the survey because he is not on the front bench. More than 100 venues are backing Martyn\u2019s law to help protect the public from terror attacks, ahead of the second reading of the terrorism (protection of premises) bill in the House of Commons today. Parts of the bill are named for Martyn Hett, 29, who was killed along with 21 other people when suicide bomber Salman Abedi attacked the Manchester Arena in 2017 at the close of an Ariana Grande concert. His mother, Figen Murray, has been campaigning ever since to ensure that venues are better prepared in the event of a terror attack. The new provisions would require all venues with a capacity of more than 200 to ensure they have a plan in place in case of an attack on their premises. More than 100 businesses - from McDonald\u2019s to the Slug &amp; Lettuce chain - are backing the bill. Speaking on BBC Breakfast earlier, Murray said: Certainly I feel this is the beginning of the end of the campaign, although there\u2019s a bit to go still. But, yeah, I can see it\u2019s coming to fruition now, finally. She said there is global interest in the proposed law, with no similar legislation currently in place. Martyn\u2019s law is never meant to be punitive or onerous, like some people may suggest; it literally is very proportionate. It depends on the size of the venue, and it\u2019s obviously in two tiers as well, and the standard tier is actually far less restrictions than the bigger venues, 800-plus, who may have to put more stringent measures in place. The feedback we got is that there is actually either no cost or very low cost. It\u2019s common sense, and at the end of the day you need to just do the right thing and keep your customers and staff safe. In a separate interview on the Today programme, Murray recalled a conversation she had recently had with Keir Starmer when he asked how she had found the energy to keep going with her campaign on this issue. She said she had told him: \u201cActually, having your child\u2019s ashes on a bookshelf is a good motivator.\u201d Back to the Conservative party, and Robert Jenrick, the leadership candidate, has written an article for the Express today criticising the government over its decision to seek bidders for firms to run two migration centres in Kent, potentially until 2032. As Sam Blewett reports in his London Playbook briefing for Politico, Labour say the Home Office started this tender process when Jenrick was the minister in charge. One Home Office adviser said the contract notice was signed off while the immigration minister was \u2026 Robert Jenrick himself. They argued that his plans would\u2019ve cost nearly \u00a3200 million more, over a shorter, six-year period, and lacked the break clauses that the government has now included. Another Labour official added: \u201cIt seems Jenrick has lost his memory as well as all that weight.\u201d Shares in British gambling companies have dropped sharply, reducing the stock market value of large operators by more than \u00a33bn, after the Guardian reported that Treasury officials could tap the sector for between \u00a3900m and \u00a33bn in extra taxes, Rob Davies reports. Yesterday Robert Jenrick said that, if he was elected Tory leader, he would make Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, the Conservative party chair. Rees-Mogg is no longer an MP, having lost his seat at the election, but he is very popular with Conservative rightwingers and viewers of GB News, where he is a presenter. In a sign of his desire to reach out to Tory \u201cmoderates\u201d too, Jenrick has also said he would like \u201cbring back\u201d Penny Mordaunt, the former defence secretary and leader of the Commons, as the Telegraph reports. Mordaunt also lost her seat during the election. But Jenrick has not said how he would like to offer Mordaunt a role, suggesting that winning over Rees-Mogg fans is more of a priority. Having Rees-Mogg as party chair would be a big statement about where Jenrick wanted to take the party. In their excellent and very readable account of Liz Truss\u2019s time as prime minister, Truss at 10, Anthony Seldon and Jonathan Meakin point out that, when Truss was planning what she would do as PM, some of Rees-Moggs\u2019s ideas were regarded as bonkers even by her team. Seldon and Meakin say: [At a meeting in August with economists] Littlewood and fellow economist Julian Jessop were present at the tutorial, as was Rees-Mogg, hoping to be her chancellor. Did she need this turbocharging? Even some of her most ardent ideological supporters had reservations: \u2018Their radicalism gave fresh tinder to something that was already burning too brightly within Liz,\u2019 said Simon Clarke. The ideas flew around the room. A few days later, the idea of scrapping the cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses was mentioned. \u2018Let\u2019s go for it!\u2019 Reducing the 45p tax rate? \u2018Long overdue.\u2019 \u2018How about replacing all direct taxes with a flat 20p rate of income tax?\u2019 \u2018Great idea, Jacob.\u2019 This last proposal was nicknamed \u2018Estonia\u2019 (a reference to a similar policy adopted there) and Rees-Mogg \u2018estimated it would cost \u00a341 billion\u2019. \u2018I\u2019d long been attracted to the idea of flat rate taxes,\u2019 Truss said later. \u2018These ideas might have been fine if it had been a blue skies airing of a hundred things that we might do together at some point. But these guys were deadly serious,\u2019 recalled one adviser. He watched with horror as those present vied with each other to produce the most radical and outlandish ideas, none more so than Rees-Mogg. \u2018What is the number one problem with the UK energy system?\u2019 he asked. Silence. \u2018Not enough nuclear power,\u2019 he said, answering his own question. \u2018We need more small reactors in the UK.\u2019 \u2018How would you do it?\u2019 one asked. \u2018We should get a nuclear submarine to dock at Liverpool and plug it into the grid. That would show people it was safe.\u2019 Shock. Simon Case quietly interjected, \u2018I fear that\u2019s a non-starter: the submarines are needed on operations.\u2019 \u2018No one even laughed. It was totally pie in the sky. I thought they should\u2019ve been blowing up these ideas rather than legitimising them,\u2019 said another present. After they left, her young aides rounded on her: \u2018Liz, this is totally mad. You\u2019re not really serious about these ideas, are you?\u2019 \u2018I was worried,\u2019 Kwarteng later said. \u2018Liz was losing her perspective. The foreign secretary David Lammy has hailed \u201ca historic moment\u201d that marks the UK\u2019s post-Brexit reset, as he entered talks with the EU\u2019s chief diplomat and his 27 European counterparts. Arriving at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Lammy said he was delighted to be at the foreign affairs council \u201cfor this historic moment that marks our EU reset\u201d. In brief remarks to reporters, he said: The UK and Europe\u2019s security is indivisible. And at this time, whether it is the aggression of Russia in Ukraine, the tremendous issues and conflicts in the Middle East, or global affairs and geopolitical affairs more generally, it is hugely important that the United Kingdom and Europe remain steadfast and clear. Lammy is not the first UK foreign secretary to attend the EU foreign affairs council since Brexit - Liz Truss attended an emergency meeting soon after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine - but he is the first for many years to come with an upbeat, pro-EU agenda. The EU\u2019s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said he had invited Lammy soon after his appointment as foreign secretary, to discuss security and common challenges. We are neighbours, we are partners, we share the same concerns. I know that we both have the same ambition to cooperate to strengthen our cooperation and security and defence, because the security challenges that we are facing go across borders, they don\u2019t know borders. The EU was hugely disappointed when the former prime minister Boris Johnson rejected a formal foreign policy and security relationship, so Lammy is pushing at an open door with his ideas for deeper cooperation. The talks today - a bilateral with Borrell and a working lunch with EU foreign ministers - are expected to focus on Ukraine and the Middle East, but EU diplomats are also curious to hear about the UK government\u2019s plans for a foreign policy and security pact. Foreign and security policy will be easier terrain to find common ground with the EU than the economic relationship, where the UK has to navigate the bloc\u2019s red lines aimed at protecting the integrity of the European single market. Elon Musk would be welcome at future UK investment summits if and when he had investment programmes the UK could bid for, Peter Kyle, the science secretary, has said. Peter Walker has the story. And Graeme Wearden has full coverage of the investment summit on his business live blog. As mentioned earlier, Robert Jenrick, Kemi Badenoch\u2019s rival for the Tory leadership, is also facing criticism over health-related remarks. In an interview with the Sunday Times published yesterday, he called for Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, to be sacked. Jenrick said: It\u2019s particularly disappointing that Amanda Pritchard essentially denied the NHS has a problem with productivity in front of a select committee last year,\u201d he says. \u201c[She] has presided over plummeting productivity and then denied there is a problem. Having spoken to many people in and around the NHS, I do query whether she is the best person Britain has to run the NHS. It\u2019s nothing personal against her. I know she\u2019s very professional. But I do think it\u2019s time for someone new, who gets that NHS productivity has to improve. In a post on social media last night Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts, said it was unfair for Jenrick to attack a civil servant who is not meant to answer back. I have no stake in the Conservative leadership race and the Confed does not always agree with @NHSEngland but I think Robert Jenrick\u2019s call for @AmandaPritchard to be sacked is regrettable. It is inappropriate and unfair especially, as a public servant, she cannot respond. Good morning. It is a big day for the government, with Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves both speaking at its international investment summit, an event intended to showcase Labour\u2019s commitment to revive the economy and kickstart growth. As Kiran Stacey reports in his overnight story, Starmer is promising to slash red tape and \u201crip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment\u201d \u2013 in language that sounds very similar to what his Conservative predecessors used to say when they were launching similar initiatives. I will be covering some of what happens at the summit here, but Graeme Wearden will be leading the coverage of it on his business live blog. In other news, with ballot papers for the Tory leadership contest going out to members this week, that contest is heating up. The bookmakers have Kemi Badenoch as the favourite, but their odds put Robert Jenrick not far behind and no one is predicting the winner with any confidence. This morning Jenrick and Badenoch are both facing criticism. Jenrick is under fire for calling for the head of NHS England to be sacked, and for attacking Labour over migration centre contracts that the Home Office started putting out to tender when he was a minister there himself. But the Badenoch row may be more serious, because she has been criticised by a former Tory cabinet colleague over her comments about people with autism and anxiety problems. At the Conservative conference Badenoch\u2019s team released a 36-page essay called Conservatism in Crisis which identifies many factors supposedly holding back growth. On anxiety and autism it says: It is a positive thing our society is now more open around mental health. However, the socialisation of mental health, whereby mental health moved from something that people worked on for their own benefit, to something where everyone had to treat you differently, has both created costs and failed to improve people\u2019s mental health outcomes \u2026. [A change in the perception of harm] helps explains why people who had suffered events once seen as non-traumatic now feel entitled to support. This increases demand for psychologists and therapists, required to help people previously seen as able to cope. As will be set out in the forthcoming book [based on the essay] across the psychological and psychotherapy professions, numbers have risen from 102,000 in 2002 to 223,700 in 2023. Being diagnosed as neuro-diverse was once seen as helpful as it meant you could understand your own brain, and so help you to deal with the world. It was an individual focused change. But now it also offers economic advantages and protections. If you have a neurodiversity diagnosis (e.g. anxiety, autism), then that is usually seen as a disability, a category similar to race or biological sex in terms of discrimination law and general attitudes. If you are a child, you may well get better treatment or equipment at school \u2013 even transport to and from home. If you are in the workforce, you are protected in employment terms from day 1, you can more easily claim for unfair dismissal, and under disability rules you can also require your employer makes \u2018reasonable adjustments\u2019 to your job (and you can reveal your disability once you have been employed rather than before). In short, whereas once psychological and mental health was seen as something that people should work on themselves as individuals, mental health has become something that society, schools and employers have to adapt around. As Eleanor Langford reports in a story for the i, these comments have been strongly criticised by Robert Buckland, a former Tory justice secretary who has an autistic daughter and who conducted a review of employment opportunities for autistic people for the last government, after he left ministerial office. Buckland told the i that it was wrong for the Badenoch report to be \u201cstigmatising or lumping certain categories in with each other\u201d. He added: Anxiety is not a neurodiverse condition \u2026 autism is not a mental health condition. That part of the report didn\u2019t seem to me to be based on any evidence, and mixing up autism with mental health is not right. It\u2019s not the correct approach to be taken into this. A spokesperson for Badenoch said she only wrote the foreward to the report published at the Tory conference and that it was wrong to says it was stigmatising people. The spokesperson said: If we are to resolve the problem of deteriorating mental health, we must be able to point out that it is happening and how society has changed its approach to it and determine whether that approach is working. It would be wrong to infer any prejudice and it is essential that we are able to talk about these issues without the media deliberately misleading their readers for the sake of easy headlines. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: David Lammy, the foreign secretary, is in Luxembourg attending a meeting of the EU\u2019s foreign affairs council. 10.05am: Keir Starmer gives a speech at the government\u2019s investment summit, before taking part in a Q&amp;A with Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. At 4.20pm Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will give a speech closing the summit. Our main coverage of the summit will be on Graeme Wearden\u2019s business live blog, which is here. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: John Healey, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I\u2019m still using X and I\u2019ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian). I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct). And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

There is to a certain extent a renaissance of the UK, as people are looking at the UK again. Not only local investors but international investors.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>With more than \u00a3100bn invested in the UK already, <strong>M&amp;G</strong> is one of the headline sponsors of the event, and is clearly in tune with the message the government wants to send. Rossi says he has held meetings with ministers throughout the day who all \u201cspeak the same language\u201d on the priority of economic growth. \u201cThe alignment [between them], that relentless focus on growth. That is what is attracting people.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rossi</strong> says <strong>M&amp;G</strong> is keen to see progress on reducing burdensome regulation, particularly in the planning system, but that he is also full-square behind the government\u2019s employment rights reforms and the need to maintain some regulations to ensure a sustainable economy. </p> \n  <p>He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cIf you want to have sustainable growth you need to make sure you take care of the most important stakeholders. Who are the most important stakeholders? It\u2019s the people working.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>However, he warned against <strong>Rachel</strong> <strong>Reeves</strong> announcing large tax increases in the budget in two weeks\u2019 time, saying:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to grow the economy if you tax the economy much, much more. Because then you\u2019re killing the economy. You might have a short-term benefit but long-term there\u2019s no benefit at all.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the suggestions that the chancellor could raise capital gains tax, <strong>Rossi</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cI cannot speculate on what she will do. But I\u2019m sure that they will balance very well, whatever they do, with their ultimate ambition of growing the economy.

      "bodyText": "A late update: here are some photos from the post-summit drinks reception at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral: Time for a recap. Investors attending the Labour government\u2019s first International Investment Summit have announced pledges totalling \u00a363bn today, which will create an estimated 38,000 jobs. Spending commitments include \u00a320bn from \u2018Vampire kangaroo\u2019 Macquarie, on projects including a rollout of fast-charging electric vehicle infrastructure at motorway service stations, over \u00a36bn of new data centres by US tech firms, an expansion of Stansted airport, and a tie-up with US pharma firm Eli Lilly. Jackie Wild, CEO of international technical construction group TSL (which is building Google\u2019s \u00a3800m data centre in Hertfordshire) welcomed the pledge for more data centre investment, but warned that planning reform is needed, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see the Government facilitating investment in digital infrastructure, including data centres, which will underpin the fourth industrial revolution and stimulate growth in the UK for decades to come. However, it is essential that international businesses have confidence in Britain\u2019s capability to deliver the physical infrastructure to back investment. Businesses like Google, Amazon and Cyrus One are prospering here but it\u2019s important that we now see swift progress on issues like planning reform to facilitate expansion and increased investment from businesses of their profile.\u201d The government also secured a \u00a31bn expansion of London Gateway port, after the row over transport secretary Louise Haigh\u2019s criticism of its owner\u2019s poor business practices was defused. Opening the event, Sir Keir Starmer said the government and investors were bound together, in the \u201cshared endeavour of prosperity\u201d. Growth, Starmer argued, was \u201cvital\u2026if we are to steer our way through a great period of insecurity and change\u201d. Having \u2018celebrated\u2019 100 days in office on Saturday, Starmer pledged to fix the UK\u2019s public service and stabilise the economy quickly, and also repair Britain\u2019s brand \u201cas an open, outward-looking, confident, trading nation\u201d. In comments that have caused alarm, Starmer pledged to \u201cget rid\u201d of regulations that are holding back investment, such as building homes, data centres, warehouses, grid connectors, roads, and trainlines. Both the Green Party and the RSPB have voiced concerns about what this will mean for Britain. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, told delegates that UK corporation tax would be capped at 25% for the lifetime of this parliament, in an attempt to give bosses some certainty. She also warned that the government faces \u2018difficult choices\u2019 as she draws up the budget, and hinted that she is planning to raise employer national insurance contributions\u2026. Reeves also announced that the UK Infrastructure Bank has been converted into the National Wealth Fund, which will be capitalised with \u00a327.8bn to catalyse private investment in the market. The Financial Times has calculated that Reeves has cut by a fifth the new money she is investing into the UK\u2019s National Wealth Fund, though \u2013 from the \u00a37.3bn originally pledged to just \u00a35.8bn. Rachel Reeves has dropped her strongest hint yet that she is planning to raise employer national insurance contributions in the budget, prompting accusations Labour is about to break its manifesto promises. The chancellor used the government\u2019s international investment summit at Guildhall in London on Monday to warn of tax rises to come in this month\u2019s announcement, insisting that business would understand the need for fiscal stability. After days of rumours that Reeves is planning to impose national insurance on employers\u2019 pension contributions, the chancellor refused to rule out doing so, adding that executives would understand the need for such decisions. Speaking at the investment summit today, Reeves said: \u201cWe will stick to the commitments we made in our manifesto. But you know there is a \u00a322bn black hole over and above anything we knew about going into the election that we need to fill, and that\u2019s not just a one year, that persists throughout the forecast period. \u201cSo we are going to need to sort of close that gap between what government is spending and bringing in through tax receipts. But we are going to be a government that sticks to our manifesto commitments, including that one [on not raising taxes on working people].\u201d However\u2026Paul Johnson, the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told Times Radio today that such a move would count as a \u201cstraightforward breach\u201d of the manifesto. He said: \u201cI went back and read the manifesto and it says very clearly, we will not raise rates of national insurance.\u201d Reeves\u2019s predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, agrees\u2026 (I think \u201cLing\u201d should be \u201cKing\u201d) Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, isn\u2019t surprised to hear that the government raised a record amount of new investment today. She points out: \u201cThere was simply no way the government\u2019s much touted summit could end without a flurry of announcements promising billions of pounds in investment. The figure of \u00a363 billion made for a rousing crescendo to a day of optimistic rhetoric and political promises but it was impossible for all those suited and booted business leaders to ignore the elephant in the room. \u201cRachel Reeves might have promised that a road map for business taxation will be set out but speculation about where that road will bend can be costly. Shares in gambling companies plummeted today as investors mulled over a potential doubling of taxes, and with the Budget still more than two weeks away confidence is fraying and businesses are crying out for the clarity and stability they\u2019ve been promised. As the dust settles at Guildhall, delegates are heading off to St Paul\u2019s Cathedral for a drinks reception with The King, where they should be entertained by Elton John. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the investments announced today: Data centres Global tech firms announced investments worth \u00a36.3bn in UK data centres \u2013 which ministers view as critical to enhancing the UK\u2019s capacity in artificial intelligence. This includes the firms CyrusOne, ServiceNow, Cloud HQ and CoreWeave making plans to open locations in the UK, including a \u00a31.9bn data centre campus at Didcot in Oxfordshire. Blackstone confirmed a \u00a310bn investment in Blyth, Northumberland to create one of the largest artificial data centres in Europe, creating 4,000 jobs. Amazon Web Services announced a \u00a38bn investment last month. Carbon capture and storage Announced in the run-up to the summit, as much as \u00a321.7bn of funding will be spread over 25 years in investment from the public sector. Ministers expect this to leverage in \u00a38bn of private sector investment from companies including BP and Equinor. The plans will fund two carbon capture sights; one in the north west of England on Merseyside, and another in the north east, on Teesside \u2013 directly creating 4,000 jobs and supporting 50,000 jobs in the long-term. Clean energy Days before the summit ministers announced investment by the private sector in clean energy. This included the Spanish firm Iberdrola doubling its investment in the UK, through Scottish Power, from \u00a312bn to \u00a324bn over the next 4 years. Orsted and Greenvolt will invest after the government\u2019s recently expanded offshore wind auction, with the business department expecting this to unlock \u00a38bn in private investment from Orsted and \u00a32.5bn from Greenvolt. Octopus Energy have committed to a \u00a32bn investment in renewable energy generation, including four new solar farms in Bristol, Essex, East Riding of Yorkshire and Wiltshire. Macquarie, the Australian investment firm \u2013 which previously owned Thames Water \u2013 will supporting investment of \u00a31.3bn investment into new green infrastructure, including its Island Green Power solar farm in Stow. Infrastructure DP World are investing up to \u00a31bn in their London Gateway container port operation, after a controversial row with the transport secretary, Louise Haigh. The new investment will fund two additional berths and a second rail terminal. Manchester Airports Group is investing more than \u00a31.1bn in London Stansted Airport. Network Rail and London &amp; Continental Railways are creating a new property company to regenerate brownfield sites across the rail estate, with a value exceeding \u00a31bn. Public investment Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, announced an expansion of Labour\u2019s flagship National Wealth Fund, involving a merger of the organisation with the existing UK Infrastructure Bank set up by the previous Conservative government. With a total of \u00a327.8bn, the combined entity will be based in Leeds, and have the aim to provide public money to \u201ccatalyse private investment\u201d into the UK\u2019s clean energy and growth industries \u2013 including green hydrogen, carbon capture and gigafactories. The British Business Bank (BBB) will also have an expanded role, through a programme branded the \u201cBritish Growth Partnership,\u201d that will raise hundreds of millions of pounds of private money to invest in commercial projects. Ministers say the funding will be allocated \u201cindependently of government on a fully commercial basis\u201d. This new money will be in addition to \u00a33.5bn of support provided by the BBB to more than 23,000 businesses last year. Katie White, MP for Leeds North West, has welcomed today\u2019s announcement that the National Wealth Fund will be headquartered in the city. White, who called for this to happen in the Yorkshire Post last week, says: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that the Chancellor has confirmed the National Wealth Fund will be based in Leeds\u2014the green finance capital of the UK. This is fantastic news for Leeds, the North, and the entire country. Private investment is crucial for driving the UK\u2019s green transition. With Leeds already home to the UK Infrastructure Bank, leading investment to achieve net zero, and the growing presence of the Bank of England here, our city has proven it has the expertise and ambition to develop and invest in the industries of the future. The National Wealth Fund will create thousands of clean energy jobs, boost energy security, and contribute to tackling climate change. By working at pace with industry, the Government will unlock private investment and strengthen the economy.\u201d The government has now announced the grand total of investment pledged at today\u2019s summit, in a fashion reminiscent of Children In Need (no Pudsey Bear, though, alas). And \u2026.. confirming Rachel Reeves\u2019s comments in her speech a few minutes ago, they say the summit has secured \u00a363bn of investment and almost 38,000 jobs. It\u2019s wise to be a little cynical about such claims \u2013 often, companies simply bundle up plans they were drawing up anyway. But the government are very keen to trumpet today\u2019s event as a triumph, pointing out that they\u2019ve secured twice as much as Rishi Sunak managed at his final investment summit in November 2023 (when there was rather more political uncertainty flowing around). Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says: \u201cGlobal investors should be in no doubt that under this new government Britain is truly the best place to do business. The record-breaking investment total secured at today\u2019s Summit marks a major vote of confidence in the UK and our stability dividend across industry and innovation. We\u2019re determined to deliver economic growth in every part of the UK and these investments, together with our forthcoming Industrial Strategy, will give global businesses the certainty they need as we lead the charge for the innovation and jobs of the future.\u201d The new government has put unlocking private investment at the heart of everything we do,, Reeves says. Returning to the \u00a360bn of investment announced at (or slightly before) the summit, Reeves says those pledges will mean new, high-skilled jobs, from Aberdeenshire in Scotland to Blyth in Northumberland, and to North Wales. She concludes: The decisions that lie ahead will not always be easy, but by making the right choices \u2013 to grow our economy, drive investment, we will create good jobs and new opportunities across every part of our country. That is the Britain that we are building, and that is the difference that we will make together. And with that, the chancellor leaves the stage, to a warm round of applause. Rachel Reeves then announces that the UK\u2019s new National Wealth Fund had been created. It will be the UK\u201ds new \u2018impact investor\u2019, she says, catalysing tens of billions of private investment to fund green technology. Reeves says the UK Infrastructure Bank will now operate as the National Wealth Fund, headquartered in Leeds, with a bigger team, more freedom, and more risk capital to invest. Business taxation is a critical part of the government\u2019s growth plan, Reeves continues. Constant changes in corporation tax in recent years have caused instability, she says, so the government will produce a corporation tax roadmap. That will mean a cap on corporation tax at 25% (its current level) for this parliament (a pledge Labour already made back in February), and a \u2018world-leading\u2019 capital allowances offer, including \u2018full expensing\u2019 [which allows firms to offset investment costs against their tax bill.] I will deliver a balanced approach in the budget, Rachel Reeves pledges. That means: Fiscal and economic stability, investment over decline, in a budget that will protect living standards, repair our NHS and fix the foundations of our economy so we can build a stronger Britain. Moving onto her budget later this month, Rachel Reeves says the government faces \u201cdifficult choices\u201d due to the situation it has inherited. The first step is to restore fiscal and economic stability, Reeves says. Defending her first fiscal rule, to move the current budget into balance, she says: Balancing the books by ensuring we do no borrow for day-to-day spending is not anti-investment. It\u2019s the only way to ensure government and business can invest with confidence. Government investment must be sustainable, she adds, with debt falling at the end of the forecast (this is the second fiscal rule). It must also \u201ccrowd in\u201d private investment too, she adds. Rachel Reeves declares the government is ending years of instability and uncertainty, and bringing jobs back to this country. She adds: Britain is open for business once again. Reeves adds that reforming the UK pension system will release more funds for investment. Rachel Reeves says the government want to be the most pro-business government the UK has ever seen. To do that, she says, government and business must work hand in hand, the chancellor says. She cites the government\u2019s plan to remove blockages in the planning system, and end the ban on onshore wind. Back at the Guildhall, chancellor Rachel Reeves is delivering a closing keynote address to delegates at the investment summit. Reeves begins by saying how fantastic it is to be at the Guildhall after such a \u201cbrilliant day\u201d. She says her optimism for Britain \u201cburns brighter than ever\u201d, after \u00a360bn of shovel-ready investment was announced today. Those commitments, from companies such as Servicenow, Eli Lilly and the Manchester Airport Group, will help create over 40,000 jobs in the UK, Reeves says. That is a sign of the confidence that we now see in the UK economy, she says, and will help big and small businesses across the UK. That \u00a360bn includes \u00a320bn from Macquarie Group for a range of projects, and \u2013 I assume \u2013 the \u00a324bn of green technology investment announced last Friday (three days before the summit)\u2026 Keir Starmer has also told Bloomberg TV that suggestions the UK government was considering raising capital gains tax as high as 39% was \u201cwide of the mark.\u201d Speaking at the investment summit, the PM said: \u201cA lot of speculation is getting pretty wide of the mark,\u201d Asked whether chancellor Rachel Reeves could hike capital gains tax to 39% from a top rate of 28% currently, Starmer replied: \u201cThat\u2019s getting to an area which is wide of the mark.\u201d The Guardian reported last week that Treasury officials have been testing a range of 33% to 39% for capital gains tax (CGT), as the government tries to raise funds for public services. The Royal Social for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has described Keir Starmer\u2019s speech this morning, in which he said he wanted to \u201crip out\u201d planning laws blocking growth as \u201cunsettling\u201d, my colleague Andrew Sparrow reports. Echoing earlier concerns from the Green Party, RSPB chief executive, Beccy Speight, says: An unsettling speech from the PM this morning for those who love and value nature. Deregulation done in the wrong way is effectively dropping standards, at a time when the natural world desperately needs better protection. It\u2019s a short-sighted tactic that could have ramifications for us all in years to come, undermining our long term prosperity - better methods, such as nature-friendly planning, would give businesses the certainty they need. We support growth and we support the badly-needed energy transition, but not at the expense of our precious wildlife and wild places. His very own secretary of state [Steve Reed] said recently that \u201cnature is dying\u201d \u2013 uncontrolled deregulation is tantamount to hammering the final nail into its coffin. That\u2019s from the Politics Live blog: Keir Starmer has told Bloomberg TV that he wants to bring in more investment, as the UK \u201cdesperately needs growth\u201d. The PM says: We haven\u2019t had meaningful growth in the economy in the United Kingdom in 14 long years. We\u2019re determined to turn that around. Q: Would the governmen need to be sure that Chinese retailer Shein wasn\u2019t using forced labour in Xinjiang, before you allowed them to float on the London stock market? Starmer won\u2019t comment on individual cases, but talks about the need for high standards, particularly for workers. And in a hint that all companies looking to sell shares in London will face scrutiny over workers\u2019 rights, Starmer says: \u201cOf course we\u2019ll be looking at any issue\u2026with a particular feature on the rights of the workforce.\u201d Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has pushed back against some implied criticism from the prime minister today. In his speech this morning, Keir Starmer told international investors he\u2019d ensure that the UK\u2019s economic and competition regulators \u201ctake growth as seriously as this room does\u201d. The Competitions and Markets Authority has now rebuffed the implication that it is neglecting growth. A CMA spokesperson has told the Guardian: \u201cDriving growth and innovation has been an explicit strategic priority for the CMA over the last two years. It continues to be a focus for the work we are doing.\u201d Australia\u2019s Macquarie Group have announced a \u00a320bn package of investment in the UK today. Attending the investment summit, Macquarie CEO Shemara Wikramanayake announced the company will help fund a network of fast-charging electric vehicle infrastructure in the UK. The investment will see Macquarie\u2019s portfolio company Roadchef install around 650 fast-charging points at its motorway service area sites. Macquarie (often criticised for its management of Thames Water) says the upgraded EV charging facilities will be partly powered by 9 MW of new solar energy capacity installed on-site. Roadchef will also test electric charging solutions for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) at two key locations across the motorway network. Wikramanayake (who we saw earlier today) says: \u201cThe upgrade of Roadchef sites is our latest in a long line of investments in UK infrastructure and we have plans to invest more. We believe that infrastructure investment helps create strong foundations for economic growth, job creation, better services for the public and stronger communities. We are fully invested in the UK\u2019s success and look forward to playing our part in delivering the investment the country needs.\u201d Macquarie is also planning to invest in: 5GW of new offshore wind developments, including projects off the Orkney and Lincolnshire coasts Developing new solar power and battery energy storage projects, including the UK\u2019s largest new solar project in Nottinghamshire by Island Green Power Supporting investment in the gas transmission network, including upgrades to the distribution networks in North West England, West Midlands, East Midlands, East of England and London Upgrading digital infrastructure, including bringing ultra-fast full fibre and gigabit wireless broadband to rural communities from Somerset to Cumbria Investing in the creation of new homes, including developments in Edinburgh and Birmingham Supporting the growth of high potential UK companies in areas such as utilities connections, wind farm performance analytics and smart metering led from Glasgow, Nottingham, and Watford Supporting investment to build the UK\u2019s first reservoir in 30 years [in Havant, Hampshire] alongside upgrades to essential water and wastewater infrastructure across England\u2019s South East Green Party MP for North Herefordshire, Ellie Chowns, has criticised Keir Starmer\u2019s pledge to rip up bureaucracy to get growth moving. Following his speech at the investment summit, Chowns says: \u201cStarmer\u2019s pledge to investors that he will \u201ccut red tape\u201d is a tired clich\u00e9 that, in practice, too often means harming environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights. We\u2019ve had fourteen years of successive Conservative governments promising to \u201ccut red tape,\u201d and all we have to show for it is a flatlining economy and falling living standards. If Starmer is serious about attracting investment to the UK, he will need a bolder approach that delivers on the \u201cchange\u201d he promised in his election campaign. He could start by re-evaluating our relationship with our biggest trading partner, the European Union.\u201d Secretary of State for Transport Louise Haigh has resisted talking about the row over her criticism of P&amp;O Ferries and their owner DP World, The Sun\u2019s Ashley Armstrong reports: As reported earlier, DP World are attending the summit, and have announced a \u00a31bn expansion of its London Gateway container port. London Mayor Sadiq Khan is hoping that the Labour governmnet will agree closer alignment with the European Union, and isn\u2019t ruling out an eventual return to the single market. Speaking at the Government\u2019s international investment summit, he told the PA news agency: \u201cI\u2019m quite clear that all successful countries do the most trade with their nearest neighbours, that\u2019s one of the signs of success. We\u2019ve got on our doorstep, not just friends and colleagues and family indeed, we\u2019ve got a market of more than 500 million people. The good news is the Prime Minister spent a lot of the last three months visiting friends in Europe, whether it\u2019s the president of France, the prime minister of Italy, the chancellor of Germany or the European Union, indeed, in Brussels. The current Brexit deal we have comes up before review next year. I\u2019m hoping, unlike last time, there will be closer alignment, rather than divergence. We should be looking at a whole host of issues and talking about them \u2013 whether it\u2019s a youth mobility scheme, whether it\u2019s seeing what we can do to bring people closer together. I think the reality is, in the short term, we probably aren\u2019t going to get back as members of the single market. But it\u2019s something we shouldn\u2019t be scared to talk about.\u201d Andrea Rossi, the chief executive of the London-based investment giant M&amp;G, says global investors are looking at Britain differently under a Labour government. Speaking at the investment summit, Rossi told my colleague Richard Partington: \u201cThe last years have suffered a little bit, you know, Brexit, Covid, and instability. There is to a certain extent a renaissance of the UK, as people are looking at the UK again. Not only local investors but international investors.\u201d With more than \u00a3100bn invested in the UK already, M&amp;G is one of the headline sponsors of the event, and is clearly in tune with the message the government wants to send. Rossi says he has held meetings with ministers throughout the day who all \u201cspeak the same language\u201d on the priority of economic growth. \u201cThe alignment [between them], that relentless focus on growth. That is what is attracting people.\u201d Rossi says M&amp;G is keen to see progress on reducing burdensome regulation, particularly in the planning system, but that he is also full-square behind the government\u2019s employment rights reforms and the need to maintain some regulations to ensure a sustainable economy. He says: \u201cIf you want to have sustainable growth you need to make sure you take care of the most important stakeholders. Who are the most important stakeholders? It\u2019s the people working.\u201d However, he warned against Rachel Reeves announcing large tax increases in the budget in two weeks\u2019 time, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to grow the economy if you tax the economy much, much more. Because then you\u2019re killing the economy. You might have a short-term benefit but long-term there\u2019s no benefit at all.\u201d Asked about the suggestions that the chancellor could raise capital gains tax, Rossi said: \u201cI cannot speculate on what she will do. But I\u2019m sure that they will balance very well, whatever they do, with their ultimate ambition of growing the economy. And I\u2019m convinced they\u2019ll be very pragmatic about it.\u201d In a further attempt to woo international investors, the UK has launched a consultation into its new industrial strategy, dubbed Invest 2035. The foreword of the strategy begins by declaring \u201cGrowth is the number one mission of this government\u201d \u2013 which we\u2019ve already heard from Keir Starmer today. The government says its industrial Strategy will be \u201cambitious and targeted\u201d, saying. Its primary objective is to drive growth, by taking advantage of the UK\u2019s unique strengths and untapped potential, enabling the UK\u2019s world-leading sectors to adapt and grow, and seizing opportunities to lead in new sectors, with high quality, well-paid jobs. It will shape the type of growth being pursued: the Government will also seek to support Net Zero, regional growth, and economic security and resilience. It will be grounded in long-term stability, a renewed commitment to free and fair trade, and a pro-business approach focused on reducing barriers to investment in the UK. And as expectred, it foguses on eight growth-driving sectors: Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Energy Industries, Creative Industries, Defence, Digital and Technologies, Financial Services, Life Sciences, and Professional and Business Services. But there\u2019s very little about migration \u2013 an issue which Eric Schmidt identified as crucial earlier today. The document says: Our people are supported by an immigration system that attracts the brightest and best, with the UK being the second most attractive country in the G20 for young people. Sam Coates of Sky News has whizzed through the document, and plucked out the key points: It\u2019s nearly as busy outside the Guildhall as inside, with a second group of protestors holding a demonstration. Campaigners opposed to the Sizewell C nuclear plant unfurled two banners saying \u201cSizewell C is a Toxic Investment\u201d this morning outside the investment summit. They hope to persuade international investors not to support the project. Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C says: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that Britain is open for business, but we\u2019re here to tell international investors that, unless they want to find themselves embroiled in another HS2, they should put their money into renewables instead of slow, risky, expensive, \u201ctoxic\u201d Sizewell C. The reality is that Sizewell C cannot help the Labour government achieve its Energy Mission, and if UK investors won\u2019t touch it, neither should international ones, nor the taxpayer.\u201d The \u2018Final Investment Decision\u2019 (FID) on the proposed plant on the Suffolk Coast has already been delayed. Yesterday, the GMB and Unite unions urged the government to sign off the investment quickly. Australian investment bank Macquarie is also attending today\u2019s investment summit, despite having been criticised for its role in the privatisation of England\u2019s water industry. Shemara Wikramanayake, Macquarie\u2019s CEO is there, and was seated next to chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2026 \u2026and also appears to have been chatting to Pat McFadden, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: Last year Wikramanayake insisted that the investment bank\u2019s UK nickname, the \u201cvampire kangaroo\u201d, was disappointing, after it piled debt onto Thames Water which is now close to collapse. Climate campaigners are unimpressed by today\u2019s announcement of more investment for Stansted airport (see earlier post). Alethea Warrington, head of aviation, heat, and energy at climate charity Possible, says: \u201cExpanding airports to encourage even more flights is the last thing we need if we\u2019re going to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cInstead of allowing high-carbon sectors such as aviation to expand, the government should rein in aviation growth by banning private jets and taxing frequent flyers, and focus on supporting investment in clean, low carbon technologies and climate-friendly transport.\u201d Larry Fink is one of the most powerful investors at today\u2019s summit; on Friday, his asset manager BlackRock reported that it now holds assets of $11.5 trillion. He\u2019s been meeting ministers this morning, including deputy PM Angela Raynor: And chancellor Rachel Reeves: While the cream of global investing hobnob inside the Guildhall, outside there are protesters calling for a wealth tax to fund investment. Youth climate justice campaign group Green New Deal Rising are displaying a banner reading \u201cTax Extreme Wealth\u201d, as they urge Rachel Reeves to target the wealthiest in this month\u2019s budget. Fatima Ibrahim, co-director of Green New Deal Rising, says: \u201cPrivate investment alone will not fix our economy - and it certainly won\u2019t rescue our public services or tackle the climate crisis. Instead of taking freebies from the super-rich and abdicating responsibility to the private sector, which has polluted our water and ruined our railways, it\u2019s time for Rachel Reeves to make the common-sense, popular choice to end the unfairness in our tax system. She must choose to tax extreme wealth by implementing an annual 2% tax on assets over 10 million in the Autumn Budget. Doing so would unlock billions for urgently needed public investment to benefit our communities, not just wealthy shareholders\u201d. Labour is pulling out all the stops for its international investment summit. Business leaders gathered in the City of London have just been told Sir Elton John will be performing tonight at an ultra-exclusive dinner reception at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, where King Charles will be in attendance. The dinner will include dining courtesy of the three-Michelin-starred-chef Clare Smyth, at an event with the cabinet, where one Labour staffer said there had been \u201cfights\u201d over who would get to attend because of the very limited capacity for company bosses. Sir Lucian Grainge, the chair of Universal Music Group, confirmed that the Rocket man would be performing this evening, while speaking on a panel session with the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, on the \u201cUK\u2019s soft power as a hard investment opportunity\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s an ambassador. He wanted to be here,\u201d says Grainge, to applause and whoops from some of the big beasts of capitalism attending the event at the Guildhall in the City of London. \u201cI wish you could see the politicians\u2019 faces. We spend a lot of time in meetings, we don\u2019t get out very often,\u201d Nandy replied. Perhaps, but would it be unfair to suggest that Labour politicians have been in hot water of late for taking freebies to attend superstar gigs? The panel session, involving Gareth Southgate, the former England manager, and the head of production at Netflix, Anna Mallet, highlighted how Britain punches above its weight for cultural capital. Southgate talked up changes to kick-off times in the Premier League as a key for attracting TV money into England\u2019s national sport. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t like,\u201d he says, but it brought the \u201cability to bring in best talent. The best players wanted to come here, and the product improved.\u201d Grainge warned the UK was \u201cat a crossroads\u201d in the market for culture, as new technologies helped the rise of talent around the world - including Latin America, India and China (a country where he says it was an \u201centirely counterfeit market\u201d 20 years ago but is now the seventh biggest in the world). Saying he is spending more time in the UK recently, as a market where Universal will invest, he adds: \u201cThe advantage for the UK, about the UK as an investment, is that it has as the prime minister keeps repeating, is the rule of law, a non-politicised justice system, and it respects and rewards for investment and innovation and creativity around copyright and IP.\u201d A group of US tech firms have announced they will invest over \u00a36bn in UK data centres. ServiceNow, CyrusOne, CloudHQ and CoreWeave would invest a combined \u00a36.3bn in UK data centre technology, the government says at today\u2019s investment summit. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle calls the move a \u2018vote of confidence\u2019 in Britain, which will take the total investment in UK data centres to over \u00a325bn since the government took office in July. CloudHQ is set to develop a new \u00a31.9bn data centre campus in Didcot, Oxfordshire. Kyle says: Tech leaders from all over the world are seeing Britain as the best place to invest with a thriving and stable market for data centres and AI development. Data centres power our day-to-day lives and boost innovation in growing sectors like AI. This is why only last month, I took steps to class UK data centres as Critical National Infrastructure giving the industry the ultimate reassurance the UK will always be a safe home for their investment. Today\u2019s drumbeat of investment is a vote of confidence in Britain and our approach to work with business to deliver sustained growth for all. The government has also announced a \u201clandmark collaboration\u201d with pharmaceuticals giant Eli Lilly, worth \u00a3279m, to accelerate the delivery of next-generation medicines. Eli Lilly has expressed an intention to invest in the UK, as part of a collaborative partnership with the government announced at the International Investment Summit today. Eli Lilly plans to launch the first \u2018Lilly Gateway Labs\u2019 innovation accelerator in Europe. It will support early-stage life sciences businesses, by providing them with lab space, mentorship, and potential financial backing. Health and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting, says: \u201cFor all the challenges facing the health of our nation, we have two huge advantages: some of the world\u2019s leading scientific minds, and a National Health Service with enormous potential. If we can combine the two, patients in this country can reap the rewards of the revolution in medical science unfolding before our eyes. \u201cThis announcement helps the UK take its place as a world leader in life sciences and brings life-changing treatments closer to being a reality for NHS patients. Partnerships like this are key to building a healthier society, healthier economy, and making the NHS fit for the future.\u201d The collaboration intends to explore new ways of delivering health and care services to people living with obesity, the government adds. Eli Lilly makes an anti-obesity drug called Zepbound in the US, or Mounjaro in the UK. Last week, the NHS said it would offer Mounjaro to nearly a quarter million people as part of a three-year plan. A five-year, \u00a31.1bn investment to grow London Stansted has been unveiled by the Prime Minister at the International Investment Summit. Just over half the money, some \u00a3600m, will go on previously announced plans to expand the airport\u2019s terminal by a third, as it grows its capacity from 29m passengers to 43m per year. Another \u00a3500m will be spent on other enhancements to the existing terminal and to the wider airport, notably a 14.3MW on-site solar farm to support Stansted\u2019s increasing electricity demands, including its new EV charging forecourt. Construction is expected to begin next year and take two to three years to complete. Planning permission for expansion was granted last year, but the cost of the overhaul has not previously been released \u2013 and with owning group MAG being one-third owned by overseas investors IFM (if mainly by Manchester councils) the announcement brings an element of foreign money to the UK. Transport secretary Louise Haigh said: \u201cTransport is central to this government\u2019s core mission of growing the economy. This is about giving companies like MAG the confidence to invest, boosting regional and national economic growth, and supporting the aviation sector while also meeting our existing environmental obligations.\u201d Ken O\u2019Toole, CEO of MAG - which owns Manchester and East Midlands Airports as well as Stansted, said: \u201cAviation is an essential enabler of the success of the UK\u2019s key high-value industries, and we look forward to helping the government achieve the highest sustained growth in the G7 through the sustainable growth of our airports.\u201d Speaking of Nobel prizes\u2026 two UK-born academics are among a trio of US-based professors who have just won this year\u2019s Nobel prize in economics, for showing how the types of institutions introduced by colonisers have helped determine whether a country is rich or poor today. The explanation put forward by Turkish-American Daron Acemo\u011flu, Sheffield-born Simon Johnson and Briton James A Robinson, suggests that inclusive institutions for the long-term benefit of European migrants ended up resulting in more prosperous societies in the long term. However, they found that in countries where the aim was to exploit the Indigenous population and extract resources for the colonisers\u2019 benefit, the impact has been detrimental, and resulted in far poorer societies, leaving some countries trapped in low economic growth cycles. Q: How can British companies attract the talent it needs for the artificial intelligence revolution? Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt says: A pro-growth agenda would start with high-skilled immigration, which is now in place here and should be expanded. Schmidt points out that a lot of \u201cincredibly smart people\u201d are now getting graduate degrees in AI. The key, he says, is either to keep them in Britain or get them to move here from Europe. Schmidt agrees that more AI talent is needed, as the technology is hard, complicated, and it\u2019s being built right now. He admits: Sometimes it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, and I have a PhD in the area. But with a little bit of time, and the right leadership., Britian can have all those people. Schmidt points out: They love living here. A good moment to wrap up the session. Q: How can the UK win the battle for AI talent? Keir Starmer argues that Britain is in a good position now, in the top three in the world for artificial intelligence thanks to world-leading universities. He agrees that the UK needs to attract top talent. Making it clear that AI matters to the UK should help the country hold its leading position, he says. Former chief Eric Schmidt then fires a warning to Keir Starmer that Britain risks missing out on the move to data centres, which are notoriously energy-thirsty. Schmidt tells Starmer, on the stage at the investment summit: The demand for energy for data centres is massive. We need you to approve the necessary steps to make these data centres in Britain, because your research scientists, your companies, your citizens all need these things. Schmidt argues that investing heavily in AI will pay off, by finding ways to improve energy efficiency \u2013 finding the solutions to the energy transition faster. GSK chief Emma Walmsley turns to the health service\u2026 Keir Starmer says the UK is \u201crightly proud\u201d of the NHS, set up by Labour over 70 years ago. The simple truth is that simply putting more money into the health services as it is won\u2019t make it fit for the future. The PM insists he\u2019s not talking about changing the principle of healthcare being free at the point of use. Instead, he says there is huge potential for AI to improve the delivery of public services, such as health care. He cites technology using AI to scan for liver cancer \u2013 which he\u2019s seen, and which massively improves the chance of spotting the disease early. Eric Schmidt backs up this point, saying computer vision is now more accurate than human vision, so can do a better job of spotting early signs of illness. Former Google chief Eric Schmidt tells the summit that the Science Museum down the road shows how the industrial age was invented here in the UK. There\u2019s every reason to think that artificial intelligence will have the same level of impact. And by the way, it was invented right here too, in particular in Kings Cross, which I think is.. \u201cMy constituency\u201d, says Keir Starmer proudly, pointing out that Demis Hassabis winning the Nobel prize last week was \u201cabsolutely amazing\u201d. I said to him yesterday, I feel proud, he should. Schmidt then eulogises about AI, arguing that AI will make everyone at least twice as productive. That means Starmer can make twice as many speeches\u2026 \u2026The PM suggests this might not be popular, winning some laughs in the room\u2026 while a firm such as GSK can make incredible life-saving drugs twice as quickly. The key to AI is efficiency gains, Schmidt adds, which will lead to a massive wave of investment and higher incomes for people. Schmidt points out that last year the UK laid out the core structure of AI safety (under Starmer\u2019s predecessor, Rishi Sunak). He says Britain is in a good position to take the lead on AI, as: The UK has frankly stronger civil servants, who are smarter and more committed to this, and are frankly stable, so you can work with them. There\u2019s every reason the UK can build the AI world, and also help deal with the \u2018guardrail\u2019 issue, Schmidt adds. GSK CEO Dame Emma Walmsley then asks: Q: Where does Britain sit in a global setting, post-Brexit? Starmer says that the Brexit vote gave the impression that Britain was turning in on itself, and less interested in the outside world. The PM says he\u2019s been focused on resetting the UK\u2019s international relations, to make it clear that we want to play our old role on the world stage, as a \u201cconfident, outward-looking, value-driven\u201d country that sticks to agreements it makes. Sat alongside Starmer, former Google chief Eric Schmidt says he was \u201cshocked\u201d when Labour became strongly in favour of growth. Taking his chance, Starmer chirps up with: Wealth creation is the number one mission of a Labour government\u2026 It\u2019s true. Schmidt says he knows Starmer believes this. Having spoken with investors at the summit in recent days, Schmidt has good news for Starmer, saying: There\u2019s plenty of money that\u2019s going to come into the country if you achieve what you\u2019re just said. Schmidt suggests the government needs a minister of \u201canti-regulation\u201d. But the bad news, he argues, is that in the UK system there are \u201cso many ways that people can say no\u201d. Businesses would rather have a single person who can give a yes or no answer. Schmidt warns Starmer that Labour\u2019s goal of making Britain a clean energy superpower by the end of the decade is at risk, saying: The cost of capital and the delay is killing you. And furthermore, you\u2019re not going to achieve your 2030 energy goal \u2013 which is laudable \u2013 without fixing this. Starmer is now holding an \u201cin conversation\u201d event with former CEO and chairman of Google Eric Schmidt, moderated by the CEO of GSK Dame Emma Walmsley Walmsley starts by asking about competitiveness, saying: Q: How will we make sure that the costs of doing business in Britain, and the regulatory environment, are competitive, compared to the G7 and the rest of Europe? And taking a long-term view, what do you most want to achieve for businesses on your watch to encourage them to bet on Britain? Starmer starts by criticising the \u2018sticking plaster\u2019 politics of the previous government, saying he is leading a mission-driven government \u2013 and the number one mission is economic growth. That provides a \u2018yardstick\u2019 for taking decisions. Secondly, he again cites Labour\u2019s chunky majority in parliament \u2013 meaning there is stability, decisions taking today can be measured in \u2018years, not months\u2019, and there\u2019s power to take difficult decisions. He says he wants to champion the brilliance of the UK economy, and remove the \u2018inhibitors\u2019 such as planning. It takes far too long to get decisions on planning, measure in years not months. We\u2019ve got to streamline that, and we\u2019ve already started. On regulation, Starmer says the \u2018volume\u2019 of regulation, and the number of regulators \u201cpulling away\u201d at issues, is a problem that needs to be stripped away. He also cites the appointment of ex-Darktrace CEO Poppy Gustafsson as UK investment minister, last week (just in time for the summit). Starmer adds that he wants a partnership between a \u2018mission-driven government\u2019 and the private sector. That means working together, where the government can clear the path to help companies succeed. As flagged this morning, Starmer then pledges to \u201clook at regulation\u201d, and remove rules that are holding back investment. The PM says: \u201cWhere it is stopping us building the homes, the data centres, the warehouses, grid connectors, roads, trainlines, you name it\u2026. then mark my words, we will get rid of it. He cites the example of the East Anglia Two windfarm, where regulators demanded 4,000 documents (not simply pages) when assessing the proposal\u2026. Once it was finally signed off, it was held up by other two years by a judicial review. That will deter investors from the UK, Starmer says, adding: It\u2019s time to upgrade the regulators\u2019 regime, and make it fit for the modern age. Starmer says the government will \u201cmarch\u201d through the regulators, and makes sure they take growth as seriously as the investors in the room today. The door is open for business leaders to voice concerns to Starmer and his team, the PM adds. He concludes: It\u2019s time to back Britain. Keir Starmer then tells international investors they shouldn\u2019t be worried about Labour\u2019s employment rights bill, introduced last week. Let me be clear, they are \u201cpro-growth\u201d, Starmer insists. Workers with more security at work, with higher wages, is a better growth model for this country, he points out, and will bring much-needed dynamism to the economy. Starmer then runs through four crucial areas for his plan (admitting that CEOs prefer lists of three, not four) 1) Stability. He says there is a \u2018golden opportunity\u2019 to end the era of chop and change, citing his large majority won in July. 2) Strategy. Building a \u2018more strategic architecture\u2019 for growth, including the creation of a national wealth fund and Great British Energy, and the recent pledge to fund carbon capture and storage projects. Starmer says his government is not in the business of picking individual winners, but ti does want to build on its strengths. Verging into sporting metaphors, he says he wants to make UK businesses match-fit, by: Mowing the grass on the pitch, making sure the changing rooms are clear and comfortable, the training ground is good. The new industrial strategy is fundamental to the plan, Starmer says. 3) Britain\u2019s global standing. Starmer says \u201cWe\u2019re determined to repair Britain\u2019s brand as an open, outward-looking, trading nation\u201d, so people know it\u2019s a stable, trusted, rule-abiding partner. Starmer says that somehow, in \u201cthe circus after Brexit\u201d, the last government \u201cneedlessly insulted our closest allies\u201d. There were also a few \u201cchoice Anglo-Saxon phrases for businesses\u201d, Starmer reminds his audience (a reference to Boris Johnson\u2019s notorious \u201cfuck business\u201d retort to employer concerns about a hard Brexit). 4) Regulation. Starmer says he doesn\u2019t see it as good or bad, that\u2019s \u201csimplistic\u201d. He points out that the tragedy at Grenfell Tower showed the importance of regulations. But he accuses the previous government of hiding behind regulators, and deferring decisions to them because it was weak or indecisive, or just not committed to growth. Starmer then points out that the UK has problems too. The public sectors need urgent care, while the public finances need the \u2018tough love\u2019 of prudence (chanelling Gordon Brown there). We will fix the public services and stabilise the economy, quickly, he promises. We don\u2019t want any of the problems associated with our inheritance misting up the shop window of Britain. Starmer turns to the issue of stability, saying \u201cIt\u2019s not just that stability leads to growth, though we all recognise that. It\u2019s also that growth leads to stability. Growth leads to a country that\u2019s better equipped to come together and get its future back. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s always been so critical to my political project. The key ingredient of that great moderation that we became accustomed to before the financial crash, but which together, in partnership, we have to earn again. Everyone invited to the summit is here for that reason, Starmer says Private sector investment is the way we rebuild this country and pay our way in the future. This is a great moment to back Britain, he insists \u2013 to back England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. He cites the \u201camazing\u201d education sector, the largest tech sector in Europe, a leading position in ley sectors such as artificial intelligence, clean energy, the creative industries. A legal system that sets high standards around the globe, and a geographical location that means we can speak to colleagues in the Americas and in Asia in the same day. Starmer continues, saying that we live in an age where political fires rage across the world \u2013 conflict, insecurity, and \u201ca populist mood\u201d that opposes the open values that \u201cmany of us\u201d at the investment summit hold dear. And yet, we also live in an \u201cage of great possibility\u201d, he argues, with businesses making investments, in areas such as digital technology, clean energy, medicine, life sciences. Each have the potential to change how we live, and to improve the lives of working people, the PM says. Starmer then argues that you can \u201cstops a country turning in on itself\u201d if you provide the benefits of growth to people., saying: In times like this, economic growth is vital \u2013 as it always been \u2013 if we\u2019re to steer our way through a great period of insecurity and change and onto calmer waters. The shared ambition at today\u2019s investment summit is growth, Keir Starmer says. Business leaders have to grow their business, while the PM has to grow the country. The \u201cshared endeavour\u201d of prosperity is what binds investors and the government together, he insisted. Starmer says he\u2019s determined that the UK becomes the highest growing economy in the G7 \u2013 that\u2019s the way to deliver the change he has promised. Sir Keir Starmer now takes the stage at the Investment Summit. He says it\u2019s fantastic to see so many attendees at the new government\u2019s first summit. Some investors have flown a long way to come to the Guildhall, the PM says, to share the \u201cprecious gift\u201d of your time. He tells investors that he briefly pursued his education on the flute at the nearby Guildhall School of Music, with \u201clong hair and very flared jeans\u201d. Starmer says all photographic evidence has been destroyed (if you know better, get in touch!). Jonathan Reynolds wraps up by telling investors that Britain is making a \u201cworld-beating offer\u201d for those who make the UK their investment destination of choice. He hopes they will leave \u201cinspired\u201d, and confident that the UK has a government that wants them to be at the forefront of our new, pro-innovation, pro-business, pro-wealth creation economy. Here\u2019s a live feed of the key speeches at today\u2019s International Investment Summit: Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds adds that the UK government is guided by four key principles: Building long-term stability renewing its commitment to free and fair trade cutting costs for investors working in partnership with business and trade unions He tells the investment summit: Our industrial strategy will create long-term, sustainable, inclusive and secure growth. The strategy will focus on eight areas, Reynolds adds: advanced manufacturing; clean energy industries, creative industries; defence; digital and technologies; financial services; life sciences; and professional and business services. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds is opening today\u2019s International Investment Summit at Guildhall. Reynolds declares that the UK is \u201cback\u201d, \u201cback at the global table\u201d, and open for business. The UK has so much potential, Reynolds says, citing the open economy, legal protections, incentives for innovation, and a skilled workforce. Naomi Smith, chief executive of campaign group Best for Britain, hopes that Keir Starmer\u2019s war on bureaucracy will address some of the hurdles created by Brexit, saying: \u201cCutting red tape must include the mountain that Brexit has created for almost every part of the UK economy but particularly SMEs, touring performers and export/import businesses. \u201cBeneficial alignment with our largest market in areas like food standards and carbon taxes will reduce costs for businesses and consumers, give confidence to investors and boost growth.\u201d Major CEOs and investors arriving at Guildhall are being whisked through the front door, with umbrella carriers protecting them from the London weather (it\u2019s pretty wet today, again). Journalists, though, are being let in through the loading bay entrance, points out The Sun\u2019s Ashley Armstrong: Logistics giant DP World has confirmed that it will invest \u00a31bn to expand its London Gateway container port, after the row with transport secretary Louise Haigh was defused by Downing Street. The expansion, announced at today\u2019s investment summit, will turn London Gateway, on the banks of the Thames in Essex, into Britain\u2019s \u201clargest container port within five years\u201d, DP World says. The plan is to build two new shipping berths, taking the total to six berths, all large enough for the world\u2019s biggest container ships. This will expand the quayside at London Gateway to more than 2.5km in length. The site will also get a second rail terminal added to handle the expected increase in containerised trade. The pledge follows the frantic effort by ministers and diplomats to repair relations with DP World, after Haigh called its P&amp;O Ferries division a \u201crogue operator\u201d when announcing new workers\u2019 protections this week. DP World say the expansion will create a further 400 permanent new jobs, on top of the 1,20 workers already employed at the former oil refinery. It points out, though, that the expansion is subject to planning approval and regulatory requirements, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chairman and chief executive officer at DP World, says: \u201cDP World London Gateway will help make Britain\u2019s trade flow in the future by connecting domestic exporters with global markets and delivering vital supply chain resilience for the whole economy. I am proud of this major investment which underlines DP World\u2019s long-term commitment to the UK.\u201d Photos of a meeting at the investment summit have landed. They show global co-chief investment officer of Blackstone Lionel Assant, and Ruth Porat, the chief investment officer of Google, with Porat alongside Keir Starmer: Q: Most investors will tell you, in private, that the biggest barrier for the UK is being outside the single market. Wouldn\u2019t rejoining the single market be the brave thing to do? Peter Kyle argues that the UK and Europe have to look to the future, and explore their potential as two seperate territories. There are lots of opportunities, and barriers, that weren\u2019t around in 2016, Kyle says, adding: We\u2019re looking at a trade deal that explores all the opportunities going forward. Kyle then explains how he visited Seattle in February this year, pitching Labour\u2019s plans to the head of Amazon Web Services. That led to AWS\u2019s announcement of \u00a38bn investment in Britain last month, he says: And on Elon Musk\u2019s non-appearance at the summit, Kyle doesn\u2019t explicitely say whether the Tesla/SpaceX chief was ever invited or not, before the row over his critical tweets this summer. Kyle says the government would \u201clove to engage\u201d with Musk, when he has an open investment programme to compete for. Q: Won\u2019t some traditional Labour supporters be a little bit unnerved by the government speaking the language of the Tories \u2013 slashing red tape, getting rid of bureaucracy, getting into bed with big business? Kyle argues everyone should celebrate that if you create a new innovation in this country it will create wealth and jobs. Q: Why did the PM tick off one of his own ministers [transport secretary Louise Haigh] for a Number 10-approved press release [which labelled P&amp;O a \u201crogue employer\u201d] Kyle points out that the Today Programme, and everyone else, criticised what P&amp;O did in 2022 [it sacked its staff without notice, and replaced them with cheaper agency workers]. P&amp;O and its owner DP World have now signed up to the government\u2019s new workers\u2019 rights legislation, he says, echoing his earlier point that DP World and the UK have both turned a corner. Q: Are you so keen at the top of the Labour Party to get close to big business that you\u2019ll ditch your own cabinet ministers\u2019 words? Kyle says the government is keen to show you can raise standards and attract innovation \u2013 he argues that this is happening, with DP World sticking to its \u00a31bn investment plan (which looked shaky last week). Q: The boss of [US pharmaceuticals firm] Eli Lily has argued that a small market, such as the UK, must be willing to regulate less than the EU to make it attractive for investors to come here. Is that the plan? Kyle argues that the key is to regulate \u201csmartly\u201d and \u201ccreatively\u201d, going back to his point about wanting to help companies get through the regulatory process without cutting corners\u2026. Peter Kyle is now on the Today programme, for a pre-investment summit grilling, where he denies that Keir Starmer\u2019s war on red tape will lead to cutting corners. Q: What bureaucracy will the government \u2018rip out\u2019\u2019? Kyle gives the example of the Regulatory Innovation Office which he announced last week. That Office takes the learnings from Covid vaccine taskforce, to speed up deployment of innovations faster in normal times, Kyle says. He explains that currently, it can take up to three years for a new product to get through the regulatory minefield, before it can be made available. Kyle adds: Not cutting corners or lowering standards, but making sure that the government takes on some of the burden of compliance, so that our nation can benefit. Q: What if the NHS wants to hold the price of an innovative drug down, or doesn\u2019t want to deploy a new development, anti-obesity drugs for example. Are you willing to get rid of that red tape in order to allow big US pharma giants to push their drugs into the health service quicker? \u201cWe are,\u201d Kyle replies. He points out that for the first time ever, health secretary Wes Streeting has taken responsibility for spreading innovation through the NHS. More highlights from Peter Kyle\u2019s morning media round: Peter Kyle has also argued that P&amp;O and the UK have both \u201cturned a corner\u201d, following the row between transport minister Louise Haigh and parent company DP World. Asked by Times Radio about the clash, the technology and innovation secretary argued that both sides were \u2018looking to the future\u2019: \u201cLike your listeners, I was angry with the way P&amp;O acted back then. \u201cBut, actually, P&amp;O has changed because last week we introduced workers\u2019 rights legislation which would stop that kind of thing happening again and P&amp;O were right there, right behind it. \u201cDP World, their parent company, were right behind it. They will be here today and they are continuing their \u00a31bn investment. \u201cThat means we\u2019ve all turned a corner. They\u2019ve turned a corner, our country has turned a corner and we are looking to the future.\u201d Haigh\u2019s criticism of P&amp;O was well-founded, though. After sacking 800 workers in 2022, the ferry operator paid some crew members less than half the UK minimum wage, the Guardian reported in March this year. Some agency workers received as little as \u00a34.87 an hour. Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, will not be at today\u2019s summit. It emerged last month that Musk would not be invited, following his controversial social media posts during last month\u2019s riots. Peter Kyle, the UK\u2019s Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, has defended Musk\u2019s non-appearance. He told Sky News this morning that Elon Musk had not attended any investment summits under the previous government either. Q: So it\u2019s not because he calls the prime minister \u2018two-tier Keir\u2019? Kyle denies it, saying: Absolutely not. Our PM puts country first, party second, he\u2019s said that numerous times. Kyle says the summit is focused on companies who are already actively looking to make investment around the world, engaging with them and getting them here. He says \u00a340tn of global assets are represented in London, looking for places to invest their money; the government wants to showcase the country and win investment. The first ministers from the British nations are all expected to attend the investment summit, as well as many regional mayors. Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will be there, and says: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be attending the International Investment Summit. With a new government, we are reclaiming Britain\u2019s reputation as a magnet for global investment - bringing with it new technology, new ways of thinking and, crucially, new jobs across our country, meaning higher living standards. \u201cLondon and the UK are open for business, trade and investment. I will continue working with the Government to forge new partnerships, reset relationships and seize the opportunity to secure long-term investment so that we can build a better London for everyone and deliver the change Britain needs.\u201d The former England football manager and keen Labour supporter Gareth Southgate is expected at the investment summit today. Southgate will join actor and director Adjoa Andoh, Lucian Grainge, the chief executive of Universal Music Group, the company behind artists including Lady Gaga and Lana Del Rey, and an executive from Netflix on a panel exploring investment opportunities in the UK\u2019s creative scene. More here: Labour have received a boost ahead of today\u2019s investment summit, with 14 top business leaders declaring that Britain has a \u201cvery real opportunity\u201d to grow its economy. Senior executives from some of the world\u2019s largest investors, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Aviva, Fidelity and Legal and General, have signed a letter declaring they are \u201coptimistic\u201d about Britain\u2019s economic future. They cite Britain\u2019s traditional strengths \u2013 education, the legal system, the City and the English language \u2013 before pointing out that \u201cgreater stability\u201d makes the country even more attractive to invest in. The letter says: Sir, As global investors, we believe that there is a very real opportunity for the UK to grow its economy by attracting international investment. Britain\u2019s educational establishments, legal system, financial services sector and language form the bedrock of a strong investment proposition. Technological developments, advances in the energy system and greater freedom in capital flows have further enhanced Britain\u2019s position. With greater stability, its attractiveness is increased even further. We are optimistic about the future of the economy, and believe it is time to invest in Britain. It\u2019s been signed by: Amanda Blanc, Aviva; Anne Richards, Fidelity International; Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, Legal and General; Beatriz Martin Jimenez, UBS; Bernard Mensah, Bank of America; Bill McDermott, ServiceNow; Cath Bowtell, IFM Investors; David M Solomon, Goldman Sachs; Dr Markus Krebber, RWE AG; Filippo Gori, JP Morgan; Jonathan D Gray, Blackstone; Philipp Freise, KKR; Steve Rigby, Rigby Group; and Viswas Raghavan, Citi. Their point about \u2018stability\u2019 will be welcomed by Starmer, who is expected to argue today that stability leads to growth, and that growth leads to stability. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Sir Keir Starmer will pledge today to scrap regulation that holds back company investment, as the UK welcomes major business leaders and investors to the new government\u2019s first international investment summit. Today\u2019s summit will see Labour pitching the UK as a place where economic stability has been restored, creating the right conditions for growth and investment. Starmer will address CEOs and investors at London\u2019s Guildhall this morning, and vow to do \u201ceverything in my power to galvanise growth\u201d. He\u2019ll pledge to end the \u201cchop and change\u201d that has riddled Britain in recent years, deterring investment. And on the issue of regulation, the PM is expected to promise to look at rules that \u201cneedlessly\u201d hold back the investment the country needs, by saying: \u201cWhere it is stopping us building the homes, the data centres, warehouses, grid connectors, roads, trainlines, you name it then mark my words \u2013 we will get rid of it. \u201cWe will rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment and we will make sure that every regulator in this country take growth as seriously as this room does.\u201d One person\u2019s needless red tape is another\u2019s vital standards, though, and there are fears that cutting regulation could be unsafe. One union source has likened Starmer\u2019s words to former PM David Cameron\u2019s \u201cbonfire of red tape\u201d, telling us: \u201cThe coalition also had a massive shake-up of red tape, and ended up taking out loads of safety regulations.\u201d About 200 senior executives are signed up to participate in the summit, as well as a string of cabinet ministers, including Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The government\u2019s argues that securing new investment from major companies will help it deliver economic growth, create jobs, lift living standards, and make communities and families across the country better off. It says ministers set to unveil billions worth of major investment deals in AI, life sciences and infrastructure. According to the Financial Times, Starmer will unveil commitments from the private sector to invest more than \u00a350bn into the economy. Last week, the leaders of the world\u2019s biggest green energy companies got the ball rolling by pledging more than \u00a324bn of new private investment. The build-up to the summit was marred, though, by the row with Dubai-based ports company DP World, after Louise Haigh, transport secretary, called its P&amp;O Ferries division a \u201crogue operator\u201d due to its sacking of 800 employees without notice in 2022. The government rowed back, after DP World threatened to pause a \u00a31bn investment in its London Gateway port, with business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Starmer placating the company, so the company\u2019s executives should now be attending. After Starmer gives his speech, he\u2019ll hold a conversation with the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, \u201cmoderated\u201d by Emma Walmsley, the chief executive of pharmaceutical firm GSK. Other panels will involve the chief investment officer of Google owner Alphabet, the chair of investment firm BlackRock, Larry Fink, and Amanda Blanc, the boss of insurance group Aviva.

      "bodyText": "Losses at the Evening Standard have topped \u00a3100m over the past seven years, highlighting the financial pressure on the title, which last month stopped daily publishing in the capital after almost 200 years. The Evening Standard, which has rebranded as the London Standard in a move to become a digital-first publication supported by a weekly print edition, reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a320.6m in the year to 1 October 2023. The latest annual loss, up from \u00a316.4m in 2022, means the title has recorded total losses of \u00a3105.1m over the past seven years. The last time the Standard was in the black was 2016, when it made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3517,000.

Pre-tax profits fell to \u00a3746,000 in the year to 30 September 2023, compared with \u00a32.99m in 2022. Revenues almost halved from \u00a37.2m to \u00a34.1m. \u201cThe company\u2019s historical profitability was dependent on a key custom relationship which expired at the end of 2022,\u201d the company said. \u201cTherefore, there is a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the company\u2019s ability to remain a going concern. It is anticipated that in the event that further funding is required, the major shareholder will continue to financially support the company.\u201d London Live said that as at the end of September last year, it had net liabilities of \u00a31.78m.",

      "bodyText": "The owner of the Vauxhall, Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot brands has said a decision will be made on the future of its UK plants \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d, amid a row over government electric vehicle quotas. Carlos Tavares, the outgoing chief executive of Stellantis, has said the company is nearing a decision on the future of Ellesmere Port and Luton. The company said in June that it could be forced to close the plants if government rules were not relaxed. Tavares said Stellantis would make a \u201ccorrection\u201d to its UK business in the coming weeks in response to the damage the government\u2019s zero-emissions vehicle mandate had done to profitability. Carmakers have been ramping up pressure for government subsidies for EV sales amid a race to comply with the mandate. The initiative is aimed at managing the phase-out of new petrol and diesel car sales, and the switch to EVs, over the next six years. \u201cWe are now reaching a point where we have to make a decision, and that will happen in the next few weeks,\u201d he said. Tavares said the company had discussed with officials for several months how the UK government could \u201chelp to stimulate demand\u201d, Bloomberg reported. Tavares also said the EU\u2019s decision to slap extra tariffs on Chinese EVs would speed up car giants\u2019 plant closures in Europe as Chinese and European motoring bosses went head to head at the Paris motor show. With countries including Hungary and Spain vying to attract Chinese investment to make Chinese vehicles locally, Tavares said the countries that would suffer most from the new duties were the traditional powerhouses of the car sector including Germany, France and Italy. Tariffs were a \u201cgood communication tool\u201d but had side effects, argued the boss of the car group, which also owns the Fiat, Jeep and Chrysler brands. He said putting levies on imported cars would encourage China to set up its own factories on the continent, putting existing car companies at risk. \u201cThe way to avoid custom duties [by China] is to build in Europe,\u201d Tavares said. \u201cYou are accelerating the need to shut down plants\u201d elsewhere in Europe, he added, underlining another risk to traditional carmakers in Germany, Italy and elsewhere. Tavares cited the case of the Chinese EV giant BYD, which is building its first European assembly plant in Hungary. \u201cChinese carmakers will not go to Germany or France or Italy to build their cars, because they would have cost disadvantages there, starting from energy costs,\u201d he said. The EU is proposing extra tariffs of up to 35% on Chinese EVs despite opposition from states including Germany which fears its joint ventures in China will be hit. In retaliation, China imposed its own tariffs on EU brandy hitting French companies such as R\u00e9my Cointreau and Hennessy. Both sides continue to talk but sources say there is little chance of a settlement before the deadline of 30 October for China to come back with a solution. The BYD vice-president, Stella Li, used the Paris car show to criticise the EU tariffs, but at the same time said the company planned to make almost all the cars it sells in Europe on the continent. Such a move would avoid tariffs but also spell danger for rivals such as troubled Volkswagen. \u201cPoliticians should stay away from tariffs, adding more cost to auto manufacturing and confusing the auto industry,\u201d said Li. Speaking alongside the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Berlin, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expressed hope of reaching an agreement by the end of October. If no agreement is struck by 30 October then tariffs can be collected from 31 October. After that, there is still potential for a pause, manufacturer by manufacturer or sector-wide, something China is pushing for. Both Tavares and Martin Sander, the sales chief of Volkswagen passenger cars said prolonging the transition to EVs was dangerous. \u201cMaking a transition for longer is a big trap,\u201d Tavares told the Financial Times. \u201cWhen you make a longer transition, in fact, you don\u2019t replace the old world by the new one. You add up the new world to the old.\u201d The next five to 10 years are considered make or break for some of Europe\u2019s biggest car manufacturers, with the EU already trying to limit the damage from competition from China with the proposed imposition of tariffs in November of up to 45% on EV imports. Several manufacturers have already scrapped their original plans to phase out the traditional internal combustion engine as they battle to meet a 2035 ban on new vehicles equipped with one.",

Le Pen is one of 27 members and employees of the party then known as the National Front (FN) who are on trial in Paris for allegedly using EU money to finance domestic political activities between 2006 and 2016. The European parliament says the money should have been used on EU staff salaries and has estimated the allegedly embezzled funds at about \u20ac7m.

Le Pen is on trial alongside her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the FN; her sister Yann Le Pen; Louis Aliot, the RN vice-president and mayor of Perpignan, and two RN MPs, Julien Odoul and Timoth\u00e9e Houssin. Jean-Marie Le Pen, 96, will not be present at the trial due to ill health. The allegations about fake jobs emerged in January 2014 when the European Anti-Fraud Office (Olaf) received an anonymous tipoff about possible fraud and \u201cfictitious employment\u201d. Olaf first investigated Thierry L\u00e9gier, Marine Le Pen\u2019s bodyguard, and Catherine Griset, her friend and chief of staff, who had been given contracts as European parliamentary assistants.

The man, who has yet to be named by police, fell while climbing the Castilla-La Mancha Bridge in the central city of Talavera de la Reina, the local mayor\u2019s office said in a statement on Sunday. Macarena Mu\u00f1oz, the city\u2019s councillor for citizen safety, said the man was accompanied by a 24-year-old British national and the pair had travelled to the structure to \u201ccreate content\u201d for social media, Sky News reported. Mu\u00f1oz added: \u201cWe have been able to find out, they had come to Talavera to climb the bridge and create content for social networks, which has resulted in this unfortunate and sad outcome.\u201d She said climbing the bridge was \u201ctotally prohibited\u201d and \u201ccannot be done under any circumstances\u201d, which the council had \u201creiterated on many occasions\u201d. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: \u201cWe are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Spain, and are in contact with the local authorities.\u201d The Castilla-La Mancha, the tallest cable-stayed bridge in Spain since its opening in 2011, stands over the Tagus River. The 192-metre-high (630ft) structure consists of a main concrete pylon with multiple cables coming from the centre in a triangular shape.",

      "bodyText": "Three US-based professors, including two UK-born academics, have been awarded this year\u2019s Nobel prize in economics, for showing how the political and economic systems introduced by colonisers can determine whether a country is rich or poor today. The explanation put forward by Turkish-American Daron Acemo\u011flu, Sheffield-born Simon Johnson and Briton James A Robinson suggests that inclusive institutions set up for the long-term benefit of European migrants ended up resulting in more prosperous societies in the long term. However, they found that in countries where the aim was to exploit the Indigenous population and extract resources for the colonisers\u2019 benefit, the impact has been detrimental, and resulted in far poorer societies, leaving some countries trapped in low economic growth cycles. \u201cThe laureates demonstrated that this led to a reversal of fortune. The places that were, relatively speaking, the richest at their time of colonisation are now among the poorest,\u201d the Nobel prize announcement said. \u201cThis is an important reason for why former colonies that were once rich are now poor, and vice versa,\u201d it added. \u201cThis reversal of relative prosperity is historically unique.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has come under pressure from two influential thinktanks to raise taxes on the industry, as she pulls every available lever to plug a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the nation\u2019s finances. Treasury officials working on Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years, which will be announced on 30 October, are understood to be open to raising the amount of duty paid by an industry that takes in \u00a311bn a year from British punters.

      "body": "<p>Lily Ebert, who has died aged 100, was one of the last survivors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. She dedicated the final decades of her life to bearing witness to the experience of Holocaust victims.</p> <p>She survived transportation to the camp where her mother, Nina, a younger sister Berta and brother Bela did not. They were singled out by the Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele, the notorious \u201cangel of death\u201d, on the arrival of the train bringing them from Hungary. </p> <p>Gesturing to the left with his stick, Mengele consigned half the family to the gas chambers, and Lily and her two sisters, Ren\u00e9 and Piri, to the right, to be put to work. Seeing smoke rising later from the crematorium chimney and thinking it was a factory, Lily was told by another inmate: \u201cThey are burning your families there. Your parents, your sisters, your brothers. They\u2019re burning them.\u201d</p> <p>Her experience led decades later to talks to schools and colleges, to conferences, interviews and to collaborating with government ministries. When she was 96, she published a bestselling memoir, co-written with her great-grandson Dov Forman, called Lily\u2019s Promise: How I survived Auschwitz and Found the Strength to Live. With Dov, again, she created a TikTok account, which gained 2&nbsp;million followers. </p> <p>She was born Livia Engelman, the eldest of six children of Ahron, a textile shop owner, and Nina (nee Bresnitz), in Bonyh\u00e1d in south-western Hungary, a town divided between its German, Orthodox and Jewish inhabitants, with the latter making up 14% of the population. </p> <p>Her father died when she was 18, and two years later, in March 1944, when German troops invaded the country, she and the rest of the family were rounded up with the town\u2019s Jews. Within weeks they were all loaded on to cattle trucks for the five-day rail journey to Auschwitz, \u201clocked in with corpses, a few more each day\u201d, she recalled.</p> <p>Her brother Imre had carved out a hollow in the heel of their mother\u2019s shoe and hidden in it the family jewellery, including a tiny pendant of a golden angel that Lily had been given when she was five. In the late stages of the journey she and her mother swapped shoes. The hidden jewellery was missed by the Nazis and Lily retained the pendant. It was, she said, \u201cthe only gold to enter and leave Auschwitz with its original owner\u201d.</p> <p>The three sisters worked as seamstresses at the camp, during which time Lily nearly died of scarlet fever, before being moved four months later to another camp, Altenburg, part of Buchenwald, near Weimar. There they worked in a munitions factory, Lily managing to pass defective bullets with usable ones in her job as a supervisor. When her mother\u2019s shoes disintegrated she hid the pendant in a piece of bread, which she kept under her armpit. For the rest of her life she always carried a morsel of bread as a reminder of her wartime deprivation.</p>    <p>In April 1945 the women at the factory were forced to march from the camp without food, water, sleep or shoes, with those who lagged behind summarily shot. On the third day the guards disappeared as American tanks approached. By then, Ebert said, they were \u201cunrecognisable as human beings, emaciated creatures, filthy, hollow-eyed, half-crazed with relief and disbelief\u201d. They were originally moved back to Buchenwald \u2013 staying in the guard quarters this time \u2013 and then to Switzerland for rehabilitation.</p> <p>The sisters emigrated to Israel in June 1946, living first at a kibbutz and then near Tel Aviv. In 1948 Lily married a Hungarian businessman, Shmuel Ebert, and the couple had three children, Esti, Bilha and Roni.</p> <p> After the Hungarian uprising in 1956 the family was reunited with Imre, who had also survived the Holocaust only to be trapped after the Communist takeover. In 1967 Lily and Shmuel moved to Golders Green, north London; he died in 1984. </p> <p>Lily did not speak of her experiences until the 1990s, after joining a survivors\u2019 support group. In 1992 she first addressed a Holocaust education conference and later helped found a survivors\u2019 centre in Golders Green. The book, written with the then 16-year-old Dov, followed in 2021. \u201cI realised that I wanted to record what had happened to me in Auschwitz-Birkenau. I wanted my children to know eventually and their children and their children\u2019s children.\u201d</p> <p>She was awarded a British Empire Medal, was made a Knight\u2019s Cross of the Order of Merit in Hungary, and an MBE last year. </p> <p>Her portrait and those of six other survivors are in the Royal Collection. When she met the then Prince Charles at the exhibition opening at the Queen\u2019s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, in 2022, she told him: \u201cMeeting you, it is for everyone who lost their lives.\u201d He replied: \u201cBut it is a greater privilege for me.\u201d</p> <p>After her death, the King \u2013 who is patron of the <a href=\"https://www.hmd.org.uk/\">Holocaust Memorial Trust</a> \u2013 said of Lily: \u201cI am so proud that she found a home in Britain where she continued to tell the world of the atrocities she had witnessed, as a reminder for our generation \u2013 and for future generations \u2013 of the depths of depravity to which humankind can fall, when reason, compassion and truth are abandoned.\u201d</p> <p>She returned to visit the camp with Esti in 1988 and again with three grandchildren in 1996. She wrote: \u201cThe satisfaction of walking freely into Auschwitz and walking freely out again, through those gates of hell, made me stronger.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was brought to Auschwitz in 1944 they told me there was no way out, only through the chimney. \u2018This was not your plan,\u2019 I kept thinking. \u2018Look at me: I am back. You wanted to kill me and yet I am here again. You murderers aren\u2019t here any more, but I am \u2026 I have kept the promise I made myself in the camp. I have told the world what happened.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She is survived by Piri, two of her three children, 10 grandchildren, 38 great-grandchildren and a great-great grandchild.</p> <p>\u2022 Lily Ebert, Holocaust survivor, writer and educator, born 29 December 1923; died 9 October 2024</p>",

When she met the then Prince Charles at the exhibition opening at the Queen\u2019s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, in 2022, she told him: \u201cMeeting you, it is for everyone who lost their lives.\u201d He replied: \u201cBut it is a greater privilege for me.\u201d After her death, the King \u2013 who is patron of the Holocaust Memorial Trust \u2013 said of Lily: \u201cI am so proud that she found a home in Britain where she continued to tell the world of the atrocities she had witnessed, as a reminder for our generation \u2013 and for future generations \u2013 of the depths of depravity to which humankind can fall, when reason, compassion and truth are abandoned.\u201d She returned to visit the camp with Esti in 1988 and again with three grandchildren in 1996. She wrote: \u201cThe satisfaction of walking freely into Auschwitz and walking freely out again, through those gates of hell, made me stronger. \u201cWhen I was brought to Auschwitz in 1944 they told me there was no way out, only through the chimney. \u2018This was not your plan,\u2019 I kept thinking. \u2018Look at me: I am back. You wanted to kill me and yet I am here again. You murderers aren\u2019t here any more, but I am \u2026 I have kept the promise I made myself in the camp. I have told the world what happened.\u2019\u201d She is survived by Piri, two of her three children, 10 grandchildren, 38 great-grandchildren and a great-great grandchild. \u2022 Lily Ebert, Holocaust survivor, writer and educator, born 29 December 1923; died 9 October 2024",

But I lost it.\u201d</p> <p>Sara\u2019s father, Urfan Sharif, 42, her stepmother, Beinash Batool, 30, and her uncle Faisal Malik, 29, are accused of killing her on 8 August. The defendants, who lived together, are said to have carried out \u201ca campaign of abuse\u201d, with Sara being subjected to \u201crepeated serious violence over a significant period of time\u201d.</p> <p>Opening the case at the Old Bailey on Monday, the prosecutor, William Emlyn Jones KC, said the postmortem examination of Sara\u2019s body revealed a \u201cterrible truth\u201d.</p>    <p>He said: \u201cWhen Urfan Sharif said in that call: \u2018I beat her up,\u2019 he came nowhere near to describing the extent of the violence and physical abuse that Sara had suffered, not just at the time of her death but repeatedly, over time. She had been the victim of serious violent assault and physical abuse for weeks and weeks, at least.</p> <p>\u201cThe doctors found dozens of separate injuries, externally and internally, when they examined Sara\u2019s body. They found she had suffered extensive bruising, burns, broken bones, old and new. So no, Sara had not just been beaten up.</p> <p>\u201cHer treatment, certainly in the last few weeks of her life, had been appalling, it had been brutal. And throughout, these three defendants were the adults living in the house where Sara had lived, where she had suffered and where she had died.\u201d</p> <p>The court heard that the defendants fled to Pakistan on 9 August and Sharif, a taxi driver, called police an hour after landing in Islamabad the following day, at 2.47am UK time.

      "bodyText": "The father of the 10-year-old schoolgirl Sara Sharif killed her before fleeing to Pakistan and calling police to say he \u201cbeat her up too much\u201d as a punishment for being naughty, a court has heard. Sara\u2019s body was discovered at the family home in Woking, Surrey, on 10 August last year alongside a handwritten note from her father, saying: \u201cI swear to God that my intention was not to kill her. But I lost it.\u201d Sara\u2019s father, Urfan Sharif, 42, her stepmother, Beinash Batool, 30, and her uncle Faisal Malik, 29, are accused of killing her on 8 August. The defendants, who lived together, are said to have carried out \u201ca campaign of abuse\u201d, with Sara being subjected to \u201crepeated serious violence over a significant period of time\u201d. Opening the case at the Old Bailey on Monday, the prosecutor, William Emlyn Jones KC, said the postmortem examination of Sara\u2019s body revealed a \u201cterrible truth\u201d. He said: \u201cWhen Urfan Sharif said in that call: \u2018I beat her up,\u2019 he came nowhere near to describing the extent of the violence and physical abuse that Sara had suffered, not just at the time of her death but repeatedly, over time. She had been the victim of serious violent assault and physical abuse for weeks and weeks, at least. \u201cThe doctors found dozens of separate injuries, externally and internally, when they examined Sara\u2019s body. They found she had suffered extensive bruising, burns, broken bones, old and new. So no, Sara had not just been beaten up. \u201cHer treatment, certainly in the last few weeks of her life, had been appalling, it had been brutal. And throughout, these three defendants were the adults living in the house where Sara had lived, where she had suffered and where she had died.\u201d The court heard that the defendants fled to Pakistan on 9 August and Sharif, a taxi driver, called police an hour after landing in Islamabad the following day, at 2.47am UK time. A recording of the eight-and-a-half-minute 999 call was played to jurors, in which a weeping Sharif told the operator: \u201cI legally punished my daughter, and she died \u2026 I killed my daughter. I killed my daughter.\u201d A little later, when asked for more detail, Sharif added: \u201cShe was naughty over the last three, four weeks and I was giving her punishment to sort her out. I did something and she died.\u201d He said he was a \u201ccruel father\u201d and had fled home in a \u201cpanic\u201d but refused to say where he was. Police found Sara\u2019s body under a pink sheet on a bottom bunk bed at the family\u2019s clean and tidy home after the 999 call. Next to her body was a note saying: \u201cIt\u2019s me Urfan Sharif who killed my daughter by beating. I\u2019m running away because I am scared.\u201d A postmortem examination found that Sara had \u201can awful constellation of injuries\u201d, including fractures that were evidence of \u201cmultiple episodes of blunt force trauma inflicted over several weeks\u201d. Doctors concluded there had been incidents of \u201cmanual strangulation\u201d and \u201cother, perhaps even more disturbing\u201d injuries, including probable human bite marks to Sara\u2019s arm and inner thigh. The prosecutor said dental records provided by Sharif and Malik indicated they were not responsible for the marks, while Batool had refused to provide an impression. The prosecutor said the experts concluded Sara had been burned by a hot iron and had been tied up and restrained, perhaps for lengthy periods. He added that matching injuries to Sara\u2019s ankles suggested \u201chot liquid encountered both feet while they were close together\u201d. The prosecution alleges it is \u201cinconceivable\u201d that any of the defendants could have carried out the \u201ccampaign of abuse\u201d on their own and that they are all responsible for Sara\u2019s death. \u201cNone of them ever reported Sara\u2019s abuse to any outside agency, who could have intervened. Sara\u2019s medical records tell us that none of the injuries she received was ever reported or shown to a doctor, let alone treated, nor shown to staff at her school. No outside help was called,\u201d the prosecutor said. The court also heard that Batool made a \u201ccalm\u201d call to a travel agent inquiring about flights to Pakistan on the evening of 8 August 2023 as Sara lay dead in the house. The jury was played a recording of the phone call in which Batool asks about flights to Islamabad for the entire family \u2013 apart from Sara. \u201cWhat is entirely obvious is that just as no medical help had ever been sought for Sara in life, so it was that now there seems to have been no question of a call to 999 from the house, to seek emergency care in her dying moments, nor to report her death while those responsible were still on the premises. Their flight to Pakistan was their priority,\u201d the prosecutor said. The defendants have pleaded not guilty to murder and to causing or allowing the death of a child between 16 December 2022 and 9 August 2023. The court heard that there was \u201ca big old conflict brewing between these defendants\u201d with each seeking to deflect the blame on to one or both of the others. Sharif has claimed that his wife, Batool, was responsible and that his apparent confession was to protect \u201cthe true guilty party\u201d. Batool in turn has accused Sharif, describing her husband as \u201ca violent disciplinarian who regularly assaulted Sara\u201d. Malik has denied responsibility, claiming he was \u201centirely and blissfully unaware of any abuse or assault of Sara by anyone at any time\u201d, the prosecutor said. The trial before the judge Mr Justice Cavanagh is expected to go on until 13 December. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2024 because Faisal Malik is 29, not 28 as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "Earlier today I set the following two puzzles. Here they are again with solutions. The first is by Randall Munroe, cartoonist of the webcomic xkcd and author of the bestselling book What If? 1. All Together Now Find all the possible ways, if any exist, to fill in the three blanks to make all three statements true. Solution There are three ways, some more interesting than others! Let the blanks be represented by x, y and z. If we are only considering the numbers in the blanks \u2013 there is only one solution x = y = z = o. The \u2018joke\u2019 is to realise that we can include the numbers of the panels. In this case, there are two solutions. The panels become three equations: x = 5 + y + z, y = \u221a3xz, and z = min (x, y, 1) Let\u2019s say min (x, y, 1) = y. So z = y, thus x = 2y + 5, and y = \u221a3xy. This simplifies to y2 + 3y = 0. We know y is bigger than or equal to 0, since it is the value of a square root, so y= o. Giving us one solution: x = 5, y = z = o Now let\u2019s say min (x, y, 1) = x. Thus z = x, and y = \u20135, which is a contradiction since y is bigger or equal to 0. When min (x, y, 1) = 1, we get the second solution: x = 12, y = 6, z = 1. 2. One to Venn The four squares below form a Venn diagram with ten regions, labelled A to J. The letters A to J each stand for a number between 1 and 10, such that no two regions share the same number and all numbers from 1 to 10 are used. The regions in each square add up to the same number. What value is D, the intersection of all four squares? Solution: D = 7 Since the sum of the regions is the same for each square, when two squares intersect, the regions that do not intersect must be equal. So, for the red and green squares, illustrated below, A = G + H + I. Likewise, F = B + E + I, and J = B + C + G. Thus A+F+J = G+H+I+B+E+I+B+C+G = 2(G+I+B) +C+E+H. The highest possible value of A+F+G is 10 + 9 + 8 = 27. The lowest possible value of 2(G+I+B) +C+E+H is 2(1 + 2 + 3) + 4 + 5 + 6, which is also 27. It follows that both of these values are 27. The only number missing is 7, and the only missing label is D, so D = 7. I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s puzzles. I\u2019ll be back in two weeks.

      "bodyText": "American investment in English football clubs is on the rise \u2013 from Arsenal to Chelsea, Wrexham to Birmingham \u2013 the game is attracting billionaire investors and high-profile celebrities. Next in line are Watford Women. But this investment is different. Watford\u2019s new partner is the Hollywood-based not-for-profit organisation Sound of Gol and the motivation is simple. \u201cEducate and empower the Latina woman, so they can educate and empower the Latina girl,\u201d says its co-founder, director and producer George Valencia. How on earth does investment in Watford Women empower the Latina woman? Sound of Gol, which Valencia founded with his wife, the actor Judy Reyes \u2013 best known for her roles in Scrubs and Devious Maids \u2013 aims to challenge the pay-to-play model of youth football in the US and tackle the underrepresentation of Latina women, providing them with all the benefits the sport brings to young people. Where Watford come in is simple: the first cohort of six Latina coaches from the US will arrive in January to take part in a new coaching course. It will be the partnership\u2019s first big initiative and the new investing group will document their journey. The idea for a proactive organisation was born from an animated series Valencia and Reyes had created, about a little Colombian footballer who goes around the world playing with her team of international orphans and raising social issues that affect kids. Valencia\u2019s niece has received her first call-up to represent Colombia, having been playing at a high level in the US, and he knows how hard the journey can be and what the barriers are. \u201cThe system is built so that college recruitment only comes from certain leagues,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, if colleges are only going to a league because they have the best young female footballers in the entire country, everything elsewhere doesn\u2019t matter ... and to get into that league, you have to pay. \u201cYou have to be able to fly yourself to San Diego from New York, or to Seattle from New York, or to the Dallas Cup from New York, with the cost of hotels added on and stuff like that.

For Reyes, who was not particularly interested in football before getting to know Valencia, it was the power of the sport to do good that attracted her. \u201cInclusion is important to me, diversity is important to me,\u201d she says. There are barriers for Latina coaches as well as players. \u201cLatinas are embarrassingly underrepresented as coaches,\u201d says Reyes, who states that \u201cless than 1% of coaching soccer jobs in the States are held by Latina women\u201d.

It was an \u201cexperience I\u2019d normalised \u2013 and then the rest of my career has not been like that\u201d, Raisin says. \u201cI think my books have got better, but the noise around anything I write has diminished.\u201d</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/01/ross-raisin-ghost-kitchen-wins-2024-bbc-national-short-story-award-with-dark-gig-economy-tale-read-it-here\">he won the BBC national short story award</a> earlier this month, Raisin had been \u201cwondering whether writing is still a viable thing for me to continue doing\u201d. The \u00a315,000 prize will \u201cfill in some financial gaps, to hopefully see me through the next couple of years of writing a book\u201d, he says.

But actually it\u2019s not very cool to be financially rewarded as if it\u2019s a hobby.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the problem is the gap between the public perception of what it is to be a \u201csuccessful novelist\u201d and what that means financially, says Tice Cin, the 29-year-old author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/02/keeping-the-house-by-tice-cin-review-a-cult-classic-in-the-making\">Keeping the House</a>. She has found it difficult to find a day job because would-be employers \u201cGoogle me, see that I\u2019m a published author, and consider me a flight risk. Actually, I wrote a book I put my heart into, and it did well.

      "bodyText": "The 2022 publication of A Hunger, Ross Raisin\u2019s fourth novel, was his \u201clowest moment\u201d, the 45-year-old author says. \u201cIt was a deflating experience.\u201d The book received positive reviews, but then Raisin found out it wouldn\u2019t be stocked in a large high-street book chain, and literary festivals claimed they \u201cdidn\u2019t have space\u201d to programme him. \u201cI had to work hard not to succumb to a negativity that in turn thwarts creativity,\u201d he says. It made him consider giving up writing altogether. Raisin received \u201ca really sizable advance\u201d for his 2008 debut God\u2019s Own Country, which won him the Sunday Times young writer of the year award in 2009 and earned him a spot on Granta magazine\u2019s 2013 list of best young British novelists. It was an \u201cexperience I\u2019d normalised \u2013 and then the rest of my career has not been like that\u201d, Raisin says. \u201cI think my books have got better, but the noise around anything I write has diminished.\u201d When he won the BBC national short story award earlier this month, Raisin had been \u201cwondering whether writing is still a viable thing for me to continue doing\u201d. The \u00a315,000 prize will \u201cfill in some financial gaps, to hopefully see me through the next couple of years of writing a book\u201d, he says. But he has come to terms with the fact that succeeding in publishing is \u201ca roll of the dice\u201d. Meanwhile, university teaching is his main source of income. Raisin\u2019s situation is not unusual. A 2022 report from the Authors\u2019 Licensing and Collecting Society (ALCS) found that the median income of full-time authors had fallen by more than 60% since 2006, to \u00a37,000 a year. Yara Rodrigues Fowler, the 31-year-old author of acclaimed novels Stubborn Archivist and There Are More Things, says that realising \u201chow badly paid\u201d writing is has led her to think: \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of writing another one?\u201d \u201cMy friends are civil servants and doctors; they have pensions and maternity pay. I am pursuing a profession I feel passionately about and is held in high esteem. It\u2019s very cool when you go to a party and say \u2018I\u2019m a novelist\u2019. But actually it\u2019s not very cool to be financially rewarded as if it\u2019s a hobby.\u201d Part of the problem is the gap between the public perception of what it is to be a \u201csuccessful novelist\u201d and what that means financially, says Tice Cin, the 29-year-old author of Keeping the House. She has found it difficult to find a day job because would-be employers \u201cGoogle me, see that I\u2019m a published author, and consider me a flight risk. Actually, I wrote a book I put my heart into, and it did well. It\u2019s changed my sense of pride and hope, not my material circumstances\u201d. Money isn\u2019t the only reason writers think about quitting. Cin adds that this year she has considered giving up trying to sell her second novel because \u201cit\u2019s really hard to know who you can trust to look after a story that\u2019s very raw\u201d. As the book is about her community, she doesn\u2019t want to publish it unless she can ensure that whoever she works with \u201crespects [her] community and doesn\u2019t commodify it\u201d. The comic novelist Dan Rhodes announced his retirement from writing in the mid-noughties. \u201cI couldn\u2019t conceive of writing anything worth reading after I turned 30,\u201d the 52-year-old says now. \u201cIn the end 30 came and went and I kept on going \u2013 it turned out I was being a bit of an idiot.\u201d Rhodes became \u201cuncomfortable in the biz\u201d after a financial fall-out with his first publisher. He now works as a postman and has found \u201ca small patch of scorched earth out on the periphery, from where I can just about operate\u201d \u2013 his most recent novel, Sour Grapes, was published in 2021 by the independent press Lightning Books.

The volume of Russian oil being transported by poorly maintained and underinsured tankers has almost doubled in a year to 4.1m barrels a day by June, according to a report published on Monday by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). The findings underscore the multiple difficulties faced by Kyiv\u2019s western allies in their efforts to isolate Russia\u2019s economy in an attempt to force Moscow to end its war in Ukraine. In December 2022, the UK \u2013 alongside G7 countries, Australia, and the EU \u2013 implemented a price cap of $60 a barrel to restrict western companies from transporting, servicing or brokering Russian crude oil cargoes in order to undermine Russia\u2019s oil trade, which is heavily reliant on western-owned and insured tankers. The move was viewed at the time as a compromise amid concerns that a full embargo could lead to rocketing oil prices and a global oil price shock. However, Russia quickly discovered a workaround to the measures by utilising a so-called shadow fleet of older tankers with opaque ownership, enabling it to sell a significant portion of its oil above the price cap. The KSE paper estimates that Russia has invested at least $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) into the fleet since early 2022. \u201cThe strategy has significantly reduced the sanctions regime\u2019s leverage,\u201d the report says. More than 630 tankers \u2013 some more than 20 years old \u2013 are involved in shipping Russian oil, as well as Iranian crude that has been subjected to sanctions, according to Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence, a maritime information service. Western governments have attempted to clamp down on Russia\u2019s shadow fleet, with the UK last month announcing sanctions on 10 ships that it believes to be at the heart of the operation. KSE, which calls for tougher sanctions on Russian oil, has also warned that the uninsured Russian shadow fleet could soon cause an environmental catastrophe in European waters.

All these things are there to be seen. I don\u2019t speak about it too much because I feel it\u2019s disrespectful to the boys that are in the squad. We have to concentrate on who we have here. We know we have to be very good at everything we do in the game. Hopefully we can get the result that might just change the whole mood about the place.\u201d Clarke will break a record of his own on Tuesday evening. The 61-year-old will take charge of Scotland for the 62nd time, taking him second in the managerial roll of honour. Clarke will edge ahead of Jock Stein and Andy Roxburgh, with only Craig Brown above him. Brown managed Scotland\u2019s senior team 71 times. \u201cProud, obviously, to be mentioned in the same breath as people like Mr Stein and Mr Roxburgh, who still sends me the occasional email just to keep in touch,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIt\u2019s really good. It shows you that the players have been fantastic for us over the last five and a half years of my reign as head coach. I\u2019d like to add a few more to the number, if I could.\u201d Clarke denied, though, surpassing Brown was anywhere near the summit of his thoughts. \u201cI want to go to the World Cup. I believe this squad of players are good enough to go to the World Cup in the Americas in 2026. That\u2019s all I\u2019m focused on.\u201d",

Tony Blair was said to have heaved a sigh of relief. In his first eight years he had <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05867/SN05867.pdf\">created</a> a record 292 lords, 25 of whom had donated <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/blair-sets-record-for-rewarding-party-donors-with-life-peerages-dz3rqwrjf6s\">close to \u00a325m</a> to Labour party coffers. When his successor, Gordon Brown, revived abolition in 2009 it was all but shouted down, as it was again in 2022. It is hypocrisy for British politicians to criticise foreign regimes for their corruption. The reality is that the House of Lords has become a festival of fancy dress, privilege and prestige, with a minor limb of parliament attached. </p> <p>There is no problem about what to do. Most democratic legislatures have second chambers that can be studied. There have been commissions, white papers and thinktanks galore. A genuine consensus exists that what the UK needs is an institutional answer to the gross over-centralisation of the British state. There should be a pressure valve to answer the rising separatism in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/08/house-of-lords-peerages-nominations-appointments-new-rules\">Parties would have to justify House of Lords nominations under new rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Starmer himself proposed in 2020, a new senate would be a forum for the regions and nations. It should have no power beyond that of argument and debate. The Lords\u2019 marginal revising role could be replaced by a reformed Commons committee system. But if one voice is glaringly absent from Britain\u2019s political conversation, it is the voice from beyond the capital.</p> <p>How that voice should be selected is controversial, since even reform-minded politicians are desperate to keep membership under their control. This must not be. Any direct election of members would replicate and weaken the legitimacy of the Commons. Party list elections would merely extend the parties\u2019 power. Better by far would be to bring together national assembly leaders, council leaders, mayors and possibly vocational representatives \u2013 as, for instance, in Ireland and Germany. Such a body could meet regionally as well as centrally. Fusing its influence into the legislative and executive process would require innovation. But it is desperately overdue.</p> <p>So why has Starmer become the champion of continuity rather than change?

The reality is that the House of Lords has become a festival of fancy dress, privilege and prestige, with a minor limb of parliament attached. There is no problem about what to do. Most democratic legislatures have second chambers that can be studied. There have been commissions, white papers and thinktanks galore. A genuine consensus exists that what the UK needs is an institutional answer to the gross over-centralisation of the British state. There should be a pressure valve to answer the rising separatism in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As Starmer himself proposed in 2020, a new senate would be a forum for the regions and nations. It should have no power beyond that of argument and debate. The Lords\u2019 marginal revising role could be replaced by a reformed Commons committee system. But if one voice is glaringly absent from Britain\u2019s political conversation, it is the voice from beyond the capital. How that voice should be selected is controversial, since even reform-minded politicians are desperate to keep membership under their control. This must not be. Any direct election of members would replicate and weaken the legitimacy of the Commons. Party list elections would merely extend the parties\u2019 power. Better by far would be to bring together national assembly leaders, council leaders, mayors and possibly vocational representatives \u2013 as, for instance, in Ireland and Germany. Such a body could meet regionally as well as centrally. Fusing its influence into the legislative and executive process would require innovation. But it is desperately overdue. So why has Starmer become the champion of continuity rather than change? Is he wondering if soon he will be joining his friends?

      "body": "<p>\u2018It\u2019s just so weird, having children,\u201d says Bill Nighy. \u201cThe whole thing is like science fiction. Human beings make decisions and have ideas and choose their partner and it\u2019s all so reckless and marvellous. It\u2019s such an extraordinary thing to attempt. Maybe it\u2019s just my age, but I just think of all the energy involved to have and raise children, you know?\u201d<br><br>I hear him gliding down the street, phone in hand, offering some sort of gorgeous apology to a cafe door. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s this human being who turns out to be somebody quite independently of whoever might have been involved in their creation.

And they\u2019re also, in the case of my grandchildren, edible.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It was a relief that there were no sex scenes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nighy is a highly covetable grandfather.

Not that it\u2019s a criticism of either group, but nothing can quite prepare you for the moment where they hand you a human being and say, this is yours, you are now their custodian.</p> <p>\u201cAnd as soon as you take the weight of the baby, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, I <em>see</em>, it\u2019s entirely about this now. It\u2019s not about me.\u2019 So it hopefully unplugs some of our unhelpful self-absorption. There\u2019s something outside of yourself to concern yourself with. You go down the billing.\u201d The birth of his daughter 40 years ago was, he concludes, \u201cthe most significant thing that has ever happened to me\u201d.</p> <p>Joy is an origin story for the procedure that enabled millions of people also to become parents. It\u2019s a movie about three good people \u2013 Dr Patrick Steptoe (Nighy), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/10/robert-edwards\">Dr Robert Edwards</a> (James Norton) and lab technician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/10/jean-purdy-female-nurse-who-played-crucial-role-in-ivf-ignored-on-plaque\">Jean Purdy</a> (Thomasin McKenzie) \u2013 trying to do a good thing, which everyone knows they manage. Yet it is as gripping as a thriller. Because, explains writer Jack Thorne, it has the structure of a sports movie. The key players \u201cwere a genuine team and it cost them to be part of that team. It\u2019s just their season ran from 1968 to 1978.\u201d</p> <p>1978 was the year the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born. In Joy, we don\u2019t encounter her parents until the final reel; the film juggles primal emotions and immense restraint. One touchstone for its director, Ben Taylor, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/29/first-man-review-ryan-gosling-shoots-for-the-moon-in-neil-armstrong-biopic\">First Man</a>, the Neil Armstrong biopic starring Ryan Gosling. \u201cEven the overblown trailer finishes with a countdown to liftoff,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery second is interspersed with cuts of him and his family.\u201d Yet the step for mankind managed in Joy is arguably more immense. \u201cGoing to the moon is one thing but what they did is more important.\u201d</p>    <p>They shot it in the shadow of Oppenheimer: another film, says Taylor, with \u201ca lot of theory, a lot of lab work\u201d \u2013 but a more obviously cinematic climax. Filming all the chat took ages, he says, \u201cbut then you\u2019ve got James Norton with a pipette. And you can\u2019t just bosh it off in 10 minutes. You want to worship it because it\u2019s the magic of the film.\u201d</p> <p>So embryos are fertilised in ecstatic closeup. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR2JlDnT2l8\">The Lark Ascending</a> booms on the soundtrack. It\u2019s as lush and lyrical as a conventional baby-making scene, just with rather less nudity. \u201cIt was a relief there were no sex scenes,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cThat it\u2019s a film not about sex.\u201d She has just finished a film in which her character is celibate. \u201cI was like, \u2018Amazing! love it!\u201d</p> <p>The simplicity of the science surprised Nighy. \u201cThe idea of fertilising an embryo outside of the body seemed unachievable. It\u2019s such a profound development yet the actual mechanics of it are not that complicated.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly binary,\u201d agrees Taylor. \u201cAnd it\u2019s still very much based on what these three people were doing in a shack in Oldham 47 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Joy is Taylor\u2019s first film; he cut his teeth on TV such as Catastrophe and Sex Education. \u201cI\u2019ve loved everything I\u2019ve made,\u201d he says, \u201cbut this was the one where I knew I had to make it.\u201d He and his wife have two children conceived by IVF; he caveated job offers with the warning that the film might be too painful to work on for anyone who had had a less happy outcome.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the most emotional rehearsal process I\u2019ve ever had in a film,\u201d agrees Thorne. \u201cSo many tears all the way through.\u201d Including for him and his wife and co-writer, Rachel Mason. \u201cThings came to light that probably wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d he said. \u201cRachel told me she\u2019d decided to leave me if we didn\u2019t have a kid.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cBecause the issue was my issue,\u201d says Mason quickly. \u201cSo I felt incredibly guilty: Jack could be with someone else and not go through all this.\u201d Mason now runs a support group for women undergoing fertility treatment, and those experiences are channelled into those scenes in the film concerning the Ovum Club, the self-named group of female volunteers who took part in the gruelling trials, motivated by a desire to help future women desperate to get pregnant \u2013 and the glancing hope they themselves might.</p> <p>Had they not had their son, says Mason, she couldn\u2019t have written Joy. \u201cThe trauma, the grief: it\u2019s in you, it never goes. It\u2019s just a darkness. It feels weird saying it, but I still have a reaction to someone else\u2019s pregnancy announcement.\u201d The upset and unwelcome jealousy of others is, she says, \u201cstill quite raw\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCapturing that shard of ice that comes when you\u2019re dealing with infertility was really important,\u201d says Thorne. \u201cAnd I think we only caught that because of what we\u2019d been through.\u201d</p> <p>The film also explains how Purdy \u2013 whose crucial role was long diminished, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01313-5\">Rosalind Franklin</a>-style \u2013 was spurred in part by her own endometriosis. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to have children,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cAnd because of that, she felt like she didn\u2019t deserve love. She\u2019d grown up in a very religious household and the expectation placed on her was to have children and she couldn\u2019t do it. So she knew how that felt, and the humanity in her drove her to want to help other women.\u201d</p> <p>McKenzie, 24, gives a remarkably mature performance as a woman whose work meant she was shunned by her church-going mother, Gladys (Joanna Scanlan). \u201cThe question of whether I\u2019m capable of being a mother is something that\u2019s always been on my mind,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cGrowing up, a lot of pressure is put on girls to be mothers. Our first toys are baby dolls. I grew up hearing that term: \u2018baby-bearing hips\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cSo I wanted to bring that to the forefront, especially because it\u2019s so relevant to what\u2019s happening today with American politics and women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s health and Roe v Wade.\u201d She invokes Edwards\u2019 argument: infertility is a medical condition no less deserving of treatment than any other. \u201cTechnology is so advanced now that we can do insane operations like laser eye surgery, so why is it not OK for women to have more power over their bodies? It\u2019s men who seem to want to control that, but are totally fine with the technology to remove tumours.\u201d</p>    <p>The cast and crew have little time for sceptics, either of today or half a century ago. \u201cI remember there was friction, static,\u201d says Nighy, of the 1970s stew of misinformation and misplaced anxiety. \u201cBut no one was playing God. There is no God, so you can\u2019t play God.\u201d</p> <p>Before he read theology at university, Norton attended a Catholic boarding school, an experience that has not made him more forgiving of intolerance. \u201cWithin the monastery there were beliefs around contraception and female priests and homosexuality I did not agree with. Just because they were embedded in an institution of the church, that didn\u2019t make it more palatable.\u201d</p> <p>Something beeps in the background of our video call. Norton has type 1 diabetes, which necessitates a pump and a sensor and \u2013 if he\u2019s on stage for a while \u2013 strategically scattered snacks. \u201cI\u2019m very aware of the importance of medical advancement and pharmaceuticals being given the attention and investment they require,\u201d he grins. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the progress of science that I feel threatened by.\u201d</p> <p>Being in a film that highlights this incredible homegrown breakthrough makes him feel \u201cimmensely proud\u201d, he says, as well as \u201cvery reassured\u201d he doesn\u2019t live in the US where the IVF procedure has been variously \u201cpoliticised \u2026 hijacked \u2026 and kind of weaponised\u201d.</p> <p>Joy was not conceived to be political. But its accidental relevance is, says Taylor, \u201cexciting\u201d. \u201cIt can\u2019t come out soon enough for me because it hopefully just shines a light on how simple and how essential this process is and how widely people are affected by infertility.\u201d</p> <p>Nighy expresses discreet optimism it will have some effect. \u201cPossibly marginally. To have a film that describes in detail the people and the events, rather than just reacting to an idea.\u201d</p>    <p>Thorne is less moderate. \u201cThe battle in the US is savage and it\u2019s horrific,\u201d he says. \u201cDoctors being scared to do their jobs is the worst thing imaginable. Yet remember that in this country, Louise Brown was born of two working-class parents who were properly supported. That doesn\u2019t happen now. You can do IVF if you can afford it or live in the right postcode. We did seven rounds \u2013 that would be impossible on the NHS. So while the political questions for the US are interesting, there are also political questions for us.\u201d</p> <p>The women in the waiting room in Oldham came from all economic and ethnic backgrounds, says Taylor. Yet it\u2019s now \u201cthe pursuit of the middle classes. It\u2019s shocking to imagine how few people can continue the journey after their first attempt. The darker side of it in this country is how exclusive that club can be.\u201d</p> <p>His voice wobbles. He\u2019s shooting in Albuquerque and hasn\u2019t seen his children for four months. \u201cIt\u2019s so indulgent to say, as someone who\u2019s seen the film 200 times, but there are moments in it that still overwhelm me. There\u2019s just something so beautiful about this idea of sacrifice and the universal desire to have a family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople can and do live incredibly fulfilling lives without children. And that should be a choice. But for me, it beats everything. It feels like as close to the embodiment of love and fulfilment as I can imagine.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, the character who best articulates this is also the one most opposed to the project succeeding. \u201cWhen you look back on your life,\u201d Gladys tells Jean at something of a critical moment, \u201cmostly all you can see is failure. But the one thing you can\u2019t see failure in is your children because they\u2019re always beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor composes himself. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly easy to say \u2018I\u2019ve got a problem with something\u2019 if somebody else is after it and you\u2019ve already got it,\u201d he says. \u201cParents who have a moral objection to somebody else wanting to be a parent I find excruciating.\u201d</p>    <p>Nighy, still gliding down the street, weighs nature and nurture and what parenthood means to him. \u201cThere is a simplistic way of looking at it,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich would suggest that children are the meaning of life. I see them as beautiful, my daughter and my grandchildren. And I do wonder how much of this is biology or narcissism or self-interest or self-absorption.</p> <p>\u201cBut actually, they\u2019re just fabulous. It\u2019s nothing to do with me. I\u2019m just a big fan. They\u2019re funny and kind and smart and decent. I\u2019m not very self-aware to be honest, but I really don\u2019t take any personal credit. I\u2019m pleased about certain elements, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re as a result of my brilliant contribution.\u201d</p> <p>Would he be the same person had he not had a child? \u201cI\u2019m halfway down a very strong cup of coffee,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich might persuade me into positions I have no right to hold, and I\u2019m not kidding, I\u2019m super-vulnerable to coffee, but I don\u2019t see them as a representation of me but sort of in spite of me.\u201d</p> <p>He snorts that familiar snort, which may or may not have been passed down the genetic line. \u201cI\u2019m quite astonished to be anybody\u2019s father. It\u2019s a relief. I like it. I like it rather better than being me.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Joy premieres at <a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=joy-lff-lff24\">the London film festival</a> on 15 October.

It\u2019s such a profound development yet the actual mechanics of it are not that complicated.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly binary,\u201d agrees Taylor. \u201cAnd it\u2019s still very much based on what these three people were doing in a shack in Oldham 47 years ago.\u201d Joy is Taylor\u2019s first film; he cut his teeth on TV such as Catastrophe and Sex Education. \u201cI\u2019ve loved everything I\u2019ve made,\u201d he says, \u201cbut this was the one where I knew I had to make it.\u201d He and his wife have two children conceived by IVF; he caveated job offers with the warning that the film might be too painful to work on for anyone who had had a less happy outcome. \u201cIt was the most emotional rehearsal process I\u2019ve ever had in a film,\u201d agrees Thorne. \u201cSo many tears all the way through.\u201d Including for him and his wife and co-writer, Rachel Mason. \u201cThings came to light that probably wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d he said. \u201cRachel told me she\u2019d decided to leave me if we didn\u2019t have a kid.\u201d \u201cBecause the issue was my issue,\u201d says Mason quickly. \u201cSo I felt incredibly guilty: Jack could be with someone else and not go through all this.\u201d Mason now runs a support group for women undergoing fertility treatment, and those experiences are channelled into those scenes in the film concerning the Ovum Club, the self-named group of female volunteers who took part in the gruelling trials, motivated by a desire to help future women desperate to get pregnant \u2013 and the glancing hope they themselves might. Had they not had their son, says Mason, she couldn\u2019t have written Joy. \u201cThe trauma, the grief: it\u2019s in you, it never goes. It\u2019s just a darkness. It feels weird saying it, but I still have a reaction to someone else\u2019s pregnancy announcement.\u201d The upset and unwelcome jealousy of others is, she says, \u201cstill quite raw\u201d. \u201cCapturing that shard of ice that comes when you\u2019re dealing with infertility was really important,\u201d says Thorne. \u201cAnd I think we only caught that because of what we\u2019d been through.\u201d The film also explains how Purdy \u2013 whose crucial role was long diminished, Rosalind Franklin-style \u2013 was spurred in part by her own endometriosis. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to have children,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cAnd because of that, she felt like she didn\u2019t deserve love. She\u2019d grown up in a very religious household and the expectation placed on her was to have children and she couldn\u2019t do it. So she knew how that felt, and the humanity in her drove her to want to help other women.\u201d McKenzie, 24, gives a remarkably mature performance as a woman whose work meant she was shunned by her church-going mother, Gladys (Joanna Scanlan). \u201cThe question of whether I\u2019m capable of being a mother is something that\u2019s always been on my mind,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cGrowing up, a lot of pressure is put on girls to be mothers. Our first toys are baby dolls. I grew up hearing that term: \u2018baby-bearing hips\u2019. \u201cSo I wanted to bring that to the forefront, especially because it\u2019s so relevant to what\u2019s happening today with American politics and women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s health and Roe v Wade.\u201d She invokes Edwards\u2019 argument: infertility is a medical condition no less deserving of treatment than any other. \u201cTechnology is so advanced now that we can do insane operations like laser eye surgery, so why is it not OK for women to have more power over their bodies? It\u2019s men who seem to want to control that, but are totally fine with the technology to remove tumours.\u201d The cast and crew have little time for sceptics, either of today or half a century ago. \u201cI remember there was friction, static,\u201d says Nighy, of the 1970s stew of misinformation and misplaced anxiety. \u201cBut no one was playing God. There is no God, so you can\u2019t play God.\u201d Before he read theology at university, Norton attended a Catholic boarding school, an experience that has not made him more forgiving of intolerance. \u201cWithin the monastery there were beliefs around contraception and female priests and homosexuality I did not agree with. Just because they were embedded in an institution of the church, that didn\u2019t make it more palatable.\u201d Something beeps in the background of our video call. Norton has type 1 diabetes, which necessitates a pump and a sensor and \u2013 if he\u2019s on stage for a while \u2013 strategically scattered snacks. \u201cI\u2019m very aware of the importance of medical advancement and pharmaceuticals being given the attention and investment they require,\u201d he grins. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the progress of science that I feel threatened by.\u201d Being in a film that highlights this incredible homegrown breakthrough makes him feel \u201cimmensely proud\u201d, he says, as well as \u201cvery reassured\u201d he doesn\u2019t live in the US where the IVF procedure has been variously \u201cpoliticised \u2026 hijacked \u2026 and kind of weaponised\u201d. Joy was not conceived to be political. But its accidental relevance is, says Taylor, \u201cexciting\u201d. \u201cIt can\u2019t come out soon enough for me because it hopefully just shines a light on how simple and how essential this process is and how widely people are affected by infertility.\u201d Nighy expresses discreet optimism it will have some effect. \u201cPossibly marginally. To have a film that describes in detail the people and the events, rather than just reacting to an idea.\u201d Thorne is less moderate. \u201cThe battle in the US is savage and it\u2019s horrific,\u201d he says. \u201cDoctors being scared to do their jobs is the worst thing imaginable. Yet remember that in this country, Louise Brown was born of two working-class parents who were properly supported. That doesn\u2019t happen now. You can do IVF if you can afford it or live in the right postcode. We did seven rounds \u2013 that would be impossible on the NHS. So while the political questions for the US are interesting, there are also political questions for us.\u201d The women in the waiting room in Oldham came from all economic and ethnic backgrounds, says Taylor. Yet it\u2019s now \u201cthe pursuit of the middle classes. It\u2019s shocking to imagine how few people can continue the journey after their first attempt. The darker side of it in this country is how exclusive that club can be.\u201d His voice wobbles. He\u2019s shooting in Albuquerque and hasn\u2019t seen his children for four months. \u201cIt\u2019s so indulgent to say, as someone who\u2019s seen the film 200 times, but there are moments in it that still overwhelm me. There\u2019s just something so beautiful about this idea of sacrifice and the universal desire to have a family.\u201d \u201cPeople can and do live incredibly fulfilling lives without children. And that should be a choice. But for me, it beats everything. It feels like as close to the embodiment of love and fulfilment as I can imagine.\u201d In the film, the character who best articulates this is also the one most opposed to the project succeeding. \u201cWhen you look back on your life,\u201d Gladys tells Jean at something of a critical moment, \u201cmostly all you can see is failure. But the one thing you can\u2019t see failure in is your children because they\u2019re always beautiful.\u201d Taylor composes himself. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly easy to say \u2018I\u2019ve got a problem with something\u2019 if somebody else is after it and you\u2019ve already got it,\u201d he says. \u201cParents who have a moral objection to somebody else wanting to be a parent I find excruciating.\u201d Nighy, still gliding down the street, weighs nature and nurture and what parenthood means to him. \u201cThere is a simplistic way of looking at it,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich would suggest that children are the meaning of life. I see them as beautiful, my daughter and my grandchildren. And I do wonder how much of this is biology or narcissism or self-interest or self-absorption. \u201cBut actually, they\u2019re just fabulous. It\u2019s nothing to do with me. I\u2019m just a big fan. They\u2019re funny and kind and smart and decent. I\u2019m not very self-aware to be honest, but I really don\u2019t take any personal credit. I\u2019m pleased about certain elements, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re as a result of my brilliant contribution.\u201d Would he be the same person had he not had a child? \u201cI\u2019m halfway down a very strong cup of coffee,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich might persuade me into positions I have no right to hold, and I\u2019m not kidding, I\u2019m super-vulnerable to coffee, but I don\u2019t see them as a representation of me but sort of in spite of me.\u201d He snorts that familiar snort, which may or may not have been passed down the genetic line. \u201cI\u2019m quite astonished to be anybody\u2019s father. It\u2019s a relief. I like it. I like it rather better than being me.\u201d \u2022 Joy premieres at the London film festival on 15 October. It is released in UK cinemas on 15 November and globally on Netflix on 22 November",

      "bodyText": "An undercover police officer \u201cbragged\u201d that he had fathered a child with an activist from whom he had concealed his real identity, a public inquiry has heard. The officer, Bob Lambert, had the child with the woman, known only as Jacqui, while he was infiltrating animal rights and anarchist groups. One of his colleagues alleged that this was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d within the secret Scotland Yard unit they worked for. The inquiry heard on Monday that Lambert told two of the unit\u2019s managers that he believed he was the father of the child, and both decided to do nothing. Lambert abandoned Jacqui and his son when he was two years old, leaving her to bring him up on her own in difficult circumstances. She only found out \u2013 by chance \u2013 more than two decades later that he had been an undercover officer sent to spy on activists, and not the committed campaigner he portrayed himself to be. The discovery has left her devastated and contemplating suicide. The inquiry heard evidence for the first time that Lambert\u2019s managers had been told at the time that he had fathered a child while he was infiltrating political campaigners. Lambert was later awarded a commendation for gathering information about activists during a successful operation. Sir John Mitting, the retired judge heading the inquiry, is examining the conduct of about 139 undercover officers who spied on more than 1,000 mainly leftwing groups between 1968 and at least 2010. One of the main issues is how officers frequently formed intimate relationships with women without disclosing that they were undercover spies. The current phase of the inquiry is concentrating on the deployments of undercover officers during the 1980s and 1990s. During his four years undercover, Lambert deceived at least four women into sexual relationships. Jacqui has described how she quickly became smitten by the \u201cvery charming and charismatic\u201d Lambert in 1984. Their son was born the following year. On the weekend she went into labour, she was unaware that he had been with his wife and two children. Jacqui has said he had made no effort to persuade her to have an abortion.

About 40% of Hamtramck\u2019s residents are of Middle Eastern or north African descent, 60% are believed to be Muslim Americans, and the city has an all-Muslim city council. Last week, as Israel was expanding its war into Lebanon and continuing its daily bombardment of Gaza, scores of locals \u2013 many immigrants from Bangladesh, Yemen and other Arab- and Muslim-majority countries \u2013 lined Joseph Campau Avenue to attend the official opening of Trump\u2019s office. \u201cPeace in the Middle East will not happen under a Harris administration \u2013 she\u2019s too weak,\u201d said Barry Altman, a Republican party candidate who is running for a seat in Michigan\u2019s house of representatives next month, and who was running the new Trump campaign office on a recent afternoon. \u201cTrump is the only hope for peace.\u201d Altman is not alone.

While Hamtramck may not sway a national election all by itself, it offers a window into how many Muslim and Arab Americans feel about their political leaders, as Israel\u2019s war on Gaza enters a second year and spreads into Lebanon. Hamtramck aside, Macomb and Oakland counties, north of downtown Detroit, are home to an estimated 140,000 people \u2013 around 45% of Michigan\u2019s entire Arab American community, which numbers more than 300,000.

The problem really is how action could be organised. It\u2019s only elite players who are playing too many games; those lower down the pyramid probably wouldn\u2019t mind a few more games for extra cash. Similarly while a lot of fans are concerned about the proliferation of games that seem to mean very little, they\u2019d still be furious if a game for which they\u2019ve bought a ticket and paid travel costs was called off because of an industrial dispute by players who earn hundreds of thousands of pounds a week. That\u2019s one of the reasons football has taken the disappointing path it has; organised opposition is very difficult \u2013 the protest against the super league was one of the very few occasions on which enough of football\u2019s different stakeholders were sufficiently in alignment to kick back.</p> <p>That said, the Club World Cup would seem a decent target. The shambolic organisation means few fans are likely to have bought tickets yet and, unlike the Champions League or a World Cup, it\u2019s not a competition players dream of playing in. In terms of the PR war, it would be very easy, at least for players at European clubs, to portray it as a needless addition imposed on the calendar with no consultation \u2013 because that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t expect it, but if there were to be serious action, it would make sense for players to target it at the Club World Cup.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you think there\u2019s anything particularly special about Mauricio Pochettino that makes him a good fit as an international coach? \u2013 Ray</strong></em><br><br>The truth is we just don\u2019t know. International management is very different to club management and there are countless examples of great club coaches who have found it difficult to adjust to the more limited involvement with the players that the international game entails. Equally, several highly successful national managers \u2013 Aim\u00e9 Jacquet, Lionel Scaloni, Joachim L\u00f6w, Luis de la Fuente, Gareth Southgate \u2013 have done little at club level but worked well within the framework of a federation.</p> <p>The press that lies at the heart of Pochettino\u2019s philosophy takes time to impose but part of that at club level has been getting his players up to the required fitness. With the USMNT that may not be such an issue; certainly by stereotype, US players are extremely fit, their shortcomings tactical and technical. And Pochettino is charismatic; there should be no issue with getting buy-in. Pre-World Cup performances for a host can always be a little uneven. It\u2019s very difficult with friendlies to know exactly what sides are trying to do, but I\u2019d be surprised if the US don\u2019t make an impression at the Gold Cup in 2025.</p> <p><em><strong>When did football clubs become privately owned \u201ccompanies\u201d, as such?

After 1885, when professionalism was legalised, there was no need to keep up the pretence. Sunderland\u2019s three league titles in the 1890s, for instance, were based on investment from the shipbuilder Robert Thompson and the mine-owner Samuel Tyzack, both of whom were directors. The only difference from a \u201cnormal\u201d company was that, until 1981, directors could not draw a profit and dividends were limited to 7.5%.

That\u2019s a rare case, but other clubs stockpile young talent, and it definitely has been true in the past that there has been a blockage in development, of talented young players struggling to get pitch time, although that seems to have eased, partly because players are more willing to move abroad now, and partly because clubs are aware of the value of loaning players out to gain experience.</p> <h2>On this day</h2>    <p>Floodlit football now feels the best form of the game, the surrounds faded into darkness as the pitch glows at the centre of attention, but for only about half of the sport\u2019s history have games under lights been sanctioned.

After the Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman saw a floodlight game in Belgium a decade later, he had lights installed at Highbury, but it wasn\u2019t until 1951 that the first sanctioned game under lights in England was played, Arsenal beating Hapoel Tel Aviv 6-1. After a series of hugely popular friendlies between English sides and top European opposition, the first league match under lights, between Portsmouth and Newcastle, was played in 1956 \u2013 although only after being delayed for several minutes because of technical issues.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/sign-up-for-soccer-with-jonathan-wilson-his-free-weekly-newsletter-on-european-soccer\">Subscribe for free here.</a> </strong>Have a question for Jonathan?

So when Mercury offered me half a million quid, I was kind of like: \u201cWell, I mean, I dunno \u2026\u201d</p> <p>I was living above a Nigerian clothes shop called La Chi Chi.

      "bodyText": "Martin Cruddace, the chief executive of the racecourse operator Arena Racing Company, has called for a cut to the rate of betting duty and an increase in the statutory Levy to \u201cmake our industry, once again, an incredible growth story reflecting its international status\u201d, and prevent the sport being caught in the fallout from potential changes to the tax regime around gambling aimed primarily at high-risk online slot and gaming products. The \u00a311bn gambling sector is reportedly seen as a significant source of extra tax revenue by the Treasury before the budget on 30 October. Cruddace, whose intervention has support from racing\u2019s main stakeholder groups, believes it is also an opportunity to reaffirm the distinctions between betting, on racing and sport, and fixed-margin casino-style gaming which guarantees a profit to the operator. General Betting Duty, on racing and other sports betting, is set at 15% of gross profits, while Remote Gaming Duty, on online slot machines and casino products, is 21% of gross profits. Gambling firms also pay the statutory Levy of 10% of gross profits on British racing bets, which is returned to the sport in prize money and other funding via the Levy Board.

      "bodyText": "As you contemplate the wonders of evolution, and how a creature can be born with something weird and new, and that thing can either help it get ahead or not hurt its chances, and it can then reproduce and make another one like it, spare a thought for the red-lipped batfish. A real animal, it has the kind of mouth that, as a kid, you may have made from Babybel cheese wax, to go with your red wax fake nails. It has a beard of white whiskers. It has fins that bend backwards, like a person\u2019s arms at yoga when they are about to do upward dog. Before your eyes, it sprouts a new limb from its nostril. Its nose \u2013 technically a snout \u2013 is long, at the top of its head, and hook-shaped. It cannot swim, only crawl. Its crawl is more like a waddle. You might think, why not the red-lipped batfish? Why shouldn\u2019t it exist? The red-lipped batfish disagrees. Its permanent scowl serves a single function: to let you know that it regrets evolving at all. Better to be primordial slime than this. It could easily have been made from the various and insurmountable small piles of random objects that accumulate perpetually around your house. Naturally, it lives in the waters off the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It eats other, smaller, fish and is bigger than it looks: RLBFs can grow to 40cm. It has a stripe, it has spots. \u201cAfter the red-lipped batfish fully matures, its dorsal fin becomes a single spine-like projection that comes out of the top of the head\u201d. This thing is called an \u201cillicium\u201d and, at the top of the illicium is an \u201cesca\u201d, which emits a light. The RLBF can live at 300m below the surface of the ocean. As the great Hannah Horvath once said, \u201cIs there anything in this world creepier than a fish?\u201d It looks as though it is just daring you to ask whether it is wearing lipstick. It looks like it applied the lipstick using its fins, ie not very well, uneven, wider than the outline of its lips. We\u2019ve all been there. We\u2019ve all felt like a badly made-up, odd-limbed, irritable floor-dwelling mess. Werner Herzog has been there.

While it\u2019s OK to succumb to cravings in moderation, Cummins cautions against the \u201ceating for two\u201d mentality. \u201cWomen are very capable of growing a baby, so you don\u2019t need to eat for two,\u201d she says. Giving in to cravings for high-sugar, high-fat and high-carb foods not only increases the risk of weight gain and gestational diabetes, but it can also increase the weight of the baby and have long-term effects on their metabolism. Eating a healthy diet in pregnancy is important, for mother and baby, but Attia acknowledges it can be tough, particularly because of cravings and food aversions. \u201cLots of women think when they become pregnant they\u2019re going to eat so healthily and eat well, they have these big plans,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know the symptoms and the side effects you\u2019re going to go through in pregnancy, and that can make it difficult to eat well.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, a friend told me a story. She and her husband had been staying in a remote area on the western slopes of the Blue Mountains. One day they were driving back to their house when a large animal appeared on the road in front of them. It was getting dark but she said the shape was unmistakable. It wasn\u2019t a dog or some kind of native animal. Instead, the dark form that paused and then jogged across the road in front of them was unambiguously, inarguably feline.</p> <p>Stories about escaped big cats \u2013 especially panthers \u2013 have roamed the outlands of the Australian settler-colonial imagination for more than a century. No doubt they have many meanings but it is difficult not to read them as a kind of haunting, another manifestation of the larger disquiet about the silences written into the Australian landscape and its history that animate the gothic underside of our culture.</p> <p>In his fourth novel, Dusk, Robbie Arnott takes these myths and reimagines them with fascinating results. His big cat is not a panther but a puma called Dusk, the last of a group released in the Tasmanian highlands to control feral deer. As one of the graziers who are desperate to be rid of her explains at one point: \u201cShe looks like every other puma. It\u2019s her personality that makes her dangerous \u2026 Dusk hunts every station, all terrains, in all weather. She favours sheep, but will take anything. Especially anything that is stalking her.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>That final observation should be enough to warn off any would-be hunters. But for twins Iris and Floyd, the bounty is too big to ignore, so they make their way up into the mountains to try to track down Dusk and kill her. They are not alone in their quest: they soon discover that Dusk has just killed one of the men hunting her, while another, known as the Patagonian, who has come from South America to hunt her, has disappeared. But despite the danger the siblings head into the bush in the company of a third man, Patrick Lees, a slippery charmer Floyd distrusts and Iris finds disturbingly attractive.</p> <p>Iris and Floyd are beguiling creations. The children of escaped convicts regarded as \u201ckiller-thieves \u2026 utter savages, the pair of them\u201d, they are bound together by the shared experience of childhood on the run, and their parents\u2019 drunkenness and unpredictable fits of violence. But although their parents\u2019 criminality has left them outcasts, it has not made them hard or cruel. Instead it has created a bond of care that sustains them in the face of society\u2019s disapproval.</p> <p>Much of the magic of Dusk grows out of the writing. As anybody who has read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/07/limberlost-by-robbie-arnott-review-a-sweet-and-moving-song-of-man-and-landscape\">any of his previous novels will know</a>, Arnott has an astonishing facility with language, and his prose imbues the Tasmanian wilderness with an extraordinary, immanent beauty. In the highlands \u201crock and water \u2026 dominate the landscape: broken boulders, fields of snow, mossy stones, mirror tarns, and among it all little rivulets, trickling through the land as glassy arteries\u201d. Currawongs are \u201clarge, sharp-beaked, with jackets of black, white tail feathers and fierce yellow eyes\u201d.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t seem accidental that the pared-back textures of Dusk\u2019s prose occasionally recall those of Cormac McCarthy, especially in the book\u2019s rolling sentences and their reliance upon rhythm: Dusk is self-consciously reinventing many of the tropes of the western in a Tasmanian setting. But while the twins\u2019 quest and the machinations of the graziers and bounty hunters place the book within the western tradition, Arnott\u2019s version of the genre is a surprisingly weird one.</p> <p>While following a stream, Iris sees shapes rising out of the mist and assumes they are \u201cabandoned fence posts, the remnants of failed farms\u201d or \u201cdead trees, killed long ago and whitened by time\u201d. It is only when she is among them that she realises they are in fact the \u201cbleached bones\u201d of prehistoric animals, \u201ccold, random, alabaster. Ribs and limbs and hips, impossibly old, haunting the green life of the country, beckoning her west.\u201d Later the twins shelter inside a huge skull high in the mountains.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/13/australian-museum-extinction-cabinets-endangered-species\">\u2018It\u2019s like looking at ghosts\u2019: inside the Australian Museum\u2019s extinction cabinets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Evocative as these moments are, they sit a little uncomfortably alongside Dusk\u2019s treatment of Aboriginal presence. Exactly when the book is set is never quite clear but it is clearly late enough for Palawa populations to have been drastically reduced: at one point they are said to have almost disappeared, although later Iris spends a day with a group of Aboriginal peat-cutters. Yet like the ancient leviathans in the riverbed, the novel\u2019s First Peoples seem to belong to a mythical past, one separated from the present of the novel by an occluding gulf of time; certainly there is little sense of the genocidal hatred and violence that was brought to bear upon Tasmania\u2019s Aboriginal peoples in the real world.</p> <p>Simultaneously, however, this starkly beautiful and deeply felt book seems to want to move away from the elegiac mode of most westerns. It is interesting to contrast it with Julia Leigh\u2019s 1999 novel, The Hunter, in which a man pursues a thylacine through the forests of western Tasmania. While the two novels share some of the same gothic trappings, they are very different beasts.</p> <p>In contrast to the emotionally denuded and obsessional textures of Leigh\u2019s novel, Dusk is a book about love: not just the love between the twins but the love they feel for the landscape and, surprisingly, for their dead parents. And, as their quest moves towards its conclusion, they find not loss and pain but instead the possibility of redemption and the \u201cchance to assist in an act that went beyond their own survival. A chance to fix a wrong in the world, and in the process somehow fix a wrong within themselves.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781761560941/\">Dusk by Robbie Arnott</a> is out now in Australia (Picador, $34.99)</em></p></li> </ul>",

Iris and Floyd are beguiling creations. The children of escaped convicts regarded as \u201ckiller-thieves \u2026 utter savages, the pair of them\u201d, they are bound together by the shared experience of childhood on the run, and their parents\u2019 drunkenness and unpredictable fits of violence. But although their parents\u2019 criminality has left them outcasts, it has not made them hard or cruel. Instead it has created a bond of care that sustains them in the face of society\u2019s disapproval. Much of the magic of Dusk grows out of the writing. As anybody who has read any of his previous novels will know, Arnott has an astonishing facility with language, and his prose imbues the Tasmanian wilderness with an extraordinary, immanent beauty. In the highlands \u201crock and water \u2026 dominate the landscape: broken boulders, fields of snow, mossy stones, mirror tarns, and among it all little rivulets, trickling through the land as glassy arteries\u201d. Currawongs are \u201clarge, sharp-beaked, with jackets of black, white tail feathers and fierce yellow eyes\u201d. It doesn\u2019t seem accidental that the pared-back textures of Dusk\u2019s prose occasionally recall those of Cormac McCarthy, especially in the book\u2019s rolling sentences and their reliance upon rhythm: Dusk is self-consciously reinventing many of the tropes of the western in a Tasmanian setting. But while the twins\u2019 quest and the machinations of the graziers and bounty hunters place the book within the western tradition, Arnott\u2019s version of the genre is a surprisingly weird one. While following a stream, Iris sees shapes rising out of the mist and assumes they are \u201cabandoned fence posts, the remnants of failed farms\u201d or \u201cdead trees, killed long ago and whitened by time\u201d. It is only when she is among them that she realises they are in fact the \u201cbleached bones\u201d of prehistoric animals, \u201ccold, random, alabaster. Ribs and limbs and hips, impossibly old, haunting the green life of the country, beckoning her west.\u201d Later the twins shelter inside a huge skull high in the mountains. Evocative as these moments are, they sit a little uncomfortably alongside Dusk\u2019s treatment of Aboriginal presence. Exactly when the book is set is never quite clear but it is clearly late enough for Palawa populations to have been drastically reduced: at one point they are said to have almost disappeared, although later Iris spends a day with a group of Aboriginal peat-cutters. Yet like the ancient leviathans in the riverbed, the novel\u2019s First Peoples seem to belong to a mythical past, one separated from the present of the novel by an occluding gulf of time; certainly there is little sense of the genocidal hatred and violence that was brought to bear upon Tasmania\u2019s Aboriginal peoples in the real world. Simultaneously, however, this starkly beautiful and deeply felt book seems to want to move away from the elegiac mode of most westerns. It is interesting to contrast it with Julia Leigh\u2019s 1999 novel, The Hunter, in which a man pursues a thylacine through the forests of western Tasmania. While the two novels share some of the same gothic trappings, they are very different beasts. In contrast to the emotionally denuded and obsessional textures of Leigh\u2019s novel, Dusk is a book about love: not just the love between the twins but the love they feel for the landscape and, surprisingly, for their dead parents. And, as their quest moves towards its conclusion, they find not loss and pain but instead the possibility of redemption and the \u201cchance to assist in an act that went beyond their own survival. A chance to fix a wrong in the world, and in the process somehow fix a wrong within themselves.\u201d Dusk by Robbie Arnott is out now in Australia (Picador, $34.99)",

Guardian Australia has seen photographs of fallen trees obstructing two fire trails in Bilpin near the Tutti Fruitti cafe and surrounding homes, which were destroyed when the Rural Fire Service lost control of the backburn it lit near Mount Wilson in December 2019. Bilpin resident Martin Tebbutt said the trails had been \u201ccompletely\u201d obstructed for about six weeks and he was concerned there was \u201cjust no maintenance at all\u201d being done on them.

The Unions NSW secretary, Mark Morey, is now calling on the Albanese government to reform the tax concessions and reinvest \u201cprofound savings\u201d in housing, such as by expanding the Housing Australia Future Fund. The peak body for unions in New South Wales conducted a survey of 2,158 workers in October, which found 72% wanted to reduce negative gearing tax concessions and two-thirds (66%) backed reducing capital gains tax concessions on investment properties. Although the results are not necessarily representative because respondents self-selected to answer, the union survey comes on the heels of a Guardian Essential poll finding half the electorate in favour of reforming negative gearing, with just 16% opposed. The union survey found support for reforming negative gearing was particularly high among workers over 65 (82% support), renters (80%), those on incomes under $48,000 (79%) and young people aged 18 to 24 (79%) and 25 to 34 (77%).

Nevertheless, in September the government confirmed reports that treasury is conducting modelling on reform options, prompting several Labor MPs to signal they would be open to reforms. The Greens welcomed the news as evidence Labor was \u201ccracking under pressure from the Greens, renters and first home buyers\u201d. In April, senators David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie release parliamentary budget office advice on five options to reform housing taxes. The most expansive option \u2013 abolishing negative gearing, grandfathering the 50% capital gains tax discount to properties bought before 1 July 2024, and limiting it to new properties built after that date \u2013 would save $9.9bn over four years.

      "bodyText": "Government emergency workers in the US responding to the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina were relocated over the weekend amid concerns that \u201carmed militia\u201d could pose a threat to their safety. According to an email obtained by the Washington Post, a US Forest Service official sent out a message warning that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) \u201chas advised all federal responders Rutherford County, NC, to stand down and evacuate the county immediately\u201d. The message said that soldiers with the national guard \u201chad come across x2 trucks of armed militia saying there were out hunting FEMA\u201d. The Appalachian county of Rutherford incorporates the mountain towns of Rutherfordton, Forest City and Chimney Rock, which were badly hit by Helene floodwaters that tore away homes, washed out roads and killed dozens. The politicization of the response to Helene and later Milton has provided a recruitment opportunity for white supremacist groups who have assembled in devastated regions that government emergency services have struggled to reach as part of a recruitment drive and PR effort. Fema has also long been a target of unfounded anti-government conspiracy theorists \u2013 especially on the US\u2019s far right \u2013 going back more than a decade. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that white nationalist groups, including Patriot Front, had joined recovery efforts in Florida and in the Carolinas. An X post from western North Carolina read: \u201cWe in Patriot Front are here to help out the local communities \u2026 Our politicians can hem and haw and switch over quickly to their talking points about Israel, but we truly are supporting our communities and being America first.\u201d A Guardian report from 2020 described people in Corbett, Oregon, being stopped at armed civilian checkpoints and asked to identify themselves during wildfires, sparking a debate about vigilante activity and how law enforcement should respond. The Forest Service email, since confirmed to be authentic according to the Washington Post, said that incident management teams \u201chave been notified and are coordinating the evacuation of all assigned personnel in that county\u201d. A Forest Service official said Helene responders moved to a \u201csafe area\u201d and some emergency response work in that area had been paused on Saturday before resuming a day later. Fema had reportedly responded to the threats by ceasing to go door-to-door and instead were operating from fixed locations. \u201cFor the safety of our dedicated staff and the disaster survivors we are helping, Fema has made some operational adjustments\u201d, an anonymous official told the Post. In the weeks since Helene hit the region, US government officials have battled misinformation, including conspiracy theories that the hurricane was manipulated by the government in part to force people off their land to make way for lithium mining projects. Federal officials co-ordinating the Helene response have been subjected to antisemitic attacks that travel alongside anti-government conspiracy theories, according to a report by the non-profit Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). Tensions between residents and government emergency workers resulted in harassment, Riva Duncan, a former Forest Service official in the area, including some being told: \u201cWe don\u2019t want the government here\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible because a lot of these folks who need assistance are refusing it because they believe the stuff people are saying about Fema and the government,\u201d Duncan told the Post. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sad because they are probably the ones who need the help the most.\u201d The tensions come as aid groups have flooded the area of western North Carolina. A resident reportedly threatened Fema personnel stationed in a trailer next to a supplies distribution center manned by the Cajun Navy Relief organisation and the Baptist church. Local police confirmed the incident. Anti-government sentiment and disinformation have spread far beyond Appalachia, with the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, accused of echoing misinformation for political gain. Some Republicans have even claimed the US government can control the weather, triggering widespread condemnation, especially by local Republican figures. In remarks to a North Carolina church congregation on Sunday, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, issued a veiled condemnation of the phenomenon. \u201cThere are some who are not acting in the spirit of community and I am speaking of those who have been literally not telling the truth, lying, about people who are working hard to help those in need.

Martyn Blake denies the murder of 24-year-old Chris Kaba on 5 September 2022 in Streatham, south London. The Audi Q8 Kaba was driving had been forced to stop by police who believed it was linked to a firearms incident the previous night in nearby Brixton. Blake, 40, told the jury at the Old Bailey he had never fired his gun at a suspect before in six years serving as an armed officer. Officers had followed the Audi that Kaba was driving and having forced it to stop jumped out of their vehicles as they raced to \u201cextract\u201d the driver, shouting \u201carmed police\u201d and \u201cshow me your hands\u201d. Previous police witnesses, as well as Blake, said the Audi tried to escape, and the firearms officer said he heard the revving of engines and the screech of tyres. The court heard how Blake rushed out of his marked police BMW, which was blocking the Audi at the front, and fired a single shot in 17 seconds. Blake, questioned by his barrister, Patrick Gibbs KC, and with Kaba\u2019s family just feet away, was asked: \u201cWhy did you pull the trigger?\u201d The officer replied: \u201cI had a genuine belief that there was an imminent threat to life, I thought one or more of my colleagues was about to die. \u201cI thought I was the only person with effective firearms cover at the time. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t acted I thought one of my colleagues would be dead. I felt I had a duty to protect them at the time.\u201d Blake shot Kaba through the car\u2019s windscreen, with the bullet striking him in the head. He was pronounced dead little more than two hours later. The firearms officer said he had followed his training and aimed at the central body mass aiming to \u201cincapacitate\u201d the driver, not kill him. Blake told the jury he believed the vehicle must be stopped because of the danger it posed, with Kaba having rammed the police car blocking him at the front and reversed. The defendant added he was unaware that seconds after the standoff started, a police car to the rear of Kaba\u2019s Audi had moved in to tighten the block. The prosecution says that when Blake fired, Kaba\u2019s car was stationary and boxed in at the front and rear. The prosecution has told the jury that the Audi never reached a speed of more than 12 miles an hour once it was blocked in. Blake had exited his car and then raised his weapon into the aim position, helped by a laser sight. He told the court he could see that his colleagues, trying to detain Kaba, were close to the car. Some, he added, were \u201cin touching distance\u201d trying to break the Audi\u2019s windows: \u201cAfter the shot, the revs ceased straight away.\u201d He said in the dark he had fired, aiming above the steering wheel believing that was the best chance of hitting the central body mass of the driver. Blake said every firearms officer thought being in a position where they had to open fire \u201cwon\u2019t happen to them\u201d. He said while he did not intend to kill, when he opened fire he was aware it was a possibility and that he did so \u201cbecause of the threat to my colleagues\u201d. Blake added that after firing he felt both \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cnumb\u201d and the incident played through his mind repeatedly in the following weeks .

Rasmus Paludan, the leader of the Danish political party Stram Kurs (Hard Line), is the first person to go on trial in Sweden in relation to Qur\u2019an burnings. He refused to attend Malm\u00f6 district court as proceedings began on Monday, saying his life would be in danger if he went to the southern Swedish city. Instead, he appeared by video link from an undisclosed location in Sweden. Paludan, 42, is charged with two counts of incitement against an ethnic group and one count of insult in relation to gatherings held in Sweden in 2022. In April of that year, Paludan held a public meeting that was followed by riots in Swedish cities including Malm\u00f6, Landskrona, Link\u00f6ping and \u00d6rebro during the Easter weekend. At the meeting he made several statements that the prosecutor alleges were incitement against an ethnic group. At another meeting, in September 2022, Paludan is accused of racially motivated verbal attacks on \u201cArabs and Africans\u201d. For this he is charged with insult, a crime that under Swedish law is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to six months. Paludan denies all the charges. Taking the stand remotely, Paludan said: \u201cI am a critic of Islam and criticise Islam. Not Muslims.\u201d He added: \u201cI want to criticise ideas not people.\u201d In the summer of 2023 a string of Qur\u2019an burning protests in Sweden, including outside parliament, prompted domestic debate over Sweden\u2019s exceptionally liberal freedom of expression laws. It also led to a diplomatic row between Sweden and Muslim countries. Paludan\u2019s burning of the Qur\u2019an outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm in January 2023 is widely thought to have slowed Sweden\u2019s passage to Nato membership. Vilhelm Persson, a law professor at Lund University, said Paludan\u2019s trial had \u201ca fundamental significance\u201d in that it was the first case to be tried in connection to burning of the Qur\u2019an.

Very happy with the result, plenty to come still.\u201d There was no foul-mouthed outburst from Ainslie on Monday after he called the New Zealand commentator, Stephen McIvor, a \u201cfucking wanker\u201d on Sunday for suggesting New Zealand were the better team. The commentators joked that on Monday they played rock-paper-scissors to choose who would ask Ainslie the first question. \u201cIt was a good race with a good start,\u201d Ainslie said. \u201cThey did really well and we need to figure out how to take it to them. We are going to keep going and push all the way here, we can still come back from this. \u201cClearly, they\u2019re going well. I think we have our moments but there are moments when we are losing a click and that\u2019s really the difference. It\u2019s a good opportunity to take a day on shore and try to figure out how we can find some gains.\u201d Leigh McMillan, trimmer on the Britannia, was optimistic after his team\u2019s best outing so far. \u201cIt\u2019s not big steps that we have to make but little ones and I think we\u2019re making those steps,\u201d he said. With racing due to resume on Wednesday, they have a day to think about how to turn it around against a New Zealand crew who seem supremely composed and at ease. They exude that same self-belief we have seen over the years from the All Blacks, the sense it is not just the will to win but a mindset that does not entertain the possibility of losing. However, despite a four-race lead in the best of 13 competition, the New Zealand team won\u2019t relax until the job is done. They will not have forgotten how in 2013 they led 8-1 in a 17-race series before the US team came back to win the next eight races. The boat that beat them was the Oracle and the tactician was none other than Ainslie. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2024. An earlier version referred to Ben Ainslie as the skipper of the US team in 2013, whereas he was the tactician from race six to 19.",

Wigglesworth will continue to oversee England\u2019s attack but takes on additional leadership responsibility as well as developing the overall gameplan with New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Japan due at Twickenham next month. It is said Wigglesworth played a key role in convincing Borthwick to adopt a more attacking gameplan during the Six Nations this year \u2013 a move that paid off immediately with victory against Ireland. His promotion demonstrates his value to Borthwick, who has endured a summer of turmoil with the departures of Aled Walters and Felix Jones from his backroom staff.

His remit has always been attack, though there were question marks over his future when it was announced Jones would join after the 2023 World Cup.

      "body": "<p><em><strong>This is the third in a series of three stories on the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election in Shasta county, a region of </strong></em><em><strong>180,000 people in northern California that has emerged as a center of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/03/mike-lindell-shasta-county-california-dominion-voting-systems\">election denial movement</a></strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>and hotbed for far-right politics.

Since gaining a majority on Shasta county\u2019s governing body, they have managed to spark an exodus of government workers, attempted to do away with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/16/california-shasta-county-counting-votes-election-deniers\">voting system</a> and fought the state over policies pertaining to Covid-19 and the second amendment.</p> <p>Earlier this year, voters in the community of 180,000 \u2013 perhaps tired of Shasta\u2019s national notoriety as a hotbed for extremist politics and election denialism \u2013 declared they had had enough. In a stunning rebuke, they voted out a far-right leader by an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/28/california-voters-election-denialism-kevin-crye-recall\">enormous margin</a>, handing his seat to a political newcomer.</p> <p>Matt Plummer, a Yale-educated former college football player who owns a corporate training business, pledged to provide an alternative to the \u201chostility and division\u201d tearing Shasta apart. Supporters view Plummer, with his focus on issues such as crime, roads and homelessness, as someone who can help the community chart a path out of the upheaval.</p> <p>But others are concerned about Plummer\u2019s connection to another powerful and ultra-conservative force that has reshaped the region: Bethel church. The megachurch has more than 11,000 members, including Plummer, and a school of \u201csupernatural ministry\u201d that serves 2,000 students a year.</p>    <p>Bethel leaders once <a href=\"https://www.christianpost.com/news/god-is-going-to-end-impeachment-give-trump-another-term-bethels-kris-vallotton-prophesies.html\">said</a> that God wanted Donald Trump to have a second term and have claimed that Joe Biden won the 2020 election by \u201c<a href=\"https://shastascout.org/bethels-bill-johnson-calls-bidens-election-100-fraud/\">fraud</a>\u201d. Church members have become major players in local government \u2013 three of the five members on the city council in Redding, the county seat, attend Bethel. The city\u2019s vice-mayor is a church elder.</p> <p>The church is involved in nearly every part of Shasta county, and is a cornerstone of the local economy, said Doni Chamberlain, a longtime local journalist and chronicler of the area.</p> <p>Shasta\u2019s extreme political landscape has forced residents to choose between a toxic rightwing movement and a church that also has deeply conservative and extreme beliefs, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the bind we\u2019re in,\u201d she said. \u201cShasta county is in this weird extremist sandwich where we have the rightwing pushing for guns and splitting the state. And there is the other extreme side of the sandwich that is Bethel church. Then the middle where people are trying to figure out how to survive in this place.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Before Shasta county garnered national attention for its fierce opposition to Covid-19 restrictions and efforts to institute a hand-count voting system favored by those who believe lies about election fraud, it was Bethel church that raised the region\u2019s profile.</p> <p>There are churches \u2013 of which Shasta county has plenty \u2013 and then there is Bethel, a behemoth institution without parallel in the area. First established in a private home in 1952, it now has more than 11,000 members \u2013 more than 10% of the population in the city of Redding \u2013 where the church is based.</p> <p>Bethel\u2019s transformation came under the direction of Bill Johnson, the son of a long-serving pastor who began leading the church with Beni, his wife, in 1996. The church has grown significantly, opening a school, a youth outreach program and Bethel Music, a record label that produces popular worship music and reported $18m in revenue in 2023. Justin Bieber is a fan and has filmed himself covering a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92W4mmGVcDc\">song</a> from a Bethel artist. Today several of Johnson\u2019s children work as senior leaders in the church.</p> <p>But it\u2019s Bethel\u2019s school of supernatural ministry, which has been called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mollyhensleyclancy/meet-the-young-saints-of-bethel-who-go-to-college-to\">Christian Hogwarts</a>\u201d, that is often credited with its growth. The program was founded by Kris and Kathy Vallotton, the senior leaders of the church, and teaches students that they can perform miracles and heal through prayer. \u201cStudents will learn how to read, understand, and \u2018do\u2019 the Bible, how to practice His presence, to witness, heal the sick, prophesy, preach, pray, cast out demons and much more,\u201d the school website states.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/shasha-county-elections-office-california\">How an ultra-right majority in California\u2019s far north picked a novice to run its elections</a> </p> </aside>  <p>People travel to Redding from around the world, more than 100 countries, to attend the vocational program. Students have been known to approach people in the city, particularly those in casts or with walkers, to offer prayers for healing. The focus on \u201csupernatural power\u201d is fundamental to the church, which in <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/21/bethel-church-prayer-hasnt-brought-olive-back-life/2724417001/\">2019</a> asked members to pray for the resurrection of a two-year-old girl.</p> <p>Bethel has long believed in the power of healing people through prayer. Chamberlain joined the church as a child after her mother died and her siblings were adopted by a local couple who were members. When they learned that Chamberlain and her twin sister had a neurological disorder that caused involuntary movements, church elders came to treat their \u201cdemons\u201d and the children were made to throw away their medications, Chamberlain recalled.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have a bunch of adults circling around you and putting their hands on your heads and shaking you, it was pretty intimidating,\u201d she said, adding that they coached her on how to speak in tongues.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like being waterboarded, you just give up and give in so they leave you alone. Then you\u2019re in the club.\u201d</p> <p>Since its founding in 1998, Bethel\u2019s supernatural school has brought thousands of people to Redding. They are a visible presence around the city, in its grocery stores and the hip cafes and bakeries operated by Bethel members. And as the church\u2019s footprint has grown, so too has criticism of its role.</p> <p>Supporters say the church has been a positive force in Redding and that it\u2019s natural for a large institution to attract scrutiny but that members want to be a part of the community in which they live. They often point to local volunteer work or when the church donated money to fund police positions in Redding and began leasing the local auditorium when it appeared the city would have to close it down.</p> <p>Bethel did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>    <p>But other Shasta county residents argue the church has changed the fabric of the community and worsened an existing housing shortage by drawing thousands of students to the area while driving up costs.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look from the outside in, there seems to be positives. They\u2019ve done good things, but I don\u2019t feel like on balance what they\u2019ve done is for the good of the community in general,\u201d said Robert Sid, a Shasta county resident who supported Plummer. \u201cTheir Hogwarts supernatural ministry has really played into flooding the market and artificially pricing things that the regular Redding person can\u2019t afford.\u201d</p> <p>Critics have expressed discomfort with church members who hold key positions in local government voting on proposals from Bethel to expand. Some residents have joined a Facebook group to identify businesses connected to the church.</p> <p>\u201c[The owners] tithe to the church. If you patronize a Bethel-affiliated business then now some of those profits are being tithed to the church. You\u2019re kind of indirectly supporting the church by doing that,\u201d said Rachel Strickland, who started the group. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p> <p>And for some in this deeply conservative region, where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one, the church\u2019s political ties have been cause for concern as well. Religious experts have described it as closely related to the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement built around the idea of modern-day prophets and apostles that aims to have Christians transform society and rule over key political and cultural institutions, referred to as the \u201cSeven Mountain Mandate\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson co-authored a book, Invading Babylon: the 7 Mountain Mandate, which advises Christians to exert influence in seven core areas: church, family, education, government, media, arts and commerce.</p> <p>Matthew D Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish studies who has studied Bethel, argued that the church appears to be trying to implement the Seven Mountain Mandate in its community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/shasta-county-elections-redding-far-right-voting-covid\">Extremist politics divided this conservative California community. What will it take to turn the tide?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think they very much intend to enact this bigger vision of Christian supremacy and Christian dominance in the Redding area. It doesn\u2019t mean they are always overt about that,\u201d said Taylor, the author of a book on the New Apostolic Reformation for which he interviewed Johnson.</p> <p>Bethel leaders endorsed Donald Trump, and in 2021 one <a href=\"https://krisvallotton.com/my-apology\">apologized</a> for incorrectly prophesying that he would win a second term. The church has come out against efforts to restrict conversion therapy. In <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pastors-worship-leaders-pray-for-trump-in-oval-office-amid-impeachment-fight\">2019</a>, several figures associated with the church attended an Oval Office event with Trump to pray over the president. Bethel has sought to distance itself from January 6, however, Taylor said.</p> <p>\u201cThey are trying to tone down public rhetoric and make themselves [seem] less extreme than they are but as far as I can tell they haven\u2019t moderated their extremism. They are just trying to package it in a better way,\u201d he argued.</p> <p>The church has long emphasized that the beliefs of individual church members are not necessarily reflective of the church\u2019s positions. Chamberlain, who left the church as a young adult, argues it is important to distinguish between the church leadership and its members.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to separate the leaders of the church, the people who are millionaires and drive expensive cars, cars that cost as much as somebody might pay for a house. They have vacation homes and eat at The French Laundry,\u201d Chamberlain said.</p> <p>They live a life of the rich and famous, she added, while some Bethel members, and students, leave their homes abroad and live in extreme poverty to be close to the church.</p> <p>Members point out that they are not a monolith.</p> <p>Matt Plummer\u2019s journey to Redding began the same way thousands of others have \u2013 with Bethel. He moved to the city in 2016 with his wife and daughters to attend the church, and remains a member, he said in an interview with the Guardian.</p> <p>Plummer, who grew up in rural New Jersey where his first job was on a horse farm, was drawn to the region\u2019s access to nature from hiking to swimming holes, he said, and the family has developed deep ties to the area.</p> <p>He decided to run for the board of supervisors after working in several political campaigns and seeing the intense polarization and problems that have plagued Shasta county.</p> <p>\u201cWe have tied basically for the highest suicide rate in the state. You have one of the highest rates of childhood trauma and one of the highest rates of kids being born with drug withdrawal effects,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a pretty cool community that has a lot to offer but at the same time if you look at all these dimensions of what makes a community thrive, we\u2019re trailing.\u201d</p>    <p>He had a tough race ahead of him seeking to unseat Patrick Jones, who previously served on the Redding city council and had been a supervisor for three years as well as a leader of the anti-establishment movement that has come to define local politics.</p> <p>Jones, a gun store manager, led some of the county\u2019s most controversial efforts, including attempting to upend the voting system and moving to allow people to carry firearms in public buildings in violation of state law. He also spread conspiracy theories, telling a conservative national news outlet: \u201cElections have been manipulated at the county level for decades.\u201d</p> <p>He once responded to a reporter\u2019s query by telling them to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/shasta-county-official-lashes-out-after-gun-vote-18264432.php\">drop dead</a>\u201d.</p> <p>While polarizing, Jones was well-known and had been in politics for years, Plummer said, and had the backing of a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-16/shasta-county-recall-election-reverge-anselmo-payback\">Connecticut magnate</a> who has poured millions of dollars into local elections.</p> <p>Plummer made up for that by making personal contact, and personally knocked on about 9,000 doors, he said (there are about 23,000 registered voters in his district).</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>People care if you show up and meet them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He sought to stay out of ideological debates and focus on what residents were worried about, primarily public safety, roads and homelessness. The number of unhoused residents has <a href=\"https://www.redding.com/story/news/2024/04/02/shasta-leaders-and-residents-discuss-causes-answers-for-homelessness/73034297007/\">grown significantly</a> in recent years from 793 in 2022 to 1,013 people in 2023.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>My opponent had been on the board almost four years and he had been on city council for eight years, which had some jurisdiction over the same things. And they had all gotten worse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His affiliation with Bethel was a concern, he acknowledged, one he tried to address and alleviate. \u201cI\u2019m not speaking on stage and not this type of celebrity at Bethel. I just go there on a Sunday morning.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cOne of the things I said is: \u2018I\u2019m not running to represent Bethel and so my job is not to defend Bethel\u2019 and so when people would attack Bethel for things, I\u2019d say OK, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s actually not my priority here,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Strickland, who has described Bethel as a cult, said the choice put the community in a tough position, but that even in her Facebook group people seemed to be leaning toward Plummer. \u201cFor me Patrick Jones is much more dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Plummer received the endorsement of Chamberlain\u2019s publication, A News Cafe, drawing backlash from some readers who started referring to the outlet as Bethel Cafe.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a tough call. I have a problem with Bethel on a lot of levels, but just kind of putting on your thinking cap sometimes the Bethel candidates were the best choice for the positions,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cDo we vote for Patrick Jones who is pushing guns and open carry? Or do we vote for Matt Plummer who is a Bethel member? He\u2019s also articulate, educated and smart.\u201d</p> <p>And in the current political climate in the county, Chamberlain mused, few people would want to subject themselves to running for office. \u201cThe Bethel people are kind of impervious to it. It\u2019s scriptural.\u201d</p>",

Read the first and second story. For years, an extremist far-right movement has worked to transform one of California\u2019s most conservative regions. Since gaining a majority on Shasta county\u2019s governing body, they have managed to spark an exodus of government workers, attempted to do away with the voting system and fought the state over policies pertaining to Covid-19 and the second amendment.

There are churches \u2013 of which Shasta county has plenty \u2013 and then there is Bethel, a behemoth institution without parallel in the area. First established in a private home in 1952, it now has more than 11,000 members \u2013 more than 10% of the population in the city of Redding \u2013 where the church is based. Bethel\u2019s transformation came under the direction of Bill Johnson, the son of a long-serving pastor who began leading the church with Beni, his wife, in 1996. The church has grown significantly, opening a school, a youth outreach program and Bethel Music, a record label that produces popular worship music and reported $18m in revenue in 2023. Justin Bieber is a fan and has filmed himself covering a song from a Bethel artist. Today several of Johnson\u2019s children work as senior leaders in the church. But it\u2019s Bethel\u2019s school of supernatural ministry, which has been called a \u201cChristian Hogwarts\u201d, that is often credited with its growth. The program was founded by Kris and Kathy Vallotton, the senior leaders of the church, and teaches students that they can perform miracles and heal through prayer. \u201cStudents will learn how to read, understand, and \u2018do\u2019 the Bible, how to practice His presence, to witness, heal the sick, prophesy, preach, pray, cast out demons and much more,\u201d the school website states. People travel to Redding from around the world, more than 100 countries, to attend the vocational program. Students have been known to approach people in the city, particularly those in casts or with walkers, to offer prayers for healing. The focus on \u201csupernatural power\u201d is fundamental to the church, which in 2019 asked members to pray for the resurrection of a two-year-old girl. Bethel has long believed in the power of healing people through prayer. Chamberlain joined the church as a child after her mother died and her siblings were adopted by a local couple who were members. When they learned that Chamberlain and her twin sister had a neurological disorder that caused involuntary movements, church elders came to treat their \u201cdemons\u201d and the children were made to throw away their medications, Chamberlain recalled. \u201cWhen you have a bunch of adults circling around you and putting their hands on your heads and shaking you, it was pretty intimidating,\u201d she said, adding that they coached her on how to speak in tongues. \u201cIt\u2019s like being waterboarded, you just give up and give in so they leave you alone. Then you\u2019re in the club.\u201d Since its founding in 1998, Bethel\u2019s supernatural school has brought thousands of people to Redding. They are a visible presence around the city, in its grocery stores and the hip cafes and bakeries operated by Bethel members. And as the church\u2019s footprint has grown, so too has criticism of its role. Supporters say the church has been a positive force in Redding and that it\u2019s natural for a large institution to attract scrutiny but that members want to be a part of the community in which they live. They often point to local volunteer work or when the church donated money to fund police positions in Redding and began leasing the local auditorium when it appeared the city would have to close it down. Bethel did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But other Shasta county residents argue the church has changed the fabric of the community and worsened an existing housing shortage by drawing thousands of students to the area while driving up costs. \u201cIf you look from the outside in, there seems to be positives. They\u2019ve done good things, but I don\u2019t feel like on balance what they\u2019ve done is for the good of the community in general,\u201d said Robert Sid, a Shasta county resident who supported Plummer. \u201cTheir Hogwarts supernatural ministry has really played into flooding the market and artificially pricing things that the regular Redding person can\u2019t afford.\u201d Critics have expressed discomfort with church members who hold key positions in local government voting on proposals from Bethel to expand. Some residents have joined a Facebook group to identify businesses connected to the church. \u201c[The owners] tithe to the church. If you patronize a Bethel-affiliated business then now some of those profits are being tithed to the church. You\u2019re kind of indirectly supporting the church by doing that,\u201d said Rachel Strickland, who started the group. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d And for some in this deeply conservative region, where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one, the church\u2019s political ties have been cause for concern as well. Religious experts have described it as closely related to the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement built around the idea of modern-day prophets and apostles that aims to have Christians transform society and rule over key political and cultural institutions, referred to as the \u201cSeven Mountain Mandate\u201d. Johnson co-authored a book, Invading Babylon: the 7 Mountain Mandate, which advises Christians to exert influence in seven core areas: church, family, education, government, media, arts and commerce. Matthew D Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish studies who has studied Bethel, argued that the church appears to be trying to implement the Seven Mountain Mandate in its community. \u201cI think they very much intend to enact this bigger vision of Christian supremacy and Christian dominance in the Redding area. It doesn\u2019t mean they are always overt about that,\u201d said Taylor, the author of a book on the New Apostolic Reformation for which he interviewed Johnson. Bethel leaders endorsed Donald Trump, and in 2021 one apologized for incorrectly prophesying that he would win a second term. The church has come out against efforts to restrict conversion therapy. In 2019, several figures associated with the church attended an Oval Office event with Trump to pray over the president. Bethel has sought to distance itself from January 6, however, Taylor said. \u201cThey are trying to tone down public rhetoric and make themselves [seem] less extreme than they are but as far as I can tell they haven\u2019t moderated their extremism. They are just trying to package it in a better way,\u201d he argued. The church has long emphasized that the beliefs of individual church members are not necessarily reflective of the church\u2019s positions. Chamberlain, who left the church as a young adult, argues it is important to distinguish between the church leadership and its members. \u201cYou have to separate the leaders of the church, the people who are millionaires and drive expensive cars, cars that cost as much as somebody might pay for a house. They have vacation homes and eat at The French Laundry,\u201d Chamberlain said. They live a life of the rich and famous, she added, while some Bethel members, and students, leave their homes abroad and live in extreme poverty to be close to the church. Members point out that they are not a monolith. Matt Plummer\u2019s journey to Redding began the same way thousands of others have \u2013 with Bethel. He moved to the city in 2016 with his wife and daughters to attend the church, and remains a member, he said in an interview with the Guardian. Plummer, who grew up in rural New Jersey where his first job was on a horse farm, was drawn to the region\u2019s access to nature from hiking to swimming holes, he said, and the family has developed deep ties to the area. He decided to run for the board of supervisors after working in several political campaigns and seeing the intense polarization and problems that have plagued Shasta county. \u201cWe have tied basically for the highest suicide rate in the state. You have one of the highest rates of childhood trauma and one of the highest rates of kids being born with drug withdrawal effects,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a pretty cool community that has a lot to offer but at the same time if you look at all these dimensions of what makes a community thrive, we\u2019re trailing.\u201d He had a tough race ahead of him seeking to unseat Patrick Jones, who previously served on the Redding city council and had been a supervisor for three years as well as a leader of the anti-establishment movement that has come to define local politics. Jones, a gun store manager, led some of the county\u2019s most controversial efforts, including attempting to upend the voting system and moving to allow people to carry firearms in public buildings in violation of state law. He also spread conspiracy theories, telling a conservative national news outlet: \u201cElections have been manipulated at the county level for decades.\u201d He once responded to a reporter\u2019s query by telling them to \u201cdrop dead\u201d. While polarizing, Jones was well-known and had been in politics for years, Plummer said, and had the backing of a Connecticut magnate who has poured millions of dollars into local elections. Plummer made up for that by making personal contact, and personally knocked on about 9,000 doors, he said (there are about 23,000 registered voters in his district). \u201cPeople care if you show up and meet them,\u201d he said. He sought to stay out of ideological debates and focus on what residents were worried about, primarily public safety, roads and homelessness. The number of unhoused residents has grown significantly in recent years from 793 in 2022 to 1,013 people in 2023. \u201cMy opponent had been on the board almost four years and he had been on city council for eight years, which had some jurisdiction over the same things. And they had all gotten worse,\u201d he said. His affiliation with Bethel was a concern, he acknowledged, one he tried to address and alleviate. \u201cI\u2019m not speaking on stage and not this type of celebrity at Bethel. I just go there on a Sunday morning.\u201d \u201cOne of the things I said is: \u2018I\u2019m not running to represent Bethel and so my job is not to defend Bethel\u2019 and so when people would attack Bethel for things, I\u2019d say OK, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s actually not my priority here,\u201d he said. Strickland, who has described Bethel as a cult, said the choice put the community in a tough position, but that even in her Facebook group people seemed to be leaning toward Plummer. \u201cFor me Patrick Jones is much more dangerous.\u201d Plummer received the endorsement of Chamberlain\u2019s publication, A News Cafe, drawing backlash from some readers who started referring to the outlet as Bethel Cafe. \u201cIt was a tough call. I have a problem with Bethel on a lot of levels, but just kind of putting on your thinking cap sometimes the Bethel candidates were the best choice for the positions,\u201d she said. \u201cDo we vote for Patrick Jones who is pushing guns and open carry? Or do we vote for Matt Plummer who is a Bethel member? He\u2019s also articulate, educated and smart.\u201d And in the current political climate in the county, Chamberlain mused, few people would want to subject themselves to running for office. \u201cThe Bethel people are kind of impervious to it. It\u2019s scriptural.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Chinese military and coastguard personnel surrounded Taiwan\u2019s main island on Monday for a day of large-scale drills that Beijing said were a warning against \u201cseparatist acts\u201d, in the wake of a recent speech by Taiwan\u2019s president. State media linked the drills to a National Day speech last Thursday by Taiwan\u2019s president, Lai Ching-te, in which he repeated that the People\u2019s Republic of China \u201chas no right to represent Taiwan\u201d, but that he was willing to work with it to maintain peace and stability. The drills began before dawn and without prior notice. The People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) said all branches of the military were approaching Taiwan by sea and air, including in a strike group led by one of China\u2019s two active aircraft carriers, the Liaoning. The joint drills focused on sea and air combat readiness, blockading key Taiwanese ports and areas, and assaults on maritime and ground targets, said the eastern theatre command\u2019s spokesperson, senior captain Li Xi. \u201cThe drill also serves as a stern warning to the separatist acts of \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 forces,\u201d Li added. The PLA did not announce any live-fire or no-fly zones. Provided maps showed nine declared zones for the exercises, including six large areas near Taiwan\u2019s major ports. At the same time the Chinese coastguard, which is separate to the military but serves under the same commanding body, announced \u201claw enforcement patrols\u201d around the main Taiwan island in what it said was \u201ca practical action to control Taiwan Island in accordance with the law based on the one-China principle\u201d. However, ship tracking data seen by the Guardian showed Chinese coastguard vessels did not track around Taiwan\u2019s southern end. The PLA said shortly after 6pm local time that the drills had been \u201ccompleted successfully\u201d. At a press conference on Monday afternoon, Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry said the PLA activity was \u201cwithin expectations\u201d of its knowledge of China\u2019s capabilities. A record number of 125 aircraft were spotted, with 90 entering Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone. It also detected 17 military ships and 17 coastguard ships, with some of the latter entering restricted waters around Taiwan\u2019s outer islands, which the ministry decried as \u201charassment\u201d and cognitive warfare. No vessels from China\u2019s maritime militia \u2013 a paramilitary fleet of fishing boats \u2013 were seen. About double the usual number of daily cyber-attacks were detected and disrupted, the ministry said. They were also investigating whether a Chinese man\u2019s attempt to motor an inflatable dinghy to a Taiwanese island a few miles from China was part of the drills. Earlier, Beijing authorities also announced three Taiwanese additions to its list of sanctioned \u201cdie-hard secessionists\u201d. The additions included Puma Shen, a legislator who co-founded the Kuma Academy civilian defence organisation, Robert Tsao, a Taiwanese billionaire who has funded civilian defence projects including the Kuma Academy, and the academy itself. Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council called Monday\u2019s drills \u201cblatant provocations\u201d that seriously undermined regional peace and stability. The ministry of foreign affairs called on Beijing to \u201cpull back from the brink of a precipice\u201d, while the president\u2019s office urged Beijing to accept the \u201cgoodwill\u201d offered in Lai\u2019s speech. It said Lai had convened a national security meeting to respond. Taiwan also deployed war ships and planes and land-based radar systems in response. In Washington, officials from the Biden administration urged Beijing to act with restraint, and said they were monitoring the drills and there was no justification for them after Lai\u2019s \u201croutine\u201d speech. On Monday afternoon, Beijing stood by its actions. \u201cTaiwan independence and peace in the Taiwan strait are irreconcilable,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular press briefing. China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, claims Taiwan is a Chinese province and has urged it to accept what he calls \u201cpeaceful reunification\u201d. But an overwhelming majority of Taiwan\u2019s people and parliament reject the prospect of Communist party rule. In response, Beijing has escalated military exercises and incursions into Taiwan\u2019s air defence zone, as well as cognitive, technological and economic warfare, and mass disinformation campaigns. US intelligence reportedly claims Xi has instructed the military to be capable of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan by 2027. Lai\u2019s National Day speech was seen by analysts as restrained, and more measured than his May inauguration speech. Writing for the Council on Foreign Relations, David Sacks said on Friday that if China were to react aggressively to it, then \u201cLai may very well conclude (not without reason) that there is little to be gained through restraint and may embrace more explicit rhetoric on cross-strait relations\u201d. Monday\u2019s exercises, codenamed \u201cJoint Sword 2024B\u201d, had been largely expected by observers. Exercises named \u201cJoint Sword 2024A\u201d were launched after Lai\u2019s inauguration, the \u201cA\u201d suffix suggesting there were more to come this year. The PLA regularly runs military drills and at least one or two a year have focused on an invasion or blockade of Taiwan. Such military drills take substantial preparation but are usually linked to a speech or action in Taiwan which Beijing says it finds provocative. Military analysts have warned each new set of drills has demonstrated strategic escalation in the PLA\u2019s approach to Taiwan, even if there appears to be less firepower. Last month China test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time since the 1980s. The missile landed in the south Pacific, near French Polynesia, prompting statements of concern from Pacific nations. Last week China also participated in joint drills with Russia. On Monday, Russian state media said the two militaries were continuing with anti-submarine firing exercises in the north-west Pacific.",

      "bodyText": "Righto, that\u2019s all from me for now, but check back on site for Stephen Bergen\u2019s report. Thanks for your company \u2013 ta-ra. The NZ team look pretty chuffed. They\u2019ll know that GB are improving, but then so are they. Dylan Fletcher, meanwhile, says it was good to have a proper race after yesterday, but agrees his team need to find a way of making gains. \u201cIt\u2019s getting closer and closer,\u201d reckons Leigh McMillan, and one more little click should send it GB\u2019s way. Maybe \u2026 but I\u2019m not convinced NZ are just going to stand still. Ainslie, meanwhile, thinks it was a good race. GB got a good start and the first cross, but NZ are sailing really well, so his team need to find a way of finding some gains. NZ are happy, their captain Nathan Outteridge saying it was a tight start. But once they were able to tack off the left-side boundary, once they got to the right, which they thought was pretty strong, they were able to get back into the race, making big strides in the team\u2019s performance and that of the boat. So need three more victories to retain the trophy. GB started well, but when it came down to it couldn\u2019t get close. Here come NZ to claim that 4-0\u2026 This is turning into something of a lesson for GB \u2013 they were in this race until they weren\u2019t, and once NZ made the crucial move, the gap between the sides, now 312m, has only increased. But there\u2019s a chasm in class too, measurable not in metres but in the 4-0 scoreline that is surely imminent. As our crews turn for the final time, NZ lead by 24s, and this looks five to over. It\u2019ll take a major error from the defenders to allow GB back in. I can\u2019t see it. The finish line has been moved a little, we\u2019re told, but the gap is now 224m and that\u2019ll take quite some closing. If NZ keep the head, they\u2019ll go 4-0 in front. GB draw nearer but NZ extend again, able to keep going straight as the challengers tack. With just a leg and half to go, they need to find something as quickly. NZ turn first into leg five, GB following 15 seconds behind. Can they find a route through the water that allows them to close the gap? NZ still lead as we near the end of leg four, and though any error will leave GB in position to punish them, you can\u2019t help but wonder if class is telling. \u201cThis high tech, person-free yachting leaves me cold,\u201d emails Andrew Benton. \u201cBring back the good old days of crews perched in a line on one side as the boat leans at an alarming angle to the other. A complete contrast to the Asian Dragonboat races competition I watched this past weekend \u2013 individual power, stamina, technique, skill and coordination in abundance. Who needs tech, eh? I know which I prefer.\u201d I know what you mean. But I guess, like F1, when the sport is tech-based, the march of that tech is always likely to dictate change in the name of progress. At halfway, NZ still lead, 13 seconds to the good. Can GB find something? You can\u2019t help but wonder, though, if NZ are just a little too good, maintaining and extending their lead. There\u2019s still plenty of time for GB to come back at them, though, and, as I type, they close the gap a little. But it\u2019s now at 120m, so Ainslie and crew need to find something. Both boats look strong as we near the halfway point of leg three. NZ still lead, but GB are within striking distance, and this could be a helluva finish. As we near the end of leg two, the boats converge, both hitting the bottom gate first time and, as they turn, NZ lead by a fraction. The boats cross, NZ cutting across Britain; Aislie presses the protest button but the umpire doesn\u2019t want ta kna. NZ lead, but GB remain well placed. Britain nick in front at the end and they turn for leg two, NZ picking the quicker side of the water as we see the lads cycling to provide the oil the boats need. Still, there\u2019s almost nothing to choose between the boats as we near the halfway mark of leg two. Britain cross, trying to make it hard for NZ, but end up losing first place and, 9.5kn from the finish, they retake the lead but by very little. This is a proper tussle and NZ zoom past Britain as we near the finish! NZ have to tack while Britain keep moving forward, the lead now six metres. They\u2019re about halfway up the course, Britain still in front but NZ coming back at them in this first leg of six. Britain lead by a little off the start, the gap now just a metre. AND AWAY WE GO! Race four is under way! Twenty seconds to go and all is calm \u2026 ish. Both boats are out and will there be a pre-start clash today? We\u2019re just over three minutes away from the start. The wind limit has been met, so we\u2019re going to have ourselves a race. \u201cWith the exception of Ainslie\u2019s moment of truth to the NZ commentator,\u201d writes Joe Sailing, \u201cthis has been a pretty uninteresting final \u2013 let\u2019s hope that changes today. I am starting to think that making the AC a one-design challenge might be the way to go \u2013 the womens final with GB and Prada was more interesting to watch. Personally I can\u2019t look at this as sailing as it is so far removed from anything connected to \u2018normal\u2019 boats. It\u2019s called the F1 of sailing, but at least F1 cars have four wheels on the ground.\u201d I know what you mean, but I guess the skills required are similar to those necessary for normal sailing. GB\u2019s Matt Gotrel, known as Shrek \u2013 presumably on account of his not insignificant size \u2013 thinks his team have a chance today. He thinks the \u201cgloves will be off\u201d after yesterday\u2019s contretemps, and the squad have come together to get themselves going. Is there anything in the world that\u2019s better than working-day sport? The answer, dear friends, is helltotheno. It is, of course, 60 years since Britain last qualified to compete for the America\u2019s Cup. They beat Italy to earn the right, but the defending champs have been too strong so far. Uncle Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe is now into sailing. Check out Nick Ames\u2019 explainer on his sporting adventures and misadventures. Some absolutely glorious snaps here, along with a potted history lesson. More gen for you here\u2026 So how does it work? Teams must first compete in a series of regattas, culminating in the Louis Vuitton Cup, which determines the main event\u2019s challenger. This year\u2019s matchup will see Team New Zealand as the defender take on Ineos Britannia after the Britons won the right to challenge New Zealand by beating Italy\u2019s Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli comfortably in the decisive race.

Relive John Brewin\u2019s blog of yesterday\u2019s activities\u2026 Yesterday was not a good day for Britain and Ben Ainslie. Already trailing 2-0 to New Zealand, they first erred at the start \u2013 with Ainslie at the wheel \u2013 the ensuing 75m penalty effectively costing them the race. Nor was that the end of the aggravation.

      "bodyText": "The Post Office tried to use selective positive comments about the reliability of the Horizon IT system from a damning high court judgment to try to get police to review a decision not to launch criminal proceedings against a post office operator earlier this year, it has emerged. More than 550 post office operators \u2013 including Alan Bates and Jo Hamilton, who were portrayed in a hit ITV drama on the Horizon IT scandal \u2013 were vindicated in 2019 when a 400-page judgment found the faulty system relied upon to secure the convictions was not \u201cremotely robust\u201d and the Post Office agreed to pay \u00a358m to settle the claims. The public inquiry into the scandal has been shown an exchange of emails between Lancashire police, the senior investigations manager at the Post Office and the organisation\u2019s legal department. Kurt Edwards, in the economic crime unit at Lancashire police, requested \u201cdocumentary evidence\u201d that the Horizon system currently being used was \u201cmore robust\u201d than previous iterations that were full of bugs and errors that resulted in the wrongful prosecution of more than 900 post office operators. The police investigation, Operation Jetfire, involved looking into allegations that owners or employees at an unnamed branch \u201cconspired to commit large-scale money laundering and possibly other fraud offences against the Post Office\u201d. Ultimately the police decided that no further action would be taken. The Post Office sent a letter earlier this year to Edwards offering to \u201cassist\u201d in a review of that decision explaining that the police had \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d court findings about Horizon. \u201cIt is not for the Post Office to influence the independence of the investigation or the assessment of evidence in any case,\u201d the letter shown to the inquiry said. \u201cHowever, the reasoning around the credibility of the Horizon system seems to be a significant factor, if not the central factor, in the reasoning for not progressing this investigation further and that reasoning appears to be based on a misinterpretation of the findings of courts.\u201d Jason Beer, the counsel for the inquiry, said the Post Office had \u201cleant on\u201d selective passages from Mr Justice Fraser\u2019s highly critical Horizon judgment from 2019. The seminal judgment brought the scale of the Horizon scandal to national attention and ultimately paved the way for the overturning of the wrongful convictions and the exoneration of hundreds of post office operators. Beer highlighted parts of passages from the judgment forwarded to police by the Post Office, such as that Horizon was \u201crelatively robust\u201d, that there were only \u201cisolated instances\u201d of bugs and errors compared with pre-2019 versions of the software, and that \u201cexperts agree it is a better system\u201d than its predecessors. Beer asked Nick Read, the chief executive of the Post Office who gave evidence at the inquiry last week, if he was aware of this strategy to use \u201cextracts from a judgment in civil proceedings \u2026 as evidence in criminal proceedings to prove the reliability of the Horizon IT system?\u201d \u201cI was not aware of this investigation,\u201d said Read. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of the level of engagement, candidly.\u201d He added that company policy was that board approval was meant to be sought for \u201cbringing to the table information associated with interaction with law enforcement agencies on specific issues\u201d.

The brief sojourn in Rome, which will be a more prominent part of season 5, regaled us with borderline delphic truths about Italy, such as \u201cPeople [in Italy] are really warm\u201d and \u201ceverybody sits down like a family to eat a delicious lunch\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCliches exist for a reason,\u201d says the character Marcello, Emily\u2019s new love interest.

On a darker note, she might end up in the middle of a neo-fascist rally disguised as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/03/the-lord-of-the-rings-italy-giorgia-meloni-tolkien\">Lord of the Rings-themed event</a>. Overall, she\u2019d live in a country that still abides by what 19th-century author Giovanni Verga called the <a href=\"https://www.openlettersmonthlyarchive.com/olm/poor-people-are-like-oysters-the-life-of-giovanni-verga\">ideal of the oyster</a> (you\u2019re better off clinging to the rock you grew up on like a mollusc, lest you get eaten by the dangerous \u201cfish\u201d of innovation).</p> <p>Hey, I am not above being seduced by the sheer beauty of the main signifiers of <em>la</em> <em>dolce vita</em>: I only learned to appreciate the cultural offerings of my home country once I emigrated. I have often lucked out: a mini-moon in the Tuscan town of Bagno Vignoni in 2022 resulted in my having the thermal pools all to myself; going to Rome in January 2020 meant I could just show up at the Museo di Roma and see a show about Canova without booking it.</p> <p>Yet, last time I partook, I paid the price. Earlier this month, my husband and I thought we had outsmarted the tourist hordes by deciding to head to the Amalfi coast in early October. After being repeatedly stuck behind gargantuan coaches along the torturous single-lane road that connects the local towns, we eventually made it to Positano, our hearts no longer really in it.</p> <p>We might as well have ended up on Main Street USA at Disneyland. People proceeded at a snail\u2019s pace, either filming content or looking at every single storefront window featuring souvenirs, homeware and clothing which, in lieu of Disneyland\u2019s signature castle and mouse ears, displayed lemons glowing like orbs or semi-abstract ceramic-tile motifs. I don\u2019t want to be a total curmudgeon, though. I do think that the B-roll showcasing the French and Italian landscapes seen in Emily in Paris is nothing short of gorgeous.</p> <p>No matter which parts of Europe Emily ends up in during seasons to come, I do strongly hope that she will get to \u201cstamp her passport\u201d with many more international lovers, as Mindy, Emily\u2019s first friend in Paris, puts it. May she date Sergio from Madrid, Hans from Berlin, Andrzej from Warsaw, J\u00e1nos from Budapest and Sandu from Bucharest. Indeed, if the findings of France\u2019s National Centre for Cinema and Animation (CNC), which reported that <a href=\"https://www.leparisien.fr/paris-75/quand-la-serie-emily-in-paris-incite-les-touristes-a-visiter-la-capitale-13-09-2024-F75HLTEUGRFG3D2RMV5Z4ZLSJU.php\">38% of tourists cited the series among their reasons for visiting Paris</a>, are accurate, Emily\u2019s many future romps around the continent can act like the rising tide that lifts all of Europe\u2019s proverbial boats. Europe, be prepared for an influx of Emilys to come.</p> <ul> <li><p>Angelica Frey is a writer, editor, and researcher from Milan living in Boston. She is the co-author of the <a href=\"http://www.italiandiscostories.com/\">Italian Disco Stories</a> newsletter</p></li> </ul> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2024. An earlier version said that there was a Canova exhibition in January 2020 at the Scuderie del Quirinale in Rome. In fact this should have said at the Museo di Roma.</p>",

Overall, she\u2019d live in a country that still abides by what 19th-century author Giovanni Verga called the ideal of the oyster (you\u2019re better off clinging to the rock you grew up on like a mollusc, lest you get eaten by the dangerous \u201cfish\u201d of innovation). Hey, I am not above being seduced by the sheer beauty of the main signifiers of la dolce vita: I only learned to appreciate the cultural offerings of my home country once I emigrated. I have often lucked out: a mini-moon in the Tuscan town of Bagno Vignoni in 2022 resulted in my having the thermal pools all to myself; going to Rome in January 2020 meant I could just show up at the Museo di Roma and see a show about Canova without booking it. Yet, last time I partook, I paid the price. Earlier this month, my husband and I thought we had outsmarted the tourist hordes by deciding to head to the Amalfi coast in early October. After being repeatedly stuck behind gargantuan coaches along the torturous single-lane road that connects the local towns, we eventually made it to Positano, our hearts no longer really in it. We might as well have ended up on Main Street USA at Disneyland. People proceeded at a snail\u2019s pace, either filming content or looking at every single storefront window featuring souvenirs, homeware and clothing which, in lieu of Disneyland\u2019s signature castle and mouse ears, displayed lemons glowing like orbs or semi-abstract ceramic-tile motifs. I don\u2019t want to be a total curmudgeon, though. I do think that the B-roll showcasing the French and Italian landscapes seen in Emily in Paris is nothing short of gorgeous. No matter which parts of Europe Emily ends up in during seasons to come, I do strongly hope that she will get to \u201cstamp her passport\u201d with many more international lovers, as Mindy, Emily\u2019s first friend in Paris, puts it. May she date Sergio from Madrid, Hans from Berlin, Andrzej from Warsaw, J\u00e1nos from Budapest and Sandu from Bucharest. Indeed, if the findings of France\u2019s National Centre for Cinema and Animation (CNC), which reported that 38% of tourists cited the series among their reasons for visiting Paris, are accurate, Emily\u2019s many future romps around the continent can act like the rising tide that lifts all of Europe\u2019s proverbial boats. Europe, be prepared for an influx of Emilys to come. Angelica Frey is a writer, editor, and researcher from Milan living in Boston.

      "bodyText": "The Tory leadership candidate Kemi Badenoch has been criticised for a campaign pamphlet that said autistic people received \u201cbetter treatment\u201d and \u201ceconomic privileges and protections\u201d. A pamphlet published by Badenoch\u2019s campaign team at the Conservative party conference argued that conditions such as anxiety, as well as an autism diagnosis, had gone from something \u201cpeople should work on themselves as individuals\u201d to \u201csomething that society, schools, and employers have to adapt around\u201d. The 36-page essay, titled Conservatism in Crisis, claims to identify factors holding back economic growth. It was not written solely by Badenoch but it features her campaign branding throughout, and she promoted it at conference fringe events. Robert Buckland, a former cabinet colleague of Badenoch, criticised the remarks about autism and suggested they were \u201cstigmatising\u201d the spectrum condition. Buckland, a former justice secretary who published a review into employment rates among autistic people, told the i paper that the essay\u2019s section on autism appeared \u201cmuddled\u201d and should not be \u201cstigmatising or lumping certain categories in with each other\u201d. \u201cAnxiety is not a neurodiverse condition \u2026 autism is not a mental health condition,\u201d he said. \u201cThat part of the report didn\u2019t seem to me to be based on any evidence, and mixing up autism with mental health is not right. It\u2019s not the correct approach to be taken into this.\u201d Anxiety is considered a mental health condition by the NHS, while the National Autistic Society defines autism as a developmental disability. The Buckland review found that at least 700,000 autistic people were economically inactive because of the barriers they faced in finding work. The essay said being diagnosed as neurodiverse had gone from \u201can individual focused challenge\u201d that \u201cmeant you could understand your own brain\u201d to something that \u201coffers economic advantages and protections\u201d. It said diagnoses of anxiety or autism were being treated similarly to race or sex discrimination, and that children with the conditions \u201cmay well get better treatment or equipment at school\u201d including transport to and from home. It added that an autism diagnosis in the workforce came with better employment protections against unfair dismissal and a requirement for workplaces to make reasonable adjustments. The essay said it was positive there was more openness around mental health, but the requirement for schools and workplaces to make adjustments for it had \u201ccreated costs and failed to improve people\u2019s mental health outcomes\u201d. A spokesperson for Badenoch told the i that it was \u201cwrong to infer any prejudice\u201d from the report and that it was \u201cessential that we are able to talk about these issues without the media deliberately misleading their readers for the sake of easy headlines\u201d. \u201cIf we are to resolve the problem of deteriorating mental health, we must be able to point out that it is happening and how society has changed its approach to it and determine whether that approach is working,\u201d they said.

This gives them an opportunity to see what is going on in different parts of the country.

If I was younger I would hope that someone would be able to reach into my community and give me a hand. How many kids [fall out of education] through lack of interest or financial problems and then don\u2019t know what to do? I was lucky that I had football.

A qualified youth worker who had worked for Crystal Palace\u2019s foundation, he \u2013 with his team \u2013 has helped create a pathway into various industries by working closely with some of Ferdinand\u2019s commercial partners such as BT Sport, Aston Martin and Warner Music. \u201cWe realised that we were engaging the kids but not keeping them because they don\u2019t have the opportunity to work,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cIf we could attach an opportunity to get a job in the industries where we see a lot of kids working, in sports and entertainment, then we have got a really good chance. Now we are branching out way beyond football.\u201d The schemes arrange work experience and opportunities and encourage young people to take qualifications that will enable them to enter their chosen industry. The fashion label Ralph Lauren has taken on four people who are being mentored on paid internships that are expected to lead to permanent roles. \u201cI used to walk past shops like that and I wasn\u2019t even allowed in,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cSo to think that I\u2019ve now got kids that are coming through my foundation that are actually going into the belly of these companies and having an opportunity to get a job, that\u2019s enough for me. Where we are now \u2026 I can\u2019t sit here and say I was a visionary but it\u2019s gone beyond where I thought it could be.\u201d More than 1,200 people greeted Ferdinand and his wife, Kate, when they attended an event at Sligo Rovers in March, with children from both sides of the Irish border invited to play in a football tournament in recognition of their progress with the foundation. Ferdinand was in charge of one of the teams and \u2013 as you would expect \u2013 took things very seriously. \u201cThe competitive energy came out,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe won though!\u201d Darryl Forsythe, the foundation\u2019s programme lead for Northern Ireland and Ireland, says the opportunity for the local community to see Ferdinand was inspiring. \u201cHe\u2019s just fantastic with the young people and really engages with them and listens to their opinions. I felt sorry for him in Sligo because literally all day you just heard kids shouting: \u2018Rio, Rio,\u2019 looking for autographs and pictures. But he always takes time.\u201d Nine years after Ferdinand hung up his boots his popularity endures judging by the number of people \u2013 including two on-duty female police officers \u2013 who ask him for a selfie while the Guardian takes his photo. The 45-year-old says he is busier these days as a pundit for TNT Sports than he was during his playing career but recognises the importance of showing his face at events. \u201cPeople can see bullshit or if it\u2019s just a PR stunt,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough down the years to have some really intimate moments with people who have been through the foundation at various stages. It can be quite emotional. I\u2019ve had people that have broken down or started crying just through pure joy or because of the opportunities they\u2019ve had. That\u2019s the most rewarding part, when you see the impact it does have.\u201d The Beyond the Ball initiative, funded by the International Fund for Ireland, is doing that. Based in eight regions either side of the border, including Enniskillen, where Ferdinand\u2019s mother\u2019s family was from, it aims to promote cross\u2011community reconciliation and build trust between communities traditionally divided down sectarian lines by organising football tournaments and workshops that could lead to future employment opportunities. \u201cSome of the kids have never travelled outside of their areas so it\u2019s kind of groundbreaking in that regard,\u201d Forsythe says. \u201cThe areas that we have selected have pretty high levels of deprivation and youth unemployment but have also suffered from interfaith issues between communities where there is a high risk of them being recruited into other activities. This gives them an opportunity to see what is going on in different parts of the country. Football is a brilliant tool for integration and there are some really great kids that have turned into young leaders.\u201d Ferdinand says: \u201cThe cross\u2011border conflict was something that you heard a lot about when I was growing up so it resonated with me immediately. When you go there, you can feel the history straight away. So to be able to put together a programme that impacts these young people is amazing.\u201d A team from the foundation has just returned from South Africa, where they delivered a workshop to local children, and they hope to create similar opportunities in the deprived Cape Flats district of Cape Town. Ferdinand says the scope of the work is something of which Janice would be proud. \u201cThis was my mum\u2019s passion. As much as this is my thing, it\u2019s her legacy as well. If I was younger I would hope that someone would be able to reach into my community and give me a hand. How many kids [fall out of education] through lack of interest or financial problems and then don\u2019t know what to do? I was lucky that I had football. Not everyone has that passion or work ethic but it\u2019s about us trying to guide them.\u201d",

Under Trump, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-28e44cc5c026dc16472751bbde0ead50\">more people incarcerated in the federal system</a> were put to death than under the previous <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-trump-and-barrs-last-minute-killing-spree\">10 presidents</a> combined, a staggering number that raised grave human rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/12/trump-executions-death-penalty-us-public\">concerns</a>.</p> <p>Among those who were executed were <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/trump-mentally-ill-lame-duck-executions.html\">people</a> with intellectual disabilities. Defendants were <a href=\"https://eji.org/news/federal-executions-continue-despite-serious-questions-of-fairness/\">deprived</a> of opportunities to present new <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/10/politics/brandon-bernard-executed/index.html\">evidence</a>. Some were killed after lawyers said the execution <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-executions-coronavirus/u-s-judge-weighs-delaying-executions-of-two-inmates-with-covid-19-idUSKBN29A2NK/\">method</a> was \u201ctortuous\u201d. In some cases, executions occurred over the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/arkansas-federal-death-penalty.html\">objections</a> of both <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/only-native-american-federal-death-row-be-executed-despite-tribal-n1238173\">victims</a> and <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/2020/11/18/op-ed-brandon-bernard-execution-prosecutor-says-he-should-live/6329685002/\">prosecutors</a>.</p> <p>Since his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, Trump\u2019s pro-death penalty rhetoric, which dates back to his 1989 campaign against the Central Park Five, has only escalated. He\u2019s recently <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5041276/president-trump-calls-death-penalty-drug-dealers\">called</a> for executions of \u201ceveryone who gets caught selling drugs\u201d and has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/28/politics/milley-donald-trump-execution-comment/index.html\">suggested</a> government <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/13/politics/trump-white-house-bunker-leak-executed-treason-book-claims/index.html\">leakers</a> should be executed for treason. Last year, Rolling Stone <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-death-penalty-firing-squad-executions-1234679447/\">reported</a>, Trump allegedly floated bringing back firing squads and hangings and pursuing group executions and televised killings.</p> <p>Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint for a second Trump term that was written by Trump\u2019s allies, although it has been disavowed by the former president, calls for the US government to do \u201ceverything possible to obtain finality\u201d for the <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/federal-death-penalty/list-of-federal-death-row-prisoners\">40 people</a> on federal death row. It also urges the president to <a href=\"https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/07/Memo_Trump_CLS_FINAL_240716.pdf\">expand capital punishment</a> to non-homicide crimes and push the US supreme court to overrule <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/united-states-supreme-court/significant-supreme-court-opinions/kennedy-v-louisiana-resource-page\">precedent</a> limiting death sentences to murders.</p> <p>\u201cTrump has said he plans to finish what he started,\u201d said Billie Allen, 47, in a recent call from federal death row in Terre Haute, Indiana. Allen, convicted of a 1997 robbery and murder, has <a href=\"https://www.freebillieallen.com/\">maintained his innocence</a>, but he has exhausted his appeals. \u201cI\u2019m terrified that I will be executed<strong> </strong>\u2013 not just because I\u2019m going to die, but because I\u2019m going to die for something I didn\u2019t do ... I can only hope that as someone who is innocent he would do the right thing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Lawless\u2019 killing spree</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-trump-and-barrs-last-minute-killing-spree\">federal killings</a> under Trump all took place during his final months in office, and they raised significant concerns about the rights of US capital defendants.</p>    <p>The first execution, in July 2020, was of Daniel Lee, condemned to death for a 1995 killing of three family members; his co-defendant, considered the \u201c<a href=\"https://eji.org/news/federal-government-executes-daniel-lee-despite-opposition-from-victims-family-judges-and-prosecutor/\">ringleader</a>\u201d, got life in prison. The lead prosecutor, judge and victim\u2019s family <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/arkansas-federal-death-penalty.html\">opposed execution</a>. But the justice department pushed to <a href=\"https://eji.org/news/federal-government-executes-daniel-lee-despite-opposition-from-victims-family-judges-and-prosecutor/\">proceed</a>, even when there was a court injunction halting the execution. Lee was <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/attorney-slams-u-s-government-daniel-lee-execution-1517660\">strapped to a gurney for four hours</a> while the government fought to move forward, and the supreme court greenlit the proceeding at 2am. He was killed by lethal injection.</p> <p>Days later, the US executed a 68-year-old man whose lawyers had won a brief injunction after arguing he was <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article244259352.html\">unfit</a> due to advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dementia and schizophrenia.</p> <p>Other cases included a man who was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-28e44cc5c026dc16472751bbde0ead50\">not the shooter</a> and had asserted his innocence; a man who <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-executions-biden-death-penalty-brandon-bernard-c1b26807c5c40b337d14485c3d6df2de#\">suffered</a> a painful condition akin to drowning during his execution; and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brandon-bernard-death-sentence-prosecutor-reversal/\">a case</a> where five jurors and a prosecutor objected.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a big rush to kill with a lot of trampling on fairness, procedure and just basic decency,\u201d said Ruth Friedman, director of the Federal Capital Habeas Project, which represents death row defendants and was Lee\u2019s counsel. \u201cIt was a parade of horribles.\u201d</p> <p>Across 13 executions, she said, courts issued more than 20 stay orders halting the killings. But the supreme court and appeals courts repeatedly rejected the rulings.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the lowest point in my 34 years of practicing law, not only because of the breathtaking speed of those 13 executions, but also the ways in which the court system utterly failed our clients,\u201d said Kelley Henry, a federal public defender. \u201cThe brokenness of the death penalty system was on full display in a way that shook me to my core.\u201d</p> <p>Henry represented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/05/lisa-montgomery-death-row-execution-history\">Lisa Montgomery</a>, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/13/us-carries-out-first-federal-execution-of-a-woman-in-nearly-seven-decades\">executed</a> in the final week of Trump\u2019s presidency, the first woman put to death by the US government in nearly 70 years. Montgomery had been convicted of murdering a pregnant woman; her attorneys said she suffered profound mental illness stemming from horrific abuse and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/12M0YUcpt1FGUfyc0aWfT-4NBkPnSEEht/view\">argued</a> she should be barred from execution due to incompetency.</p> <p>In Montgomery\u2019s final weeks, <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/supreme-court-vacates-stays-of-execution-paves-way-to-late-night-execution-of-lisa-montgomery\">four courts</a> sided with her lawyers and issued stays. But the US bureau of prisons plowed ahead, and the supreme court, at around midnight on the day of her scheduled lethal injection, <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/01/reversing-several-lower-courts-justices-allow-execution-of-lisa-montgomery/\">tossed out the lower court rulings</a>. Montgomery was pronounced dead at 1.31am on 13 January 2021 \u2013 before her competency claim had been resolved.</p>    <p>\u201cThe 13 executions were lawless,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI never believed the legal system could be so politicized. It\u2019s untenable to me that it could happen again.\u201d</p>    <h2><strong>40 men on death row</strong></h2> <p>The 40 men currently held on federal death row represent systemic problems with capital punishment, experts said. The majority are people of color, and 38% are Black (while Black people <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/fact-sheet/facts-about-the-us-black-population/\">comprise</a> 14% of the American population), said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. In 58% of cases, at least one victim was white.

      "bodyText": "If Donald Trump wins the election, he is expected to pursue a spree of executions that could fast-track the cases of people on federal death row, and threaten the life of a man with a longstanding innocence claim. Advocates for people on death row fear a second Trump term could be worse than his first, which saw an unprecedented 13 federal executions. Under Trump, more people incarcerated in the federal system were put to death than under the previous 10 presidents combined, a staggering number that raised grave human rights concerns. Among those who were executed were people with intellectual disabilities. Defendants were deprived of opportunities to present new evidence. Some were killed after lawyers said the execution method was \u201ctortuous\u201d. In some cases, executions occurred over the objections of both victims and prosecutors. Since his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, Trump\u2019s pro-death penalty rhetoric, which dates back to his 1989 campaign against the Central Park Five, has only escalated. He\u2019s recently called for executions of \u201ceveryone who gets caught selling drugs\u201d and has reportedly suggested government leakers should be executed for treason. Last year, Rolling Stone reported, Trump allegedly floated bringing back firing squads and hangings and pursuing group executions and televised killings. Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint for a second Trump term that was written by Trump\u2019s allies, although it has been disavowed by the former president, calls for the US government to do \u201ceverything possible to obtain finality\u201d for the 40 people on federal death row. It also urges the president to expand capital punishment to non-homicide crimes and push the US supreme court to overrule precedent limiting death sentences to murders. \u201cTrump has said he plans to finish what he started,\u201d said Billie Allen, 47, in a recent call from federal death row in Terre Haute, Indiana. Allen, convicted of a 1997 robbery and murder, has maintained his innocence, but he has exhausted his appeals. \u201cI\u2019m terrified that I will be executed \u2013 not just because I\u2019m going to die, but because I\u2019m going to die for something I didn\u2019t do ... I can only hope that as someone who is innocent he would do the right thing.\u201d \u2018Lawless\u2019 killing spree The federal killings under Trump all took place during his final months in office, and they raised significant concerns about the rights of US capital defendants. The first execution, in July 2020, was of Daniel Lee, condemned to death for a 1995 killing of three family members; his co-defendant, considered the \u201cringleader\u201d, got life in prison. The lead prosecutor, judge and victim\u2019s family opposed execution. But the justice department pushed to proceed, even when there was a court injunction halting the execution. Lee was strapped to a gurney for four hours while the government fought to move forward, and the supreme court greenlit the proceeding at 2am. He was killed by lethal injection. Days later, the US executed a 68-year-old man whose lawyers had won a brief injunction after arguing he was unfit due to advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dementia and schizophrenia. Other cases included a man who was not the shooter and had asserted his innocence; a man who suffered a painful condition akin to drowning during his execution; and a case where five jurors and a prosecutor objected. \u201cThere was a big rush to kill with a lot of trampling on fairness, procedure and just basic decency,\u201d said Ruth Friedman, director of the Federal Capital Habeas Project, which represents death row defendants and was Lee\u2019s counsel. \u201cIt was a parade of horribles.\u201d Across 13 executions, she said, courts issued more than 20 stay orders halting the killings. But the supreme court and appeals courts repeatedly rejected the rulings. \u201cIt was the lowest point in my 34 years of practicing law, not only because of the breathtaking speed of those 13 executions, but also the ways in which the court system utterly failed our clients,\u201d said Kelley Henry, a federal public defender. \u201cThe brokenness of the death penalty system was on full display in a way that shook me to my core.\u201d Henry represented Lisa Montgomery, who was executed in the final week of Trump\u2019s presidency, the first woman put to death by the US government in nearly 70 years. Montgomery had been convicted of murdering a pregnant woman; her attorneys said she suffered profound mental illness stemming from horrific abuse and argued she should be barred from execution due to incompetency. In Montgomery\u2019s final weeks, four courts sided with her lawyers and issued stays. But the US bureau of prisons plowed ahead, and the supreme court, at around midnight on the day of her scheduled lethal injection, tossed out the lower court rulings. Montgomery was pronounced dead at 1.31am on 13 January 2021 \u2013 before her competency claim had been resolved. \u201cThe 13 executions were lawless,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI never believed the legal system could be so politicized. It\u2019s untenable to me that it could happen again.\u201d 40 men on death row The 40 men currently held on federal death row represent systemic problems with capital punishment, experts said. The majority are people of color, and 38% are Black (while Black people comprise 14% of the American population), said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. In 58% of cases, at least one victim was white. And nearly one in four men were 21 or younger during the crime. \u201cBy every objective measure, the federal death penalty is irretrievably broken,\u201d said Maher, noting that some death sentences were secured during the racist crackdown on \u201csuperpredators\u201d in the 1990s, and some relied on discredited \u201cjunk science\u201d techniques. It\u2019s unclear how many men could be immediately vulnerable under Trump, as their litigation is in varying stages, but advocates fear a chaotic rush led by his justice department. Trump\u2019s former attorney general, Bill Barr, spearheaded the last execution spree and approved the use of the drug pentobarbital. Advocates have little hope that he\u2019d use his presidential authority to issue clemency grants or pause federal executions. \u201cI feel fairly confident that [a second Trump] administration, if it comes to pass, could try to cut some corners,\u201d said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the ACLU Capital Punishment Project. Kamala Harris has previously opposed the death penalty, but has been silent on it during her presidential campaign, and a call to abolish capital punishment was left out of the Democratic party\u2019s platform this year for the first time in 12 years. The Harris campaign didn\u2019t respond to inquiries. Joe Biden issued an executions moratorium in 2021. Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, didn\u2019t respond to questions about Trump\u2019s executions and his plans for federal death row, but said in an email: \u201cPresident Trump has repeatedly stated he supports the death penalty for drug dealers. He will carry out that promise when elected.\u201d \u2018I deserve to live\u2019 Billie Allen, the defendant at risk of execution, was convicted of a 1997 bank robbery in which two men killed a guard. One suspect was arrested on the scene; Allen was arrested hours later. Allen has said he was shopping at a mall during the robbery, and a mall guard told police that he saw Allen at that time, his lawyers told the federal pardon office earlier this year. Blood on the scene believed to belong to a robber did not match Allen\u2019s, DNA tests showed. And while the getaway car exploded, Allen tested negative for traces of gasoline. His lawyers say his trial attorney was ineffective. In a statement, a US attorney\u2019s office spokesperson defended Allen\u2019s conviction, pointing to a 2001 appeals court ruling that said that Allen confessed after his arrest, that eyewitnesses identified him in a lineup and that he was \u201cprimarily responsible\u201d for firing the fatal shots. Allen has said he didn\u2019t confess, an officer testified he \u201cthrew away\u201d notes from the confession, and other eyewitnesses described a suspect who didn\u2019t match him. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful because I have evidence of my innocence,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI believe if someone in Biden\u2019s administration examines this, I\u2019ll be home after 26 years convicted for a crime I didn\u2019t commit.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019re dealing with a system that\u2019s flawed,\u201d he continued, pointing to the recent Missouri execution of a man prosecutors suggested was innocent. Allen has focused on writing and art while imprisoned: \u201cIf I\u2019m executed, I want people to look back on my art and see this guy was documenting the trauma he went through on death row \u2026 he documented for us that he\u2019s human, he deserves to live and is innocent.\u201d Allen has remained scarred from Trump\u2019s executions, recounting hearing guards walking by his cell, not knowing whether he\u2019d be taken to be killed.

In November, before they travelled to Switzerland, she made a statement to solicitors explaining her wish for an assisted death and that no one should get in trouble as a result.

      "bodyText": "A man who helped his terminally ill wife travel to Switzerland to end her own life is entitled to inherit part of her estate, a judge has ruled. Philip Morris, 76, with \u201cvery great reluctance\u201d assisted his wife, Myra Morris, then 73, when she went to the Pegasos clinic in Liestal, Switzerland in December 2023 and self-administered a fatal dose of pentobarbital. The Forfeiture Act 1982 precludes a person who has unlawfully killed another from acquiring a benefit in consequence of the killing. However, after a challenge by Philip Morris, Mr Justice Trower ruled in the high court that the forfeiture rule should not apply in the case at hand. At the time of her death, Myra Morris had multiple system atrophy, a rare and degenerative neurological disorder with no known cure, and was in constant pain. In November, before they travelled to Switzerland, she made a statement to solicitors explaining her wish for an assisted death and that no one should get in trouble as a result. Her husband said that he had considered his wife\u2019s wish to end her life \u201ctoo horrendous\u201d but she persisted until he realised he could not ignore what she wanted. In his written judgment last week, Trower said: \u201cPhilip sacrificed his own happiness and put himself at risk of prosecution to honour the heartfelt wishes of his wife. It is clear to me that this was not because he wanted her to die, far from it, but rather because he loved and respected his wife too much to disregard her wishes.\u201d Under the current law in England and Wales on assisted dying, which could change in a forthcoming parliamentary vote, assisting someone to end their life is a criminal offence which carries a maximum prison sentence of up to 14 years, although prosecutions are rare. The day after returning from Switzerland, Morris reported his wife\u2019s voluntary assisted death and his involvement to police at Colindale station, north-west London. He was told in writing that there was nothing to report. But Morris had not been given any advice regarding the forfeiture rule and, when he became aware of it, it was said to have caused him \u201cvery considerable distress\u201d. However, under section 2 of the Forfeiture Act, the court can modify the effect of it if \u201cthe justice of the case requires the effect of the rule to be so modified in that case\u201d. Describing it as \u201ca tragic case\u201d, Trower said: \u201cI had no doubt at the end of the hearing that this is a case in which I should modify the forfeiture rule by excluding its application in full.\u201d Morris, who was supported by his two adult children with his late wife in challenging the application of the forfeiture rule, said in his witness statement: \u201cFor a woman of such beauty, intelligence, dignity and grace, being so physically incapacitated and reliant on others made life intolerable for Myra. \u201cI was desperate for Myra to change her mind, but she was solid in her decision that she wanted to be dignified to the end which is why she chose to end her life. She faced a future that she did not want.\u201d A bill legalising assisted dying for people in England and Wales with less than six months to live is due to be published on Wednesday.",

If he really wanted to help the Lebanese deal with Hezbollah, he wouldn\u2019t order his military to invade southern Lebanon and as a result breathe new life into the organisation. Netanyahu knows his history, yet he chooses to ignore it: Hezbollah was born in part to resist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/08/israel-lebanon-invasion-compare-previous-operations\">Israel\u2019s occupation of southern Lebanon</a>, which began in 1982 and ended only in 2000.

Kicking the Israeli military out of southern Lebanon 24 years ago bolstered its claim. But since Israel\u2019s departure, Hezbollah\u2019s military role has been neither effective nor legitimate. The group has failed to deter Israeli attacks, and its actions have even invited Israeli hostilities, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/30/syria.israel1\">2006 war</a> and the current deadly confrontation.</p> <p>Hezbollah\u2019s role, arms and influence are not all self-made.

Hezbollah has hardly considered Lebanon\u2019s borders or sovereignty as constraints in its conflict with Israel. It also believes, as Iran does, that a successful struggle against Israel requires the unification of all regional fronts \u2013 in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza.</p>    <p>The first real application of this doctrine was in the summer of 2006, when Hezbollah crossed into northern Israel and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/08/israel-lebanon-invasion-compare-previous-operations\">captured two Israeli soldiers</a>. Tactically, Hezbollah wanted to force a Lebanese-Palestinian prisoner exchange with Israel and to aid Hamas in its confrontation with Israel in Gaza. But the more strategic aim of its masters in Tehran was to force a new reality on Israel in which the Palestinian and Lebanese battlefields were one.</p> <p>Hezbollah\u2019s attack led to 34 days of vicious fighting with Israel that left Lebanon in ruins, with more than 1,100 people killed, much of southern Lebanon flattened and infrastructure across the country badly damaged.</p> <p>Seventeen years later, clearly having learned nothing, Hezbollah would do it all over again \u2013 except that this time its gamble would prove to be far more detrimental to the group, and to Lebanon as a whole. Israel has punished Hezbollah for launching a front against it on 8 October 2023 by killing most of its political and military commanders, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/israel-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah\">Hassan Nasrallah, its top leader</a>. It has levelled the group\u2019s headquarters. It has infiltrated the organisation like never before.

He told Robinson: \u201cWe often refer to people like yourself as talent, but I\u2019ve kind of banned that. You\u2019re a presenter, I\u2019m a leader of the organisation, and we\u2019re here to serve.</p> <p>\u201cI do think over the last decade or so we\u2019ve seen fundamental changes in the culture in this industry, and it hasn\u2019t been completely unique [to the BBC that] those that have had power in places can often use that in bad ways.

Many good or bad things happen in the new age, but one thing we should take comfort from is that things are improving.

      "bodyText": "The BBC director general has said he has \u201ckind of banned\u201d referring to its high-profile staff as \u201ctalent\u201d as the corporation grapples with the fallout from controversies involving a number of senior presenters. Tim Davie was speaking after the BBC launched an independent review of its workplace culture after scandals including the one surrounding the disgraced presenter Huw Edwards. Other controversies have included a furore over the welfare of contestants on the 2023 season of Strictly Come Dancing, and the sacking of the presenter Jermaine Jenas after complaints about his workplace conduct. Speaking to Nick Robinson on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Davie said no one at the corporation was \u201cindispensable\u201d. He told Robinson: \u201cWe often refer to people like yourself as talent, but I\u2019ve kind of banned that. You\u2019re a presenter, I\u2019m a leader of the organisation, and we\u2019re here to serve. \u201cI do think over the last decade or so we\u2019ve seen fundamental changes in the culture in this industry, and it hasn\u2019t been completely unique [to the BBC that] those that have had power in places can often use that in bad ways. I think the BBC is utterly committed \u2013 you see us acting in good faith to get at this [issue] \u2013 and I would say [it is] important that everyone is treated equally regardless of rank.\u201d The corporation last week announced the start of an independent review into its workplace culture by Grahame Russell, the executive chair and founder of the management consultancy Change Associates. The review would \u201cbe helpful for us\u201d in \u201csorting this culture\u201d, Davie said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s about how people deploy power in a workplace, we\u2019ve all seen it, it\u2019s not unique to the BBC. Many good or bad things happen in the new age, but one thing we should take comfort from is that things are improving. People need to speak up and everyone at every level needs to be heard.\u201d The BBC boss was also asked if there had been progress on Edwards returning the estimated \u00a3200,000 salary he was paid between his arrest and leaving the corporation in April. He said there had been \u201csome dialogue with the lawyers, but we\u2019re yet to resolve that issue\u201d, and suggested he was waiting for Edwards to respond. Asked if he believed the money would be returned, Davie said: \u201cI think the ball is clearly not in my court on that one.\u201d Edwards pleaded guilty in July to three counts of making indecent images of children, having accessed indecent photographs of children as young as seven that were sent to him by a convicted paedophile. He was given a six-month suspended prison sentence. Davie was speaking before a speech to the Future Resilience Forum in London, where he appealed to the government to bolster funding of the World Service amid what he called an \u201call-out assault on truth worldwide\u201d by hostile states and others. \u201cBad actors\u201d such as Russia were already moving into the void left by the loss of audiences for the BBC World Service by setting up in places such as Lebanon to pump out \u201cunchallenged propaganda\u201d, said Davie, as he warned that the stakes were high. \u201cWe are at a moment of choice.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, I went to a retirement event for someone who, in his late 80s at the time, had spent more than 60 years as a professor at New York University. He had been embedded in every aspect of academic life, from mentoring and research to fundraising. Over the years he had managed to teach 100,000 students the university\u2019s Introduction to Psychology course. Ted is one of those institutional pillars who can tell you what the place was like in 1965. These days, most people don\u2019t last more than <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/tenure.nr0.htm\">four years</a> in one job.</p> <p>I walked into Ted\u2019s party thinking it would be full of students and teachers, but I was wrong. There were guests from his theatre days, people who hung out at his favourite piano bar, as well as the \u201ctechno music\u201d people. Ted had a smorgasbord of identities he had fostered in the city, some related to his career as a scholar, but most not.</p> <p>Now an emeritus, Ted still comes to his office for a few hours each day to socialise. Some might think that he\u2019s having a hard time \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/business/retirement/retire-advice-life-tips.html\">letting go</a>\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s so married to his job, he doesn\u2019t know what to do with himself. But Ted\u2019s not suffering from separation anxiety. In fact, quite the opposite.</p> <p>Throughout those 60 years, he maintained a healthy separation from his work. Being a professor was never his be-all and end-all, his central identity, pulling the strings on his self worth like a puppet master. Instead, it was one of many facets of his life. And although he loved parts of his job, there were plenty of aspects of it he didn\u2019t. Ted had as many career lows as he did highs, yet he was always able to maintain a healthy relationship with being a professor.</p> <p>I like to contrast Ted\u2019s approach to what the modern careerist often tries to achieve; the one who values \u201c<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nearly-all-genzs-millennials-want-purpose-driven-work-behbahani-4bdue/\">purpose-driven</a>\u201d professions above all else, and who is willing to make huge sacrifices in order to succeed in them.</p> <p>Gone are the days in which jobs were just jobs. Despite all the talk of work-life balance, the importance of having psychological distance from our careers is not an especially fashionable value. Even those who want that distance \u2013 who don\u2019t define themselves by their professional achievements and lean on other identities instead \u2013 are often afraid to admit it. They worry that people will interpret their mindset as a sign that they\u2019re apathetic, lack passion, aren\u2019t dedicated enough.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Ironically, expecting to love your job means you\u2019re more likely to quit it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019ve got here, given the messages we\u2019re chronically exposed to.

Business leaders talk about how finding <a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/passion-at-work-is-a-good-thing-but-only-if-bosses-know-how-to-manage-it\">passion</a> at work is what has enabled them to achieve success.

Pluralistic ignorance is when you think everyone around you is engaging in some behaviour, or has a set of beliefs, when it isn\u2019t actually true. (My favourite example of this in social science is from a paper called <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12908120/\">Pluralistic Ignorance and Hooking Up</a>. It\u2019s about how, on college campuses, there\u2019s a belief that everyone is having one-night stands and loving them \u2013 but actually no one really does.) Believing that other people love their job more than you can breed jealousy, resentment and, in some cases, <a href=\"https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2014.33.8.701\">depression</a>. These negative experiences lead to poorer performance and, sometimes, selfish behaviours such as hiding knowledge from co-workers. The quest for love can bring out the worst in us.</p> <p>Second, we\u2019ve come to believe that falling in love with your career should happen instantly \u2013 within months of starting the job. But in reality it takes time and experience to appreciate the good things. It can be hard to take in the highs without experiencing some lows, for example, including long stretches of doing nothing but monotonous, tedious work that characterises a large part of many roles. Ted weathered these storms by dedicating himself to other pursuits, but the modern careerist interprets such stretches as red flags that say \u201cthis isn\u2019t right for me\u201d. Ironically, expecting to love your job means you\u2019re more likely to quit it.</p> <p>Third, even those who do find love are often at risk of negative outcomes such as <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02678373.2012.712291\">chronic stress</a> and burnout. Love means dedicating your whole self to the job, and, in turn, feeling every failure and setback like a punch to the gut.

      "body": "<h2>Can Eidevall turn things around at Arsenal?</h2> <p>The \u201cJonas out\u201d painted on a wall outside the ground and the mock P45 waved from the stands reflect the pressure on Arsenal\u2019s manager, Jonas Eidevall, after Arsenal\u2019s 2-1 defeat by Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. That result alone hasn\u2019t led to this level of discontent; it has been bubbling under the surface, getting closer to boiling over with every failure to break down a low block, every sloppily conceded goal and every indication that the plan just isn\u2019t working. Two draws in the league, against Manchester City and Everton, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/09/bayern-munich-arsenal-womens-champions-league-match-report\">5-2 loss to Bayern Munich</a>, despite having twice taken the lead, and the manner of the goals conceded against Chelsea have played their part. The concession of the first goal on Saturday via a corner, shortly after Eidevall had been on the BBC talking about how much work they had done on defending set pieces in preparation, was symbolic of how wrong things are going. Can they turn it around? Of course. However, with the disconnect between the fans and the manager growing and several players looking disconsolate, the signs don\u2019t look good. <strong>SW</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/12/arsenal-chelsea-womens-super-league-match-report\">Match report: Arsenal 1-2 Chelsea</a></p> <h2>Kirby key for resurgent Brighton</h2> <p>Another three points have put Brighton two wins from their tally of five across the whole of last season. That this has been achieved with such a high turnover of players and a new manager, Dario Vidosic, is hugely impressive. Sunday\u2019s 1-0 victory at the WSL newcomers, Crystal Palace, was far from straightforward, the home team having more shots. However, while Palace accrued 13 shots to Brighton\u2019s 11, they managed only three on target. The summer signing Fran Kirby and Barcelona\u2019s on-loan forward Bruna Vilamala combined to give Brighton the points. Kirby\u2019s resurgence under Vidosic has been hugely heartwarming, after her final years at Chelsea were blighted by illness and injury. Her assist for Vilamala was her first of the season but she also has two league goals. Her guile could be hugely impactful and should she stay fit and retain her place in the starting XI she has a strong chance of making the England squad for the Euros next summer. <strong>SW</strong></p> <h2>Terland up and running at United</h2> <p>Elisabeth Terland got her first two Manchester United goals in their 3-0 win over Tottenham. The Norway international, Brighton\u2019s top scorer last season, netted in the 44th minute and wasted no time in getting her second five minutes later, in injury time. Marc Skinner had high praise for Terland, United\u2019s manager saying: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t dip off her focus. Whether it\u2019s pressing or whatever the task is, she\u2019s all in. I think she knows Erling Haaland personally [Terland\u2019s brother is in a relationship with Haaland\u2019s sister] and I don\u2019t want to compare the two but the immense and intense action of both of them, that\u2019s how she performs.\u201d <strong>SR</strong></p> <h2>Rock-bottom Everton need goals</h2> <p>Everton scored their first WSL goal of the season in their 1-1 draw against West Ham but it went down as an own goal, Melissa Lawley\u2019s shot deflected in by Camila S\u00e1ez to cancel out Anouk Denton\u2019s first-half strike. Everton\u2019s lack of scoring prowess is a cause for concern. They are the first team since Reading in the 2021-22 campaign not to score in their opening three league games and goals will have to start flowing if Brian S\u00f8rensen\u2019s side want a fighting chance of remaining in the top flight. They are bottom, level on points with Aston Villa, Leicester City and West Ham. Villa and Leicester have a superior goal difference and West Ham have scored more goals in their opening four games. <strong>SR</strong></p>    <h2>Shaw drags City to \u2018ugly\u2019 win</h2> <p>There are always a handful of moments which make or break your season. If Manchester City get their hands on the WSL trophy in May, they may look back at Khadija Shaw\u2019s 92nd minute goal at Anfield on Sunday as season-defining. It was not the prettiest from Gareth Taylor\u2019s side against a Liverpool who dug in deep and battled hard to frustrate them. This was probably to be expected from City after their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/09/manchester-city-barcelona-womens-champions-league-match-report\">triumphant exploits against Barcelona</a> in midweek. Despite their domination of the ball, it was a story of mettle and perseverance, epitomised by no one more than Shaw. Their prolific centre-forward caused problems for Liverpool\u2019s defence throughout and took the game by the scruff of the neck with her two goals to ensure her team came out with nothing less than victory. \u201cSometimes an ugly win is just as important for the three points,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe just have to keep going.\u201d <strong>SD</strong></p> <h2>Villa left to rue lack of clinical edge</h2> <p>Sunday\u2019s goalless encounter between Aston Villa and Leicester at Villa Park was a prime example of two sides struggling to kickstart their season. Although there have been some positive signs in the first few weeks for the respective managers, Robert de Pauw and Amandine Miquel, this display illustrated how neither team have been able to find their feet. The hosts will be the more frustrated \u2013 they had more possession and creativity but lacked a clinical edge. Of the 16 chances they produced, only four were on target. It was marginally better than Leicester\u2019s sole opportunity and the Foxes will be particularly grateful to their goalkeeper, Janina Leitzig. Her brilliant injury-time stop to deny Anna Patten ensured her team returned home with an important point, a foundation from which to build. <strong>SD</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/961\"> <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table table--football table--striped\"> <thead> <tr> <th class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\"><abbr title=\"Position\">Pos</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Team</th> <th class=\"football-stat--played\"><abbr title=\"Played\">P</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--difference\"><abbr title=\"Goal difference\">GD</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--points\"><abbr title=\"Points\">Pts</abbr></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">1</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man City Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">10</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Chelsea Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">9</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">9</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man Utd Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">9</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">9</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Liverpool FC Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">0</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">5</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Arsenal Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">0</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">5</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Tottenham Hotspur Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">0</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">4</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Crystal Palace Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-10</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">3</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">9</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Aston Villa Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">2</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">10</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Leicester Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">2</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">11</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">West Ham Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">2</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">12</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Everton Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">2</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>Crochet has undergone something of a rebrand. From its cottagecore-blanket and tea-cosy roots, it now regularly graces the pages of Vogue. And the craft itself is hugely popular \u2013 particularly among gen Z \u2013 thanks, in part, to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/02/purls-of-wisdom-the-wellbeing-benefits-of-knitting-and-crocheting\">meditative sense of flow</a> that comes as the hands perform the rhythmic, repetitive actions.</p> <p>The good news for novices is that it\u2019s super easy to get into crocheting. Knowing the basic kit you need, though, is helpful, so we asked the experts for their advice. These are the tools they recommend if you are starting out, and the stuff they say you don\u2019t need.</p> <h2><strong>Yarn</strong></h2> <p>Yarn comes in varying thicknesses, or weights, for different types of projects. But the only one those just starting out in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/29/get-knotted-best-of-the-crochet-trend-this-season\">crochet</a> need worry about is medium-weight double knit (DK). This yarn weight is best for beginners because it\u2019s big enough to clearly see each stitch, but not chunky to the point of being unwieldy.</p> <p>Where you should buy from depends on what you plan to create. <a href=\"https://yarnloft.co.uk/\">Yarn Loft</a>, for example, is good for quality and designer yarns, while <a href=\"https://www.crochet-uk.co.uk/\">Crochet UK</a> has an inspiring range of colours. Other retailers include <a href=\"https://www.woolbox.co.uk/yarn.html\">WoolBox</a>, which offers solid all-rounders, <a href=\"https://www.lovecrafts.com/en-gb/l/yarns/popular-yarns/cheap-value-yarns\">lovecrafts.com</a> has a good value section and <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=crochet%20yarn&amp;ref=auto-1&amp;as_prefix=crochet%20yarn\">Etsy</a> is brilliant as a crochet superstore for small, independent brands.</p> <p>Our experts advise, however, that there are certain yarns beginners should avoid at first.

      "bodyText": "Crochet has undergone something of a rebrand. From its cottagecore-blanket and tea-cosy roots, it now regularly graces the pages of Vogue. And the craft itself is hugely popular \u2013 particularly among gen Z \u2013 thanks, in part, to the meditative sense of flow that comes as the hands perform the rhythmic, repetitive actions. The good news for novices is that it\u2019s super easy to get into crocheting. Knowing the basic kit you need, though, is helpful, so we asked the experts for their advice. These are the tools they recommend if you are starting out, and the stuff they say you don\u2019t need. Yarn Yarn comes in varying thicknesses, or weights, for different types of projects. But the only one those just starting out in crochet need worry about is medium-weight double knit (DK). This yarn weight is best for beginners because it\u2019s big enough to clearly see each stitch, but not chunky to the point of being unwieldy. Where you should buy from depends on what you plan to create. Yarn Loft, for example, is good for quality and designer yarns, while Crochet UK has an inspiring range of colours. Other retailers include WoolBox, which offers solid all-rounders, lovecrafts.com has a good value section and Etsy is brilliant as a crochet superstore for small, independent brands. Our experts advise, however, that there are certain yarns beginners should avoid at first.

Human rights groups and released detainees say the thousands of of Palestinians who have been through the facility have been subjected to severe abuse and torture. In July, Israel consolidated the various mechanisms approving aid operations in Gaza into one body, the Joint Coordination Board. The JCB sits at Sde Teiman and coordinates logistics with the US, the United Nations and a number of international NGOs. The Guardian viewed an internal USAid document that referred to \u201cthe present JCB location on Sde Teiman IDF base\u201d, located outside of Be\u2019er Sheva in southern Israel. In the document, the base\u2019s name links to its Wikipedia entry, which features photos of blindfolded Palestinian prisoners and details their mistreatment. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Guardian that two USAid officials travel to Sde Teiman daily for JCB meetings with Israeli and UN officials. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep at night knowing that it\u2019s going on,\u201d one US official told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s another form of psychological torture to make someone work there.\u201d The IDF confirmed the location of the JCB but did not respond to questions about the prison. It is not clear whether USAid officials have seen the part of the base where Palestinian prisoners reside. The IDF division that oversees the entry of humanitarian aid works out of \u201ca handful of makeshift trailers\u201d on the base, Jewish Insider has reported. \u201cUSAid is working closely to ensure more effective dialogue between humanitarian partners and the Israeli government to improve the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of humanitarian movements into and throughout Gaza,\u201d a USAid spokesperson wrote by email. \u201cDue to security considerations, we do not comment on the specific locations of our staff.\u201d Human rights groups, whistleblowers and prisoners released from Sde Teiman have described severe violence meted out by Israeli soldiers in the facility, including rape, beatings, electric shocks and force feedings. An Israeli doctor who worked at the camp reported prisoners \u201croutinely\u201d had limbs amputated as a result of prolonged handcuffing. In May, the New York Times reported that 4,000 Palestinians had been through the prison since 7 October. At least 35 died, either at the site or nearby hospitals. \u201cThe situation there is more horrific than anything we\u2019ve heard about Abu Ghraib and Guant\u00e1namo,\u201d Khaled Mahajneh, a lawyer who visited Sde Teiman, told +972 Magazine. In a lawsuit surrounding the conditions in Sde Teiman, the Israeli government reported to the country\u2019s high court of justice that 24 prisoners remained there and that conditions were set to improve with the opening of a new wing. \u201cWe have no indication that the living conditions in the camp have indeed been improved, as our lawyers have still not had access to the camp to assess that,\u201d Tal Steiner, executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, told the Guardian. The Israeli human rights organization B\u2019Tselem reports that Sde Teiman is part of a network of detention facilities where torture has become widespread in the last year. Israel is investigating 10 IDF soldiers and reservists who were posted at the prison for sexual violence, after one prisoner was hospitalized in critical condition. The investigations sparked violent far-right attacks on two military bases in support of the soldiers under investigation. The state department spokesperson, Matt Miller, called the allegations of sexual abuse \u201chorrific\u201d and said those involved \u201cought to be held accountable\u201d. Israel previously coordinated humanitarian operations out of site 61 on Hatzor airbase near Ashdod, north of Gaza. Weeks before the operation moved to Sde Teiman, Samantha Power, the USAid administrator, visited site 61. \u201cI think what\u2019s happening in this room is incredibly important,\u201d she said. Israel\u2019s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat), which oversees the JCB, holds daily meetings at the Sde Teiman base with USAid and UN representatives, the American officials told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big base,\u201d a Cogat spokesperson said. The sources say that the relocation of the humanitarian operations center to Sde Teiman has been a closely guarded secret, and that USAid documents and internal correspondence list the location as Be\u2019er Sheva. An Israeli military factsheet confirms the consolidation of the JCB at the end of July without naming its location. \u201cMembers meet every morning to discuss the day\u2019s planned activities in detail,\u201d the factsheet says. \u201cThese efforts underscore Israel\u2019s commitment to work in close collaboration with humanitarian actors and constantly improve existing mechanisms so that humanitarian teams can operate effectively, and that aid reaches those in need.\u201d But the officials who spoke with the Guardian said that the Israeli military has undermined coordination with the UN and humanitarian organizations over the past year, and the relocation of the JCB to Sde Teiman reflected that. \u201cIt seems like trolling,\u201d one of them told the Guardian. Power, the administrator of USAid, established herself two decades ago as one of America\u2019s most prominent advocates for a foreign policy that centers human rights. But over the past year, she has come under fire from her own staff for not getting Israel to allow more aid into Gaza. USAid staff have coordinated dissent memos on private group chats, held vigils for slain aid workers outside of the Washington office, and confronted USAid leadership in meetings. Seventy-six staffers sent a letter in March to the leadership of the agency\u2019s Bureau for Resilience, Environment, and Food Security criticizing USAid\u2019s \u201csilence on the suffering of Gaza\u201d. In a separate open letter from January, 128 USAid officials wrote to the agency\u2019s global health leader, Atul Gawande, seeking \u201cgreater advocacy for the protection of civilian life and to salvage the little that remains of the health care system in Gaza\u201d. Gawande responded by saying he and USAid leadership were \u201cpressing for Israel to restore water, food, fuel, communications, and electricity in Gaza and to adhere to international humanitarian law\u201d. But USAid staffers question the efficacy of their efforts without a sustained ceasefire. Power has been actively involved in the US\u2019s response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. On 6 September, she and Maj Gen Ghassan Alian, the head of Cogat, \u201cdiscussed immediate actions that can be taken to improve the operation of the Joint Coordination Board\u201d, according to a USAid statement.",

      "bodyText": "Two young female journalists who were sentenced to lengthy prison terms for reporting on the death of Mahsa Amini have been cleared of charges of collaborating with the United States government but will still spend up to five more years behind bars, the Iranian authorities have announced. Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi were arrested in 2022 after reporting on the death and funeral of Amini, the young Kurdish woman who died in police custody in 2022, sparking the nationwide Women, Life, Freedom protests. Hamedi and Mohammadi were initially charged with \u201ccollusion and assembly against national security\u201d and \u201cpropaganda activity against the regime\u201d and sentenced to 13 and 12 years respectively. In January they were released from prison after 17 months in detention and their sentences have now been reduced to five years each after a court acquitted them of further charges of \u201ccollaboration with the United States\u201d. On Sunday, an Iranian judicial spokesperson, Asghar Jahangir, said the five-year prison sentences would now be imposed but did not indicate when, meaning that the two women will have to wait to see when the authorities will implement the court ruling. The families and lawyers representing the two women said they had hoped they would be pardoned and allowed to remain free, after state media reported last year that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei intended to pardon \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of prisoners, including those arrested during the Women, Life, Freedom protests. Skylar Thompson, director of advocacy at the US-based organisation Human Rights Activists in Iran, said: \u201cThe regime\u2019s refusal to grant these journalists the 2023 amnesty represents a blatant disregard for justice.\u201d A Tehran-based journalist said on condition of anonymity: \u201cWe had all hoped that Niloofar and Elaheh are pardoned soon and are shocked by the announcement. We don\u2019t know what will happen next or when, and where they will be taken to. \u201cNow that they have made this announcement, this in itself is a sentence. They are psychologically torturing them and their families.\u201d Human rights activists said that two years on, the regime continues to target and punish those who took part in the nationwide protests that followed Amini\u2019s death. Iran has already executed 10 protesters, including Gholamreza Rasaei, who was hanged in August after being convicted of killing a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to Human Rights Watch, relatives of people killed, executed or imprisoned during the Women, Life, Freedom protests have also been arrested, threatened and harassed by the regime.",

      "body": "<p>The View, America\u2019s most popular daytime talkshow, was on commercial break. Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1613735412893424\">sat writing absence notes</a> for students who were missing class to attend the live broadcast. \u201cIs it just today, right?\u201d the vice-president laughed.</p> <p>She handed over the letters written on notepaper headed \u201cThe Vice President\u201d. One said: \u201cDear teacher, please excuse Dani from class today. She was hanging out with us. Best and thank you for being an educator. Kamala.\u201d</p> <p>It was an unscripted moment that the studio audience loved but TV viewers wouldn\u2019t see. Harris, running the shortest presidential campaign in modern US history after being unexpectedly plunged into the fight when Joe Biden dropped out, is exploring ways to reveal herself to a wary nation.</p> <p>Still a relatively unknown quantity, the former California attorney general and US senator is trying to make the electorate feel comfortable about the prospect of President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/18/kamala-harris-presidential-candidate\">Kamala Harris</a>.</p> <p>In less than three months the vice-president has raised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/harris-funding-swing-state-concerns\">a record-breaking billion dollars</a>. She has tried to put daylight between herself and the unpopular incumbent figure of Biden, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/09/kamala-harris-donald-trump-change-campaign-strategies\">turn the election into a referendum</a> on her opponent, former US president Donald Trump. She has sought to bring positive vibes to a country that seems to have anxiety in its bones. She has set out to persuade America to do something that it has never done before in its 248-year existence: elect a woman to the White House \u2013 and a woman of colour to boot.</p>    <p>Harris has done it while carrying the burden of the hopes of millions in America and beyond who fear the return of Trump to the White House would herald a new dark age for American democracy and the planet. Opinion polls suggest the race is currently a dead heat.</p> <p>Last week the Guardian joined her for three days on the campaign trail, flying hundreds of miles across country on Air Force Two, trailing her motorcade as it halted traffic in Manhattan and putting questions to her in two off-the-record gatherings with reporters. The Democratic nominee was lawyerly on some topics and disarmingly open on others. She could display righteous anger, for example about Trump\u2019s affinity with dictators, but also a light touch and homespun wit. She was comfortable in her skin.</p> <p>No presidential candidate has enjoyed the use of Air Force Two since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/14/uselections2000.usa12\">Democrat Al Gore in 2000</a>. At first glance it resembles the presidential plane, Air Force One, painted blue and white with the typeface for the legend \u201cUnited States of America\u201d similar to the one used in the Declaration of Independence.</p> <p>But inside it is a less glamorous affair: dated decor of dark brown chairs, white cabin walls, a blank TV screen. Inside a seat pocket was a tatty, dog-eared leaflet entitled: \u201cC-32A. Boeing 757-22 safety\u201d. There is no wifi or inflight entertainment. The main clues as to its special status is a vice-presidential seal on a wall and on phone handsets beside windows.</p> <p>Another clue: the frequent appearance of Harris, after boarding but before takeoff, to ask reporters \u201cwhat you got?\u201d on an off-the-record basis with aides keeping watch. The 59-year-old stands at 5ft 4in and a quarter, her makeup and clothing immaculate, her gaze fixed on each reporter as they ask and she answers. The mood is convivial. The charisma factor is high. The responses are enlightening rather than revelatory.</p> <p>Harris\u2019s willingness to hold such interactions might explain a mismatch between her perceived media shyness and a more generous attitude among some journalists. She was long criticised for dodging interviews, a topic the Guardian raised with her in person. But a candidate\u2019s willingness to engage with reporters behind the scenes can add a frisson of exclusivity; doing so off the record can give the impression of authenticity.</p> <p>Notably, in the days before she was a candidate, Harris would often struggle to attract media interest in her travels, sometimes flying with a solitary reporter. Some allies believe this explains why she was underreported and underappreciated for so long.</p> <p>This week, however, she launched an intense media blitz. Having told her story at the Democratic national convention in Chicago, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/prosecutor-kamala-harris-put-trump-on-trial-but-the-court-of-public-opinion-can-be-fickle\">prosecuted the case against Trump</a> at their only debate in Philadelphia, she was now on a kaleidoscopic interview tour designed, as CNN put it, to project \u201cin four words, \u2018I\u2019m a normal person.\u2019 (And that Trump is not.)\u201d</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/27/frank-luntz-interview-pollster-us-uk-politics\">Frank Luntz</a>, a political consultant and pollster, said: \u201cThe secret of this campaign is that Donald Trump needs to say less and Kamala Harris needs to say more. The more that Trump says, the worse he gets; the less that Harris says, the worse she gets. Just as their politics are exactly the opposite, so are their strategies.\u201d</p> <p>Harris appeared on 60 Minutes, a heavyweight current affairs programme on the CBS network that has interviewed every major presidential candidate for more than half a century (Trump agreed but then backed out). She went on the podcast <a href=\"https://www.callherdaddy.com/\">Call Her Daddy</a> in an appeal to young women who follow host Alex Cooper\u2019s frank conversations about sex and relationships (a recent episode was entitled \u201cHeather McMahan: Blow jobs, hall passes, &amp; frat daddies\u201d).</p> <p>During the interview, Cooper asked about the Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019s comments that the vice-president \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything keeping her humble\u201d because she does not have biological children of her own. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-podcast-comments\">Harris responded pointedly</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, as Harris\u2019s motorcade wended its way, streets in midtown Manhattan were temporarily closed down. Hundreds of bustling New Yorkers stopped and stared, learning the art of patience or taking pictures or videos on their phones.</p> <p>The View is based in new studios in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/business/hudson-square-nyc-google-disney.html\">New York\u2019s Hudson Square</a>, with a fast-talking, microphone-wielding warm-up artist keeping the audience amped up. Harris entered to the strains of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s anthem Freedom (a striking contrast to Trump\u2019s lineup of ageing white rockers) and was cheered to the rafters as she embraced Whoopi Goldberg and other co-hosts. She unveiled a policy plan to help the \u201csandwich generation\u201d caught between caring for ageing parents and children.</p> <p>But history has shown that so-called softball interviews often lay the biggest traps. Harris, whose campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/29/election-biden-harris-administration-record\">is an awkward dance</a> of trying to bask in Biden\u2019s legislative accomplishments while shrugging off his perceived failures, was asked if she would have done anything differently from him over the past four years.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of \u2013 and I\u2019ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact,\u201d she replied. Trump scented blood. With characteristic misogyny, he called it Harris\u2019s \u201cdumbest answer so far\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-lashes-out-at-dumb-women-hosts-of-the-view-after-kamala-harris-interview\">and complained</a>: \u201cThe Lamestream Media doesn\u2019t want to pick up the story, the dumb women on the show wish they never asked her the question that led to that Election Defying answer, but the Internet is going WILD.\u201d</p> <p>A chorus of Trump allies joined in but they were not alone in detecting a gaffe. Steve Schmidt, a Trump critic who worked on Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign and first floated the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/13/sarah-palin-republican-party-trump-defamation-trial\">Sarah Palin as his running mate</a>, invoked misstatements by past presidential candidates who went on to lose.</p>    <p>Schmidt <a href=\"https://steveschmidt.substack.com/p/theres-not-a-thing-that-comes-to\">wrote on Substack</a>: \u201cThe question is whether this quote joins John Kerry\u2019s \u2018I voted for it before I voted against it.\u2019 Or John McCain\u2019s \u2018the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\u2019 Or Mitt Romney\u2019s 47% quote: \u2018There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He called it the Harris campaign\u2019s worst day by far since her entry into the race. \u201cIt follows a trend line of creeping incoherence and contradiction within the core message that could be politically fatal if not arrested \u2013 immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Still, as Harris left the View studios, a group of students let out a noise that was half-cheer, half-shriek. She proceeded to an office block containing the satellite radio station SiriusXM and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/kamala-harris-howard-stern-interview?utm\">sat with Howard Stern</a>, whose show has an audience that is 73% male and 85% white. It was her most personal interview of the campaign yet.</p> <p>Among the snippets: she ate a family-sized bag of Doritos after Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. She works out on an elliptical every day and liked Special K cereal. Her first job was cleaning test tubes at her mother\u2019s laboratory and she got fired. Her favourite Formula One driver is Lewis Hamilton. She went to see the band <a href=\"https://thesphere.com/shows/v-u2-immersive-concert-film?utm_source=%20search%20&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=VU22024&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw9p24BhB_EiwA8ID5BrYxxk0mptO7D3R6UbBr5Bf9yLIY5L4vZNeXslSr3czpRQ6fnBA7dhoCjXQQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">U2 at the Sphere in Las Vegas</a> and recommends going with a \u201cclear head\u201d \u2013 meaning not high on drugs \u2013 because \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of visual stimulation\u201d.</p> <p>There was also a rare insight into the weight on her shoulders. Harris said: \u201cI literally lose sleep, and have been, over what is at stake in this election. I mean, honestly, I end the day pretty much every day, these days, asking myself, what can I do more? Because the stakes are so high.\u201d</p> <p>Harris has been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5106766/kamala-harris-first-woman-racial-identity\">reluctant to indulge</a> identity politics and embrace her status as the first Black woman and first woman of south Asian heritage to be a major party nominee. Stern asked if there were people who will not vote for a woman because she is a woman. Harris replied: \u201cListen, I have been the first woman in almost every position I\u2019ve had, so I believe that men and women support women in leadership and that\u2019s been my life experience and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president.\u201d</p> <p>It was a far cry from Hillary Clinton describing her own nomination as \u201ca milestone in our nation\u2019s march toward a more perfect union\u201d and issuing a clarion call for women to break \u201cthe highest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d. Kate Cohen, a columnist for the Washington Post newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/03/kamala-harris-first-female-president/\">wrote</a>: \u201cThis time, we\u2019re quiet \u2013 from superstition, maybe, or from knowing how hope can plant a land mine in your heart. Kamala Harris is keeping it quiet, too, campaigning in unisex Converse sneakers rather than in heels.\u201d</p>    <p>The past two elections have been dominated by class and race. This one might be determined by gender A recent <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/steve-kornacki-new-nbc-news-poll-shows-off-the-charts-gender-gap-between-harris-trump-219964997709\">NBC poll</a> found that men favour Trump over Harris by 12 points, 52% to 40%. Among women, Harris led Trump by 21 points: 58% to 37%. That adds up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/27/donald-trump-kamala-harris-men-women-us-election\">a historic gap of 33 points</a>.</p> <p>The day finished at <a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/\">The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</a>, a comedian whose brand of political satire has had medicinal value in the toxic era of Trump. The late-night show with live band takes place before an audience in Broadway\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.edsullivan.com/ed-sullivan-theater/\">Ed Sullivan Theater</a>, which opened in 1927 with a young Cary Grant and hosted the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964.</p> <p>In an amusing 40-minute interview, Colbert gave Harris two implicit auditions. One was the perennial commander-in-chief test. She proved fiercely authoritative, reminiscent of her finest moments at the debate, in eviscerating Trump as a threat to democracy and national security.</p> <p>\u201cHe openly admires dictators and authoritarians,\u201d she said, her voice rising in indignation. \u201cHe has said he wants to be a dictator on day one if he were elected again as president. He gets played by these guys. He admires so-called strongmen and he gets played because they flatter him or offer him favour.\u201d</p> <p>Reacting to an account by the journalist Bob Woodward that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/trump-putin-covid-test-machines-bob-woodward\">Trump sent Covid testing kits</a> to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin even as US citizens were in need, Harris urged the audience: \u201cThink about what this means on top of him sending love letters to Kim Jong-un. He thinks, well, that\u2019s his friend. What about the American people? They should be your first friend.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert\u2019s other test recalled a longtime staple of election campaigns: which candidate would you rather grab a beer with? The host made it literal by pulling out two cans of <a href=\"https://www.millerhighlife.com/av?url=https://www.millerhighlife.com/\">Miller High Life</a> (chosen by Harris in advance). She took a sip of \u201cthe champagne of beers\u201d and said the last time she drank beer was at a baseball game with husband Doug Emhoff.</p> <p>Soon after, Harris delivered <a href=\"https://x.com/CAPAction/status/1844013328340852736\">a sharp jab at Trump\u2019s expense</a>: \u201cWhen you lost millions of jobs, you lost manufacturing, you lost automotive plants, you lost the election, what does that make you? A loser. This is what somebody at my rallies said. I thought it was funny.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert remarked: \u201cIt\u2019s accurate. It\u2019s accurate.\u201d</p> <p>Harris confessed: \u201cThis is what happens when I drink beer!\u201d</p>    <p>Gore\u2019s defeat in 2000 is often attributed to the notion that, stiff and cerebral, he would have been less fun over a beer than his Republican rival George W Bush. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/people/william-a-galston/\">Bill Galston</a>, who worked on the Gore campaign, said: \u201cLikability counts in politics everywhere but particularly when you\u2019re dealing with someone who\u2019s going to be a major presence in your life, for good or ill, for the next four years.</p> <p>\u201cA fair number of people are asking themselves, do I want to spend the next four years with this person in my living room or on my computer? Will I dread or worry about each encounter? Or will it be relatively pleasant even if not always agreeable in substance? That does matter.\u201d</p> <p>As a candidate, Harris has projected happy warrior, placing a bet that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-politics-of-joy-democrats-are-embracing-the-sunny-side\">politics of joy </a>will elevate rather than clash with the national mood. As vice-president, she must still discharge solemn duties. On Wednesday, hunkered down at a New York hotel, she joined Biden on a call with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, (<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/politics/bob-woodward-book-war-joe-biden-putin-netanyahu-trump/index.html\">according to Woodward\u2019s book</a>, Biden has previously described Netanyahu as a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d and \u201cbad fucking guy\u201d). She remains under pressure from progressives to distance herself from Biden\u2019s Gaza policy.</p> <p>Harris also took part in a briefing on preparations for Hurricane Milton and gave phone interviews to CNN and The Weather Channel. Part of her mission was to counter disinformation spread by Trump and his acolytes.</p>    <p>In the afternoon the vice-president flew on Air Force Two from New York to Las Vegas, disembarking in desert heat and beholding the kitsch delights of Sin City including replicas of the Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty and Great Pyramid and Great Sphinx of Giza. Earlier that day the Tropicana hotel and casino, a relic of the mob era, had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/tropicana-implosion-las-vegas\">reduced to rubble in a controlled implosion</a>. Elsewhere, gamblers were still trying their luck at blackjack or in vast arcades of slot machines.

While some Americans are still asking, who is Kamala Harris?, no one, it seems, is asking who is Donald Trump? As the Atlantic magazine noted in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/kamala-harris-atlantic-endorsement/679944/\">an endorsement of Harris</a> this week: \u201cNo voter could be ignorant by now of who he is.

      "bodyText": "The View, America\u2019s most popular daytime talkshow, was on commercial break. Kamala Harris sat writing absence notes for students who were missing class to attend the live broadcast. \u201cIs it just today, right?\u201d the vice-president laughed. She handed over the letters written on notepaper headed \u201cThe Vice President\u201d. One said: \u201cDear teacher, please excuse Dani from class today. She was hanging out with us. Best and thank you for being an educator. Kamala.\u201d It was an unscripted moment that the studio audience loved but TV viewers wouldn\u2019t see. Harris, running the shortest presidential campaign in modern US history after being unexpectedly plunged into the fight when Joe Biden dropped out, is exploring ways to reveal herself to a wary nation. Still a relatively unknown quantity, the former California attorney general and US senator is trying to make the electorate feel comfortable about the prospect of President Kamala Harris. In less than three months the vice-president has raised a record-breaking billion dollars. She has tried to put daylight between herself and the unpopular incumbent figure of Biden, and turn the election into a referendum on her opponent, former US president Donald Trump. She has sought to bring positive vibes to a country that seems to have anxiety in its bones. She has set out to persuade America to do something that it has never done before in its 248-year existence: elect a woman to the White House \u2013 and a woman of colour to boot. Harris has done it while carrying the burden of the hopes of millions in America and beyond who fear the return of Trump to the White House would herald a new dark age for American democracy and the planet. Opinion polls suggest the race is currently a dead heat. Last week the Guardian joined her for three days on the campaign trail, flying hundreds of miles across country on Air Force Two, trailing her motorcade as it halted traffic in Manhattan and putting questions to her in two off-the-record gatherings with reporters. The Democratic nominee was lawyerly on some topics and disarmingly open on others. She could display righteous anger, for example about Trump\u2019s affinity with dictators, but also a light touch and homespun wit. She was comfortable in her skin. No presidential candidate has enjoyed the use of Air Force Two since Democrat Al Gore in 2000. At first glance it resembles the presidential plane, Air Force One, painted blue and white with the typeface for the legend \u201cUnited States of America\u201d similar to the one used in the Declaration of Independence. But inside it is a less glamorous affair: dated decor of dark brown chairs, white cabin walls, a blank TV screen. Inside a seat pocket was a tatty, dog-eared leaflet entitled: \u201cC-32A. Boeing 757-22 safety\u201d. There is no wifi or inflight entertainment. The main clues as to its special status is a vice-presidential seal on a wall and on phone handsets beside windows. Another clue: the frequent appearance of Harris, after boarding but before takeoff, to ask reporters \u201cwhat you got?\u201d on an off-the-record basis with aides keeping watch. The 59-year-old stands at 5ft 4in and a quarter, her makeup and clothing immaculate, her gaze fixed on each reporter as they ask and she answers. The mood is convivial. The charisma factor is high. The responses are enlightening rather than revelatory. Harris\u2019s willingness to hold such interactions might explain a mismatch between her perceived media shyness and a more generous attitude among some journalists. She was long criticised for dodging interviews, a topic the Guardian raised with her in person. But a candidate\u2019s willingness to engage with reporters behind the scenes can add a frisson of exclusivity; doing so off the record can give the impression of authenticity. Notably, in the days before she was a candidate, Harris would often struggle to attract media interest in her travels, sometimes flying with a solitary reporter. Some allies believe this explains why she was underreported and underappreciated for so long. This week, however, she launched an intense media blitz. Having told her story at the Democratic national convention in Chicago, and prosecuted the case against Trump at their only debate in Philadelphia, she was now on a kaleidoscopic interview tour designed, as CNN put it, to project \u201cin four words, \u2018I\u2019m a normal person.\u2019 (And that Trump is not.)\u201d Frank Luntz, a political consultant and pollster, said: \u201cThe secret of this campaign is that Donald Trump needs to say less and Kamala Harris needs to say more. The more that Trump says, the worse he gets; the less that Harris says, the worse she gets. Just as their politics are exactly the opposite, so are their strategies.\u201d Harris appeared on 60 Minutes, a heavyweight current affairs programme on the CBS network that has interviewed every major presidential candidate for more than half a century (Trump agreed but then backed out). She went on the podcast Call Her Daddy in an appeal to young women who follow host Alex Cooper\u2019s frank conversations about sex and relationships (a recent episode was entitled \u201cHeather McMahan: Blow jobs, hall passes, &amp; frat daddies\u201d). During the interview, Cooper asked about the Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019s comments that the vice-president \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything keeping her humble\u201d because she does not have biological children of her own. Harris responded pointedly: \u201cI don\u2019t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble.\u201d On Tuesday, as Harris\u2019s motorcade wended its way, streets in midtown Manhattan were temporarily closed down. Hundreds of bustling New Yorkers stopped and stared, learning the art of patience or taking pictures or videos on their phones. The View is based in new studios in New York\u2019s Hudson Square, with a fast-talking, microphone-wielding warm-up artist keeping the audience amped up. Harris entered to the strains of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s anthem Freedom (a striking contrast to Trump\u2019s lineup of ageing white rockers) and was cheered to the rafters as she embraced Whoopi Goldberg and other co-hosts. She unveiled a policy plan to help the \u201csandwich generation\u201d caught between caring for ageing parents and children. But history has shown that so-called softball interviews often lay the biggest traps. Harris, whose campaign is an awkward dance of trying to bask in Biden\u2019s legislative accomplishments while shrugging off his perceived failures, was asked if she would have done anything differently from him over the past four years. \u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of \u2013 and I\u2019ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact,\u201d she replied. Trump scented blood. With characteristic misogyny, he called it Harris\u2019s \u201cdumbest answer so far\u201d and complained: \u201cThe Lamestream Media doesn\u2019t want to pick up the story, the dumb women on the show wish they never asked her the question that led to that Election Defying answer, but the Internet is going WILD.\u201d A chorus of Trump allies joined in but they were not alone in detecting a gaffe. Steve Schmidt, a Trump critic who worked on Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign and first floated the idea of Sarah Palin as his running mate, invoked misstatements by past presidential candidates who went on to lose. Schmidt wrote on Substack: \u201cThe question is whether this quote joins John Kerry\u2019s \u2018I voted for it before I voted against it.\u2019 Or John McCain\u2019s \u2018the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\u2019 Or Mitt Romney\u2019s 47% quote: \u2018There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.\u2019\u201d He called it the Harris campaign\u2019s worst day by far since her entry into the race. \u201cIt follows a trend line of creeping incoherence and contradiction within the core message that could be politically fatal if not arrested \u2013 immediately.\u201d Still, as Harris left the View studios, a group of students let out a noise that was half-cheer, half-shriek. She proceeded to an office block containing the satellite radio station SiriusXM and sat with Howard Stern, whose show has an audience that is 73% male and 85% white. It was her most personal interview of the campaign yet. Among the snippets: she ate a family-sized bag of Doritos after Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. She works out on an elliptical every day and liked Special K cereal. Her first job was cleaning test tubes at her mother\u2019s laboratory and she got fired. Her favourite Formula One driver is Lewis Hamilton. She went to see the band U2 at the Sphere in Las Vegas and recommends going with a \u201cclear head\u201d \u2013 meaning not high on drugs \u2013 because \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of visual stimulation\u201d. There was also a rare insight into the weight on her shoulders. Harris said: \u201cI literally lose sleep, and have been, over what is at stake in this election. I mean, honestly, I end the day pretty much every day, these days, asking myself, what can I do more? Because the stakes are so high.\u201d Harris has been reluctant to indulge identity politics and embrace her status as the first Black woman and first woman of south Asian heritage to be a major party nominee. Stern asked if there were people who will not vote for a woman because she is a woman. Harris replied: \u201cListen, I have been the first woman in almost every position I\u2019ve had, so I believe that men and women support women in leadership and that\u2019s been my life experience and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president.\u201d It was a far cry from Hillary Clinton describing her own nomination as \u201ca milestone in our nation\u2019s march toward a more perfect union\u201d and issuing a clarion call for women to break \u201cthe highest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d. Kate Cohen, a columnist for the Washington Post newspaper, wrote: \u201cThis time, we\u2019re quiet \u2013 from superstition, maybe, or from knowing how hope can plant a land mine in your heart. Kamala Harris is keeping it quiet, too, campaigning in unisex Converse sneakers rather than in heels.\u201d The past two elections have been dominated by class and race. This one might be determined by gender A recent NBC poll found that men favour Trump over Harris by 12 points, 52% to 40%. Among women, Harris led Trump by 21 points: 58% to 37%. That adds up to a historic gap of 33 points. The day finished at The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, a comedian whose brand of political satire has had medicinal value in the toxic era of Trump. The late-night show with live band takes place before an audience in Broadway\u2019s Ed Sullivan Theater, which opened in 1927 with a young Cary Grant and hosted the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. In an amusing 40-minute interview, Colbert gave Harris two implicit auditions. One was the perennial commander-in-chief test. She proved fiercely authoritative, reminiscent of her finest moments at the debate, in eviscerating Trump as a threat to democracy and national security. \u201cHe openly admires dictators and authoritarians,\u201d she said, her voice rising in indignation. \u201cHe has said he wants to be a dictator on day one if he were elected again as president. He gets played by these guys. He admires so-called strongmen and he gets played because they flatter him or offer him favour.\u201d Reacting to an account by the journalist Bob Woodward that Trump sent Covid testing kits to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin even as US citizens were in need, Harris urged the audience: \u201cThink about what this means on top of him sending love letters to Kim Jong-un. He thinks, well, that\u2019s his friend. What about the American people? They should be your first friend.\u201d Colbert\u2019s other test recalled a longtime staple of election campaigns: which candidate would you rather grab a beer with? The host made it literal by pulling out two cans of Miller High Life (chosen by Harris in advance). She took a sip of \u201cthe champagne of beers\u201d and said the last time she drank beer was at a baseball game with husband Doug Emhoff. Soon after, Harris delivered a sharp jab at Trump\u2019s expense: \u201cWhen you lost millions of jobs, you lost manufacturing, you lost automotive plants, you lost the election, what does that make you? A loser. This is what somebody at my rallies said. I thought it was funny.\u201d Colbert remarked: \u201cIt\u2019s accurate. It\u2019s accurate.\u201d Harris confessed: \u201cThis is what happens when I drink beer!\u201d Gore\u2019s defeat in 2000 is often attributed to the notion that, stiff and cerebral, he would have been less fun over a beer than his Republican rival George W Bush. Bill Galston, who worked on the Gore campaign, said: \u201cLikability counts in politics everywhere but particularly when you\u2019re dealing with someone who\u2019s going to be a major presence in your life, for good or ill, for the next four years. \u201cA fair number of people are asking themselves, do I want to spend the next four years with this person in my living room or on my computer? Will I dread or worry about each encounter? Or will it be relatively pleasant even if not always agreeable in substance? That does matter.\u201d As a candidate, Harris has projected happy warrior, placing a bet that the politics of joy will elevate rather than clash with the national mood. As vice-president, she must still discharge solemn duties. On Wednesday, hunkered down at a New York hotel, she joined Biden on a call with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, (according to Woodward\u2019s book, Biden has previously described Netanyahu as a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d and \u201cbad fucking guy\u201d). She remains under pressure from progressives to distance herself from Biden\u2019s Gaza policy. Harris also took part in a briefing on preparations for Hurricane Milton and gave phone interviews to CNN and The Weather Channel. Part of her mission was to counter disinformation spread by Trump and his acolytes. In the afternoon the vice-president flew on Air Force Two from New York to Las Vegas, disembarking in desert heat and beholding the kitsch delights of Sin City including replicas of the Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty and Great Pyramid and Great Sphinx of Giza. Earlier that day the Tropicana hotel and casino, a relic of the mob era, had been reduced to rubble in a controlled implosion. Elsewhere, gamblers were still trying their luck at blackjack or in vast arcades of slot machines. It was a metaphor-rich environment for a candidate seeking to prove her authenticity, avoid campaign mishaps and counter accusations that she is risk averse. She is doing it all in competition with a man about whom little mystery remains. While some Americans are still asking, who is Kamala Harris?, no one, it seems, is asking who is Donald Trump? As the Atlantic magazine noted in an endorsement of Harris this week: \u201cNo voter could be ignorant by now of who he is.

      "body": "<p>How\u2019s your pain threshold? For a few months now, I\u2019ve been obsessively watching videos of men trying period pain simulators. The machines have wired abdominal pads that send electrical impulses controlled by a console that can replicate the ferocity of cramps on a range of one to 10. Often by five or six on the dial, men are groaning or even screaming in agony while their female partners, also hooked up to the machine, sit unfazed.</p> <p>Like many, many women, I am habituated to a certain level of pain. From girlhood, we go about our lives in varying levels of agony, often with the people around us knowing little of our discomfort. There are days, though, when it all becomes too much. It used to be that all you had to do was vaguely mention \u201cwomen\u2019s problems\u201d to be granted some respite. Not so any more, at least in some schools.</p> <p>Last week Neale-Wade Academy in Cambridgeshire <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g583q7k17o\">has had to reverse its policy</a> on period pain following an outcry on social media. I\u2019m not surprised: pupils had<strong> </strong>been told that time off school for period pains will be classed as an unauthorised absence, unless medical information was provided by parents. This was ridiculous and possibly discriminatory (the headteacher has now confirmed that based on Department for Education guidance, no such evidence will need to be shown). But it also sent the message that women and girls are not reliable witnesses to what they experience in their own bodies \u2013 a gendered assumption that they will wrestle with their entire lives as they encounter widespread medical misogyny.</p> <p>Were I the parent of a girl at this school not only would I have been livid, but I\u2019d have been tempted to furnish the principal, Graham Horn, who is of course a man, with exactly what was requested. Namely, too much information. You see, I\u2019m old enough to remember the good old days of early-2000s feminism, and the amusing tactic that many women resorted to when male Republican, anti-abortion politicians made ill-informed statements about female biology.</p> <p>They would find them on Facebook or on Twitter and provide them with extremely detailed information about their various gynaecological issues. I will never forget the hilarity of reading one poster\u2019s vivid retelling of trying to find an absorbent enough tampon for her extremely heavy flow. You want to poke your nose into female biology? Be careful what you wish for.</p> <p>The period simulator videos are fascinating because they encapsulate just how conditioned women have become to enduring our own physical discomfort and suffering. Period cramps, after all, can be as <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/headlines/2018/mar/doctors-finally-confirm-period-pain-can-be-painful-heart-attack\">painful as a heart attack</a>. (I also find the male solidarity quite moving. These are men who are willing to expose themselves as vulnerable in the interests of empathy.)</p> <p>I have been having periods for more than 20 years. But when I see the grimaces on these men\u2019s faces, I can dimly remember the shock I felt as a young teen at the intensity of the cramps coursing through me as I writhed on the bed in a foetal position. I used to pass out a lot as well.</p> <p>I consider myself lucky. I have friends who vomit repeatedly every time they menstruate, or who have endured several surgeries for endometriosis. They have struggled to be taken seriously by doctors, or to receive the pain relief they so desperately need. And their period cramps are often just a precursor to a whole range of medical events they end up having to endure, from having precancerous cells burned off your cervix to having your fallopian tubes unblocked without anaesthetic.</p> <p>I was told my bad period pain would mean that I would probably cope well with the pain of labour contractions (and indeed, some lucky women do say that, for them, they felt no worse than period pain). Sweet summer child that I was, I almost bought it. I hadn\u2019t bargained for a back-to-back baby. My period pain has never been so bad that I\u2019ve seriously contemplated jumping out of the window \u2013 not hyperbole \u2013 with that Kristin Scott Thomas speech in Fleabag ringing in my ears:<em> \u201c</em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZrnHnASRV8\">Women are born with pain built in</a>.\u201d</p> <p>But the medical establishment can be shockingly laissez-faire about that pain. Too many women are still having to beg for pain relief in labour.<strong> </strong>And it never ceases to shock me that some new mothers are sent home, post C-section, with nothing more than two paracetamol. This minimisation of female pain \u2013 internalised by so many of us \u2013 can then be passed on from mother to daughter like a sickness. Sometimes late at night I\u2019ll lurk on <a href=\"https://www.mumsnet.com/\">Mumsnet</a> threads and see comments such as: \u201cShould I take my child to A&amp;E? They\u2019re short of breath and vomiting blood but I don\u2019t want to waste NHS time.\u201d</p> <p>Society-wide change is needed to tackle female pain, not to mention new innovations in pain relief (and please, for the love of god, legalise cannabis, which some women in the US are finding <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cannabis-tampons-foria-relief-period-painkiller-cramps-lower-back-pain-a7220381.html\">really helps.</a>) Male solidarity and empathy is part of that picture. I recently caught the Almeida theatre\u2019s production of The Years, which features a scene during which a bloodied Romola Garai recounts, in graphic detail, how it feels to pass a dead foetus after an abortion. I had read that theatregoers were fainting and having to be carried out. I assumed that these people would be women, triggered by a reminder of their own pain and trauma.</p> <p>Reader, I was sexist. It was the men who couldn\u2019t cope, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jul/31/london-play-the-years-paused-after-theatregoers-felt-faint-during-abortion-scene\">one of whom shouted</a> at the cast for not warning him. It was a graphic portrayal, to be sure, but to most people who have had a heavy period, an abortion, a miscarriage, or given birth, it will just have felt true.

      "bodyText": "How\u2019s your pain threshold? For a few months now, I\u2019ve been obsessively watching videos of men trying period pain simulators. The machines have wired abdominal pads that send electrical impulses controlled by a console that can replicate the ferocity of cramps on a range of one to 10. Often by five or six on the dial, men are groaning or even screaming in agony while their female partners, also hooked up to the machine, sit unfazed. Like many, many women, I am habituated to a certain level of pain. From girlhood, we go about our lives in varying levels of agony, often with the people around us knowing little of our discomfort. There are days, though, when it all becomes too much. It used to be that all you had to do was vaguely mention \u201cwomen\u2019s problems\u201d to be granted some respite. Not so any more, at least in some schools. Last week Neale-Wade Academy in Cambridgeshire has had to reverse its policy on period pain following an outcry on social media. I\u2019m not surprised: pupils had been told that time off school for period pains will be classed as an unauthorised absence, unless medical information was provided by parents. This was ridiculous and possibly discriminatory (the headteacher has now confirmed that based on Department for Education guidance, no such evidence will need to be shown). But it also sent the message that women and girls are not reliable witnesses to what they experience in their own bodies \u2013 a gendered assumption that they will wrestle with their entire lives as they encounter widespread medical misogyny. Were I the parent of a girl at this school not only would I have been livid, but I\u2019d have been tempted to furnish the principal, Graham Horn, who is of course a man, with exactly what was requested. Namely, too much information. You see, I\u2019m old enough to remember the good old days of early-2000s feminism, and the amusing tactic that many women resorted to when male Republican, anti-abortion politicians made ill-informed statements about female biology. They would find them on Facebook or on Twitter and provide them with extremely detailed information about their various gynaecological issues. I will never forget the hilarity of reading one poster\u2019s vivid retelling of trying to find an absorbent enough tampon for her extremely heavy flow. You want to poke your nose into female biology? Be careful what you wish for. The period simulator videos are fascinating because they encapsulate just how conditioned women have become to enduring our own physical discomfort and suffering. Period cramps, after all, can be as painful as a heart attack. (I also find the male solidarity quite moving. These are men who are willing to expose themselves as vulnerable in the interests of empathy.) I have been having periods for more than 20 years. But when I see the grimaces on these men\u2019s faces, I can dimly remember the shock I felt as a young teen at the intensity of the cramps coursing through me as I writhed on the bed in a foetal position. I used to pass out a lot as well. I consider myself lucky. I have friends who vomit repeatedly every time they menstruate, or who have endured several surgeries for endometriosis. They have struggled to be taken seriously by doctors, or to receive the pain relief they so desperately need. And their period cramps are often just a precursor to a whole range of medical events they end up having to endure, from having precancerous cells burned off your cervix to having your fallopian tubes unblocked without anaesthetic. I was told my bad period pain would mean that I would probably cope well with the pain of labour contractions (and indeed, some lucky women do say that, for them, they felt no worse than period pain). Sweet summer child that I was, I almost bought it. I hadn\u2019t bargained for a back-to-back baby. My period pain has never been so bad that I\u2019ve seriously contemplated jumping out of the window \u2013 not hyperbole \u2013 with that Kristin Scott Thomas speech in Fleabag ringing in my ears: \u201cWomen are born with pain built in.\u201d But the medical establishment can be shockingly laissez-faire about that pain. Too many women are still having to beg for pain relief in labour. And it never ceases to shock me that some new mothers are sent home, post C-section, with nothing more than two paracetamol. This minimisation of female pain \u2013 internalised by so many of us \u2013 can then be passed on from mother to daughter like a sickness. Sometimes late at night I\u2019ll lurk on Mumsnet threads and see comments such as: \u201cShould I take my child to A&amp;E? They\u2019re short of breath and vomiting blood but I don\u2019t want to waste NHS time.\u201d Society-wide change is needed to tackle female pain, not to mention new innovations in pain relief (and please, for the love of god, legalise cannabis, which some women in the US are finding really helps.) Male solidarity and empathy is part of that picture. I recently caught the Almeida theatre\u2019s production of The Years, which features a scene during which a bloodied Romola Garai recounts, in graphic detail, how it feels to pass a dead foetus after an abortion. I had read that theatregoers were fainting and having to be carried out. I assumed that these people would be women, triggered by a reminder of their own pain and trauma. Reader, I was sexist. It was the men who couldn\u2019t cope, one of whom shouted at the cast for not warning him. It was a graphic portrayal, to be sure, but to most people who have had a heavy period, an abortion, a miscarriage, or given birth, it will just have felt true. Some men still don\u2019t know the half of it. That\u2019s why truth, solidarity and believing women when they describe their own pain matters.

      "body": "<p>Black history must be made mandatory in England to counter hatred and help prevent racist riots, a leading campaigner says.</p> <p>Lavinya Stennett, who founded the Black Curriculum, warned of the real risks of black history and a diverse curriculum being relegated to just one month, or only being implemented in schools with diverse students and in metropolitan areas.</p> <p>She pointed to the riots that broke out in England and Northern Ireland in the summer as the consequences of failures to ensure that diverse teaching is widespread and available to all.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as we place black history as a thing that is in October, as long as we continue to place black history as a thing that\u2019s only for black people, as long as black history is only focused on the metropolitan areas and negating those rural areas where a lot of the riots actually kicked off, then we\u2019ll forever have instances of young people \u2026 continue to be ignorant and racism will be fuelled,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Stennett spoke to the Guardian for Black History Month ahead of her upcoming memoir Omitted: The Untold Black History Lessons We Need to Change the Future. The book also explores the 27-year-old\u2019s time in foster care and in pupil referral units.</p> <p>Stennett said that while there was a flurry of interest in the black curriculum during the Black Lives Matter protests, systemic change had been too slow.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lack of appetite in this country to systemically recognise the importance of who we are and recognise our full humanity. Interventions that recognise our [black Britons\u2019] importance are more than just \u2018let\u2019s talk about racism\u2019,\u201d Stennett said.</p> <p>She pointed to the national curriculum as an example of this. \u201cWhy are we still facing so much resistance to having a curriculum that accurately reflects who we are as a people, and also providing \u2026 mandatory training for teachers, or they won\u2019t recognise racial literacy as a safeguarding issue?\u201d</p> <p>Stennett criticised the previous government\u2019s opposition to what it deemed \u201canti-white\u201d rhetoric in schools, saying it had a chilling effect on their ability to teach black history.</p> <p>The Department for Education <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/01/legal-threat-governments-anti-capitalist-guidance-schools-political\">guidance states</a> that schools should not \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d work with or use material from groups that promote \u201cvictim narratives that are harmful to British society\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a few schools that we had engaged with that said we\u2019re not sure how to engage with you, we don\u2019t have to break the law,\u201d Stennett said.</p> <p>She believes the government must be clear and unequivocal in its support for the black curriculum: \u201cThis new government needs to say that it is mandatory that all schools engage with this, that it\u2019s mandatory that teachers do this training.</p> <p>\u201cThey need to put some metrics to it. This is what we want teachers to achieve by 2027 for example, because I think leaving it to teachers to just decide is not working.\u201d</p> <p>She points to the gulf between what students are learning in Wales, which made black history lessons mandatory in Welsh schools, compared with students in England.</p> <p>She has been working with the Welsh organisation Diversity and Anti-Racist Professional Learning (DARPL) for the past three years. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing because there\u2019s a lot of appetite,\u201d she said, adding that there was buy-in from teachers because \u201cnot only is it mandatory, there\u2019s a culture of reward \u2026 It is top-down approved\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWhereas in England, what we try to do is still very much bottom up.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education said the government had recently launched a review of curriculum and assessments, which would \u201cconsider how to ensure young people can access a broad, balanced and cutting-edge curriculum that reflects the issues and diversities of our society\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Black history must be made mandatory in England to counter hatred and help prevent racist riots, a leading campaigner says. Lavinya Stennett, who founded the Black Curriculum, warned of the real risks of black history and a diverse curriculum being relegated to just one month, or only being implemented in schools with diverse students and in metropolitan areas. She pointed to the riots that broke out in England and Northern Ireland in the summer as the consequences of failures to ensure that diverse teaching is widespread and available to all. \u201cAs long as we place black history as a thing that is in October, as long as we continue to place black history as a thing that\u2019s only for black people, as long as black history is only focused on the metropolitan areas and negating those rural areas where a lot of the riots actually kicked off, then we\u2019ll forever have instances of young people \u2026 continue to be ignorant and racism will be fuelled,\u201d she said. Stennett spoke to the Guardian for Black History Month ahead of her upcoming memoir Omitted: The Untold Black History Lessons We Need to Change the Future. The book also explores the 27-year-old\u2019s time in foster care and in pupil referral units. Stennett said that while there was a flurry of interest in the black curriculum during the Black Lives Matter protests, systemic change had been too slow. \u201cThere is a lack of appetite in this country to systemically recognise the importance of who we are and recognise our full humanity. Interventions that recognise our [black Britons\u2019] importance are more than just \u2018let\u2019s talk about racism\u2019,\u201d Stennett said. She pointed to the national curriculum as an example of this. \u201cWhy are we still facing so much resistance to having a curriculum that accurately reflects who we are as a people, and also providing \u2026 mandatory training for teachers, or they won\u2019t recognise racial literacy as a safeguarding issue?\u201d Stennett criticised the previous government\u2019s opposition to what it deemed \u201canti-white\u201d rhetoric in schools, saying it had a chilling effect on their ability to teach black history. The Department for Education guidance states that schools should not \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d work with or use material from groups that promote \u201cvictim narratives that are harmful to British society\u201d. \u201cThere were a few schools that we had engaged with that said we\u2019re not sure how to engage with you, we don\u2019t have to break the law,\u201d Stennett said. She believes the government must be clear and unequivocal in its support for the black curriculum: \u201cThis new government needs to say that it is mandatory that all schools engage with this, that it\u2019s mandatory that teachers do this training. \u201cThey need to put some metrics to it. This is what we want teachers to achieve by 2027 for example, because I think leaving it to teachers to just decide is not working.\u201d She points to the gulf between what students are learning in Wales, which made black history lessons mandatory in Welsh schools, compared with students in England. She has been working with the Welsh organisation Diversity and Anti-Racist Professional Learning (DARPL) for the past three years. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing because there\u2019s a lot of appetite,\u201d she said, adding that there was buy-in from teachers because \u201cnot only is it mandatory, there\u2019s a culture of reward \u2026 It is top-down approved\u201d. \u201cWhereas in England, what we try to do is still very much bottom up.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Education said the government had recently launched a review of curriculum and assessments, which would \u201cconsider how to ensure young people can access a broad, balanced and cutting-edge curriculum that reflects the issues and diversities of our society\u201d.",

The comment was seized on by the Trump campaign, who have used it in an attempt to seize upon Biden\u2019s unpopularity and blame Harris for the issues that seem to most enrage and terrify their supporters, among them high consumer prices and immigration. But the comment also rankled some members of Harris\u2019s own base: namely, the young, progressive and non-white voters who have been distraught over the suffering inflicted by Israel in its US-backed war on Gaza.</p> <p>If Harris can\u2019t think of any way she would differ from Biden, these voters may have some suggestions for her. The Biden approach to Israel, after all, has been disastrous on multiple fronts. It has been a moral catastrophe, with Israel\u2019s wildly disproportionate campaign of indiscriminate slaughter in Gaza leading to famine, plague and tens of thousands of deaths. It has been an electoral liability, alienating Muslim and Arab American voters in the crucial swing state of Michigan and depressing turnout among the young voters whom Democrats have long relied on and which were a crucial part of Biden\u2019s 2020 victory.</p> <p>And it has been a complete strategic failure, with Israel now expanding its war into Lebanon, the region on the brink of a large-scale conflict between American and Iranian proxies, and the whole world watching as American leaders fail to exert any meaningful pressure or discernible consequences on a small country that has used a great number of US weapons while completely ignoring US instruction.</p> <p>There was a moment, earlier in the war, when things could have gone differently. After the 7 October 2023 attacks killed hundreds of innocent Israelis, the Biden administration reportedly urged caution. But it was only in February, some four months into the war, when much of Gaza had already been leveled and its hundreds of thousands of people displaced into the south, that the Biden White House attempted to stop the Israelis from invading Rafah, the small southern border city where the refugees had fled, by delaying a shipment of 2,000lb bombs.</p> <p>The move had broad support: Nancy Pelosi, hardly a robust supporter of the Palestinian cause, was by then urging enforceable conditions on aid to Israel.

By the time the Biden administration even so much as dawdled in sending military support to Israel, tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians had already been massacred. But reportedly, the anger that this small act of non-compliance provoked among Israeli officials and the American pro-Israel lobby was so intense that the Biden administration got spooked.</p> <p>No meaningful conditions have been imposed on military aid since, and Israel has openly flouted American efforts to de-escalate, continuing its brutal assault on Gaza, launching an invasion into Lebanon that has displaced approximately 1 million people, and attempting to provoke Iran into an outright war \u2013 which, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Israeli government seems to believe, America will fight on Israel\u2019s behalf.

She refused to attend Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress when he came to Washington this summer, and she had strong words for the Israeli prime minister when they spoke together at a news conference. Harris also made positive rhetorical gestures towards the plight of Palestinians, saying kind words in her convention speech about the injustice of their suffering and their right to self-determination. But for the most part, that\u2019s all these moves were \u2013 words. Now, Harris has mostly stopped saying them.</p> <p>Voters have noticed. Specifically, Arab American voters in Michigan have.

The uncommitted votes were several times greater in number than Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory in the state. That discontent has not gone away.

      "body": "<p>A former officer in the East German secret police has been sentenced to 10 years in jail for the murder of a Polish firefighter at a Berlin border crossing 50 years ago.</p> <p>Martin Naumann, now 80, shot Czes\u0142aw Kukuczka in the back at close range on 29 March 1974 as Kukuczka walked towards the last in a series of control posts at a transit area in the divided city, having been told he had a free pass to escape to West Berlin.</p> <p>The truth surrounding Kukuczka\u2019s death was never revealed to his family. Instead, his cremated remains were sent in an urn to his wife, Emilia, weeks later, after which he was buried in a private ceremony by his family in southern Poland.</p> <p>It took the dogged research skills of a historian immersed in the history of the Ministry for State Security (MfS), or the Stasi \u2013 which was the intelligence service and secret police of the communist GDR \u2013 to unearth the details of the case years later.</p>    <p>Stefan Appelius found documents about the shooting and the subsequent attempts to cover it up in the archives of the former Stasi, and tracked down Kukuczka\u2019s family in Poland. They alerted the Polish judiciary to the case, who issued a European arrest warrant for Naumann in 2021, which put pressure on German investigative authorities to reopen the case after decades of inaction. Naumann was charged with murder in October last year.</p> <p>Details specifically linking Naumann to the killing had only emerged in 2016, after documents shredded by Stasi officers in the dying days of the regime in order to cover up its activities were pieced together by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/10/germany.kateconnolly1\">digital puzzler machine</a> manufactured specially for the purpose.</p> <p>Naumann, from Leipzig, who had repeatedly denied the charges against him, was one of the first former East German officials to be charged with murder instead of manslaughter. Prosecutors had demanded a 12-year prison sentence for him, highlighting the \u201cparticularly treacherous\u201d characteristic of the killing, namely that Kukuczka was shot having believed he had made it to freedom.</p> <p>The court heard how Kukuczka, a 38-year-old father of three from the mountain village of Kamienica near Krakow in southern Poland, had entered the Polish embassy in East Berlin, demanding permission to allow him to go to West Germany. He had threatened to detonate a fake explosive, which he claimed would have blown up the embassy and other buildings, if he was turned down.</p> <p>Research by the historians Filip Ga\u0144czak and Hans-Hermann Hertle found that embassy staff had contacted the Stasi, telling them of Kukuczka\u2019s threat. In apparent collusion with the embassy, Stasi officials came to meet the Pole, handed him an exit visa and five West Deutschmarks and drove him to the nearby Friedrichstra\u00dfe border point. While Kukuczka was under the impression he was soon to be a free man, Stasi officers had been ordered that he should be \u201crendered harmless\u201d, using a euphemism commonly used for the killing of political opponents.</p> <p>Naumann, hiding behind a strategically placed screen at the station, shot Kukuczka in the back from a distance of around 2 metres after he had crossed two of three control points.</p> <p>According to the Stasi\u2019s report into the incident, \u201coperative forces\u201d succeeded at around 3pm \u201cto render [Kukuczka] harmless without attracting any special attention from other outgoing travellers\u201d.</p> <p>Naumann was described by a lawyer for Kukuczka\u2019s daughter, who was 18 at the time of her father\u2019s death, as \u201cthe last link in a chain of command\u201d that led to the killing, but ultimately it was he who carried out the order, the court heard.</p> <p>Naumann\u2019s lawyer, Andrea Liebscher, had insisted her client was<strong> </strong>innocent and that there was<strong> </strong>no proof that he carried out the shooting or that the killing could be deemed murder rather than manslaughter, on which the statute of limitations would have already expired. She said having made a bomb threat, Kukuczka was not an innocent party and \u201cwould have to have expected authorities to intervene with weapons\u201d.</p> <p>Naumann typically appeared in court wearing a black corduroy cap and trainers, and clutching an office file to cover his face. He was described as having lived a life of quiet retirement for decades in suburban Leipzig, until his past caught up with him in 2016. He spoke only once to confirm his identity. He was decorated after the murder, for special services to border protection (as was the doctor who treated Kukuczka in hospital before he was pronounced dead).</p> <p>Among those to give evidence were three pensioners who were at the time teenagers on a school trip to the communist East Berlin from West Germany. Petra L, 65, a retired teacher from Hessen, recalled having spent a \u201ctypical day\u201d in East Berlin before returning with her classmates through the border controls in the heavily guarded underground tunnel at Friedrichstra\u00dfe station. A man in sunglasses caught her attention, she said. \u201cIt was odd, because we were underground.\u201d She told the court how the man had pulled a pistol, and shot at a man who had passed him with a briefcase, and recalled how those around her \u201cheld their hands to their mouths in shock\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSuddenly doors opened where none had been before then, and people in uniform emerged and sealed the passage,\u201d she said. </p> <p>On the sidelines of the trial, Ga\u0144czak said that while authorities in communist Poland and their counterparts in East Germany (GDR) had attempted to cover up the murder, they disagreed on how to present it. \u201cWhilst the Polish side wanted it to look like Kukuczka had taken his own life, the GDR was not in agreement \u2026 According to a shortened version of events they prepared, there had been an incident at the border crossing, which had resulted in Kukuczka being killed.

      "bodyText": "A former officer in the East German secret police has been sentenced to 10 years in jail for the murder of a Polish firefighter at a Berlin border crossing 50 years ago. Martin Naumann, now 80, shot Czes\u0142aw Kukuczka in the back at close range on 29 March 1974 as Kukuczka walked towards the last in a series of control posts at a transit area in the divided city, having been told he had a free pass to escape to West Berlin. The truth surrounding Kukuczka\u2019s death was never revealed to his family. Instead, his cremated remains were sent in an urn to his wife, Emilia, weeks later, after which he was buried in a private ceremony by his family in southern Poland. It took the dogged research skills of a historian immersed in the history of the Ministry for State Security (MfS), or the Stasi \u2013 which was the intelligence service and secret police of the communist GDR \u2013 to unearth the details of the case years later. Stefan Appelius found documents about the shooting and the subsequent attempts to cover it up in the archives of the former Stasi, and tracked down Kukuczka\u2019s family in Poland. They alerted the Polish judiciary to the case, who issued a European arrest warrant for Naumann in 2021, which put pressure on German investigative authorities to reopen the case after decades of inaction. Naumann was charged with murder in October last year. Details specifically linking Naumann to the killing had only emerged in 2016, after documents shredded by Stasi officers in the dying days of the regime in order to cover up its activities were pieced together by a digital puzzler machine manufactured specially for the purpose. Naumann, from Leipzig, who had repeatedly denied the charges against him, was one of the first former East German officials to be charged with murder instead of manslaughter. Prosecutors had demanded a 12-year prison sentence for him, highlighting the \u201cparticularly treacherous\u201d characteristic of the killing, namely that Kukuczka was shot having believed he had made it to freedom. The court heard how Kukuczka, a 38-year-old father of three from the mountain village of Kamienica near Krakow in southern Poland, had entered the Polish embassy in East Berlin, demanding permission to allow him to go to West Germany. He had threatened to detonate a fake explosive, which he claimed would have blown up the embassy and other buildings, if he was turned down. Research by the historians Filip Ga\u0144czak and Hans-Hermann Hertle found that embassy staff had contacted the Stasi, telling them of Kukuczka\u2019s threat. In apparent collusion with the embassy, Stasi officials came to meet the Pole, handed him an exit visa and five West Deutschmarks and drove him to the nearby Friedrichstra\u00dfe border point. While Kukuczka was under the impression he was soon to be a free man, Stasi officers had been ordered that he should be \u201crendered harmless\u201d, using a euphemism commonly used for the killing of political opponents. Naumann, hiding behind a strategically placed screen at the station, shot Kukuczka in the back from a distance of around 2 metres after he had crossed two of three control points. According to the Stasi\u2019s report into the incident, \u201coperative forces\u201d succeeded at around 3pm \u201cto render [Kukuczka] harmless without attracting any special attention from other outgoing travellers\u201d. Naumann was described by a lawyer for Kukuczka\u2019s daughter, who was 18 at the time of her father\u2019s death, as \u201cthe last link in a chain of command\u201d that led to the killing, but ultimately it was he who carried out the order, the court heard. Naumann\u2019s lawyer, Andrea Liebscher, had insisted her client was innocent and that there was no proof that he carried out the shooting or that the killing could be deemed murder rather than manslaughter, on which the statute of limitations would have already expired. She said having made a bomb threat, Kukuczka was not an innocent party and \u201cwould have to have expected authorities to intervene with weapons\u201d. Naumann typically appeared in court wearing a black corduroy cap and trainers, and clutching an office file to cover his face. He was described as having lived a life of quiet retirement for decades in suburban Leipzig, until his past caught up with him in 2016. He spoke only once to confirm his identity. He was decorated after the murder, for special services to border protection (as was the doctor who treated Kukuczka in hospital before he was pronounced dead). Among those to give evidence were three pensioners who were at the time teenagers on a school trip to the communist East Berlin from West Germany. Petra L, 65, a retired teacher from Hessen, recalled having spent a \u201ctypical day\u201d in East Berlin before returning with her classmates through the border controls in the heavily guarded underground tunnel at Friedrichstra\u00dfe station. A man in sunglasses caught her attention, she said. \u201cIt was odd, because we were underground.\u201d She told the court how the man had pulled a pistol, and shot at a man who had passed him with a briefcase, and recalled how those around her \u201cheld their hands to their mouths in shock\u201d. \u201cSuddenly doors opened where none had been before then, and people in uniform emerged and sealed the passage,\u201d she said. On the sidelines of the trial, Ga\u0144czak said that while authorities in communist Poland and their counterparts in East Germany (GDR) had attempted to cover up the murder, they disagreed on how to present it. \u201cWhilst the Polish side wanted it to look like Kukuczka had taken his own life, the GDR was not in agreement \u2026 According to a shortened version of events they prepared, there had been an incident at the border crossing, which had resulted in Kukuczka being killed. The family was not allowed to ask further questions.\u201d In one version, Kukuczka was said to have been armed, but there is no evidence to back this up. The explosive he alleged he was carrying was nonexistent. Kukuczka was taken to the Stasi prison hospital in Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen, where he was pronounced dead after having bled to death, according to an autopsy. In a reflection of its historical importance, the trial was recorded, similarly to some Holocaust-related trials of recent years. Kukuckza\u2019s family, including his sister, and his daughter, now 68, do not know to this day what their father had planned. According to anecdotes he had hankered after a life in Florida. An estimated 140 people or more were killed trying to cross the Berlin Wall, which divided the city between 1961 and 1989. The handful of East German officials and border guards who have so far faced prosecution for the deaths have mostly been charged with manslaughter. Higher-ranked officials have often escaped justice. Attempts to try Erich Mielke, head of the Stasi from 1957 to 1989, repeatedly failed until, in 1993, he was sentenced to six years in prison for the 1931 murder of two police officers as a young communist combatant.",

      "body": "<p>Oblivious though she surely was to the idea of a dirty protest, this is nevertheless what Chelsea, my cat of 17 years, performed on the last night of her life. She had never taken to our daughter, who was born nine months previously, put out by her usurper in the way of Big Brother contestants when a shiny newcomer arrives. Clearly, she wanted to make her feelings felt. And she did, in the baby\u2019s bedroom, while we slept, with an emphatic deposit.</p> <p>In the previous weeks, Chelsea had been a&nbsp;shadow of her former self. She had lost a lot of weight, her features had grown pointed, her spine like a xylophone, ribs like harp strings. She could no longer manage the stairs.</p> <p>She had arrived in my life in the autumn of 1989, as I was preparing to leave my childhood home. A family friend had given a kitten to my mother, to fill the void absence left by my departure, but I ended up taking her with me. I&nbsp;named her Chelsea after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/27/no-ifs-no-butts-how-the-film-industry-is-digitally-revising-its-history-splash-daryl-hannah\">Daryl Hannah</a> character in the 1984 mermaid-in-Manhattan film Splash. I wish Google had been around then: when the film turned up on television six months later, we discovered that the character was called Madison, not Chelsea. Too late.</p>    <p>The cat was my one constant throughout early adulthood. We moved together from one bedsit to the next and she grew accustomed to occasionally being bundled into cupboards or on to windowsills whenever landlords dropped by to ensure that rules were being abided by, chief among them: no pets allowed.

      "bodyText": "Oblivious though she surely was to the idea of a dirty protest, this is nevertheless what Chelsea, my cat of 17 years, performed on the last night of her life. She had never taken to our daughter, who was born nine months previously, put out by her usurper in the way of Big Brother contestants when a shiny newcomer arrives. Clearly, she wanted to make her feelings felt. And she did, in the baby\u2019s bedroom, while we slept, with an emphatic deposit. In the previous weeks, Chelsea had been a shadow of her former self. She had lost a lot of weight, her features had grown pointed, her spine like a xylophone, ribs like harp strings. She could no longer manage the stairs. She had arrived in my life in the autumn of 1989, as I was preparing to leave my childhood home. A family friend had given a kitten to my mother, to fill the void absence left by my departure, but I ended up taking her with me. I named her Chelsea after the Daryl Hannah character in the 1984 mermaid-in-Manhattan film Splash. I wish Google had been around then: when the film turned up on television six months later, we discovered that the character was called Madison, not Chelsea. Too late. The cat was my one constant throughout early adulthood. We moved together from one bedsit to the next and she grew accustomed to occasionally being bundled into cupboards or on to windowsills whenever landlords dropped by to ensure that rules were being abided by, chief among them: no pets allowed. We would eat at the same table and she shared my single bed, taking up her regular position on my chest, with a proprietary paw on my chin. One girlfriend found this charming, another considered it \u201ca bit much\u201d. When a particularly lovely woman came back to mine for dinner one night, the cat was receptive to her in ways she hadn\u2019t been to others, so I did the only thing I could possibly do: I married her. (The woman, not the cat.) By the time we finally moved into a house, with stairs, a garden and the luxury of space, Chelsea was deep into midlife and content to sit on one end of the ironing board we never put away, where she could watch us with imperious disdain. She paid no attention to the pregnancy, but retreated by stealth the moment the baby arrived, haunting me like a ghost. When she became ill, the vet gave me the talk vets give everyone at some stage.

      "body": "<p>The world is on fire, but in Washington DC topic A is Olivia Nuzzi. Her suspension as a writer for New York Magazine for <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/reporter-olivia-nuzzi-sent-rfk-jr-demure-nudes-while-sexting\">sharing</a> \u201cdemure\u201d nude photographs of herself and other indiscreet communications with Robert F Kennedy Jr has engendered gales of hilarity to relieve the tension of the razor-thin close campaign.</p> <p>Nuzzi\u2019s relationship in journalistic terms fits the supreme court\u2019s ruling on presidential immunity of the distinction between Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cofficial\u201d acts involving the January 6 insurrection. In the spirit of the court and The Scarlet Letter, the blond bombshell has received more punishment for sexting than the blond bomber has for attempting a coup.</p> <p>In the hurricane of gossip the most notable public discussion of the Nuzzi affair was an exchange of two buddies giggling at their lowbrow humor. \u201cThere\u2019s this weird sex scandal story going on right now,\u201d says the first. \u201cThe media is obsessed with \u2013 I don\u2019t think there was any actual sex in the sex scandal.\u201d Hahaha. His pal snickers, \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m sure it is.\u201d They guffaw. \u201cI think that\u2019s right,\u201d replies the first. They laugh together in a communion of their misplaced coolness, unclever witticisms and pubescent misogyny.</p> <p>This is not dialogue from an episode of Beavis and Butt-Head. It is not a cartoon. It is not a satire. The first jokester is the Republican candidate for vice-president, Senator JD Vance of Ohio. His interlocutor is Tucker Carlson, the erstwhile No 1 Fox News host, fired as a liability, financial and personal, and left to roam untethered in the social media wasteland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/jd-vance-anti-democracy-movement-leader\">JD Vance is the handpicked leader of the antidemocracy movement in America | Robert Reich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vance <a href=\"https://www.happyscribe.com/public/the-tucker-carlson-show/jd-vance-the-new-opposition-party-saving-rural-america-why-trump-seeks-advice-from-his-gardener\">appeared</a> on stage with Carlson on his tour on 22 September, undeterred after Carlson had recently featured a Hitler apologist and Holocaust revisionist on his podcast. Vance preferred to talk about Nuzzi rather than the Nazis. After raising the kerfuffle unprompted, he swiveled without a skip to lay out a cascading conspiracy theory pinging from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris to the entire press corps with an inference to Nuzzi. Biden is \u201csleepwalking into world war three\u201d, he declared, then jumping to \u201cthe reason why we have Joe Biden is because Kamala Harris lied about his mental fitness in office. If you actually care about the truth, ask those questions and leave this salacious bullshit to the tabloids. But they can\u2019t do that. And if they did, Tucker, again, if they did, a lot of them would lose their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>So, in translation, the Nuzzi affair is really the media\u2019s way to avoid confirming Vance\u2019s conspiracy theory. The third world war weighs on Vance\u2019s mind. It is a meme, like the \u201ccat meme\u201d about the Haitians, as he called it. In the mode of Butt-Head impersonating a serious person, Vance told Tucker: \u201cWe\u2019re worried about getting involved in world war three because we should be, because we have nuclear weapons now, and you have to be cautious about that stuff.\u201d Tucker was gravely silent.</p> <p>Without missing a beat, Vance offered a new wrinkle in the great replacement theory. \u201cIf you look at the Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney view, their basic argument is, let\u2019s flood the United States with millions upon millions of foreign laborers because that\u2019s good for business.\u201d Now it was the conservative endorsers of Harris who were to blame for the bogeyman of immigration. Vance was unconcerned that Liz Cheney had been ousted as chair of the House Republican conference for investigating January 6 and defeated in a primary for her seat, and that Dick Cheney had ceased serving as vice-president more than 15 years ago. It was their fault.</p> <p>\u201cThe third thing,\u201d said Vance, \u201cthat I think really divides the parties, and it\u2019s like me, Bobby Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump, we\u2019re all on the same page on this is, do you think that the United States should ship its entire industrial base to foreign countries, some of which hate us?\u201d</p> <p>First of all, \u201cthe third thing\u201d wasn\u2019t the third thing, but more about the second thing. Second, by embracing Bobby Kennedy, Vance didn\u2019t seem aware he was back to another thing \u2013 \u201cthis weird sex scandal story\u201d. Then, he returned to the subject of Springfield, Ohio, which is his warped example to prove the replacement theory, his first, second and third thing. \u201cAmen,\u201d said Tucker.</p> <p>Vance is Trump\u2019s running mate in large part because of the influence of Carlson. For the past couple of years, he has been escorting Vance to introduce him to people hostile to Nato. At least one of them was nonplussed when, rather than sticking to the menace of Nato expansion, he expatiated on his many pathological stepfathers. Carlson notoriously appeared in Budapest under the auspices of the pro-Putin Hungarian authoritarian Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Vance has been uniformly opposed to support for Ukraine. On the eve of Russia\u2019s invasion, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d</p> <p>In the battle over who Trump would chose as his running mate, Carlson was pitted against Rupert Murdoch, who had fired him from his perch at Fox. Murdoch favored the wealthy businessman and North Dakota governor, Doug Burgum. \u201cWhen your enemies are pushing a running mate on you,\u201d Carlson told Trump about Murdoch, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-vp-decision.html\">the New York Times</a>, \u201cit\u2019s a pretty good sign you should ignore them.\u201d</p> <p>Trump had to overcome his aversion to Vance for his remarks that he was an \u201cidiot\u201d, \u201cunfit for our nation\u2019s highest office\u201d and a looming \u201cAmerican Hitler\u201d. On 4 January 2021, two days before the assault on the US Capitol, Carlson wrote in a private text about Trump, \u201cI hate him passionately,\u201d but subsequently ingratiated himself back into his good graces. Now he played on Trump\u2019s deepest fear. If Trump picked a \u201cneocon\u201d, a pro-Nato Republican like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the Times reported, \u201cthen the US intelligence agencies would have every incentive to assassinate Mr Trump in order to get their preferred president\u201d. Carlson was buttressed in waging his paranoid campaign to eliminate competitors to Vance by Donald Trump Jr, whom Carlson had recruited into the Vance inner circle.</p> <p>Trump put Carlson on the platform at the Republican convention in order to have Tucker hail him as the \u201ckindest\u201d, \u201cbravest\u201d man of \u201cempathy\u201d who \u201cactually cares\u201d, and most \u201cwonderful person\u201d. Carlson delivered his tribute seemingly unaware, or perhaps completely aware, that his speech was almost word for word a copy from the film The Manchurian Candidate of the brainwashed description of Raymond Shaw, the phoney Medal of Honor winner himself conditioned into becoming an assassin in a communist conspiracy to kill the party\u2019s nominee for president and turn the country over to the Russians under a rightwing puppet. Maj Ben Marco, played by Frank Sinatra, who served with Shaw in Korea, breaks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZWgnt50g4k\">the code</a> of the brainwashed idealization: \u201cRaymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I\u2019ve ever known in my life.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Vance is a construct. The man known as \u2018JD Vance\u2019 has existed for three years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Carlson and Vance have curiously parallel lives. One born to wealth, the other in poverty, both were partly abandoned children. Vance and Tucker are Lost Boys in their own Neverland who have signed up with Captain Hook.</p> <p>Carlson\u2019s mother, heiress to one of California\u2019s oldest and greatest fortunes, left Tucker at the age of six for life in a hippy commune, never seeing him again. After his father remarried to the heiress of the Swanson frozen food fortune, Tucker was sent off to boarding school.</p> <p>As Vance chronicled in his book, Hillbilly Elegy, his mother was suicidal and addicted to alcohol and heroin. \u201cOf all the things that I hated about my childhood, nothing compared to the revolving door of father figures,\u201d he wrote. He was abandoned to be more or less raised by his grandmother, who from the age of 13 had four children and eight miscarriages, possibly some of them abortions. She once tried to set her drunken abusive husband, Vance\u2019s grandfather, on fire while he slept.</p> <p>Vance is a construct. The man known as \u201cJD Vance\u201d has existed for three years. His various name changes tell only a superficial part of his story. James Donald Bowman carried his father\u2019s middle and last name. When his parents divorced he dropped the middle name \u201cDonald\u201d for \u201cDavid\u201d. He took his stepfather\u2019s last name when he became James David Hamel. In high school he called himself \u201cJD\u201d. He graduated from Ohio State University and served in the military as James D Hamel. He was accepted to Yale Law School under that name. While at Yale, in 2010-2011, he blogged for David Frum\u2019s FrumForum as JD Hamel.</p> <p>He implied in his 2016 memoir that he took the name of JD Vance upon his wedding in 2014, but in fact he assumed the name \u201cVance\u201d, after his grandmother\u2019s name, just before his graduation from Yale Law in 2013. Then, when he announced his candidacy for the Senate from Ohio in 2021, he removed the periods from his initials to become simply \u201cJD\u201d. which is how he is <a href=\"https://www.vance.senate.gov/about/\">listed</a> in his US Senate biography.</p> <p>Vance has had more mentors than name changes. One of them explained to me that his technique is to mirror them, one after another, to win approval and get ahead. His greatest skill is advancement through mimicry. A ruthless instinct for survival drives his hollow striving. He demonstrated his method in justifying Trump\u2019s fabrication about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating cats and dogs. \u201cI say that we\u2019re creating a story, meaning we\u2019re creating the American media focusing on it,\u201d he told Dana Bash on CNN. His own self-creation involves a lot of creativity.</p> <p>From mentor to mentor, too numerous to mention without writing a small treatise, Vance has shape-shifted. Under the tutelage of the Yale Law professor Amy Chua, author of the terrifyingly strict parenting memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, he framed his story. She threw out his first draft of a memoir, then directed and edited the writing and its promotion. Chua had been the making of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s career, helping to place him in a clerkship on the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, and she became a pipeline of clerks to him when he ascended to the US supreme court, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/20/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-yale-amy-chua\">advising</a> her proteges that he preferred women who \u201clooked like models\u201d. She advanced Usha Vance, whose match to JD she encouraged, to become a Kavanaugh clerk, while telling Vance not to apply for the post but to stick to composing the book.</p> <p>Vance met Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire, at a Yale event. Thiel inducted him into his network, hiring him after graduation for his venture capital firm. In the 2016 campaign cycle, Thiel became the single largest donor to the Republican party. He was drawn to Trump\u2019s darkness. Thiel is an anti-democratic, illiberal dystopian for whom Trump is a mere agent. When Vance ran for the Senate from Ohio in 2022, Thiel <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/17/peter-thiel-boosted-jd-vance-career/74397520007/\">bankrolled</a> him with $15m, a pittance for the potential investment.</p> <p>Thiel and his venture capital network are heavily sunk into cryptocurrency. On the day before Trump anointed Vance as his VP, he endorsed a federal strategic bitcoin reserve that would put the US government behind the essentially worthless commodity. That would trigger an explosion of cryptocurrency products. Vance as vice-president would be a guarantor of an unregulated market that would almost certainly lead to financial chaos, the fleecing of small investors and new avenues for international crime.</p> <p>In 2019, Vance converted to Catholicism, embracing a particular strand of anti-liberal traditionalism. As a boy he had been a Pentecostal. At Yale, he was an avowed atheist. Through Thiel, he met a number of profoundly reactionary Catholic ideologues, including Patrick Deneen, author in 2023 of Regime Change, a manifesto for the \u201cParty of Order\u201d to defeat the \u201cParty of Progress\u201d to install \u201cthe post-liberal order\u201d. At a panel about the book at the Heritage Foundation, Vance appeared with Deneen and Kevin Roberts, the rightwing thinktank\u2019s president and an adherent of Opus Dei, a reactionary Catholic sect developed in Franco\u2019s Spain that is at war with Pope Francis\u2019s liberal openings. Vance <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/06/08/the-new-right-patrick-deneen-00100279\">proclaimed</a> himself there a cadre of the \u201cpostliberal right\u201d and \u201cexplicitly anti-regime\u201d, a further confession of faith.</p> <p>At the time, Roberts was overseeing the publication of Project 2025, a far-right wish book of draconian policies for a second Trump term. Roberts wrote an accompanying book, Dawn\u2019s Early Light: Burning Down Washington to Save America, for which Vance wrote the introduction. \u201cWe are now all realizing that it\u2019s time to circle the wagons and load the muskets,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/06/08/the-new-right-patrick-deneen-00100279\">wrote</a>. But when Trump tried to distance himself from the controversial Project 2025, the book\u2019s publication was stopped, retitled \u2013 \u201cBurning Down\u201d scrapped for \u201cTaking Back\u201d \u2013 and pushed back until after the election.</p> <p>Vance had also become close to another radical rightwing theocrat, Rod Dreher, a columnist for The American Conservative, a magazine founded by Patrick Buchanan, avatar of the America First movement. Dreher was present at Vance\u2019s Catholic conversion ceremony. Yet Dreher had already left the Catholic church for Eastern Orthodoxy because, among other things, he felt Catholicism was controlled by a \u201c<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040205010019/http:/www.nationalreview.com/flashback/flashback-dreher042202.asp\">Lavender Mafia</a>\u201d of gay priests. In 2022, he went into voluntary exile in Hungary, where he became the director of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Danube Foundation \u201cnetwork project\u201d, for which he facilitated the trip of Carlson while he maintained his close relationship with Vance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In his debate with Tim Walz, Vance was the trained attorney smoothly spreading an oil slick of falsehoods to defend his guilty client</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Vance wants to impress the theoreticians of the quasi- and neo-fascist right, he mirrors by echoing their special language, showing he is one of them. But when he wants to prove himself to Trump, he no longer poses as the intellectual manqu\u00e9 but instead a standup insult comic.</p> <p>His awkward jocularity and lame jokes, if they are jokes, almost always bomb. Notoriously, there\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/29/nx-s1-5055616/jd-vance-childless-cat-lady-history\">sophomoric snark</a> of \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. There are his put-downs, such as: \u201cI\u2019ve actually got thoughts in my head \u2013 unlike Kamala Harris.\u201d There was Vance\u2019s misfired tweet intended to mock Harris by posting a 2007 video clip of Miss South Carolina Teen Caitlin Upton freezing in her answer to a question about finding the United States on a map \u2013 only to have it revealed that Donald Trump subsequently offered her a job and that she had been a Trump supporter. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/31/jd-vance-miss-teen-usa\">condemned</a> Vance for \u201conline bullying\u201d.</p> <p>Vance wore a different persona than the apprentice name-caller in his debate with Tim Walz. Now he was the trained attorney smoothly spreading an oil slick of falsehoods to defend his guilty client. Vance lied that he never supported a national abortion ban; that Trump saved the Affordable Care Act \u2013 Obamacare \u2013 instead of trying to destroy it at every turn; and that \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d in Springfield, Ohio, had \u201coverwhelmed\u201d the community. When Margaret Brennan of CBS News corrected him that the Haitians there are legal immigrants, Vance revealed a glint of anger. \u201cMargaret, the rules were that you guys weren\u2019t going to factcheck,\u201d he complained. Facts are not his friend. Then, Vance closed with his most breathtaking lie, that Trump \u201cpeacefully gave over power on January 20\u201d, eliding January 6. With that, Vance could breathe easy that he had jumped the hurdle of the big lie.</p> <p>JD obviously feels most comfortable bantering with Tucker. Together on stage, on 22 September, they jammed to stroke Trump\u2019s narcissism as a true man of the people. Tucker kicked it off. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said, \u201cto imagine Carmela, or whatever she\u2019s calling herself, Harris, talk to the lady behind the counter about the differences in quality and weight and price between the quarter pounder and the Big Mac. He has such strong feelings about it. He\u2019s really thought about it a lot.\u201d</p> <p>JD chimed in. \u201cWell, and again, this goes to his leadership style,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump actually really cares of what people think. So, he has absolutely thought to himself, what is the better value between the quarter pounder and the Big Mac? He actually wants to know what the people who work there think about this question. And by the way, I have views about this. Obviously, the quarter pounder is a better deal.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/10/trump-hurricane-lies-conspiracy-theories\">Trump and his allies are whipping up a whirlwind of lies about the hurricanes | Sidney Blumenthal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d replied Tucker. \u201cWithout secret sauce, it\u2019s not even worth going there. But whatever. Honest people disagree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve allowed yourself to be manipulated by the elites,\u201d JD ribbed him. \u201cThe secret sauce is not the thing that matters. It\u2019s the amount of meat. You get way more meat with a quarter pounder.\u201d</p> <p>Vance clinched his point with an anecdote about being interviewed by Trump at Mar-a-Lago to be his running mate.

      "bodyText": "The world is on fire, but in Washington DC topic A is Olivia Nuzzi. Her suspension as a writer for New York Magazine for sharing \u201cdemure\u201d nude photographs of herself and other indiscreet communications with Robert F Kennedy Jr has engendered gales of hilarity to relieve the tension of the razor-thin close campaign. Nuzzi\u2019s relationship in journalistic terms fits the supreme court\u2019s ruling on presidential immunity of the distinction between Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cofficial\u201d acts involving the January 6 insurrection. In the spirit of the court and The Scarlet Letter, the blond bombshell has received more punishment for sexting than the blond bomber has for attempting a coup. In the hurricane of gossip the most notable public discussion of the Nuzzi affair was an exchange of two buddies giggling at their lowbrow humor. \u201cThere\u2019s this weird sex scandal story going on right now,\u201d says the first. \u201cThe media is obsessed with \u2013 I don\u2019t think there was any actual sex in the sex scandal.\u201d Hahaha. His pal snickers, \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m sure it is.\u201d They guffaw. \u201cI think that\u2019s right,\u201d replies the first. They laugh together in a communion of their misplaced coolness, unclever witticisms and pubescent misogyny. This is not dialogue from an episode of Beavis and Butt-Head. It is not a cartoon. It is not a satire. The first jokester is the Republican candidate for vice-president, Senator JD Vance of Ohio. His interlocutor is Tucker Carlson, the erstwhile No 1 Fox News host, fired as a liability, financial and personal, and left to roam untethered in the social media wasteland. Vance appeared on stage with Carlson on his tour on 22 September, undeterred after Carlson had recently featured a Hitler apologist and Holocaust revisionist on his podcast. Vance preferred to talk about Nuzzi rather than the Nazis. After raising the kerfuffle unprompted, he swiveled without a skip to lay out a cascading conspiracy theory pinging from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris to the entire press corps with an inference to Nuzzi. Biden is \u201csleepwalking into world war three\u201d, he declared, then jumping to \u201cthe reason why we have Joe Biden is because Kamala Harris lied about his mental fitness in office. If you actually care about the truth, ask those questions and leave this salacious bullshit to the tabloids. But they can\u2019t do that. And if they did, Tucker, again, if they did, a lot of them would lose their jobs.\u201d So, in translation, the Nuzzi affair is really the media\u2019s way to avoid confirming Vance\u2019s conspiracy theory. The third world war weighs on Vance\u2019s mind. It is a meme, like the \u201ccat meme\u201d about the Haitians, as he called it. In the mode of Butt-Head impersonating a serious person, Vance told Tucker: \u201cWe\u2019re worried about getting involved in world war three because we should be, because we have nuclear weapons now, and you have to be cautious about that stuff.\u201d Tucker was gravely silent. Without missing a beat, Vance offered a new wrinkle in the great replacement theory. \u201cIf you look at the Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney view, their basic argument is, let\u2019s flood the United States with millions upon millions of foreign laborers because that\u2019s good for business.\u201d Now it was the conservative endorsers of Harris who were to blame for the bogeyman of immigration. Vance was unconcerned that Liz Cheney had been ousted as chair of the House Republican conference for investigating January 6 and defeated in a primary for her seat, and that Dick Cheney had ceased serving as vice-president more than 15 years ago. It was their fault. \u201cThe third thing,\u201d said Vance, \u201cthat I think really divides the parties, and it\u2019s like me, Bobby Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump, we\u2019re all on the same page on this is, do you think that the United States should ship its entire industrial base to foreign countries, some of which hate us?\u201d First of all, \u201cthe third thing\u201d wasn\u2019t the third thing, but more about the second thing. Second, by embracing Bobby Kennedy, Vance didn\u2019t seem aware he was back to another thing \u2013 \u201cthis weird sex scandal story\u201d. Then, he returned to the subject of Springfield, Ohio, which is his warped example to prove the replacement theory, his first, second and third thing. \u201cAmen,\u201d said Tucker. Vance is Trump\u2019s running mate in large part because of the influence of Carlson. For the past couple of years, he has been escorting Vance to introduce him to people hostile to Nato. At least one of them was nonplussed when, rather than sticking to the menace of Nato expansion, he expatiated on his many pathological stepfathers. Carlson notoriously appeared in Budapest under the auspices of the pro-Putin Hungarian authoritarian Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Vance has been uniformly opposed to support for Ukraine. On the eve of Russia\u2019s invasion, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d In the battle over who Trump would chose as his running mate, Carlson was pitted against Rupert Murdoch, who had fired him from his perch at Fox. Murdoch favored the wealthy businessman and North Dakota governor, Doug Burgum. \u201cWhen your enemies are pushing a running mate on you,\u201d Carlson told Trump about Murdoch, according to the New York Times, \u201cit\u2019s a pretty good sign you should ignore them.\u201d Trump had to overcome his aversion to Vance for his remarks that he was an \u201cidiot\u201d, \u201cunfit for our nation\u2019s highest office\u201d and a looming \u201cAmerican Hitler\u201d. On 4 January 2021, two days before the assault on the US Capitol, Carlson wrote in a private text about Trump, \u201cI hate him passionately,\u201d but subsequently ingratiated himself back into his good graces. Now he played on Trump\u2019s deepest fear. If Trump picked a \u201cneocon\u201d, a pro-Nato Republican like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the Times reported, \u201cthen the US intelligence agencies would have every incentive to assassinate Mr Trump in order to get their preferred president\u201d. Carlson was buttressed in waging his paranoid campaign to eliminate competitors to Vance by Donald Trump Jr, whom Carlson had recruited into the Vance inner circle. Trump put Carlson on the platform at the Republican convention in order to have Tucker hail him as the \u201ckindest\u201d, \u201cbravest\u201d man of \u201cempathy\u201d who \u201cactually cares\u201d, and most \u201cwonderful person\u201d. Carlson delivered his tribute seemingly unaware, or perhaps completely aware, that his speech was almost word for word a copy from the film The Manchurian Candidate of the brainwashed description of Raymond Shaw, the phoney Medal of Honor winner himself conditioned into becoming an assassin in a communist conspiracy to kill the party\u2019s nominee for president and turn the country over to the Russians under a rightwing puppet. Maj Ben Marco, played by Frank Sinatra, who served with Shaw in Korea, breaks the code of the brainwashed idealization: \u201cRaymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I\u2019ve ever known in my life.\u201d Carlson and Vance have curiously parallel lives. One born to wealth, the other in poverty, both were partly abandoned children. Vance and Tucker are Lost Boys in their own Neverland who have signed up with Captain Hook. Carlson\u2019s mother, heiress to one of California\u2019s oldest and greatest fortunes, left Tucker at the age of six for life in a hippy commune, never seeing him again. After his father remarried to the heiress of the Swanson frozen food fortune, Tucker was sent off to boarding school. As Vance chronicled in his book, Hillbilly Elegy, his mother was suicidal and addicted to alcohol and heroin. \u201cOf all the things that I hated about my childhood, nothing compared to the revolving door of father figures,\u201d he wrote. He was abandoned to be more or less raised by his grandmother, who from the age of 13 had four children and eight miscarriages, possibly some of them abortions. She once tried to set her drunken abusive husband, Vance\u2019s grandfather, on fire while he slept. Vance is a construct. The man known as \u201cJD Vance\u201d has existed for three years. His various name changes tell only a superficial part of his story. James Donald Bowman carried his father\u2019s middle and last name. When his parents divorced he dropped the middle name \u201cDonald\u201d for \u201cDavid\u201d. He took his stepfather\u2019s last name when he became James David Hamel. In high school he called himself \u201cJD\u201d. He graduated from Ohio State University and served in the military as James D Hamel. He was accepted to Yale Law School under that name. While at Yale, in 2010-2011, he blogged for David Frum\u2019s FrumForum as JD Hamel. He implied in his 2016 memoir that he took the name of JD Vance upon his wedding in 2014, but in fact he assumed the name \u201cVance\u201d, after his grandmother\u2019s name, just before his graduation from Yale Law in 2013. Then, when he announced his candidacy for the Senate from Ohio in 2021, he removed the periods from his initials to become simply \u201cJD\u201d. which is how he is listed in his US Senate biography. Vance has had more mentors than name changes. One of them explained to me that his technique is to mirror them, one after another, to win approval and get ahead. His greatest skill is advancement through mimicry. A ruthless instinct for survival drives his hollow striving. He demonstrated his method in justifying Trump\u2019s fabrication about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating cats and dogs. \u201cI say that we\u2019re creating a story, meaning we\u2019re creating the American media focusing on it,\u201d he told Dana Bash on CNN. His own self-creation involves a lot of creativity. From mentor to mentor, too numerous to mention without writing a small treatise, Vance has shape-shifted. Under the tutelage of the Yale Law professor Amy Chua, author of the terrifyingly strict parenting memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, he framed his story. She threw out his first draft of a memoir, then directed and edited the writing and its promotion. Chua had been the making of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s career, helping to place him in a clerkship on the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, and she became a pipeline of clerks to him when he ascended to the US supreme court, advising her proteges that he preferred women who \u201clooked like models\u201d. She advanced Usha Vance, whose match to JD she encouraged, to become a Kavanaugh clerk, while telling Vance not to apply for the post but to stick to composing the book. Vance met Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire, at a Yale event. Thiel inducted him into his network, hiring him after graduation for his venture capital firm. In the 2016 campaign cycle, Thiel became the single largest donor to the Republican party. He was drawn to Trump\u2019s darkness. Thiel is an anti-democratic, illiberal dystopian for whom Trump is a mere agent. When Vance ran for the Senate from Ohio in 2022, Thiel bankrolled him with $15m, a pittance for the potential investment. Thiel and his venture capital network are heavily sunk into cryptocurrency. On the day before Trump anointed Vance as his VP, he endorsed a federal strategic bitcoin reserve that would put the US government behind the essentially worthless commodity. That would trigger an explosion of cryptocurrency products. Vance as vice-president would be a guarantor of an unregulated market that would almost certainly lead to financial chaos, the fleecing of small investors and new avenues for international crime. In 2019, Vance converted to Catholicism, embracing a particular strand of anti-liberal traditionalism. As a boy he had been a Pentecostal. At Yale, he was an avowed atheist. Through Thiel, he met a number of profoundly reactionary Catholic ideologues, including Patrick Deneen, author in 2023 of Regime Change, a manifesto for the \u201cParty of Order\u201d to defeat the \u201cParty of Progress\u201d to install \u201cthe post-liberal order\u201d. At a panel about the book at the Heritage Foundation, Vance appeared with Deneen and Kevin Roberts, the rightwing thinktank\u2019s president and an adherent of Opus Dei, a reactionary Catholic sect developed in Franco\u2019s Spain that is at war with Pope Francis\u2019s liberal openings. Vance proclaimed himself there a cadre of the \u201cpostliberal right\u201d and \u201cexplicitly anti-regime\u201d, a further confession of faith. At the time, Roberts was overseeing the publication of Project 2025, a far-right wish book of draconian policies for a second Trump term. Roberts wrote an accompanying book, Dawn\u2019s Early Light: Burning Down Washington to Save America, for which Vance wrote the introduction. \u201cWe are now all realizing that it\u2019s time to circle the wagons and load the muskets,\u201d he wrote. But when Trump tried to distance himself from the controversial Project 2025, the book\u2019s publication was stopped, retitled \u2013 \u201cBurning Down\u201d scrapped for \u201cTaking Back\u201d \u2013 and pushed back until after the election. Vance had also become close to another radical rightwing theocrat, Rod Dreher, a columnist for The American Conservative, a magazine founded by Patrick Buchanan, avatar of the America First movement. Dreher was present at Vance\u2019s Catholic conversion ceremony. Yet Dreher had already left the Catholic church for Eastern Orthodoxy because, among other things, he felt Catholicism was controlled by a \u201cLavender Mafia\u201d of gay priests. In 2022, he went into voluntary exile in Hungary, where he became the director of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Danube Foundation \u201cnetwork project\u201d, for which he facilitated the trip of Carlson while he maintained his close relationship with Vance. When Vance wants to impress the theoreticians of the quasi- and neo-fascist right, he mirrors by echoing their special language, showing he is one of them. But when he wants to prove himself to Trump, he no longer poses as the intellectual manqu\u00e9 but instead a standup insult comic. His awkward jocularity and lame jokes, if they are jokes, almost always bomb. Notoriously, there\u2019s the sophomoric snark of \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. There are his put-downs, such as: \u201cI\u2019ve actually got thoughts in my head \u2013 unlike Kamala Harris.\u201d There was Vance\u2019s misfired tweet intended to mock Harris by posting a 2007 video clip of Miss South Carolina Teen Caitlin Upton freezing in her answer to a question about finding the United States on a map \u2013 only to have it revealed that Donald Trump subsequently offered her a job and that she had been a Trump supporter. She condemned Vance for \u201conline bullying\u201d. Vance wore a different persona than the apprentice name-caller in his debate with Tim Walz. Now he was the trained attorney smoothly spreading an oil slick of falsehoods to defend his guilty client. Vance lied that he never supported a national abortion ban; that Trump saved the Affordable Care Act \u2013 Obamacare \u2013 instead of trying to destroy it at every turn; and that \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d in Springfield, Ohio, had \u201coverwhelmed\u201d the community. When Margaret Brennan of CBS News corrected him that the Haitians there are legal immigrants, Vance revealed a glint of anger. \u201cMargaret, the rules were that you guys weren\u2019t going to factcheck,\u201d he complained. Facts are not his friend. Then, Vance closed with his most breathtaking lie, that Trump \u201cpeacefully gave over power on January 20\u201d, eliding January 6. With that, Vance could breathe easy that he had jumped the hurdle of the big lie. JD obviously feels most comfortable bantering with Tucker. Together on stage, on 22 September, they jammed to stroke Trump\u2019s narcissism as a true man of the people. Tucker kicked it off. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said, \u201cto imagine Carmela, or whatever she\u2019s calling herself, Harris, talk to the lady behind the counter about the differences in quality and weight and price between the quarter pounder and the Big Mac. He has such strong feelings about it. He\u2019s really thought about it a lot.\u201d JD chimed in. \u201cWell, and again, this goes to his leadership style,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump actually really cares of what people think. So, he has absolutely thought to himself, what is the better value between the quarter pounder and the Big Mac? He actually wants to know what the people who work there think about this question. And by the way, I have views about this. Obviously, the quarter pounder is a better deal.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d replied Tucker. \u201cWithout secret sauce, it\u2019s not even worth going there. But whatever. Honest people disagree.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve allowed yourself to be manipulated by the elites,\u201d JD ribbed him. \u201cThe secret sauce is not the thing that matters. It\u2019s the amount of meat. You get way more meat with a quarter pounder.\u201d Vance clinched his point with an anecdote about being interviewed by Trump at Mar-a-Lago to be his running mate. Trump told him he had asked the gardener whom he should pick. \u201cI\u2019m sitting there, sweating bullets like, \u2018Well, sir, what did the gardener at Mar-a-Lago have to say about who should be the VP?\u2019\u201d Trump did not tell him. But, according to Vance, it proved \u201che actually likes to know what people think about things. That\u2019s one of his secrets of success as a political leader.\u201d Vance did not interpret the incident as Trump toying with him in a humiliating little game in which he dangled the gardener as a determining factor in his fate. Then Tucker and JD riffed about what JD called \u201cthe Kamala switcheroo\u201d in full Beavis and Butt-Head style. \u201cThe switch-up, the disappearance of the president of the United States. Biden is still president, technically, correct?\u201d says Tucker. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d answers JD. \u201cI don\u2019t either. I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. He was pretty famous at one point, and then he\u2019s just gone.\u201d \u201cI saw some clip on social media that Jill Biden was running a cabinet meeting,\u201d says JD. \u201cWas that real or was that \u2013 for sure.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a doctor, JD. Settle down. She\u2019s got this. Anyone who hasn\u2019t read her dissertation on community colleges in the state of Delaware really should see where the doctorate comes from. She literally is a part of it where she\u2019s breaking down the proportion of bi-ethnicity of students \u2026 I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not good at math.\u201d \u201cWait a second.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d says Tucker, \u201cyou should read Dr Jill\u2019s dissertation. It\u2019s unbelievable. Anyway, she\u2019s running the government, just so you know.\u201d Hahaha. In an earlier conversation for Tucker\u2019s podcast, on 18 September, Tucker and JD blithely talked about the agenda of a coming Trump administration. \u201cIf you guys win,\u201d says Tucker, \u201cand you start firing people who are acting against orders of their commander-in-chief and against the expressed will of voters, the New York Times will call it a fascist takeover.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right,\u201d replied JD. \u201cThe question is, do you care?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d JD answered, \u201cI think we have to not care.\u201d He wasn\u2019t joking.

My first thought when I read this list of ingredients was: \u201cWhat a fantastic soup!\u201d And my second was: \u201cWhat is bitter vetch?\u201d The answer is it\u2019s an ancient legume in the expansive <em>Vicia</em> genus that\u2019s related to broad beans, although physically closer to the lentil and, taste-wise, nearer to a pea, only bitter. So, if you do make the founder crop soup, remember to parboil the bitter vetch several times, changing the water in between, before adding it to the soup.

This is what ancient civilisations (the oldest known remains of barley are at Tell Mureybet in Syria) would have used to make breador porridge-like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puls_(food)\">puls</a>, I suppose, and malted for beer. The second is a variety called hulless barley, which is cultivated with a hull so loose that it falls o\ufb00 during harvesting, which cuts down on processing and ensures that all of the bran and germ are retained.

Although pearl barley is technically a re\ufb01ned grain, it retains significant goodness, because some of the bran may still be present and the \ufb01bre in barley is distributed throughout the kernel. All four types - whole, hulless, pot and pearl - are suitable for this soup, but the advantage of using pearl barley is that it doesn\u2019t need soaking and has a shorter cooking time, generally around 25 minutes.

The rising costs of maintaining and running the Grade II-listed building, as well as a drop in grant funding, have left it with a shortfall of about \u00a3250,000. Opened 120 years ago in Ordsall, it continues to provide a lifeline to young people from some of Greater Manchester\u2019s most deprived communities, offering sports and other activities six days a week. Initially founded as a club for boys, but now open to all young people, it was officially opened in January 1904 by Robert Baden-Powell, who later founded the Scout movement. The tiled interior still features many of its original fittings, and was described by English Heritage as \u201cthought to be the most complete example of this rare form of social provision to survive in England\u201d. Recognising its place in the tapestry of Greater Manchester\u2019s musical history, Salford Lads Club also has a Smiths room, which is regularly open to visitors. However, the club has suffered a drop in grant income in an increasingly competitive field. Last year the club\u2019s annual income was \u00a3160,000, while its outgoings came to \u00a3394,700. The club wants to hire new staff, to professionalise the running of the club, making it better able to compete for grant funding. It also faces annual bills of \u00a315,000 for utilities and \u00a313,000 for insurance, as well as building maintenance costs of \u00a315,000. A fundraiser has ben launched by the Manchester Evening News to help raise the \u00a3250,000 that the club needs to secure by the end of November to keep its doors open. The club also intends to set up a Salford Lads and Girls Club Legacy Fund, which will be invested into a permanent trust, to help to secure its future survival. \u201cThe more we have in the fund the greater the annual returns, helping the club to become and remain self-sustainable,\u201d Laura Slingsby, head of youth operations at the centre, told the MEN. \u201cThe club needs the urgent cash injection now to help close the current funding gap, as even if \u00a31m is secured for the legacy fund now, the returns wouldn\u2019t be generated until next year.\u201d",

The companies said an already attractive investment environment in the UK had been boosted by greater political stability: \u201cWe are optimistic about the future of the economy, and believe it is time to invest in Britain.\u201d In his keynote speech, Starmer is to promise to slash red tape and \u201crip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look at regulation where it is needlessly holding back the investment, to take our country forward,\u201d he is to say. \u201cWhere it is stopping us building the homes, the datacentres, warehouses, grid connectors, roads, train lines, you name it, then mark my words \u2013 we will get rid of it. We will rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment and we will make sure that every regulator in this country takes growth as seriously as this room does.\u201d Asked whether that was the same as regulating less, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s different. You don\u2019t have to cut corners to get innovation through the regulatory landscape.\u201d",

We were wholeheartedly wrong, it appeared, for since he had hardly heard much in one ear for all of his young life he\u2019d been innocently distanced by such loss, sending antisocial signals he wasn\u2019t guilty of. I sat behind him in the vaulty booth, sworn to quiet, kindly ordered to keep really still: just there for him in silent support, pretending to be parentally composed. I couldn\u2019t hear the doctor\u2019s words when he began the test from behind the cloudy one-way mirror that hid his face, the inter-booth exchange between their headphoned selves, for my boy to listen to and show that he had caught the words the doctor threw. He sat there motionless, concentrated, as grown up as he always was when faced with the new that those much older would struggle with. I couldn\u2019t hear the words, only he could seek their sound, but knew when they were found by how he\u2019d physically respond, raising his hand casually like a cattle bidder when a word came through, or thumbing a button when a word barge docked, not sank, along his ear canal. Sometimes he spoke in answer to the mystery words, sending back those he\u2019d been asked to repeat: some wrong no doubt, like errant echoes, some like perfect rhymes, but all were simple words now solemnly renewed, words and phrases rinsed of the ordinariness of daily use in the inner sanctum hush of that listening room: words like house, home, sailboat, mother, laughter, and sunshine, doctor, flavour, good, past, and before. Icecream, I remember, raised and left a ripple of a smile and a sneaky lifting of eyes to meet with mine. I felt involved but helpless, hovering in that room, unable to lend him my ears, though given age I\u2019m unsure whether mine would catch the words\u2019 drift better.

Currently the airline only has a union <a href=\"https://www.alpa.org/about-alpa/our-pilot-groups/pilot-groups/delta\">representing</a> pilots at the company and a union <a href=\"https://www.pafca.org/\">representing</a> dispatchers, unlike other major airlines, where most workers are predominantly union represented.</p> <p>Delta has faced <a href=\"https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-blumenthal-butler-colleagues-call-for-delta-airlines-to-remain-neutral-in-union-organizing-campaigns\">calls from Congress</a> to remain neutral in the face of such campaigns. It has not.</p> <p>The lawsuit alleges Delta Air Lines engaged in an anti-union campaign during Nejat\u2019s initial flight attendant training, between May and June of last year. At his graduation ceremony, the lawsuit alleges that a Delta flight attendant, Matthew Miller, spoke to Nejat and other graduates, telling them \u201cthat if they wanted a good working environment, they should not sign a union card\u201d.</p> <p>Miller was a proponent of Delta Air Lines\u2019 anti-union campaign, One Delta, according to the complaint, which alleges he selects flight attendants to be included in safety and training videos, which come with extra pay and promotion pathways in the company.</p> <p>The anti-union messaging during training was \u201coverwhelming\u201d, according to Nejat. \u201cI think it was really telling that Delta is investing a lot of resources, money, time and effort into preventing a union organization campaign.\u201d</p> <p>While performing a uniform inspection on new flight attendant graduates at the ceremony, the lawsuit accuses Miller of inappropriately touching trainees.</p> <p>\u201cDuring that inspection, Miller engaged in non-consensual, sexually assaultive touching of Nejat with Miller\u2019s hands reaching inside Nejat\u2019s pants close to his genitals and then moving to underneath Nejat\u2019s vest and against Nejat\u2019s chest,\u201d it says. \u201cThe experience made Nejat feel violated, uncomfortable, and anxious.\u201d</p> <p>Miller did the same thing to at least one other male flight attendant, who relayed the experiences to Nejat, according to the lawsuit, which adds: \u201cOn information and belief, several male flight attendants have experienced similar treatment at the hands of Miller.\u201d</p> <p>Miller did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Delta did not comment, beyond stating that it does not tolerate retaliation or harassment.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very chilling moment,\u201d Nejat of the alleged incident during his training graduation ceremony. \u201cIt made me realize that at that time, and to this day, that there are very strict power dynamics within the culture at Delta. These power dynamics involve unfair work practices. They involve power plays. They involve this kind of unfair power dynamic, and with no union to mediate that sort of power dynamic that exists.\u201d</p> <p>Nejat did not immediately report the incident with Miller due to Miller\u2019s closeness with Delta Air Lines management, according to the lawsuit, but mentioned it on social media and in internal company posts while advocating for a union at the airline.

      "bodyText": "A former flight attendant at Delta Air Lines has filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging he was fired in retaliation for supporting a unionization effort and for speaking out after enduring \u201csexually assaultive touching\u201d during training. Aryasp Nejat was fired by Delta in August. In a complaint filed late last month, his attorneys argued he is \u201cone of the latest casualties\u201d of an anti-union campaign waged by the airline. \u201cDelta themselves, through their own policies, encourage an open door policy. They encourage employees to bring up concerns,\u201d Nejat, 24, told the Guardian. \u201cThey explicitly say that they don\u2019t tolerate Discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and they want us to engage in constructive dialogue. \u201cBut then, when I made my comments in protest of their anti-union campaign, in protest of the harassment that I and another flight attendant suffered, the company retaliated against me.\u201d A spokesperson for Delta Air Lines said: \u201cDelta does not tolerate retaliation or harassment of any kind.\u201d Multiple labor unions including the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and the Teamsters, announced a bid two years ago to unionize non-union employees at Delta Airlines. Currently the airline only has a union representing pilots at the company and a union representing dispatchers, unlike other major airlines, where most workers are predominantly union represented. Delta has faced calls from Congress to remain neutral in the face of such campaigns. It has not. The lawsuit alleges Delta Air Lines engaged in an anti-union campaign during Nejat\u2019s initial flight attendant training, between May and June of last year. At his graduation ceremony, the lawsuit alleges that a Delta flight attendant, Matthew Miller, spoke to Nejat and other graduates, telling them \u201cthat if they wanted a good working environment, they should not sign a union card\u201d. Miller was a proponent of Delta Air Lines\u2019 anti-union campaign, One Delta, according to the complaint, which alleges he selects flight attendants to be included in safety and training videos, which come with extra pay and promotion pathways in the company. The anti-union messaging during training was \u201coverwhelming\u201d, according to Nejat. \u201cI think it was really telling that Delta is investing a lot of resources, money, time and effort into preventing a union organization campaign.\u201d While performing a uniform inspection on new flight attendant graduates at the ceremony, the lawsuit accuses Miller of inappropriately touching trainees. \u201cDuring that inspection, Miller engaged in non-consensual, sexually assaultive touching of Nejat with Miller\u2019s hands reaching inside Nejat\u2019s pants close to his genitals and then moving to underneath Nejat\u2019s vest and against Nejat\u2019s chest,\u201d it says. \u201cThe experience made Nejat feel violated, uncomfortable, and anxious.\u201d Miller did the same thing to at least one other male flight attendant, who relayed the experiences to Nejat, according to the lawsuit, which adds: \u201cOn information and belief, several male flight attendants have experienced similar treatment at the hands of Miller.\u201d Miller did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Delta did not comment, beyond stating that it does not tolerate retaliation or harassment. \u201cIt was a very chilling moment,\u201d Nejat of the alleged incident during his training graduation ceremony. \u201cIt made me realize that at that time, and to this day, that there are very strict power dynamics within the culture at Delta. These power dynamics involve unfair work practices. They involve power plays. They involve this kind of unfair power dynamic, and with no union to mediate that sort of power dynamic that exists.\u201d Nejat did not immediately report the incident with Miller due to Miller\u2019s closeness with Delta Air Lines management, according to the lawsuit, but mentioned it on social media and in internal company posts while advocating for a union at the airline. He claims to have been initially suspended without pay for making two anti-harassment, pro-union posts, but was told his sexual harassment allegation against Miller would be investigated. After an initial interview, however, he says there was no follow-up. \u201cDelta has never offered Nejat any explanation of the reasons for its suspension and eventual termination of him, other than its intolerance for his pro-union, anti-sexual- harassment posts,\u201d the lawsuit claims. Miller was permitted to continue working at Delta Air Lines, it alleges. Executives at Delta appeared to have \u201cterminated an employee who reported sexual harassment instead of holding the alleged perpetrator accountable\u201d, said the airline\u2019s Association of Flight Attendants. \u201cFlight Attendants shouldn\u2019t have to be afraid to go to work and face sexual harassment.\u201d The airline\u2019s conduct is \u201cby all means not right\u201d, said Nejat. \u201cIt\u2019s unjust, and it needs to be called out for what it is. On behalf of everyone who has and in the past and in the current has stories of sexual harassment, not only at Delta, but across the airline industry, in other industries, I think it\u2019s really important to speak out, because it demonstrates the power of speaking out. \u201cAnd once people see someone take that first step, then they feel more comfortable sharing their stories and experiences.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese has backed Steven Miles\u2019s opposition to nuclear power while joining the Queensland premier on the first day of pre-poll voting in the state election. At a joint press conference in the Gold Coast on Monday, the prime minister was asked about Miles\u2019s plan to hold a plebiscite on nuclear if Labor wins this month\u2019s poll. Albanese said the proposal was a \u201cmatter for Queensland\u201d, but supported the incumbent premier\u2019s stance against nuclear power. \u201cWhat I certainly hope occurs is that Steve Miles is elected premier of Queensland. That\u2019s what I want to see happen, because that\u2019s a way of making sure that this nuclear fantasy [is stopped],\u201d he said at a joint press conference with Miles. Miles revealed the plan to call a vote on the issue in an exclusive interview with Guardian Australia, perhaps at the next federal election. The premier said he hadn\u2019t run the idea past the prime minister before making it public. The nuclear facilities prohibition act both bans nuclear power and requires a plebiscite on any commonwealth plan. \u201cI\u2019ve said I\u2019ll comply with the law,\u201d Miles said. \u201c[Opposition leader] David Crisafulli has said he does too, but I wonder whether he actually intends to hold that plebiscite.\u201d The Liberal National party leader refused to give an answer as to whether he would support a plebiscite, but called the premier\u2019s comments \u201cdivisive\u201d. \u201cWe have an energy plan, and we will be rolling out that energy plan, and it doesn\u2019t involve nuclear,\u201d Crisafulli said. He dodged questions about why he opposed the plans for nuclear power stations proposed by his federal counterpart, Peter Dutton. The federal opposition leader will take a plan for seven commonwealth-owned nuclear power stations to the next election. That includes two in Queensland, replacing existing coal plants at Callide and Tarong. The Liberal National party leader, who voted for the state\u2019s renewables and emissions reduction targets earlier this year, has gradually hardened his position on green power. Crisafulli said last fortnight that he would extend the state\u2019s coal fleet beyond their planned closure dates. He later dismissed Labor\u2019s legislated green power transition as \u201cfanciful\u201d. Crisafulli also dodged questions on abortion laws, again giving no commitment not to allow a conscience vote by his party members on a bill to be introduced by Katter\u2019s Australian Party next parliament. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you the answer that you want but I\u2019m giving you the answer Queenslanders deserve,\u2019 he told journalists \u201cThere is an act in place that allows that and there\u2019ll be no change to the act, none.\u201d Albanese and Miles took the Gold Coast light rail to Monday\u2019s press conference at Parkwood, paying just 50c apiece for the journey, with the prime minister joining the campaign for the first time as pre-poll voting in the state election opened. Miles had earlier declared he didn\u2019t need Albanese\u2019s backing. \u201cDavid Crisafulli might think he needs some of Peter Dutton\u2019s rizz to rub off on him, but I don\u2019t,\u201d Miles said last week. Dutton joined Crisafulli 10 days ago, in the first week in the election campaign. Standing in front of a pull up banner reading \u201call fares 50 cents\u201d, Albanese backed his Labor left counterpart as a \u201cnew premier\u201d leading a government that could \u201cregenerate\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, this bloke here is going to get better and better,\u201d he said. All ballots in the election must be cast by 26 October.",

      "body": "<p>Argentinian writer Mariana Enriquez exploded on to the literary scene with her collections of grotesque, disturbing stories <em>Things We Lost in the Fire</em> and the International Booker prize-shortlisted <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/19/the-dangers-of-smoking-in-bed-by-mariana-enriquez-review-a-south-american-shirley-jackson\">The Dangers of Smoking in Bed</a></em>, which explored violence against women and the aftermath of the horror of her country\u2019s dictatorship. Her first novel translated into English, <em>Our Share of Night</em>, had a more mixed reception, but her new collection of tales, translated by Megan McDowell, reminds us why she\u2019s one of the best modern practitioners of the form.</p> <p>Enriquez has never been one to pussyfoot about when she can achieve her effects by grabbing the reader hard. Her earlier collections featured body horror \u2013 a girl pulling out her fingernails with her teeth; a woman throttling a zombie baby \u2013 that became part of a movement for literary dystopias from South American female writers, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/24/samanta-schweblin-little-eyes-interview-kentuki-fever-dream\">Samanta Schweblin</a> and Fernanda Tr\u00edas.</p> <p>The opening story of <em>A Sunny Place for Shady People</em> starts in a grim neighbourhood with \u201ckids selling crack on the stairways\u201d and a narrator whose mother \u201cdied screaming\u201d of cancer because she was allergic to morphine. As people die, by violence or their own hand, our commentator becomes a sort of ghost whisperer, caring for dead strangers in a city where compassion is scarce. In a neighbourhood meeting about immigration, one man \u201cdeclares that the police should display the heads of these \u2018illegals\u2019 on stakes, like in colonial days. No one opposes him, or even rolls their eyes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the brilliant Metamorphosis, a menopausal woman finds herself patronised by her doctor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The dictatorship and male violence are more shaded than in Enriquez\u2019s earlier collections. But if Argentina here is a sunny place \u2013 the title savagely ironic \u2013 where \u201cthere\u2019s more money in crime than in lawful work\u201d, it simply means that the horror has seeped down from the political to the domestic. One narrator lives in a household of \u201cconstant misery\u201d, where even death is not the end: her mother\u2019s suicide, far from providing \u201ca huge relief\u201d, is just \u201ca burden I hadn\u2019t asked for and didn\u2019t want to carry\u201d.</p> <p>It is Enriquez\u2019s great gift that she can make stories with ugly subject matter so addictive and full of life. She works best with a high concept: in Face of Disgrace, a woman finds her facial features being erased as a response to intergenerational trauma; in Hyena Hymns, a woman puts on a dress taken from a house once used for torture and finds it cutting open her body and organs.</p> <p>The difficulty for a writer in carving such a distinctive space is that it\u2019s easy to tip into shtick. Sometimes Enriquez overdoes it, as in Night Birds, which features women turning into birds, a narrator whose skin turns green and falls off, and two men whose bodies are fused into a jaguar. It becomes hard to see the substance below the cluttered surface.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/01/mariana-enriquez-our-share-of-night-i-dont-want-to-be-complicit-in-any-kind-of-silence\">Mariana Enr\u00edquez: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be complicit in any kind of silence\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So it\u2019s refreshing when some of the stories offer more subtle effects.

      "bodyText": "Argentinian writer Mariana Enriquez exploded on to the literary scene with her collections of grotesque, disturbing stories Things We Lost in the Fire and the International Booker prize-shortlisted The Dangers of Smoking in Bed, which explored violence against women and the aftermath of the horror of her country\u2019s dictatorship. Her first novel translated into English, Our Share of Night, had a more mixed reception, but her new collection of tales, translated by Megan McDowell, reminds us why she\u2019s one of the best modern practitioners of the form. Enriquez has never been one to pussyfoot about when she can achieve her effects by grabbing the reader hard. Her earlier collections featured body horror \u2013 a girl pulling out her fingernails with her teeth; a woman throttling a zombie baby \u2013 that became part of a movement for literary dystopias from South American female writers, including Samanta Schweblin and Fernanda Tr\u00edas. The opening story of A Sunny Place for Shady People starts in a grim neighbourhood with \u201ckids selling crack on the stairways\u201d and a narrator whose mother \u201cdied screaming\u201d of cancer because she was allergic to morphine. As people die, by violence or their own hand, our commentator becomes a sort of ghost whisperer, caring for dead strangers in a city where compassion is scarce. In a neighbourhood meeting about immigration, one man \u201cdeclares that the police should display the heads of these \u2018illegals\u2019 on stakes, like in colonial days. No one opposes him, or even rolls their eyes.\u201d The dictatorship and male violence are more shaded than in Enriquez\u2019s earlier collections. But if Argentina here is a sunny place \u2013 the title savagely ironic \u2013 where \u201cthere\u2019s more money in crime than in lawful work\u201d, it simply means that the horror has seeped down from the political to the domestic. One narrator lives in a household of \u201cconstant misery\u201d, where even death is not the end: her mother\u2019s suicide, far from providing \u201ca huge relief\u201d, is just \u201ca burden I hadn\u2019t asked for and didn\u2019t want to carry\u201d. It is Enriquez\u2019s great gift that she can make stories with ugly subject matter so addictive and full of life. She works best with a high concept: in Face of Disgrace, a woman finds her facial features being erased as a response to intergenerational trauma; in Hyena Hymns, a woman puts on a dress taken from a house once used for torture and finds it cutting open her body and organs. The difficulty for a writer in carving such a distinctive space is that it\u2019s easy to tip into shtick. Sometimes Enriquez overdoes it, as in Night Birds, which features women turning into birds, a narrator whose skin turns green and falls off, and two men whose bodies are fused into a jaguar. It becomes hard to see the substance below the cluttered surface. So it\u2019s refreshing when some of the stories offer more subtle effects. (In the Enriquez universe, a woman having sex with ghosts, in the story Julie, counts as a subtle effect.) The Refrigerator Cemetery has a more low-key grotesquerie, as children playing in a field of abandoned fridges experience an outcome both expected and surprising. In the brilliant Metamorphosis, a menopausal woman who finds herself patronised by her doctor (\u201cYou\u2019re going to love not menstruating any more\u201d), takes back control of her body by making unusual use of a two-kilo fibroid she had removed. Enriquez saves, if not the best story, then the most insidious, for last. In Black Eyes, set in a city with a growing homelessness problem, a pair of strange children keep politely insisting on being allowed into the narrator\u2019s car. The scene at the end of the tale, and the end of the book, is perhaps the most unsettling of all.

Sunday\u2019s defeat, though, felt like a nadir. It was the team\u2019s worst loss since 2010 \u2013 and the worst at home since before the days of Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith. Is now a good time to note that this game marked the 82nd birthday for team owner and general manager Jerry Jones?</p> <p>Typically, Jones has to wait until January for his team\u2019s annual meltdown. This year, he was treated to a horror show before Halloween.</p> <p>It was not that long ago that the Cowboys had a whiff of perennial contenders. They had a talented, young roster, with playmakers on both sides of the ball. They struck gold in the draft with Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and Micah Parsons, and looked ripe to bury some playoff demons. This defeat to the Lions leaves the Cowboys looking like a team who will be lucky to even reach the postseason. They\u2019re 3-3 on the year, with close wins over the Giants and Steelers. Change two plays \u2013 a fumble here, a botched return there \u2013 and the Cowboys would be 1-5.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/10/the-jets-are-a-mess-but-theyre-not-the-most-hopeless-franchise-in-the-nfl\">The Jets are a mess. But they\u2019re not the most hopeless franchise in the NFL</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The manner of the defeat on Sunday is more impactful than the loss itself. Detroit bullied the Cowboys, on offense and defense. Without the injured Parsons they could not pressure Jared Goff. A run defense that has struggled all season had no shot against the best offensive line in the NFL. Just as in the Week 3 defeat to the Ravens, the Cowboys were crushed upfront, unable to stop the run and incapable of wrapping a protective shield around Prescott. Any hope of a fightback ended on the first drive of the third quarter, with Goff finding Jameson Williams down the field for a 32-yard score. From there, Detroit spent the remainder of the game playing with their food, trying, in vain, to draw up a touchdown for one of their offensive linemen. It <a href=\"https://x.com/313clips/status/1845600089752125933\">almost felt like bullying</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/313clips/status/1845600089752125933\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"zxx\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/hA5TrGx6s7\">pic.twitter.com/hA5TrGx6s7</a></p>&mdash; doodleBob (@313clips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/313clips/status/1845600089752125933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Losing is one thing. Being humiliated at home \u2013 again \u2013 in a season that the Cowboys entered with championship expectations is something bleaker.</p> <p>In truth, it was a defeat five months in the making, with the seeds of the mess planted in the offseason. The Cowboys ducked out of free agency, betting on internal development and the draft. The result is a top-heavy roster lacking talent, one that relies on a handful of star players to drag the team through games. The NFL has never worked that way. Sure, stars put a team over the top in the playoffs, but teams with depth grind out wins in October and November. And depth is acquired in three ways: acing evaluations in free agency and the draft or having a coaching staff that can improve the players already on the roster.</p> <p>Dallas bet on the latter, and it has taken only six weeks to prove the plan was a dud.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/13/tackles-and-textbooks-inside-the-uk-nfl-dream-factory\">Tackles and textbooks: inside the UK\u2019s NFL dream factory</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/15/dallas-cowboys-loss-green-bay-packers-nfl-playoffs-jerry-jones-mike-mccarthy-bill-belichick\">After last season\u2019s playoff debacle</a>, it was evident that the Cowboys had reached the end of a cycle. The offseason was a chance to reboot things, to either rejuvenate the roster or refresh the coaching staff. Jones opted for neither. The Cowboys locked in their prized assets and held on to head coach Mike McCarthy and offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer.</p> <p>Jones\u2019s plan, as far as one can be discerned, was to assemble the All-Grouch Avengers to run his team. After Dan Quinn bolted for the head coaching job in Washington in the offseason, Dallas brought Mike Zimmer back from retirement to run the defense. Adding Zimmer echoed the decisions to keep McCarthy and Schottenheimer. The theory was that there would be few bells and whistles to the scheme, but that the coaches would get the players to play tough, disciplined football. The standout players would add glitz, and the Cowboys would be on their way to another postseason.</p> <p>Instead, the Cowboys look like a dinosaur fighting extinction. On offense, everything feels like hard work, with few ways for Prescott to rack up easy completions. On defense, the Cowboys are soft \u2013 a cardinal sin for a Zimmer-led group.</p> <p>Plus, both units remain jarringly ill-disciplined. If it\u2019s not a running back gliding through open lanes, it\u2019s a busted coverage. If it\u2019s not two receivers arriving in the same spot, it\u2019s a pre-snap penalty.</p> <p>The failure falls back on the man calling the shots. Jones is the team\u2019s general manager in name only; he is not grinding the film and digging for players to build out the back end of the roster. But he signs off on the big calls. It was his decision to bring back McCarthy and Schottenheimer to run the offense. He signed off on bringing in Zimmer. It was his call to sit out free agency and to hand bumper extensions to Prescott and Lamb while holding money in reserve for a future Parsons contract.</p> <p>This is the house that Jerry built \u2013 and Sunday showed that it is rotten.</p> <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Jordan Love, quarterback, Green Bay Packers. </strong>One of the telltale signs of a serious contender is their ability to blow away inferior opponents. The Packers delivered on Sunday, rolling past an overmatched Arizona <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671722\">in a 34-14 win</a>.</p> <p>Green Bay\u2019s defense was at its chaos-inducing best, forcing and recovering three fumbles. But it\u2019s difficult to imagine the group will continue to force multiple turnovers every week. What looks sustainable, what <em>feels </em>sustainable is Jordan Love and the offense. Love tossed four touchdowns and threw for 258 yards against the Cardinals. He was accurate, decisive and peppered all areas of the field, successfully connecting with nine different targets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/11/jim-trotter-nfl-lawsuit-settlement\">Jim Trotter: what happened when an NFL insider sued the league</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1845543671242104890\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jordan Love lofts it up and Romeo Doubs adjusts for another touchdown!<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AZvsGB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AZvsGB</a> on FOX<br>\ud83d\udcf1: <a href=\"https://t.co/waVpO909ge\">https://t.co/waVpO909ge</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/3Tq0RyHxVh\">pic.twitter.com/3Tq0RyHxVh</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1845543671242104890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Arizona\u2019s defense has been frisky this season by throwing a series of wacky looks at opposing quarterbacks to try to offset a lack of talent up front. Against Love, it didn\u2019t matter. In his second season as a starter, Love is playing with a simmering self-assurance. Parts of the game that used to be hard for him \u2013 picking up pressures, attacking the middle of the field \u2013 look easy now. Pair that with his instinctive, playmaking magic, and you have a quarterback who has the answers to any test.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2>    <p><strong>594 yards. </strong>How about the Bucs? Tampa\u2019s 594 yards of total offense in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671735\">a 51-27 win over the Saints</a> set a franchise record and is the most by any team in a game this season, topping the 550-yard effort from the Falcons last week against \u2026 the Bucs.</p> <p>It was a performance fuelled by the team\u2019s run game. After struggling to get anything going on the ground in the first four weeks of the season, Tampa\u2019s rushing attack has come alive in the past two weeks. It exploded in New Orleans, with the Bucs totalling 277 total rushing yards. Everyone was in on the action: Sean Tucker hit 136 yards on 14 carries, Bucky Irving rushed for 81 yards on 14 carries, receiver Sterling Shepard added 31 yards on four carries and Baker Mayfield capped it off with 29 yards on three scrambles. For those keeping score at home, that\u2019s an average of 7.9 yards (!) a carry. Not content with grinding out yards, they also hit four runs of 20 yards or more and two of 30 yards or more. In a sputtering NFC, the Bucs have the firepower to keep up with anybody.</p> <h2><strong>Video of the week</strong></h2> <p>Things are miserable in Cleveland. But amid the darkness, there is always Myles Garrett.<strong> </strong>The all-world defensive player was (largely) responsible for Cleveland\u2019s only touchdown in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671714\">a 20-16 loss to the Eagles</a>, blocking a field goal that Rodney McLeod Jr scooped up for a score.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1845530083693629664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MYLES GARRETT BLOCKS THE FG.<br><br>BROWNS RETURN IT FOR THE TD.<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CLEvsPHI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CLEvsPHI</a> on FOX<br>\ud83d\udcf1: <a href=\"https://t.co/waVpO909ge\">https://t.co/waVpO909ge</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/mTsIcPOEfQ\">pic.twitter.com/mTsIcPOEfQ</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1845530083693629664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>If the field-goal block looks familiar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a carbon copy of the Giants\u2019 decisive block against the Seahawks last week. It\u2019s becoming a mini-trend \u2013 one that the league may look to legislate out of the game sooner rather than later. By rule, a player leaping over the line of scrimmage can\u2019t touch the snapper. But teams have found a savvy workaround: one player drags the snapper down while another leaps into the vacated space. If executed properly, it\u2019s close to unstoppable. And when you\u2019re dealing with Garrett, it\u2019s almost always going to be executed properly.</p> <h2><strong>Elsewhere around the league</strong></h2>    <p>-- The Texans handled their business with a comfortable <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671619\">41-21 win over the Patriots</a>. But there was good news for New England: Drake Maye threw more touchdowns in his first start (three) than Jacoby Brissett had all season (two). Maye\u2019s debut went about as well as could be expected for a rookie behind the worst offensive line in the league, one facing off against a defense that leads the NFL in pressures. Maye threw two interceptions, including an ugly floater on his second drive of the game. But the rookie showed enough flashes to justify the team\u2019s decision to bench Brissett. Maye created plays with his legs and delivered a 30-yard touchdown strike to Kayshon Boutte at the end of the first half. New England will lose plenty of games this season, but Maye\u2019s first start offered a sliver of hope for the future.</p> <p>-- The Lions\u2019 victory was marred by a serious injury to star edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41778959/lions-hutchinson-carted-serious-injury\">who suffered a broken tibia</a>. The episode affected Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, whose season was ended by a similar injury in 2020. Prescott offered Hutchinson words of encouragement as he was carted off the field. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that I felt in the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably get his number from one of the guys in the locker room and reach out again ... When you\u2019re in that, it\u2019s blurry. So I don\u2019t even know if he heard [what I said]. Don\u2019t care if he heard them. I understand where he was.\u201d</p> <p>-- Chicago took an unusual approach with Caleb Williams this season. They threw the lot at the rookie quarterback, handing him full control of the offense while running one of the most expansive schemes in the league. It was ugly in the opening two weeks, but those early-season jitters appear to have drifted away. The offense came online in recent weeks by leaning into the run game and relying on Williams to throw the ball in rhythm. But on Sunday we were treated to the Williams who dazzled at USC, spinning magic outside the pocket. The Bears pasted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/13/chicago-bears-trample-jacksonville-jaguars-in-clash-at-tottenham-stadium\">dejected-looking Jaguars team 35-16 in London</a>, with Williams carving the Jacksonville defense up with his arm and legs. He threw for 226 yards and four touchdowns, tacking on an extra 56 yards with his legs. Williams has been efficient in recent weeks, mastering the pro part of professional quarterback play. Sunday, against a ragged Jags defense, was the first glimpse of the player Williams can become: a quarterback who can excel in or out of structure.</p> <p>-- The Jaguars will hang around in London for another week before their game against the Patriots at Wembley. It has become something of a trend for a coach under fire to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/08/stumbling-new-york-jets-reportedly-fire-head-coach-robert-saleh\">fired after an ugly overseas loss</a>. What will Jacksonville do with Doug Pederson? The defeat to the Bears was a someone-should-get-fired kind of performance, a limp, lifeless outing that showed a staff out of ideas. But back-to-back weeks overseas will make the decision tricky. Will Jacksonville fly Pederson back to Florida while they stay in London? Will they keep him for another week, thinking that they should squeeze by a poor Patriots team? Either way, it will be an awkward few days at the breakfast buffet.</p> <p>-- How about Michael Pittman Jr? Last week, it was reported that the Colts\u2019 wide receiver would be placed on injured reserve with a back injury. But Pittman told the team that he wanted to play on Sunday before making a decision. In <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671820\">a messy 20-17 win over the Titans</a>, it was the receiver who was the difference maker. Pittman pulled in only three receptions, but he came up big in must-have-it situations. Joe Flacco found Pittman on a jump ball to give the Colts a go-ahead score before the receiver grabbed a late reception to ice the game. There is toughness \u2013 and then there is snagging a catch in traffic with a lingering back injury</p>",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s give this to Dallas: they always find a way to entertain. Sunday\u2019s 47-9 drubbing at the hands of the Lions may have felt more like watching The Substance than Love Is Blind, but seeing the Cowboys being beaten on their own home turf remains must-watch TV. In the nearly 30 years since the Cowboys last won the Super Bowl, there have been plenty of lows. Sunday\u2019s defeat, though, felt like a nadir. It was the team\u2019s worst loss since 2010 \u2013 and the worst at home since before the days of Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith. Is now a good time to note that this game marked the 82nd birthday for team owner and general manager Jerry Jones? Typically, Jones has to wait until January for his team\u2019s annual meltdown. This year, he was treated to a horror show before Halloween. It was not that long ago that the Cowboys had a whiff of perennial contenders. They had a talented, young roster, with playmakers on both sides of the ball. They struck gold in the draft with Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and Micah Parsons, and looked ripe to bury some playoff demons. This defeat to the Lions leaves the Cowboys looking like a team who will be lucky to even reach the postseason. They\u2019re 3-3 on the year, with close wins over the Giants and Steelers. Change two plays \u2013 a fumble here, a botched return there \u2013 and the Cowboys would be 1-5. The manner of the defeat on Sunday is more impactful than the loss itself. Detroit bullied the Cowboys, on offense and defense. Without the injured Parsons they could not pressure Jared Goff. A run defense that has struggled all season had no shot against the best offensive line in the NFL. Just as in the Week 3 defeat to the Ravens, the Cowboys were crushed upfront, unable to stop the run and incapable of wrapping a protective shield around Prescott. Any hope of a fightback ended on the first drive of the third quarter, with Goff finding Jameson Williams down the field for a 32-yard score. From there, Detroit spent the remainder of the game playing with their food, trying, in vain, to draw up a touchdown for one of their offensive linemen. It almost felt like bullying. Losing is one thing. Being humiliated at home \u2013 again \u2013 in a season that the Cowboys entered with championship expectations is something bleaker. In truth, it was a defeat five months in the making, with the seeds of the mess planted in the offseason. The Cowboys ducked out of free agency, betting on internal development and the draft. The result is a top-heavy roster lacking talent, one that relies on a handful of star players to drag the team through games. The NFL has never worked that way. Sure, stars put a team over the top in the playoffs, but teams with depth grind out wins in October and November. And depth is acquired in three ways: acing evaluations in free agency and the draft or having a coaching staff that can improve the players already on the roster. Dallas bet on the latter, and it has taken only six weeks to prove the plan was a dud. After last season\u2019s playoff debacle, it was evident that the Cowboys had reached the end of a cycle. The offseason was a chance to reboot things, to either rejuvenate the roster or refresh the coaching staff. Jones opted for neither. The Cowboys locked in their prized assets and held on to head coach Mike McCarthy and offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer. Jones\u2019s plan, as far as one can be discerned, was to assemble the All-Grouch Avengers to run his team. After Dan Quinn bolted for the head coaching job in Washington in the offseason, Dallas brought Mike Zimmer back from retirement to run the defense. Adding Zimmer echoed the decisions to keep McCarthy and Schottenheimer. The theory was that there would be few bells and whistles to the scheme, but that the coaches would get the players to play tough, disciplined football. The standout players would add glitz, and the Cowboys would be on their way to another postseason. Instead, the Cowboys look like a dinosaur fighting extinction. On offense, everything feels like hard work, with few ways for Prescott to rack up easy completions. On defense, the Cowboys are soft \u2013 a cardinal sin for a Zimmer-led group. Plus, both units remain jarringly ill-disciplined. If it\u2019s not a running back gliding through open lanes, it\u2019s a busted coverage. If it\u2019s not two receivers arriving in the same spot, it\u2019s a pre-snap penalty. The failure falls back on the man calling the shots. Jones is the team\u2019s general manager in name only; he is not grinding the film and digging for players to build out the back end of the roster. But he signs off on the big calls. It was his decision to bring back McCarthy and Schottenheimer to run the offense. He signed off on bringing in Zimmer. It was his call to sit out free agency and to hand bumper extensions to Prescott and Lamb while holding money in reserve for a future Parsons contract. This is the house that Jerry built \u2013 and Sunday showed that it is rotten. MVP of the week Jordan Love, quarterback, Green Bay Packers. One of the telltale signs of a serious contender is their ability to blow away inferior opponents. The Packers delivered on Sunday, rolling past an overmatched Arizona in a 34-14 win. Green Bay\u2019s defense was at its chaos-inducing best, forcing and recovering three fumbles. But it\u2019s difficult to imagine the group will continue to force multiple turnovers every week. What looks sustainable, what feels sustainable is Jordan Love and the offense. Love tossed four touchdowns and threw for 258 yards against the Cardinals. He was accurate, decisive and peppered all areas of the field, successfully connecting with nine different targets. Arizona\u2019s defense has been frisky this season by throwing a series of wacky looks at opposing quarterbacks to try to offset a lack of talent up front. Against Love, it didn\u2019t matter. In his second season as a starter, Love is playing with a simmering self-assurance. Parts of the game that used to be hard for him \u2013 picking up pressures, attacking the middle of the field \u2013 look easy now. Pair that with his instinctive, playmaking magic, and you have a quarterback who has the answers to any test. Stat of the week 594 yards. How about the Bucs? Tampa\u2019s 594 yards of total offense in a 51-27 win over the Saints set a franchise record and is the most by any team in a game this season, topping the 550-yard effort from the Falcons last week against \u2026 the Bucs. It was a performance fuelled by the team\u2019s run game. After struggling to get anything going on the ground in the first four weeks of the season, Tampa\u2019s rushing attack has come alive in the past two weeks. It exploded in New Orleans, with the Bucs totalling 277 total rushing yards. Everyone was in on the action: Sean Tucker hit 136 yards on 14 carries, Bucky Irving rushed for 81 yards on 14 carries, receiver Sterling Shepard added 31 yards on four carries and Baker Mayfield capped it off with 29 yards on three scrambles. For those keeping score at home, that\u2019s an average of 7.9 yards (!) a carry. Not content with grinding out yards, they also hit four runs of 20 yards or more and two of 30 yards or more. In a sputtering NFC, the Bucs have the firepower to keep up with anybody. Video of the week Things are miserable in Cleveland. But amid the darkness, there is always Myles Garrett. The all-world defensive player was (largely) responsible for Cleveland\u2019s only touchdown in a 20-16 loss to the Eagles, blocking a field goal that Rodney McLeod Jr scooped up for a score. If the field-goal block looks familiar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a carbon copy of the Giants\u2019 decisive block against the Seahawks last week. It\u2019s becoming a mini-trend \u2013 one that the league may look to legislate out of the game sooner rather than later.

They argued the allegations against her were \u201cpolitical\u201d and therefore not extraditable, and that the people were not kidnapped but legitimately arrested.</p> <p>At each stage, courts found she was eligible for extradition \u2013 the final decision on whether she would be surrendered to Chile lay in the hands of Australia\u2019s attorney general.</p> <p>But Rivas has now launched a last-minute challenge in the federal court, asking the court to declare government\u2019s decision to surrender her to Chile \u201cvoid and of no legal effect\u201d.</p>    <p>Her application, which indicates a decision to surrender her had been made, asks the court to restrain government ministers \u201cdirectly, or by their agents, officers or delegates, from surrendering Ms Adriana Rivas to the Republic of Chile\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyer Adriana Navarro, representing the families of the seven people disappeared, told Guardian Australia they were \u201cmortified\u201d they had not been informed of the apparent decision to surrender Rivas, nor that she had filed another appeal to block the extradition.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve had enough, they find it disturbing that they have to learn through the media that this is happening,\u201d Navarro said. </p> <p>She said the families had been told \u201cnothing whatsoever\u201d through official channels about the progress of Rivas\u2019s case over the past five years, and felt \u201cmocked\u201d by a system which kept them uninformed.</p> <p>Rivas first came to Australia in 1978. In Chile, she worked as a secretary at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Centre, a secretive compound on the outskirts of the capital later discovered to be the Dina\u2019s interrogation, torture and extermination site. She has insisted her role was administrative and she knew nothing of the crimes that occurred at her place of work.</p> <p>When she travelled to Chile to visit family in 2006, she was arrested and questioned. She was held in custody for three months and released on bail under strict conditions, including a prohibition on leaving on the country.</p> <p>But in 2007, while Rivas was living in Chile on bail, a man called Jorgelino Vergara was arrested and charged with Diaz\u2019s murder. In 2010, he gave testimony that directly alleged Rivas participated in the torture of prisoners at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Centre.</p> <p>A Chilean police report specifically names her as a brigade member involved in the commission of \u201cforced entries, detention, interrogations and application of torture\u201d.</p> <p>Metal bunk beds were rigged with electrical current and detainees repeatedly shocked all over their bodies, according to the police report, which also detailed they were injected with unknown substances or \u201csuffocated by asphyxiating them with plastic bags\u201d.</p> <p>Chile\u2019s interior ministry wrote in court documents: \u201cIt is important to emphasise the cruelty of the crimes committed.\u201d</p> <p>Rivas has expressly denied these allegations and any involvement in torture, and she has not been convicted of any crime.</p> <p>Vergara\u2019s testimony ultimately led to the conviction of more than 70 Dina agents and officials of the Pinochet regime. The same year he agreed to give evidence against the Dina, Rivas escaped over Chile\u2019s land border into Argentina and flew back to Australia.</p> <p>In a 2013 SBS interview, she said she had worked at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Center, but insisted she was not involved in interrogating detainees.</p> <p>\u201cNot guilty. Not guilty. If I \u2026 look, I never had the opportunity to be where the detainees were. Never, understand? All my work was as a secretary or security. Nothing more.\u201d</p> <p>In the same interview, she defended the use of violence against opponents of the regime. \u201cEveryone knew they had to do that to the people in order to break them because communists would not talk. It was necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Rivas said she did not regret working for the Dina.</p> <p>\u201cFor me it was a job. It was a chance to survive. Understand?\u201d</p> <p>No hearing date has been set for the federal court application to be heard.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A former Bondi nanny and cleaner accused by Chile of being a torturer and kidnapper for Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s has launched a last-ditch legal appeal to avoid extradition. Adriana Rivas, 70, has been in prison in Australia since 2019, when she was arrested on an extradition request from Chile \u2013 seeking her for trial on seven counts of aggravated kidnapping relating to the disappearance, and presumed murder, of seven members of Chile\u2019s communist party who disappeared in 1976. Party leader Victor D\u00edaz was abducted by Pinochet\u2019s secret police, the Dina (Direcci\u00f3n de Inteligencia Nacional, or National Intelligence Directorate) in May 1976. Six more party members were kidnapped off the streets of Santiago in December \u2013 the youngest, 29-year-old Reinalda del Carmen Pereira Plaza, was six months pregnant when she disappeared. Documents from Chile\u2019s appeal court provided to Australian courts allege Rivas worked as an agent of the Dina\u2019s shadowy Lautaro Brigade (established to target members of the communist party) and was involved in the torture and disappearance of political opponents of the military dictator. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Rivas\u2019s legal team have fought Chile\u2019s extradition request over half a decade, including appeals to Australia\u2019s federal court and the high court (which was ultimately abandoned). They argued the allegations against her were \u201cpolitical\u201d and therefore not extraditable, and that the people were not kidnapped but legitimately arrested. At each stage, courts found she was eligible for extradition \u2013 the final decision on whether she would be surrendered to Chile lay in the hands of Australia\u2019s attorney general. But Rivas has now launched a last-minute challenge in the federal court, asking the court to declare government\u2019s decision to surrender her to Chile \u201cvoid and of no legal effect\u201d. Her application, which indicates a decision to surrender her had been made, asks the court to restrain government ministers \u201cdirectly, or by their agents, officers or delegates, from surrendering Ms Adriana Rivas to the Republic of Chile\u201d. Lawyer Adriana Navarro, representing the families of the seven people disappeared, told Guardian Australia they were \u201cmortified\u201d they had not been informed of the apparent decision to surrender Rivas, nor that she had filed another appeal to block the extradition. \u201cThey\u2019ve had enough, they find it disturbing that they have to learn through the media that this is happening,\u201d Navarro said. She said the families had been told \u201cnothing whatsoever\u201d through official channels about the progress of Rivas\u2019s case over the past five years, and felt \u201cmocked\u201d by a system which kept them uninformed. Rivas first came to Australia in 1978. In Chile, she worked as a secretary at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Centre, a secretive compound on the outskirts of the capital later discovered to be the Dina\u2019s interrogation, torture and extermination site. She has insisted her role was administrative and she knew nothing of the crimes that occurred at her place of work. When she travelled to Chile to visit family in 2006, she was arrested and questioned. She was held in custody for three months and released on bail under strict conditions, including a prohibition on leaving on the country. But in 2007, while Rivas was living in Chile on bail, a man called Jorgelino Vergara was arrested and charged with Diaz\u2019s murder. In 2010, he gave testimony that directly alleged Rivas participated in the torture of prisoners at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Centre. A Chilean police report specifically names her as a brigade member involved in the commission of \u201cforced entries, detention, interrogations and application of torture\u201d. Metal bunk beds were rigged with electrical current and detainees repeatedly shocked all over their bodies, according to the police report, which also detailed they were injected with unknown substances or \u201csuffocated by asphyxiating them with plastic bags\u201d. Chile\u2019s interior ministry wrote in court documents: \u201cIt is important to emphasise the cruelty of the crimes committed.\u201d Rivas has expressly denied these allegations and any involvement in torture, and she has not been convicted of any crime. Vergara\u2019s testimony ultimately led to the conviction of more than 70 Dina agents and officials of the Pinochet regime. The same year he agreed to give evidence against the Dina, Rivas escaped over Chile\u2019s land border into Argentina and flew back to Australia. In a 2013 SBS interview, she said she had worked at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Center, but insisted she was not involved in interrogating detainees. \u201cNot guilty. Not guilty. If I \u2026 look, I never had the opportunity to be where the detainees were. Never, understand? All my work was as a secretary or security. Nothing more.\u201d In the same interview, she defended the use of violence against opponents of the regime. \u201cEveryone knew they had to do that to the people in order to break them because communists would not talk. It was necessary.\u201d Rivas said she did not regret working for the Dina. \u201cFor me it was a job. It was a chance to survive. Understand?\u201d No hearing date has been set for the federal court application to be heard.",

Now, its backsliding could threaten global progress</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Combined with the declining resilience of the Amazon and drought conditions in parts of the tropics, the hot conditions in the northern forests helped drive the collapse of the land sink in 2023 \u2013 causing a spike in the rate of atmospheric carbon.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2023 the accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is very high and this translates into a very, very low absorption by the terrestrial biosphere,\u201d says Philippe Ciais, a researcher at the French Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, who was an author of the most <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12447\">recent paper</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn the northern hemisphere, where you have more than half of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, we have seen a decline trend in absorption for eight years,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no good reason to believe it will bounce back.\u201d</p> <p>The oceans \u2013 nature\u2019s largest absorber of CO<sub>2</sub> \u2013 have <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ocean-warming/?intent=121\">soaked up 90%</a> of the warming from fossil fuels in recent decades, driving a rise in sea temperatures. Studies have also <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110124000200\">found signs</a> that this is weakening the ocean carbon sink.</p> <h2>\u2018None of the models have factored this in\u2019</h2> <p>The flow of carbon through the land and ocean remains one of the least understood parts of climate science, say researchers. While human emissions are increasingly simple to measure, the sheer number and complexity of processes in the natural world mean there are important gaps in our understanding.</p> <p>Satellite technology has improved monitoring of forests, peatlands, permafrost and ocean cycles, but assessments and forecasts in international reports often have large error margins. That makes it difficult to predict how the world\u2019s natural carbon sinks will behave in future \u2013 and means many models do not factor in a sudden breakdown of multiple ecosystems.</p>    <p>\u201cOverall, models agreed that both the land sink and the ocean sink are going to decrease in the future as a result of climate change. But there\u2019s a question of how quickly that will happen. The models tend to show this happening rather slowly over the next 100 years or so,\u201d says Prof Andrew Watson, head of Exeter University\u2019s marine and atmospheric science group.</p> <p>\u201cThis might happen a lot quicker,\u201d he says. \u201cClimate scientists [are] worried about climate change not because of the things that are in the models but the knowledge that the models are missing certain things.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the latest Earth systems models used by scientists include some of the effects of global heating on nature, factoring in impacts such as the dieback of the Amazon or slowing ocean currents. But events that have become major sources of emissions in recent years have not been incorporated, say scientists.</p> <p>\u201cNone of these models have factored in losses like extreme factors which have been observed, such as the wildfires in Canada last year that amounted to six months of US fossil emissions. Two years before, we wrote a paper that found that Siberia also lost the same amount of carbon,\u201d says Ciais.</p>    <p>\u201cAnother process which is absent from the climate models is the basic fact that trees die from drought. This is observed and none of the models have drought-induced mortality in their representation of the land sink,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that the models are lacking these factors probably makes them too optimistic.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018What happens if the natural sinks stop working?\u2019</h2> <p>The consequences for climate targets are stark. Even a modest weakening of nature\u2019s ability to absorb carbon would mean the world would have to make much deeper cuts to greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net zero. The weakening of land sinks \u2013 which has so far been regional \u2013 also has the effect of cancelling out nations\u2019 progress on decarbonisation and progress towards climate goals, something that is proving a struggle for many countries.</p> <p>In Australia, huge soil carbon losses from extreme heat and drought in the vast interior \u2013 known as rangelands \u2013 are likely to push its climate target out of reach if emissions continue to rise, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00619-z\">a study this year found</a>. In Europe, France, <a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/DE/themen/wald/wald-in-deutschland/bundeswaldinventur.html\">Germany</a>, the Czech Republic and Sweden have <a href=\"https://cbmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-023-00234-0\">all experienced significant declines</a> in the amount of carbon absorbed by land, driven by climate-related bark beetle outbreaks, drought and increased tree mortality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/23/mangrove-forests-risk-human-coastline-protection-biodiversity-ecosystems-climate-carbon-aoe\">Half of world\u2019s mangrove forests are at risk due to human behaviour \u2013 study </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finland, which has the most ambitious carbon neutrality target in the developed world, has seen its once huge land sink vanish in recent years \u2013 meaning that despite reducing its emissions across all industries by 43%, the country\u2019s total emissions have stayed unchanged.</p> <p>So far, these changes are regional. Some countries, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32961-2\">such as China</a> and the US, are not yet experiencing such declines.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue of natural sinks has never really been thought about properly in political and government fields. It\u2019s been assumed that natural sinks are always going to be with us. The truth is, we don\u2019t really understand them and we don\u2019t think they\u2019re always going to be with us. What happens if the natural sinks, which they\u2019ve previously relied on, stop working because the climate is changing?\u201d says Watson.</p> <p>In recent years, several estimates have been published on how the world could increase the amount of carbon that its forests and natural ecosystems absorb. But many researchers say the real challenge is protecting the carbon sinks and stores we already have by halting deforestation, cutting emissions and ensuring they are as healthy as possible.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t rely on natural forests to do the job. We really, really have to tackle the big issue: fossil fuel emissions across all sectors,\u201d says Prof Pierre Friedlingstein of Exeter University, who oversees the annual <a href=\"https://globalcarbonbudget.org/\">Global Carbon Budget</a> calculations.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just assume that we have forests and the forest will remove some CO<sub>2</sub>, because it\u2019s not going to work in the long term.\u201d </p> <ul> <li><p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on X for all the latest news and features</em></p></li> </ul> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2024.

The boreal forests \u2013 home to about a third of all carbon found on land, which stretch across Russia, Scandinavia, Canada and Alaska \u2013 have seen a sharp fall in the amount of carbon they absorb, down more than a third due to climate crisis-related beetle outbreaks, fire and clearing for timber. Combined with the declining resilience of the Amazon and drought conditions in parts of the tropics, the hot conditions in the northern forests helped drive the collapse of the land sink in 2023 \u2013 causing a spike in the rate of atmospheric carbon. \u201cIn 2023 the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere is very high and this translates into a very, very low absorption by the terrestrial biosphere,\u201d says Philippe Ciais, a researcher at the French Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, who was an author of the most recent paper. \u201cIn the northern hemisphere, where you have more than half of CO2 uptake, we have seen a decline trend in absorption for eight years,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no good reason to believe it will bounce back.\u201d The oceans \u2013 nature\u2019s largest absorber of CO2 \u2013 have soaked up 90% of the warming from fossil fuels in recent decades, driving a rise in sea temperatures. Studies have also found signs that this is weakening the ocean carbon sink. \u2018None of the models have factored this in\u2019 The flow of carbon through the land and ocean remains one of the least understood parts of climate science, say researchers. While human emissions are increasingly simple to measure, the sheer number and complexity of processes in the natural world mean there are important gaps in our understanding. Satellite technology has improved monitoring of forests, peatlands, permafrost and ocean cycles, but assessments and forecasts in international reports often have large error margins. That makes it difficult to predict how the world\u2019s natural carbon sinks will behave in future \u2013 and means many models do not factor in a sudden breakdown of multiple ecosystems. \u201cOverall, models agreed that both the land sink and the ocean sink are going to decrease in the future as a result of climate change. But there\u2019s a question of how quickly that will happen. The models tend to show this happening rather slowly over the next 100 years or so,\u201d says Prof Andrew Watson, head of Exeter University\u2019s marine and atmospheric science group. \u201cThis might happen a lot quicker,\u201d he says. \u201cClimate scientists [are] worried about climate change not because of the things that are in the models but the knowledge that the models are missing certain things.\u201d Many of the latest Earth systems models used by scientists include some of the effects of global heating on nature, factoring in impacts such as the dieback of the Amazon or slowing ocean currents. But events that have become major sources of emissions in recent years have not been incorporated, say scientists. \u201cNone of these models have factored in losses like extreme factors which have been observed, such as the wildfires in Canada last year that amounted to six months of US fossil emissions. Two years before, we wrote a paper that found that Siberia also lost the same amount of carbon,\u201d says Ciais. \u201cAnother process which is absent from the climate models is the basic fact that trees die from drought. This is observed and none of the models have drought-induced mortality in their representation of the land sink,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that the models are lacking these factors probably makes them too optimistic.\u201d \u2018What happens if the natural sinks stop working?\u2019 The consequences for climate targets are stark. Even a modest weakening of nature\u2019s ability to absorb carbon would mean the world would have to make much deeper cuts to greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net zero. The weakening of land sinks \u2013 which has so far been regional \u2013 also has the effect of cancelling out nations\u2019 progress on decarbonisation and progress towards climate goals, something that is proving a struggle for many countries. In Australia, huge soil carbon losses from extreme heat and drought in the vast interior \u2013 known as rangelands \u2013 are likely to push its climate target out of reach if emissions continue to rise, a study this year found. In Europe, France, Germany, the Czech Republic and Sweden have all experienced significant declines in the amount of carbon absorbed by land, driven by climate-related bark beetle outbreaks, drought and increased tree mortality. Finland, which has the most ambitious carbon neutrality target in the developed world, has seen its once huge land sink vanish in recent years \u2013 meaning that despite reducing its emissions across all industries by 43%, the country\u2019s total emissions have stayed unchanged. So far, these changes are regional. Some countries, such as China and the US, are not yet experiencing such declines. \u201cThe issue of natural sinks has never really been thought about properly in political and government fields. It\u2019s been assumed that natural sinks are always going to be with us. The truth is, we don\u2019t really understand them and we don\u2019t think they\u2019re always going to be with us. What happens if the natural sinks, which they\u2019ve previously relied on, stop working because the climate is changing?\u201d says Watson. In recent years, several estimates have been published on how the world could increase the amount of carbon that its forests and natural ecosystems absorb. But many researchers say the real challenge is protecting the carbon sinks and stores we already have by halting deforestation, cutting emissions and ensuring they are as healthy as possible. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t rely on natural forests to do the job. We really, really have to tackle the big issue: fossil fuel emissions across all sectors,\u201d says Prof Pierre Friedlingstein of Exeter University, who oversees the annual Global Carbon Budget calculations. \u201cWe can\u2019t just assume that we have forests and the forest will remove some CO2, because it\u2019s not going to work in the long term.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features \u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2024.

A final note: just because you can\u2019t smell it after a few hours, it doesn\u2019t mean a fragrance doesn\u2019t suit you. Catalani adds: \u201cAs your olfactory system adapts to the constant presence of a scent, it becomes less sensitive to it.\u201d",

One trip was to Thailand, a solo journey planned as an escape from burnout, that spiralled into a dark encounter with a would-be trafficker.

Although they\u2019ve been prominent on the UK comedy scene for nearly a decade, this year was Bob\u2019s debut hour at the festival. \u201cI worried that the mental health element would deter people,\u201d the comedian says. A whistle-stop run through the subject matter \u2013 bipolar disorder, financial ruin, extortion \u2013 belies how light and mischievous Miss Fortunate is, with the charismatic and reflective standup delivering a handful of songs, and guiding us through their ups and downs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My character was addicted to PCP. I gouged my eyes out with knitting needles because rats were eating them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSometimes I do feel the burden of making people laugh,\u201d Bob says. \u201cBut it was important not to trivialise this experience.\u201d Guided by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/18/desiree-burch-review-edinburgh-2019\">Desiree Burch</a> (\u201cShe understands the strength in vulnerability\u201d), Bob started to probe this trickier subject matter and the shame bound up in it. The show was co-directed by Burch and Sarah Chew. \u201cWe created something that doesn\u2019t shy away from the darkness, while also being quite silly, quite fun,\u201d says Bob. \u201cThat was important \u2013 because that\u2019s how I am.\u201d</p> <p>Bob has a mission statement: \u201cTo enlighten and empower through entertainment.\u201d As well as addressing mental health in their comedy, Bob has relished talking about sex and sexuality, which felt important after their \u201csuper religious\u201d upbringing, and in 2018 founded FOC It Up, a comedy club for femmes of colour. It\u2019s now less rare to be the only FOC on a bill, Bob says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a lot of road to cover! Obviously, the industry could do more.\u201d</p>    <p>At Bob\u2019s Texas high school, they performed as a cheerleader, but their stage debut in a play was a little different: \u201cMy character was addicted to PCP. I gouged my eyes out with knitting needles because rats were eating them. That\u2019s wild as a first role.\u201d This led Bob to study drama at college, where a teacher spotted their classroom quips and directed them to improv, bringing a first taste of comedy.</p> <p>After a stint in LA, they relocated to Britain to study TV production and set a goal: try standup in the city. How was it, being a Texan comedian in London? \u201cI felt free,\u201d Bob says, \u201cbecause people didn\u2019t know what to project upon me. This country has space for different forms of comedy, not just club comedy. I\u2019ve had space to find my voice without having to do dick jokes in a basement. I do dick jokes when I want to. That\u2019s a <em>choice!</em>\u201d</p> <p>They joined an \u201call-femme improv group\u201d and got involved in the cabaret scene where they created rapper drag king persona Lil Test Ease. Becoming a co-host of The Guilty Feminist podcast \u201cwas transformative, it allowed me to hone my voice\u201d, while Nish Kumar got Bob involved with \u201csome of my first, and best, writing jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Bob put off doing a full debut fringe hour at Edinburgh because their first taste \u2013 a shared comedy show in 2018 with a different comic each night \u2013 felt \u201cchaotic and intense\u201d. Bob worried about costs, and being judged for awards and reviews, but they\u2019ve started to see the creative opportunities of longer-form comedy. Plus, after the Thailand trauma, the comedian was low on money and work. \u201cThat was my initial motivation \u2013 take the charge paddles to the chest of my career.\u201d It felt natural, even \u201curgent\u201d, to explore the incident abroad. \u201cCreating the show allowed me to process my experience. Now I\u2019m able to be compassionate towards myself.\u201d</p> <p>Bob couldn\u2019t fit all of the \u201cmany twists and turns\u201d into a single hour and is now exploring a book or film version, as well as writing their next standup show \u201cabout adverse childhood experiences\u201d. Miss Fortunate\u2019s success has equipped them well for that challenge. \u201cI had to face my biggest fear, which was losing my mind. And my second biggest fear, which was being financially vulnerable. On the other side, well, I\u2019m still broke. But you can go through dark times, make it out wiser \u2013 and loving yourself even more.\u201d</p> <p>And there\u2019s another silver lining. \u201cInitially,\u201d says Bob, \u201cI was upset that I had all of the shit around me that I bought, and barely any money. But now I love my stuff. Manic me?

A whistle-stop run through the subject matter \u2013 bipolar disorder, financial ruin, extortion \u2013 belies how light and mischievous Miss Fortunate is, with the charismatic and reflective standup delivering a handful of songs, and guiding us through their ups and downs. \u201cSometimes I do feel the burden of making people laugh,\u201d Bob says. \u201cBut it was important not to trivialise this experience.\u201d Guided by Desiree Burch (\u201cShe understands the strength in vulnerability\u201d), Bob started to probe this trickier subject matter and the shame bound up in it. The show was co-directed by Burch and Sarah Chew. \u201cWe created something that doesn\u2019t shy away from the darkness, while also being quite silly, quite fun,\u201d says Bob. \u201cThat was important \u2013 because that\u2019s how I am.\u201d Bob has a mission statement: \u201cTo enlighten and empower through entertainment.\u201d As well as addressing mental health in their comedy, Bob has relished talking about sex and sexuality, which felt important after their \u201csuper religious\u201d upbringing, and in 2018 founded FOC It Up, a comedy club for femmes of colour. It\u2019s now less rare to be the only FOC on a bill, Bob says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a lot of road to cover! Obviously, the industry could do more.\u201d At Bob\u2019s Texas high school, they performed as a cheerleader, but their stage debut in a play was a little different: \u201cMy character was addicted to PCP. I gouged my eyes out with knitting needles because rats were eating them. That\u2019s wild as a first role.\u201d This led Bob to study drama at college, where a teacher spotted their classroom quips and directed them to improv, bringing a first taste of comedy. After a stint in LA, they relocated to Britain to study TV production and set a goal: try standup in the city. How was it, being a Texan comedian in London? \u201cI felt free,\u201d Bob says, \u201cbecause people didn\u2019t know what to project upon me. This country has space for different forms of comedy, not just club comedy. I\u2019ve had space to find my voice without having to do dick jokes in a basement. I do dick jokes when I want to. That\u2019s a choice!\u201d They joined an \u201call-femme improv group\u201d and got involved in the cabaret scene where they created rapper drag king persona Lil Test Ease. Becoming a co-host of The Guilty Feminist podcast \u201cwas transformative, it allowed me to hone my voice\u201d, while Nish Kumar got Bob involved with \u201csome of my first, and best, writing jobs\u201d. Bob put off doing a full debut fringe hour at Edinburgh because their first taste \u2013 a shared comedy show in 2018 with a different comic each night \u2013 felt \u201cchaotic and intense\u201d. Bob worried about costs, and being judged for awards and reviews, but they\u2019ve started to see the creative opportunities of longer-form comedy. Plus, after the Thailand trauma, the comedian was low on money and work. \u201cThat was my initial motivation \u2013 take the charge paddles to the chest of my career.\u201d It felt natural, even \u201curgent\u201d, to explore the incident abroad. \u201cCreating the show allowed me to process my experience. Now I\u2019m able to be compassionate towards myself.\u201d Bob couldn\u2019t fit all of the \u201cmany twists and turns\u201d into a single hour and is now exploring a book or film version, as well as writing their next standup show \u201cabout adverse childhood experiences\u201d. Miss Fortunate\u2019s success has equipped them well for that challenge. \u201cI had to face my biggest fear, which was losing my mind. And my second biggest fear, which was being financially vulnerable. On the other side, well, I\u2019m still broke. But you can go through dark times, make it out wiser \u2013 and loving yourself even more.\u201d And there\u2019s another silver lining. \u201cInitially,\u201d says Bob, \u201cI was upset that I had all of the shit around me that I bought, and barely any money. But now I love my stuff. Manic me? Great taste!\u201d Miss Fortunate is at Soho theatre, London, 6\u20139 November. Then touring.",

Here\u2019s what\u2019s been keeping us busy: NSW state MP Alex Greenwich has been urged to restore protections for LGBTQ+ school staff in his equality bill. A year on from the failed voice referendum, Murray Watt said the government had the \u201cguts\u201d to see the voice proposal through despite the polls, while Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price bemoaned a lack of change on the ground. NSW may look to other states\u2019 bans on Nazi salutes in a quest to remove any ambiguity in laws around the display of hate symbols in public. The Australian government has told Israel that targeting of any United Nations staff or facilities in Lebanon must end. A third executive is to depart Nine Entertainment after a tumultuous year in which allegations of predatory behaviour in newsrooms were aired. The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, is looking forward to welcoming King Charles to the state later this week. The MP Peter Khalil\u2019s office was allegedly criminally vandalised overnight. The Labor MP said a substance with an \u201cunbearable stench\u201d had been poured into the premises. Bruce Lehrmann is unemployable and may only be able to make money from OnlyFans, his lawyer told federal court \u2013 but he \u201chad his day in court\u201d and should be denied an appeal against his defamation finding, the court also heard. And finally, a duo of baby seagulls on Collins Street in Melbourne has given the famed peregrine falcons at nearby 367 Collins a run for their money. Thank you, as ever, for joining us today. We\u2019ll be back bright and early tomorrow morning. Australia tells Israel \u2018targeting or intimidation of UN personnel\u2019 in Lebanon is unacceptable Australian government officials are also understood to have made representations to Israel\u2019s government, both in Canberra and Tel Aviv, calling for the same outcome. UNIFIL, the UN mission in Lebanon, claimed two Israeli tanks destroyed a gate and forcibly entered a base in the country\u2019s south. Five peacekeepers have been injured since Friday. A spokesperson for the UN secretary general said overnight that \u201cUNIFIL personnel and its premises must never be targeted. Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law, including international humanitarian law. They may constitute a war crime.\u201d Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in a statement to Guardian Australia, said it was \u201cdeeply concerned by the escalation of conflict between Israel, Hizballah and Iran.\u201d \u201cWe condemn Hizballah\u2019s recent drone strikes on Israel. We continue to call for a ceasefire and for all parties to show restraint, de-escalate and comply with UN security council resolutions,\u201d a Dfat spokesperson said. \u201cWe have made clear to Israel that any targeting or intimidation of UN personnel and facilities in Lebanon is unacceptable and must cease.\u201d The foreign minister, Penny Wong, said on X on Friday: We reiterate our strong support for the essential role played by UNIFIL in upholding regional peace. The Australian Defence Force has deployed 12 personnel to the UN Truce Supervision Organisation, whose activities are spread across Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The government does not comment on how many are in each specific country. A defence department spokesperson said \u201call personnel assigned to the Middle East region are safe and accounted for.\u201d They added: The Australian Defence Force continually revises force protection measures for its personnel deployed across the Middle East region. For operational security reasons, Defence does not comment on the nature of force protection measures. A look ahead to tomorrow\u2019s weather in New South Wales, where unsettled weather is forecast \u2013 and to the national picture, which is more mixed. Here are the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s latest updates: Man dies after being swept off rocks A man has died near Coffs Harbour on New South Wales\u2019 mid-north coast today, NSW Police said. Emergency services were called to Broom Head lookout, south of Yamba, at about 12:30pm after reports a man was washed into the water. Police said the man was found unresponsive and could not be revived despite the efforts of emergency crews and witnesses. He is believed to be in his mid-50s and has not yet been formally identified. A crime scene has been established as police investigate the incident. A report is being prepared for the coroner. Albanese condemns Coalition nuclear plan in Queensland election campaign The prime minister has lent his weight to Queensland premier Steven Miles\u2019 campaign as the state\u2019s election race unfolds. Speaking about the Coalition\u2019s plans to build nuclear power stations in Australia, Anthony Albanese said: What I certainly hope is that Steven Miles is elected premier of Queensland, and that\u2019s what I want to see happen, because that\u2019s a way of making sure that this nuclear fantasy, which is completely un-costed and they won\u2019t say where it will be \u2026 One of the spots is in Newcastle, that in recent months has had a fair bit of activity under the ground. I mean, you don\u2019t build a nuclear power station in an area that has been subject to a major earthquake in Australia, in Newcastle, where many people lost their lives and which has seen recent seismic activity as well. They don\u2019t have a proper plan here. Man found dead south of Brisbane A 32-year-old woman is assisting police with their investigations after a man was found dead in a home in Browns Plains, south of Brisbane, this morning. At around midday, emergency services were called to a Basie Court address after a 72-year-old man was found unconscious and not breathing, Queensland Police said. He was declared dead at the scene. It is believed the man and woman were known to each other, police said. A crime scene has been established while police investigate the circumstances surrounding the man\u2019s death. Over to Afternoon Briefing, where MP Peter Khalil has detailed the alleged criminal damage to his office overnight. The site is still an active crime scene. The Labor MP is, in the words of the ABC\u2019s Greg Jennett, the Prime Minister\u2019s hand-picked special envoy for social cohesion. Khalil said the alleged vandalism was \u201cunacceptable under the law and morally repugnant as well.\u201d No-one should have to go to their place at work and face this kind of actions, the people that live here should not face this at all. It\u2019s completely unacceptable morally and legally and needs to be called out. I will defend Australians\u2019 rights to disagree, to have differences. The vast majority of protest, whether it be on any issue, has been peaceful. Forms of violence, including threats, vandalism, attacking people based on their identity or background, were unacceptable, both legally and morally, he said. I\u2019m somewhat exasperated by those who think it is OK to do this. It puts people in danger, my staff in danger. Staff who work around the clock to help people and give them a better life \u2026it\u2019s also shutting down the office and not allowing us to process the work around visas. He said the action had forced him to shut the office, disrupting visa processing, preventing him from meeting refugees and asylum seekers today and \u201cputting a stop on democratic practice and it needs to be called out through the law.\u201d Nine Entertainment\u2019s communications chief Victoria Buchan will leave the company at the end of November, becoming the third executive to depart in a tumultuous year in which allegations of predatory behaviour in newsrooms were aired. Buchan follows chief executive Mike Sneesby and news director Darren Wick out the door ahead of the release of an independent review of the culture of its newsrooms. Nine has acknowledged \u201calleged inappropriate behaviour and broader cultural issues\u201d in its television newsrooms. Acting chief executive officer Matt Stanton said during her 15 years Buchan made a significant contribution to the company, working with Sneesby and former leaders David Gyngell and Hugh Marks and managing the successful merger with Fairfax. \u201cWhile this year has been more challenging than most, I\u2019ve enjoyed the ride since joining Nine back in 2010,\u201d Buchan said in an email to staff. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way since those days. I\u2019m looking forward to some family time over the summer and then getting stuck back into some projects or opportunities to work in the industry I love and know so well.\u201d Pub company fined over underage gambling Australia\u2019s largest pubs operator will cough up $177,000 for repeatedly flouting underage gambling laws, AAP reports. An underage teenager was allowed to gamble on multiple occasions at five Melbourne pubs from September 2022 to October 2023, Victoria\u2019s gambling watchdog said. The Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group-run venues involved were the Albion Charles Hotel in Northcote, Cramers Hotel in Preston, Doncaster Hotel, Excelsior Hotel in Thomastown and Rose Shamrock &amp; Thistle Hotel. Separately, an eight-year-old child with an adult was not stopped from entering the poker machine area of Laverton\u2019s Westside Taverner, another venue operated by the company. The adult was spoken to by staff and asked to leave, before the incident was reported to the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission. The operator pleaded guilty to 24 charges in Melbourne magistrates court, which ordered it pay a $177,500 fine plus $45,000 in costs to the watchdog. All venues have a legal and social obligation to protect children from gambling, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, Annette Kimmitt, said. \u201cIt is well established that minors who gamble are more likely to experience severe harm from gambling as adults,\u201d she said in a statement on Monday. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for operators that flout the law, especially when children are involved.\u201d GP training aims to help bridge the city/country medicine gap GPs in the country need to be prepared for all sorts of scenarios their metropolitan counterparts may not necessarily face, including limb injuries from dangerous farm tools, poisoning, electrocution, quad bike rollovers and snake bites. This Wednesday GPs training in western NSW will receive training to better prepare for all these scenarios with an event run by the peak body for GPs (RACGP) and the Royal Flying Doctor Service south eastern section. Associate professor Kerrie Stewart from the RACGP hoped the event would help trainees \u2013 some of whom had never been on a farm before \u2013 better understand injuries and health issues unique to rural areas. The Royal Flying Doctor Service chief medical officer, Dr Shannon Nott, said standard GP training doesn\u2019t always prepare trainees for the \u201creal difference between medicine in the bush and metro communities\u201d. The Bureau of Meteorology was spot-on with its earlier predictions of thunderstorms for parts of New South Wales this afternoon. As thunder rumbled over Sydney, the bureau issued another alert, warning of severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall in Sydney\u2019s metropolitan area and parts of Hunter, Illawarra, Central Tablelands, Southern Tablelands and South West Slopes forecast districts. Flash flooding may affect Sydney\u2019s city centre and east. The SES is on alert. Thanks for joining me on today\u2019s blog, I\u2019ll handover to Daisy Dumas who will continue bringing you the latest this afternoon. Take care and have a great evening. Here\u2019s the full story from Adeshola Ore on the alleged vandalism of Labor MP Peter Khalil\u2019s Melbourne office: NSW may look to other states\u2019 bans on Nazi salutes in a quest to remove any ambiguity in laws that ban the display of related hate symbols in public, AAP reports. About 50 people attended a white supremacist rally in the small Murray River town of Corowa on Saturday, sparking calls for NSW to join other states in explicitly banning the Nazi salute. It is a criminal offence in NSW to knowingly display a Nazi symbol in public without a reasonable excuse. The state does not have a specific ban on gestures such as the heil Hitler salute, although people have successfully been prosecuted over the act. Premier Chris Minns said he believed the Nazi salute was covered by existing laws but vowed to strengthen them if necessary: If there\u2019s any ambiguity, we will straighten it out, because I\u2019m not going to allow racism, anti-Semitism, or some kind of remembrance of this horrific period in human history. Minns said the conduct of people at the rally, which featured a neo-Nazi banner, was \u201ccompletely obnoxious.\u201d I think the people who participated in those rallies have brought shame on themselves and their families. This is not a reflection on the vast majority of people that live in NSW, who are committed to anti-racism. No arrests were made at the rally but investigations continued, police said yesterday. The New South Wales RFS says storms are beginning across parts of the state, sharing this video from Picton in the Southern Highlands this afternoon: Earlier, the Bureau of Meteorology said there would be an \u201coutbreak\u201d of showers and thunderstorms across much of eastern Australia from today until Wednesday \u2013 particularly for parts of central and southern NSW. PM expected to join campaign trail on first day of voting in Queensland election Anthony Albanese is expected to join premier Steven Miles in a joint press conference this afternoon, as polls open for the Queensland state election. Miles told the Guardian that, if reelected, he\u2019d execute the provisions of the state\u2019s nuclear ban legislation to call a plebiscite on the federal opposition\u2019s power plan. He speculated that it might take place at the next federal election, to save people voting twice. Queensland is the LNP\u2019s strongest state holding 21 of 30 lower house electorates. The prime minister and Miles \u2013 both of Labor\u2019s left faction \u2013 are reportedly close friends. Albanese launched his successful campaign for the seat of Mount Coot-tha in 2015, his first successful run for office. Miles started the day spruiking yet another cost of living promise, free school breakfasts for every student at a state school in Queensland. He held a panel discussion with experts on the policy at the Queensland University of Technology. The first Queenslanders cast their ballots at 8am this morning, with polls open until 6pm on Saturday, 26 October. NSW premier looking forward to welcoming King Charles to state The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, is looking forward to welcoming King Charles to the state later this week. Minns said there would be \u201clots of community activity and lots of engagement with the public\u201d. Speaking on Monday, Minns said: Whether you\u2019re a republican or a royalist, whether you want change or not, he\u2019s a visitor to our country, he\u2019s our head of state and he\u2019ll be warmly received. Minns added that while he was personally a republican, that NSW would \u201croll out the red carpet for him, make sure that he feels welcomed\u201d. Greens leader condemns alleged vandalism of Khalil\u2019s office Leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said his party condemns the alleged vandalism of Labor MP Peter Khalil\u2019s office. Bandt wrote on X that protests \u201cmust always be peaceful and non-violent.\u201d Everyone should feel safe at work, and we wish Peter Khalil and his team well after this [alleged] vandalism overnight. Tickets for 90s rock band Oasis for the 2025 reunion tour went on pre-sale for fans at midday for Sydney and Melbourne shows in October. Unlike much of the controversy in the United Kingdom, there isn\u2019t dynamic pricing on the tickets in Australia, meaning demand has not pushed up the prices as it did with Green Day last month. Punters can expect to pay between $183.28 to $407.57 plus a $9.90 handling fee for the Melbourne show, while for the Sydney show, prices are between $187.39 and $411.67 plus an $8.95 handling fee. The Sydney price includes public transport to and from the event. Photos of alleged vandalism to Peter Khalil\u2019s office Labor MP Peter Khalil\u2019s office has provided these photos of the alleged vandalism to his electorate office in Melbourne: Red paint can be seen thrown across the building\u2019s signage and walls. One graffiti tag reads \u201cland back\u201d, and another reads \u201cglory to the martyrs\u201d. An inverted red triangle can also be seen spray painted on the building. Victorian Labor MP Peter Khalil has told Guardian Australia about the alleged vandalism at his Melbourne electorate office. He said his staff had arrived at work on Monday morning to find the office vandalised. He said this included an inverted red triangle, a symbol used by Hamas to denote Israeli military targets, spray painted on the building. His staff also noticed an unknown substance had been pumped into the office via a hole that was drilled in: The stench was so unbearable that staff immediately closed the door, and five hours later still feel overwhelmed and sick from the intensity. This behaviour is unacceptable. I have always supported peaceful protest as a fundamental part of our democratic society. But when that behaviour escalates into actions that harm people, as it has today, then that is not protest. That is unacceptable both under the law and morally, and it needs to be called out. Khalil said his staff had a right to be safe at work and reiterated his support of peaceful protests. Liberal senator says \u2018targeting\u2019 of Peter Khalil\u2019s office \u2018totally unacceptable\u2019 Liberal senator and shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, says the \u201ccontinued targeting\u201d of Labor MP Peter Khalil\u2019s electorate office and staff is \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d As we flagged just earlier, police said paint was sprayed on the MPs electorate office in Melbourne, and alleged offenders poured an unknown liquid through the door. Paterson wrote on X: The perpetrators of this intimidating and dangerous behaviour must feel the full force of the law. \u2018Outbreak\u2019 of showers and thunderstorms across eastern Australia this week The Bureau of Meteorology says there will be an \u201coutbreak\u201d of showers and thunderstorms across much of eastern Australia from today until Wednesday \u2013 particularly for parts of central and southern NSW. Tasmanian Police deploy drones to \u2018hooning hotspots\u2019 Tasmanian Police have charged two people for dangerous driving after they were monitored by police drones and then arrested by officers. Sergeant Andy McShane said police deployed drones to Rose Bay and Montagu Bay \u201cto covertly monitor known hooning hotspots, and detect and remove unsafe motorists from the roads\u201d. A 17-year-old motorcycle rider with a learner licence was allegedly detected dangerously conducting a burnout and high-speed wheel-stand, police said, and will appear in court this month for serious traffic offences. An 18-year-old driver was also found allegedly dangerously conducting a prolonged burnout. Police said his vehicle has been clamped for a month, and he will appear in court on summons for several driving related charges. McShane said it is \u201cpleasing to see that drones are assisting police to detect and remove unsafe motorists from our roads\u201d and that police will \u201ccontinue to deploy drones across the state, to assist in investigations, and detect and deter unsafe motorists and those who commit anti-social behaviours.\u201d Justice Wendy Abraham has reserved her decision on whether to make Bruce Lehrmann pay a $200,000 surety ahead of an appeal. Before the closure of proceedings in the federal court Lehrmann\u2019s lawyer Zali Burrows said Lehrmann was on Centrelink payments, was unemployable and had no possibility of paying the surety. Mr Lehrmann is arguably, probably, Australia\u2019s most hated man. You cannot imagine the worst type of defamation against someone [other than] being called a rapist. The only shot he\u2019d probably ever have in making money is by going on Only Fans or something silly like that. But other than that, they know that he cannot come up with this. Police issue warning over \u2018romance scams\u2019 after woman loses $200k Cairns police have issued a warning about \u201cromance scams\u201d, after a 60-year-old woman lost $200,000 to a scammer who established an online connection with her. Police said that \u201cromance scams\u201d typically begin with a scammer sending an unsolicited request or message through social media via a fake profile, that can appear genuine. The scammer might encourage communication on a different platform and build a story over time \u2013 such as being deployed overseas and unable to access their own funds. Detective acting inspector Cindy Searle said scammers aim to manipulate victims by establishing trust before requesting money. She said victims of romance scams \u201care not at fault\u201d, and the people behind them are \u201cwell practised\u201d. A scammer may ask you to send money. They may ask you to send cash in packages, make an online transfer either in cryptocurrency or funds, or even open accounts they can access. Before making any transactions think about what you really know about the person. If you have not met them in person, you can\u2019t be sure they are who they say they are. Aussie shares hit two-week high, creep towards record The local share market has gained ground, AAP reports, hitting its highest level in two weeks and creeping towards another all-time high. At midday AEDT the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 22.8 points, or 0.28%, to 8,237.3, while the broader All Ordinaries was up 22.5 points, or 0.26%, to 8,514.0. Five of the ASX\u2019s 11 sectors were higher and five were lower, with consumer staples basically flat. The heavyweight mining sector was up 1.1%, with BHP up 0.9%, Fortescue climbing 2.3% and Rio Tinto adding 1.7%. All of the big four banks were higher as well, with CBA up 0.6%, ANZ adding 0.7%, Westpac climbing 0.5%, and NAB rising 0.3%. WEB Travel Group \u2013 formerly known as Webjet Limited \u2013 had plunged 31.7% to a nearly two-year low of $4.80 after the business-to-business marketplace for the travel trade downgraded guidance provided just a month and a half ago. Seek was up 1.4% to $25.32 as the job-search platform said it had entered into exclusive talks to acquire Xref, an ASX-listed HR and recruitment tech company. Xref shares soared 55.7% to 21 cents, not far from Seek\u2019s tentative figure of 21.8 cents. The Australian dollar was buying 67.32 US cents, from 67.41 US cents at Friday\u2019s ASX close. Victoria Police is investigating alleged criminal damage to Labor MP Peter Khalil\u2019s office in Brunswick. In a statement, police said paint was sprayed on the Sydney Road building and a door was damaged between 2am and 9am this morning. Police said the alleged offenders poured an unknown liquid through the door, and no one was inside at the time. According to the ABC red paint was used, with \u201cland back\u201d and \u201cglory to the martyrs\u201d written along the walls. Khalil, who is the government\u2019s special envoy for social cohesion, told the ABC it \u201csmells like an abattoir and it\u2019s hard to breathe near by it\u201d. Police said anyone with information or CCTV is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Queensland Labor begins day with panel discussion on school lunches policy Queensland premier Steven Miles has started the first week of voting with a panel discussion with experts on Labor\u2019s free school lunch policy. He was joined by education minister Di Farmer, QUT expert Danieele Gallegos, as well as Justine Caine from Diabetes Australia, Diona Maxwell from First Bit and FareShare, and Mica Projects CEO Jaryn Walsh. There were few additional details of the policy announced, but Miles and Farmer defended the policy against claims the money would be better spent filling a gap in Commonwealth funding of the state school system. Miles said: We think we can do both, but we also think this is important to core education outcomes. And there\u2019s a lot of evidence that says that. There is currently a disagreement between the states and the Australian government what their share should be ... we want to see the Australian government contribute. Miles said he\u2019d been developing the policy virtually the entire 10 months he spent as premier. The policy assumes an uptake of about 76%. So that assumes that most families will take it up every day, but some might optimally have it one or two days a week. Vocus to acquire TPG\u2019s fibre network assets for $5.25b Vocus Group has agreed to buy the fixed-line fibre networks from TPG Telecom for $5.25bn, AAP reports. The acquisition will almost double Vocus\u2019s fibre network, to more than 50,000km of owned or leased fibre connecting close to 20,000 buildings across capital cities. The deal includes a submarine cable from Sydney to Guam along with TGP\u2019s wholesale residential broadband assets, which includes fibre in major capital cities, plus Ballarat, Mildura, and Geelong. TPG \u2013 whose brands include Vodafone Australia, iiNet and Internode \u2013 expects the transaction to result in net cash proceeds of $4.65bn to $4.75bn, money it will use on yet-to-be-determined business investments. Under the deal, Vocus has agreed to supply network services to TPG for at least 15 years at a fixed fee of $130m a year. TPG shares were down 0.9% to $5.045 late this morning. Vocus used to be listed on the ASX but was taken private by Macquarie Asset Management and Aware Super in 2021. Collins Street welcomes baby seagulls, giving falcons a run for their money A duo of baby seagulls on Collins Street in Melbourne are giving the famed peregrine falcons a run for their money. Two peregrine falcon chicks hatched on top of 367 Collins Street earlier this month, witnessed by more than 1,000 viewers on the building\u2019s rolling live feed. As Caitlin Cassidy reports, peregrine falcons have treated the ledge as home for more than three decades, but cameras, and the mundanity of Covid-19 lockdowns, made them a social media phenomenon. But now, the Environment Protection Authority of Victoria has shared images of two baby seagulls just nearby, near its training rooms at 664 Collins Street. The EPA wrote on X: Move over 367 Peregrine Falcons. We have our very own seagulls! Greens accuse Queensland Labor of adopting \u2018numerous Greens policies\u2019 The Greens MP for Brisbane, Stephen Bates, has accused the state Labor government of adopting \u201cnumerous Greens policies\u201d or floating them in the media. He said this \u201cshows the power that comes from threatening the two party system\u201d, with Labor\u2019s free school meals policy \u201ca prime example of this\u201d. Bates wrote on X: When debating a universal school meals program, then education minister Grace Grace in 2021 said, \u201cThe Greens have not one skerrick of evidence to suggest that this affects children in schools today.\u201d Flash forward and now it\u2019s a Labor election policy. The longer the two party system reigns, the worse outcomes we get, and the realm of what\u2019s possible continues to shrink. The continuing and cementing existence (and political threat) of The Greens in QLD politics has already shifted the Overton window. This comes as the Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather also accused Labor of stealing a number of Greens policies, including 50 cent fares, an electricity retailer and the free school lunches. As Andrew Messenger reported, premier Steven Miles warded off allegations of plagiarism at yesterday\u2019s election campaign launch: Greens senator pushes for First Nations truth and justice commission The Greens senator Dorinda Cox says it is important governments don\u2019t \u201cwalk away from First Nations justice\u201d on the one-year anniversary of the voice referendum. In a post to X, she said it had been \u201ca difficult year for First Nations communities\u201d and that \u201cmany are looking for action and want to see a renewed focus on implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart\u201d. The Greens have a bill before Parliament right now to establish a Truth [and] Justice Commission, which we need to progress to get to Treaty. We are the only Commonwealth nation without a Treaty with its First Peoples. This was Labor\u2019s election promise, they mustn\u2019t break it. The Greens will keep fighting for First Nations Justice both in [and] out of Parliament. Minority Liberal premier backs embattled deputy Tasmania\u2019s Liberal premier has thrown his support behind his under-fire right-hand man who appears set to be forced out of cabinet by parliament, AAP reports. The deputy premier and treasurer Michael Ferguson has copped increasing heat over the bungled roll-out of two new Bass Strait ferries, prompting him to drop the infrastructure portfolio in August. The yet-to-be-delivered $900m Spirit of Tasmania ships are over budget, behind schedule and new wharfs for the vessels won\u2019t be ready for their arrival. The state\u2019s Labor opposition has flagged moving a no-confidence motion in Ferguson when parliament resumes tomorrow. Independents David O\u2019Byrne and Kristie Johnston, and the Jacqui Lambie Network\u2019s Andrew Jenner, have said they\u2019d back a no-confidence motion. With Labor\u2019s 10 votes and five from the Greens, it means the motion would succeed. Under parliamentary convention, Ferguson would have to resign from cabinet or premier Jeremy Rockliff would have to send him to the backbench. Rockliff told reporters he had full confidence in Ferguson, but he would respect the will of parliament: He has already accepted responsibility for the Spirit of Tasmania situation when he relinquished his responsibility as infrastructure minister. [But] should there be a no-confidence passed ... then Mr Ferguson will be resigning and then going to the backbench. Bruce Lehrmann\u2019s lawyer has told the court he has not been served a bankruptcy notice, although one was attempted on his mother. The statement contradicts an earlier claim by Matt Collins KC for Network Ten, that Lehrmann was served with a bankruptcy notice on 8 August. The court has adjourned while Lehrmann\u2019s lawyer, Zali Burrows, reads Ten\u2019s submissions on the bankruptcy notice. Before the break Sue Chrysanthou SC, for Lisa Wilkinson, said Lehrmann has \u201chad his day in court\u201d and should not be given a second chance: He came to this court by choice. He came here pleading his first imputation as one of rape. He did so having escaped the criminal process. He chose to enter the fray. He walked over the line and asked this court, knowing the likelihood that my client in Network Ten would plead truth; he made that decision, and that\u2019s a factor against the arguments that he would make on public interest. Thunderstorm warnings in NSW The Bureau of Meteorology is warning New South Wales residents that severe thunderstorms are likely from this afternoon and over the next few days. The affected areas may experience damaging wind, heavy rain and hail: Warning sounded on inevitable bird flu pandemic It\u2019s a case of when, not if, a deadly bird flu pandemic arrives in Australia, the country\u2019s top medical expert is warning. As AAP reports, chief medical officer Paul Kelly says Australia is the only continent without the H5N1 strain, but it\u2019s coming. He told reporters in Canberra: It\u2019s really when, not if, this arrives, and we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the world, whilst there has been rather mild human disease so far, this virus is changing very quickly. This is about us getting ahead of the curve ... Australia does have a moat and we know how to use it, so the fact that we\u2019ve had time to actually see what\u2019s happening elsewhere is really important. Kelly reiterated a bird flu outbreak would not lead to human health issues, but would spread in the same way as other influenza viruses. The Albanese government has announced an extra $95m to prepare for the potential arrival of the strain in Australia. We have more details on this earlier in the blog here. Lehrmann was served bankruptcy notice in August, court told Bruce Lehrmann was served with a bankruptcy notice on 8 August, the federal court has heard. Network Ten has asked the court to make an order for security for costs ahead of the hearing of any appeal of the defamation finding. The former Liberal staffer lost the defamation case he brought against Ten and Lisa Wilkinson. The interlocutory hearing before Justice Wendy Abraham today is hearing from counsel for Lehrmann, Ten and Wilkinson on the matter of costs. Lehrmann is unemployed and has no apparent means to pay the lump sum cost order of $2m which Ten has been granted. Sue Chrysanthou SC, for Wilkinson, says Lehrmann\u2019s grounds for appeal that he was not given procedural fairness is not valid: And at no point, at no point was there any complaint about how we put the case, or that it took the appellant by surprise, or that it somehow departed from the pleadings, or that it somehow wasn\u2019t available on the pleadings. Seven Australian sailors graduate from US navy nuclear power school The first seven Royal Australian Navy sailors have graduated from the US navy nuclear power school, according to a statement from Defence. Vice-Admiral Mark Hammond, Australia\u2019s navy chief, said the sailors would now move on to the nuclear power training unit and this \u201ctakes [Australia] closer\u201d to operating a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (SSN) in the early 2030s, as part of Aukus. The nuclear power training unit \u201ctrains officers, enlisted sailors, and civilians for shipboard nuclear power plant operation and maintenance of surface ships and submarines\u201d in the US navy\u2019s nuclear fleet, Defence said. The director general of the Australian Submarine Agency, Vice-Admiral Jonathan Mead, said: We are well on our way to developing Australia\u2019s SSN capability. The secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, says she has \u201ctwo black belts\u201d, doesn\u2019t go out much and has had to change her routine due to security concerns \u2013 and this is the \u201cprice to pay\u201d for taking a stand against the CFMEU. Speaking on ABC RN earlier this morning, McManus was asked about concerns she expressed during her last interview on the program, and whether anything had changed? She said within the construction industry there are some people who have \u201cinfiltrated the union that are not good people\u201d: They are, at the moment, worried that their business model has been disrupted, and that doesn\u2019t make life great for those of us who are standing up to it. Asked if she has had to put on extra security, McManus said: I\u2019ve got two black belts \u2026 I don\u2019t go out much, I\u2019ve had to change my routines, I live between different places. That\u2019s life unfortunately at the moment, because we\u2019re standing up to those people, and there\u2019s a price to pay for that. McManus said police have been helpful, and \u201chopefully over time, that\u2019ll get better, but we\u2019re not walking away from what\u2019s got to happen\u201d. Australia\u2019s live performance industry reported record levels of attendance last year, in its first full year of operation without any Covid-19 disruptions or restrictions. The 2023 ticket attendance and revenue report from Live Performance Australia shows revenue was $3.1bn and ticketed attendance reached 30.1m \u2013 the highest recorded attendance and revenue since the report commenced in 2004. New South Wales accounted for the highest market share of revenue at 33.3% and tied with Victoria for the highest attendance (30.6%). The two states accounted for 64.7% of all live performance revenue and 61.2% of attendance. LPA\u2019s chief executive Evelyn Richardson said despite the strong results \u201cthere continues to be real pressures on many of our performing arts organisations\u201d. All categories are managing significant increases in their operating costs with limited scope to pass these on to audiences through higher ticket prices. For many, a \u2018full house\u2019 now means just breaking even, leaving little scope for reinvestment in new productions or rebuilding of financial reserves \u2026 Government needs to step up public investment in our small to medium not-for-profit and national performing arts organisations, as well as incentivise more private investment through LPA\u2019s proposal for a live theatre tax offset. Matt Collins KC, for Network Ten, says some of Bruce Lehrmann\u2019s appeal grounds are \u201cfaintly arguable\u201d but the first two are \u201chopeless\u201d. In an expanded appeal of his defamation loss, Lehrmann argues Justice Michael Lee should not have ruled that Network Ten had proven its substantial truth defence. The amended appeal reads: The justification case found had not been pleaded \u2026 had not been the subject of submissions \u2026 and had not been put to the relevant witnesses contrary to the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice. In an interlocutory hearing in the federal court today Collins has told Justice Wendy Abraham that \u201call of those propositions are wrong as a matter of fact\u201d. Lehrmann is not in court today for the hearing and has sent his apologies via his lawyer, Zali Burrows. Bruce Lehrmann not in court for appeal hearing Bruce Lehrmann is not in court today for an interlocutory hearing in his appeal and has sent his apologies via his lawyer, Zali Burrows: Your honour, I\u2019d like to mention Mr Lehrmann doesn\u2019t mean any disrespect by not being present today but he is watching the proceedings electronically. Appearing for Network Ten, Matt Collins KC has told the court the network\u2019s costs for the defamation case are estimated to be $3.1m and Ten sought and obtained a lump sum cost order in the sum of $2m. The former Liberal staffer lost the defamation case he brought against Ten and Lisa Wilkinson, with Lee finding last month that on the balance of probabilities Lehrmann raped Brittany Higgins on a minister\u2019s couch in Parliament House in 2019. He is appealing that decision and Network Ten is asking the former Liberal staffer to put up $200,000 in security for costs ahead of the appeal. Lehrmann has always denied the allegation and pleaded not guilty at the criminal trial of the matter which was aborted due to juror misconduct. Wilkie says government \u2018avoiding Indigenous issues\u2019 after voice referendum Independent federal MP Andrew Wilkie has claimed the Albanese government is \u201cavoiding Indigenous issues\u201d a year after the unsuccessful voice referendum, urging Labor to get \u201cback on the front foot\u201d in addressing yawning gaps in social indicators between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The Tasmanian politician said in a media statement this morning: It\u2019s been one year since the unsuccessful Voice Referendum and the federal government still seems to be avoiding Indigenous issues. Indeed according to the latest Productivity Commission report, only five of the 19 Closing the Gap targets are on track and some are even going backwards. There has been an abysmal lack of progress by a succession of Australian governments, with a range of policies and programs that have consistently failed Indigenous people and communities. The government has so far flagged no plans today to mark the one-year anniversary. There remain questions over whether Labor still remains true to its commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart and its agenda of voice, truth and treaty. Some Indigenous advocates for the voice referendum have since conceded that the failure of the vote has made that Uluru statement agenda very difficult or potentially impossible to realise. Wilkie continued: It\u2019s time for this government to get back on the front foot, listen to and empower First Nations people to make decisions about their lives and needs, and get serious about funding and delivering frontline services. Reconciliation Australia says referendum loss strengthened will to \u2018work harder and better\u2019 Twelve months on from the failed voice referendum, Reconciliation Australia says an opportunity to \u201creset\u201d the relationship between First Nations people and the Australian electorate was rejected. In a statement on the anniversary, Reconciliation Australia says the result caused disappointment and hurt for many in the Indigenous community and their supporters. A year ago the Australian electorate rejected an opportunity to advance reconciliation and reset relationships between the Australian state and First Nations peoples, On 14 October 2023 the Voice to Parliament referendum failed, causing disappointment and hurt in the hearts of First Nations people and their allies across the continent. Reconciliation Australia said while the campaign turned ugly at times, they are focusing on the millions who voted in favour: This was starkly illustrated in the ignorance and racism that characterised a large amount of the public discourse during that time. But it is also true that, despite a huge misinformation campaign, six million Australians voted yes. They said despite the loss they are strengthened in their will to \u201cwork harder and better\u201d for the reconciliation effort. Indigenous leaders remain confident Australia will enshrine an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice to parliament in the constitution, one year on from the referendum defeat. As AAP reports, the Indigenous campaigner Thomas Mayo \u2013 who was among the leading yes vote advocates \u2013 said constitutional change could still take place down the track, despite the defeat. He told ABC Radio: There\u2019s still a future that includes Indigenous people in the constitution. Sure, in reality it\u2019s not going to happen again for a while. We don\u2019t always get things right in a democracy. If we accepted the \u2018no\u2019 answers that we got about equal wages or about our right to vote as Indigenous people ... things would be worse today. Because more than 60% of young people voted \u2018yes\u2019 between 18 and 24, that tells me that we\u2019ve got a future, and what we tried to do last year will be achieved. Megan Davis, one of the architects of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, said once it became clear the referendum was unlikely to win public support, it should have been delayed. But Mayo said despite the polls, the government was right in pursuing the referendum: I don\u2019t think it was a mistake and the reason is because ... we would still be wondering if we didn\u2019t do it. We had to press on, because it might not have been another chance. Here\u2019s a look at the national weather forecasts across Australia\u2019s capital cities, from the Bureau of Meteorology: Woman charged after single vehicle crash left 14-year-old boy dead A woman has been charged following a single vehicle crash in western NSW yesterday that left a 14-year-old boy dead. About 8.30am yesterday, emergency services were called to the crash on Barrier Highway at Cubba, about 25km west of Cobar. Officers found a car had left the roadway and rolled. A passenger, a 14-year-old boy, was treated by paramedics but died at the scene. The driver, a 23-year-old woman, was uninjured and taken to Cobar District Hospital for mandatory testing. She was later taken to Cobar Police Station and charged with dangerous driving occasioning death, given conditional bail to appear before Cobar Local Court on 27 November. The Bruce Lehrmann case is back in court today as Network Ten asks the former Liberal staffer to put up $200,000 in security for costs ahead of the appeal. In May, Lehrmann was ordered to pay most of Ten\u2019s legal costs from his failed defamation suit because the court found he brought the case on a \u201cknowingly false premise\u201d. Lehrmann\u2019s lawyers will ask the court to delay the enforcement of costs order. Ten\u2019s application says Lehrmann is unemployed and without significant means to pay its costs and the network could be saddled with the bill. Last month Lehrmann was given extra time to refile the grounds of his appeal against his defamation trial loss to Network Ten and presenter Lisa Wilkinson, after he missed court-set deadlines. Lehrmann has widened his appeal grounds to argue Justice Michael Lee should not have ruled that Network Ten had proven its substantial truth defence. Lee said Lehrmann should pay almost all of Ten\u2019s and Wilkinson\u2019s costs on an indemnity basis, except when it came to the failed qualified privilege defence argument, where the network would receive regular costs. Justice Wendy Abraham will conduct the interlocutory hearing in the federal court in Sydney, and the proceedings will be live streamed on the federal court YouTube channel. The Coalition has taken the lead over Labor on a two-party-preferred basis in a Newspoll first since the Albanese government came to power, AAP reports. The Coalition is leading Labor 51-49, eight months out from the next election. The lead has been generated by a shift in preferences from minor parties, however, with voter support for the Coalition and Labor remaining unchanged from the previous poll in September. Albanese\u2019s approval ratings fell to the lowest level since becoming prime minister, suffering a three-point fall in his satisfaction rating to 40% and a three-point rise in dissatisfaction to 54%. His net negative approval ratings also dropped to minus 14, a point lower than his previous worst. The two party leaders are equal in their overall approval ratings, but Albanese\u2019s disapproval rating is higher than opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s \u2013 54% to his 52%. In the head-to-head contest over who would make a better prime minister, Dutton remained on 37%, but Albanese retained his lead at 45%, despite losing a point. Miles on Palaszczuk missing campaign launch: \u2018She was invited, but this was my campaign launch\u2019 Steven Miles was also asked why the former premier Annastacia Palaszczuk didn\u2019t attend the campaign launch yesterday. Miles said she was invited, as were \u201call of our former premiers\u2026 but they\u2019re all busy people and they have to make decisions\u201d. She was invited, but this was my campaign launch. I was there in my own right, and I\u2019m campaigning in this election to get a mandate to do the kinds of things that I have been outlining, things like expanding GP clinics, bulk-billing and free lunches for school kids. He was asked whether Palaszczuk has the \u201cirates with you?\u201d Miles said no, and \u201cI don\u2019t think you should read too much into it\u201d. This comes after another former premier Peter Beattie \u2013 who was in attendance \u2013 said it was sad Palaszczuk didn\u2019t give Miles more time to establish himself as premier. Miles responded to this: I\u2019ll leave the commentary to other people but I reckon I have given it a pretty good shake with the 10 months that I have had, and I\u2019m taking pretty comprehensive plan to this election that I hope Queenslanders will endorse \u2026 There\u2019s not much use thinking I can rewrite history. You know, what\u2019s happened has happened. I played the hand I have been dealt and I have worked pretty hard at it. Queensland premier says school lunch program will reduce stigma for kids without food The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, spoke with ABC News Breakfast this morning as early voting in the state election kicks off this morning. He spoke about the free school lunch plan he unveiled yesterday for state school students from prep to grade 6 \u2013 and said: I had so many teachers tell me that they bring extra food to work every day to feed kids who aren\u2019t sent to school with food. There\u2019s a real stigma around that for those kids and this will make sure that we can be confident every one of our primary school students is getting a decent nutritious lunch. Miles was asked about criticism from the Association of Principals, who said there would be logistical difficulties for remote schools not having tuck shop facilities to roll this out. The premier said it is at these remote schools the program is \u201cmost important\u201d. We have been building up towards this. We have been expanding our school lunch and breakfast programs, we have been appointing paid school food coordinators throughout the year. We have a lunchbox task force that has been helping us to expand those programs. Miles also hit back at economic concerns and said there is \u201cno evidence this will have an impact on inflation\u201d. Victoria police have confirmed a man was shot in the Melbourne CBD earlier this morning. As we flagged just earlier, a man was found injured near the intersection of Spencer and Lonsdale streets about 3.30am. Victoria police have now said it is believed the man sustained a suspected gunshot wound to the upper body. The 26-year-old Cairnlea man was taken to hospital with serious injuries. Jewish TV chef Ed Halmagyi says a threatening note was shoved under the door of his Sydney bakery yesterday. In a post to Instagram, he shared an image of the note \u2013 reading \u201cBe careful\u201d \u2013 and said this was \u201cBeing Jewish in Sydney, 2024 edition\u201d. The chef, better known as \u201cFast Ed\u201d, appeared on Better Homes and Gardens for 20 years and operates Avner\u2019s Bakery in Surry Hills. He wrote on Instagram: This note was shoved under the door of our bakery overnight. But the fact is, it\u2019s hard to be intimidated by inner-city middle-class Cosplay Radicals who graduated primary school without their pen licence. Police were called to the Bourke Street business about 3pm on Sunday, after becoming aware of offensive graffiti sprayed on the walls. The force said: Police have been told a man also received a written note containing an alleged threat when he arrived at the business the same morning. Police said they are investigating the incident and anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Spender backs calls for raising small business threshold to 25 workers The Independent MP Allegra Spender says she backs the calls from business to change the definition of small business to be up to 25 workers, up from 15. She said this would \u201cmake it easier for small and young businesses to grow\u201d and wrote on X: It\u2019s time to look at IR not through politics, but how it balances protections for workers with increasing wages through productivity. We need to look at models, such as in Denmark, that provide strong social safety nets as well as flexible working arrangements. And start by simplifying awards, getting the PC to assess the impact of IR on productivity, and increasing the rate of jobseeker. If you\u2019re just joining us \u2013 we\u2019ve covered the government response to these calls, as well as the opposition and union responses, earlier in the blog. Man allegedly assaulted and car stolen from Eastern Beaches home Police allege a man was assaulted before a car was stolen from a home in Sydney\u2019s Eastern Beaches overnight. About 11.10pm yesterday, a 65-year-old woman was approached by two men, who allegedly broke into a home at Matraville. One of the men allegedly assaulted a 70-year-old occupant, causing injuries to his head and hands, before the men allegedly drove away in a blue Subaru XV after taking keys. The 70-year-old man was treated by paramedics and taken to Prince of Wales Hospital in a stable condition. An investigation has been commenced, and anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Ley says white supremacists demonstrating in Corowa \u2018should be held accountable\u2019 Circling back to Sussan Ley\u2019s interview on ABC RN: She was asked about an incident in her electorate at the weekend, where police had to break up a group of white supremacists demonstrating in the town of Corowa on the Murray River. Ley said she was \u201cappalled\u201d to see the group try to use Corowa as \u201cthe latest backdrop in that campaign to sow division and spread hate.\u201d Now they were rightly sent away, and they are rightly condemned \u2026 But I really want to say how proud I am of my community, because they\u2019ve \u2026 called these people out, they\u2019ve said to their face, \u2018just go away and get off the street\u2019. They use a small town to try to get a big national headline, and we don\u2019t want them back. Asked if anyone should have been arrested, Ley said police would be \u201clooking at any possible laws or breaches that these people have made, and they\u2019ll be tracking them down even now\u201d. They\u2019re hiding their identities. That\u2019s what they do, these isolated minorities. They need to be called out, found out, and if there\u2019s anything that they can be charged with, I know they will be. I want maximum pressure on these people. We cannot and we should not tolerate this sort of activity, but it was shocking \u2026 Ley said their words were \u201cpretty awful, and it shouldn\u2019t be repeated anywhere, and they should be held accountable\u201d. Police investigating after injured man found in Melbourne\u2019s CBD Victoria police are investigating after a man was found injured in Melbourne\u2019s CBD early this morning. Officers were called to the intersection of Spencer and Lonsdale streets about 3.30am where the man was found. He is yet to be formally identified, and was taken to hospital with serious injuries. 3AW reported that a section of Spencer Street was shut down, and Lonsdale Street closed eastbound, amid the investigation. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Sussan Ley won\u2019t confirm if Coalition supports change to definition of small business The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, was also asked about calls to change the definition of small business to include up to 25 workers, while speaking with ABC RN. She responded: I\u2019m not getting ahead of the discussion we will have in our party room and with colleagues about a range of matters to do with any piece of legislation. Watt had said the opposition was in favour of this change \u2013 are they? Ley repeated her previous answer: We will run this through our normal party room processes when legislation appears, not via conversations on breakfast radio. But there won\u2019t be legislation, host Patricia Karvelas said, as the government is against this. Does Ley think it is a good idea? She said she hopes the government looks at proposals from the Business Council and that \u201cthey do turn [it] into something that we consider seriously through the parliament.\u201d ACTU secretary says it\u2019s \u2018wrong in principle\u2019 to have different workers\u2019 rights depending on size of business The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, has been speaking with ABC RN about the call to raise the definition of small business from 15 to 25 employees, as we just flagged just earlier. Asked if she would campaign for any increase, even if it was up to 20 from the current 15, she responded that the union \u201calready, on principle, [doesn\u2019t] like the fact that there are two sets of rights for workers just depending on how big your workplace happens to be\u201d. We just think that\u2019s wrong in principle. It\u2019s been the case for quite a while now that there have been these small business exemptions, and it\u2019s not been some big thing we\u2019ve campaigned about. But I\u2019ve got to tell you, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s right in principle, and it\u2019s sort of a dodgy way of being able to take rights off workers by saying, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just going to increase the limit for small business\u2019, because it just means that all of those workers just lose rights \u2013 and you can do so, and make it sound like you\u2019re being fair. Price says yes campaigners need to \u2018let go\u2019 and \u2018accept result\u2019 of Voice referendum Jacinta Nampijinpa Price was also asked about comments from yes advocate and Uluru Statement from the Heart architect Megan Davis, that there is still a lot of grieving amongst Indigenous Australians. Price said \u201cit\u2019s no surprise that there\u2019s still grieving taking place\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s not what I\u2019ve picked up\u201d. She argued that yes campaigners need to \u201clet go\u201d and \u201caccept the result\u201d. \u2026 because Australia has made that determination, and move forward, because there are marginalised Indigenous Australians whose lives need to be impacted in a positive way right now. Jacinta Nampijinpa Price on Voice referendum, one year on The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, was on ABC News Breakfast earlier on the first anniversary of the Voice referendum. Price was a leading no vote advocate, arguing at the time there were better ways to improve the plight of Indigenous Australians. 12 months on, can she point to any alternative methods that have succeeded? She argued the Albanese government hasn\u2019t \u201cimplemented any methods to improve the circumstances or change the things on the ground.\u201d We have been calling for an inquiry into statutory authorities for the last 18 months, which we believe need to be looked at closely because of their failures to ... well, not all statutory authorities, but some, in terms of their failures of how they\u2019re supposed to serve the interests of those that they are supposed to represent. And this has been ongoing now and something that the Albanese Government has continued to ignore. But those voices \u2013 especially of Traditional Owners \u2013 that I have been speaking to, are growing louder, with more concern. And, really, there is a need to fix the structures that currently exist, and it begins with an inquiry. Murray Watt on the government\u2019s review of workplace relations laws Murray Watt was asked about calls from employers to change the definition of small business from 15 to 25 employees \u2013 will he do it? \u201cNo, we won\u2019t,\u201d he said, arguing this would \u201cmake it easier for small and medium sized businesses to be able to unfairly sack workers\u201d by losing their unfair dismissal rights. There\u2019s no evidence at all that current laws led by the Albanese government are stifling businesses from employing people. In fact, we\u2019ve actually created nearly 1 million jobs since coming to office a bit over two years ago \u2026 So unfortunately, for some of the leading business groups calling for this, the evidence of what\u2019s going on in the economy just doesn\u2019t back up their wish list. The business community also wants the government to revisit multi-employer bargaining and same job, same pay legislation \u2013 will the government\u2019s review of workplace relations laws look at this? He argued the laws already introduced by the government \u201chave actually delivered exactly what we said they would \u2013 higher pay, more secure jobs, reducing the gender pay gap, delivering safer workplaces and more equality in the workplace\u201d. Watt also said the government was \u201cvery willing to have industrial relations as a key battleground for the next election\u201d. The employment and workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, spoke with ABC RN earlier and was asked about the voice referendum, one year on. He recognised today was \u201cgoing to be a pretty painful day for First Nations Australians\u201d and said there were \u201ca lot of hopes invested\u201d in the voice proposal. One of the lessons that we took is that it\u2019s really pretty much impossible to undertake constitutional reform in this country without bipartisan support. We saw that,w prior to Peter Dutton and the Coalition opposing the voice, support for the voice was actually quite high, and that whittled away as soon as we saw the opposition take a position against it. Host Patricia Karvelas asked why the government didn\u2019t go to Indigenous leaders and say, \u201cwe don\u2019t think we can win this\u201d, when the polls were showing a defeat? Watt said the PM and the government as a whole wanted the proposal to be led by First Nations people, and \u201cwe didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to ignore their wishes, either at the beginning of the campaign or as the campaign went on\u201d. We see a lot of criticism of the government and the prime minister lately about not taking enough hard decisions and not being bold enough. This was a pretty bold thing to do, and it demonstrated the conviction of the prime minister and the conviction of the government that we were prepared to take on a difficult issue and see it through to the end. Watts said the government \u201cdeserve[s] points for having had the guts to see it through, especially given that was the position of First Nations leaders\u201d. The Independent Education Union of Australia\u2019s NSW branch says it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the state independent MP Alex Greenwich dropping protections for LGBTQ+ teachers, school staff and students from his equality bill \u2013 before cabinet today. The union said that currently, non-government school employers can discriminate against school staff by terminating their employment because of their sexual orientation or transgender status \u2013 and expel students for the same reason. Greenwich was reported in yesterday\u2019s Sun Herald as dropping proposed protections for school staff pending a review of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 by the NSW Law Reform Commission. But branch secretary Carol Matthews says there are \u201cno guarantees this long-running review will recommend protections for teachers and school staff in faith-based schools.\u201d Nor is there any guarantee the NSW government will legislate recommendations arising from the review \u2026 School employers have nothing to fear from modern community standards \u2013 they can still thrive without the need to discriminate. Changes to the Act could still allow religious schools to build communities of faith central to their ethos and character. The union calls on Mr Greenwich to restore protections for LGBTQI+ school staff and students to his equality bill, and for the NSW government to implement full protections from all forms of discrimination in non-government schools. Gavan Reynolds to be sworn in as ABF commissioner The former head of defence intelligence Gavan Reynolds will be sworn in as the Australian Border Force commissioner next month. Reynolds said he would work closely with the government: It is a privilege to lead the Australian Border Force and the dedicated people protecting the national asset that is our border. I look forward to working closely with the Department of Home Affairs and across Government to deliver prosperity, security and unity for Australia. Reynolds spent his 40-year career with the Australian Defence Force (ADF), serving in roles including the Australian Military Representative to NATO and the European Union, senior positions within the ADF and a deployment to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force. He will take over from Michael Outram, who retires on 9 November. A previous version of this post said Gavan Reynolds had already been sworn in. He will be sworn in on 10 November. The new Administrative Review Tribunal opens The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, will attend the inaugural ceremonial sitting of the new Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) today. The ART will replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in a major reform to Australian administrative law after concerns that the previous scheme had become inaccessible and unfair. Dreyfus described the moment as \u201cthe most significant reform to Australia\u2019s system of administrative review in decades\u201d that will help \u201crestore confidence in government.\u201d The new ART will be efficient, accessible, independent and fair for the tens of thousands of people every year who seek independent review of government decisions, such as whether they qualify for an age pension, are compensated for an injury they suffered while serving their nation or receive NDIS funding for essential support. The Labor government previously accused the former Coalition government of stacking the AAT with supporters in a way that was undermining the institution, particularly in the wake of scandals such as the robodebt fiasco. The long-awaited revamp to the process, which allows Australian\u2019s to seek review of government decisions, has been in the works since Labor took office. A key feature of the new ART is a \u201ctransparent and merit-based selection process\u201d for the appointment of members. Among the reforms are a demand-driven funding model, greater harmonisation across different case types, mechanisms to escalate issues of significance and a new case-management system. Staff who worked with the previous AAT have also been transferred to the new ART, along with all existing matters. The Australian Republican Movement (ARM) is launching a tongue-in-cheek media campaign ahead of King Charles\u2019 visit to Australia, branding it the \u201cfarewell tour\u201d of the British monarchy \u2013 claiming it is \u201ctime to give the royal wave goodbye.\u201d Charles and Queen Camilla will visit Australia from 18 to 23 October, with stops in Sydney and Canberra. The ARM points out it\u2019s the first visit from a monarch in more than a decade, and say it\u2019s time to \u201cchange the conversation\u201d about the royals. The unsuccessful Indigenous voice referendum, coincidentally a year ago today (14 October), has stalled momentum for potential constitutional change that would be needed for an Australian republic. The Labor government recently dropped its ministerial portfolio focused on the republic, and political observers theorise it will be some time before a future government proposes another referendum. But the ARM is preparing to use Charles\u2019s visit to draw attention to the republican push again. Their campaign is titled \u201cmonarchy: the Farewell Oz tour\u201d, branded like the final tour of a rock band, with T-shirts and posters printed. Think Elton\u2019s Yellow Brick Road Tour and Farnham\u2019s The Last Time. It\u2019s time to Wave Goodbye to Royal Reign with Monarchy: The Farewell Oz Tour! The group points to their own research showing 92% of Australians are open to becoming a republic, and that 60% of Australians say they\u2019d prefer an Australian head of state to King Charles. It\u2019s time for Australia to say \u2018thanks, but we\u2019ve got it from here\u2019. Expect to see big names leading our new conversation all over Australia as we wave goodbye to royal reign. Environment advocates welcome funding boost for bird flu preparation Work by Wildlife Health Australia more than a year ago warned the consequences of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in native birds could be catastrophic. Environment organisations have been calling for additional funding for preparedness for the disease in wildlife for many months. The announcement (see previous post) comes ahead of a meeting later this week of federal, state and territory environment and agriculture ministers to discuss preparedness for the deadly strain. The Invasive Species Council\u2019s advocacy director Jack Gough welcomed the extra funding: This is incredible news. The Albanese government is finally investing a serious amount into preparation for what could be the worst environmental disaster in Australia\u2019s history. This level of funding will allow departments to get on with the job of properly preparing to save wildlife and stop extinctions if the deadly bird flu hits our shores. We will not be able to stop this disease from arriving but we know that vaccination, carcass removal and stopping disturbance can reduce death rates and save species like Tassie devils, sea lions and black swans. The Albanese government has announced an extra $95m to prepare for the potential arrival of a deadly strain of bird flu that has been catastrophic for wildlife globally. Australia is the only continent that remains free of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza but the chance it will be detected increases during spring with the arrival of migratory shorebirds. The rapid global spread of the strain has caused mass deaths of wild birds and some mammal species and had significant impacts for industries such as poultry. The government is committing an extra $37m for initiatives to protect agriculture, including $15m to increase biosecurity response capability and surveillance and $10m for nationally coordinated communications to ensure communities are informed and protected. The new investment also includes a major increase in funding of $35.9m for environmental measures to \u201caccelerate protective action for threatened species and priority biodiversity\u201d. A further $22.1m is for strengthening public health preparedness. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said: I am particularly concerned about the potential impact on species already at risk of extinction and not well placed to cope with significant mortalities. This includes marine mammals such as the endangered Australian sea lion, and sea birds like the Christmas Island frigatebird, which has only one breeding site. Good morning and welcome back to a new week on the Australia news live blog. I\u2019m Emily Wind and I\u2019ll be taking you through our live coverage for most of today. The Albanese government has announced an extra $95m to prepare for the potential arrival of a deadly strain of bird flu that has been catastrophic for wildlife globally. Australia is the only continent that remains free of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza, but the chance it will be detected increases during spring with the arrival of migratory shorebirds. We\u2019ll have more on this from Lisa Cox in a moment. The Australian Republican Movement is launching a tongue-in-cheek media campaign ahead of King Charles\u2019s visit to Australia \u2013 from 18 to 23 October \u2013 branding it the \u201cfarewell tour\u201d of the British monarchy. The movement is preparing to use Charles\u2019s visit to draw attention to the republican push with a campaign titled \u201cmonarchy: the Farewell Oz tour\u201d, branded like the final tour of a rock band with T-shirts and posters printed.

      "body": "<p>In 2021, the renowned French author Annie Ernaux published <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/exteriors-winner-of-the-2022-nobel-prize-in-literature-9781913097684/\">Exteriors</a></em>, a random selection of journal entries written while she lived for a time in the Parisian suburb of Cergy-Pontoise. It stands apart from the books that have made her reputation as a fearless chronicler of her own life and relationships \u2013 the likes of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/simple-passion-winner-of-the-2022-nobel-prize-in-literature-9781804270554/\">Simple Passion</a></em> (1993), <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/happening-winner-of-the-2022-nobel-prize-in-literature-9781804270530/\">Happening</a></em> (2001) and <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-girls-story-winner-of-the-2022-nobel-prize-in-literature-9781913097158/\">A Girl\u2019s Story</a></em> (2020) \u2013 eschewing the unflinchingly intimate and semi-autobiographical approach that helped earn her the Nobel prize in literature in 2022. Instead, as its name suggests, <em>Exteriors</em> is detached and outward-looking. Her aim, she said, was to \u201cdescribe reality as through the eyes of a photographer and to perceive the mystery and opacity of the lives I encountered\u201d.</p> <p>Despite its oddly academic-sounding title, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-use-of-photography-9781804271148/\">The Use of Photography</a></em> \u2013 note the singular \u2013 bears little relation to its predecessor, being a return to the intensely personal style for which Ernaux is revered. The difference here is that, although the lens is once again turned on herself, her reflections \u2013 on desire, illness, memory and encroaching mortality as well as photography \u2013 are juxtaposed with those of her former lover Marc Marie, a journalist and photographer with whom she had a prolonged and passionate love affair in 2003. Rather than dilute the intensity of her prose, their to-and-fro conversation somehow works.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Certain elements recur throughout: her fashionable mules, his unlaced work boots; her unfurled stockings, his crumpled denim jeans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The arc of their relationship is sketched in a series of 14 snapshots that are, in essence, 14 variations on a single subject: their discarded clothes and shoes lying in a tangled jumble across the floors of various apartments and hotel rooms. On first encountering these scattered remnants of the fumbled and hurried prelude to their lovemaking, Ernaux was overcome, she writes, by \u201ca sensation of beauty and sorrow\u201d and immediately went to find her camera lest \u201cthis arrangement born of desire and accident\u201d would simply disappear if not recorded.</p> <p>Certain elements recur throughout: her fashionable mules, his unlaced work boots; her unfurled stockings, his crumpled denim jeans. (Oddly, the photos are printed in black and white throughout, despite there being several references in the texts to the colour of clothes and objects.)

      "bodyText": "In 2021, the renowned French author Annie Ernaux published Exteriors, a random selection of journal entries written while she lived for a time in the Parisian suburb of Cergy-Pontoise. It stands apart from the books that have made her reputation as a fearless chronicler of her own life and relationships \u2013 the likes of Simple Passion (1993), Happening (2001) and A Girl\u2019s Story (2020) \u2013 eschewing the unflinchingly intimate and semi-autobiographical approach that helped earn her the Nobel prize in literature in 2022. Instead, as its name suggests, Exteriors is detached and outward-looking. Her aim, she said, was to \u201cdescribe reality as through the eyes of a photographer and to perceive the mystery and opacity of the lives I encountered\u201d. Despite its oddly academic-sounding title, The Use of Photography \u2013 note the singular \u2013 bears little relation to its predecessor, being a return to the intensely personal style for which Ernaux is revered. The difference here is that, although the lens is once again turned on herself, her reflections \u2013 on desire, illness, memory and encroaching mortality as well as photography \u2013 are juxtaposed with those of her former lover Marc Marie, a journalist and photographer with whom she had a prolonged and passionate love affair in 2003. Rather than dilute the intensity of her prose, their to-and-fro conversation somehow works. The arc of their relationship is sketched in a series of 14 snapshots that are, in essence, 14 variations on a single subject: their discarded clothes and shoes lying in a tangled jumble across the floors of various apartments and hotel rooms. On first encountering these scattered remnants of the fumbled and hurried prelude to their lovemaking, Ernaux was overcome, she writes, by \u201ca sensation of beauty and sorrow\u201d and immediately went to find her camera lest \u201cthis arrangement born of desire and accident\u201d would simply disappear if not recorded. Certain elements recur throughout: her fashionable mules, his unlaced work boots; her unfurled stockings, his crumpled denim jeans. (Oddly, the photos are printed in black and white throughout, despite there being several references in the texts to the colour of clothes and objects.) Blessedly, the sexual act itself remains out-of-frame throughout, both of them no doubt aware of French philosopher Roland Barthes\u2019s insistence that, in photography, the erotic should be \u201ca kind of subtle beyond\u201d, evoking desire most powerfully by what it suggests rather than what it shows. Intriguingly, Ernaux\u2019s initial essay is a response to a photograph that she took but has chosen not to include: a closeup snapshot of her lover\u2019s erect penis in which the camera flash \u201cmakes a drop of sperm glisten at the tip of the glans, like a bead\u201d. The primary reason for the absence of visual evidence, it turns out, is privacy rather than propriety \u2013 \u201cI can describe it, but I could not expose it to the eyes of others\u201d. The purpose of the almost mundane images that Ernaux and Marie chose to include \u2013 their primary use as intimated in the book\u2019s definitive title \u2013 lies to a great degree in the prose they have inspired. They are not so much aide-m\u00e9moires as melancholy traces of their once fervent but now dissipated desire, which Ernaux retrospectively interrogates in her inimitable way.

      "body": "<p>As soon as I stepped within the stone circle of Cerrig Arthur, the strange noise began. It came from the far side of the valley \u2013 a long, hoarse scream. Then it became louder, growing into an ear-splitting thunder. I jammed my fingers into my ears \u2013 but still felt its sonic explosion down in my stomach. The cloud lay low over the stone circle that evening, so it was impossible to tell where the terrible sound was coming from. I might have half-imagined that Cerrig Arthur had unleashed some ancient sorcery, or that this was the return of the legendary king the circle is named for.</p>    <p>But really, I knew what it was. Military training flights often pass over these Gwynedd hills. The roar was a jet fighter streaking right over my head. The disturbance was quickly over. In truth, there were few people to disturb.</p> <p>I was walking in the Rhinogydd: often said to be the wildest and most remote mountains of Snowdonia (Eryri). The range is rectangular: moated to the north and south by the Dwyryd and Mawddach estuaries. To the west is a shoreline polka-dotted with static caravans, and to the east a nuclear power station. The Rhinogydd form a backdrop to Gwynedd\u2019s holiday coastline \u2013 visible to anyone who has scaled the towers of Harlech Castle, or glanced up from their menu at Hotel Portmeirion. But few hikers walk them. The country is rugged, the footpaths scarce, faint or forgotten. You can queue for an hour to stand on the summit of Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), but you can hike for days and see almost no one in the Rhinogydd.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You can queue for an hour to stand on the summit of Snowdon, but you can hike for days and see almost no one in the Rhinogydd</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The range has long seemed forbidding to travellers. In 1883, Jenkinson\u2019s Practical Guide to North Wales characterised it as a \u201cregion of utter desolation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "As soon as I stepped within the stone circle of Cerrig Arthur, the strange noise began. It came from the far side of the valley \u2013 a long, hoarse scream. Then it became louder, growing into an ear-splitting thunder. I jammed my fingers into my ears \u2013 but still felt its sonic explosion down in my stomach. The cloud lay low over the stone circle that evening, so it was impossible to tell where the terrible sound was coming from. I might have half-imagined that Cerrig Arthur had unleashed some ancient sorcery, or that this was the return of the legendary king the circle is named for. But really, I knew what it was. Military training flights often pass over these Gwynedd hills. The roar was a jet fighter streaking right over my head. The disturbance was quickly over. In truth, there were few people to disturb. I was walking in the Rhinogydd: often said to be the wildest and most remote mountains of Snowdonia (Eryri). The range is rectangular: moated to the north and south by the Dwyryd and Mawddach estuaries. To the west is a shoreline polka-dotted with static caravans, and to the east a nuclear power station. The Rhinogydd form a backdrop to Gwynedd\u2019s holiday coastline \u2013 visible to anyone who has scaled the towers of Harlech Castle, or glanced up from their menu at Hotel Portmeirion. But few hikers walk them. The country is rugged, the footpaths scarce, faint or forgotten. You can queue for an hour to stand on the summit of Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), but you can hike for days and see almost no one in the Rhinogydd. The range has long seemed forbidding to travellers. In 1883, Jenkinson\u2019s Practical Guide to North Wales characterised it as a \u201cregion of utter desolation\u201d. And yet its rocky slopes have also acted as ramparts \u2013 guarding a number of prehistoric sites. There are Neolithic burial chambers and iron age hillforts, and the Rhinogydd are bookended by two bronze age stone circles: Cerrig Arthur in the south and the spectacular Bryn Cader Faner in the north.

      "body": "<p>In an era where conversations between strangers often take place through screens, C\u00e9line Pernet\u2019s playful documentary seeks answers the (almost) old-fashioned way. Curious about the thinking of men of her generation, the film-maker put out an ad seeking male interview subjects between 30-45, who speak French and are willing to be in front of the camera. As Pernet volleys questions about identity, relationships, and more, the responses form a fascinating tapestry of male experiences, told with candidness and vulnerability.</p> <p>One common theme that arises from these t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates is a feeling of uncertainty and restlessness. Many of the interviewees are unsure of their place in a world where feminism is more confident and gender relations in France appear to have changed. Antiquated expectations of sexual performance, earning potential and beauty ideals prove oppressive to some, while positive role models are few and far between. One even suggests that the two choices available for men are either to adopt toxic behaviours or to remain silent.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLZo4bnhMk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZLZo4bnhMk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Such a point of view may be challengingly binary, but Pernet\u2019s interest lies not so much in debating the men, but in lending an ear to their inner thoughts. The tongue-in-cheek title of Gar\u00e7onni\u00e8res (Man Caves in English), also alludes to this atmosphere of confidentiality. The subjects are often shot in their own homes, and the interiors are just as revealing as their answers. At the same time, to take Pernet\u2019s film as an anthropological study would be an overreach, with the diversity of the interviewees rather limited, perhaps due to the small numbers of people answering the ad. Still, Gar\u00e7onni\u00e8res remains a compelling documentary exercise; to watch it is to observe how the presence of a camera can grant a woman a unique access into the private domains of men.</p> <p>\u2022 Gar\u00e7onni\u00e8res is on True Story from 20 October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In an era where conversations between strangers often take place through screens, C\u00e9line Pernet\u2019s playful documentary seeks answers the (almost) old-fashioned way. Curious about the thinking of men of her generation, the film-maker put out an ad seeking male interview subjects between 30-45, who speak French and are willing to be in front of the camera. As Pernet volleys questions about identity, relationships, and more, the responses form a fascinating tapestry of male experiences, told with candidness and vulnerability. One common theme that arises from these t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates is a feeling of uncertainty and restlessness. Many of the interviewees are unsure of their place in a world where feminism is more confident and gender relations in France appear to have changed. Antiquated expectations of sexual performance, earning potential and beauty ideals prove oppressive to some, while positive role models are few and far between. One even suggests that the two choices available for men are either to adopt toxic behaviours or to remain silent. Such a point of view may be challengingly binary, but Pernet\u2019s interest lies not so much in debating the men, but in lending an ear to their inner thoughts. The tongue-in-cheek title of Gar\u00e7onni\u00e8res (Man Caves in English), also alludes to this atmosphere of confidentiality. The subjects are often shot in their own homes, and the interiors are just as revealing as their answers. At the same time, to take Pernet\u2019s film as an anthropological study would be an overreach, with the diversity of the interviewees rather limited, perhaps due to the small numbers of people answering the ad. Still, Gar\u00e7onni\u00e8res remains a compelling documentary exercise; to watch it is to observe how the presence of a camera can grant a woman a unique access into the private domains of men. \u2022 Gar\u00e7onni\u00e8res is on True Story from 20 October.",

      "body": "<p>In 2017, when Carol Douglas got the news she would be going to art school aged 66, she couldn\u2019t have been happier. \u201cI felt I had been given the biggest gift on the planet,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Throughout her adult life, Douglas had regretted giving up art at school when she was 16. \u201cArt is for Saturday mornings,\u201d her parents told her, and she listened, dropping the subject for Latin and then pursuing a sociology degree. \u201cEver since then, I had a general underlying feeling that I hadn\u2019t done something I should have done and I never would,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She went on to have various jobs \u2013 a community worker, a chef in a vegetarian restaurant, a catering manager and a pupil support worker. It wasn\u2019t until her 50s that she tapped into her creativity while working as a kindergarten teacher in an international school, after moving to Thailand for her then husband\u2019s job. \u201cI was working with four- and five-year-olds, encouraging children\u2019s creativity through school art projects \u2013 it was the most fulfilled I had been,\u201d she says. </p> <p>When Douglas returned to the UK and retired, aged 62, she knew she wanted to dedicate her time to creating her own art. She dabbled with a few part-time art adult education courses but craved more. \u201cI wanted to do an art degree but couldn\u2019t afford to go to university for three years,\u201d she says. A chance encounter with an artist in his 50s at York Open Studios \u2013 a community project that allows local artists to show their work to the public \u2013 changed everything. \u201cHe said he got a student loan for an art foundation course and I immediately knew I had to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>She applied for an art foundation course at York College and was thrilled when she was accepted. \u201cIt was just me and over a hundred 18- to 20-year-olds. I could have been their grandma,\u201d she says. On the one-year course, Douglas chose to specialise in painting and soon found her style, capturing still lifes and figures in a muted colour palette. After the course finished, she quickly found an affordable studio space in York and started experimenting with cheap acrylic paint and secondhand canvases bought at car boot sales. \u201cI was going nearly every day. Nothing was stopping me,\u201d she says.</p>    <p>After two years of hard work, her art started to gain some recognition. \u201cThe second year I applied to be shown at York Open Studios I got in and this led to some small exhibitions in local cafes,\u201d she says. Douglas also started sharing her work on Instagram and began getting commissions.</p> <p>Since then, she has sold hundreds of paintings. \u201cI have lost count,\u201d she says. This summer \u2013 six years after completing the art foundation course \u2013 Douglas opened her biggest exhibition to date, Actually I Can, at Yorkshire Sculpture Park, which features 51 of her paintings. \u201cThe first time I saw the paintings in the gallery it was mind-boggling. Seeing your work in a really professional and beautiful space is quite something. I am unbelievably proud,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Douglas has had many messages of support about the exhibition, many praising her bravery for embarking on something new later in life \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cIf I was younger, I would have to be much more organised professionally and work harder on things like social media. But when you get older and are reasonably financially comfortable, you can take more risks and it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>Douglas now wants to push herself to try other creative endeavours. \u201cIt has opened up other doors in my mind. I like the idea of incorporating my imagery on ceramics,\u201d she says.

      "bodyText": "In 2017, when Carol Douglas got the news she would be going to art school aged 66, she couldn\u2019t have been happier. \u201cI felt I had been given the biggest gift on the planet,\u201d she says. Throughout her adult life, Douglas had regretted giving up art at school when she was 16. \u201cArt is for Saturday mornings,\u201d her parents told her, and she listened, dropping the subject for Latin and then pursuing a sociology degree. \u201cEver since then, I had a general underlying feeling that I hadn\u2019t done something I should have done and I never would,\u201d she says. She went on to have various jobs \u2013 a community worker, a chef in a vegetarian restaurant, a catering manager and a pupil support worker. It wasn\u2019t until her 50s that she tapped into her creativity while working as a kindergarten teacher in an international school, after moving to Thailand for her then husband\u2019s job. \u201cI was working with four- and five-year-olds, encouraging children\u2019s creativity through school art projects \u2013 it was the most fulfilled I had been,\u201d she says. When Douglas returned to the UK and retired, aged 62, she knew she wanted to dedicate her time to creating her own art. She dabbled with a few part-time art adult education courses but craved more. \u201cI wanted to do an art degree but couldn\u2019t afford to go to university for three years,\u201d she says. A chance encounter with an artist in his 50s at York Open Studios \u2013 a community project that allows local artists to show their work to the public \u2013 changed everything. \u201cHe said he got a student loan for an art foundation course and I immediately knew I had to do the same.\u201d She applied for an art foundation course at York College and was thrilled when she was accepted. \u201cIt was just me and over a hundred 18- to 20-year-olds. I could have been their grandma,\u201d she says. On the one-year course, Douglas chose to specialise in painting and soon found her style, capturing still lifes and figures in a muted colour palette. After the course finished, she quickly found an affordable studio space in York and started experimenting with cheap acrylic paint and secondhand canvases bought at car boot sales. \u201cI was going nearly every day. Nothing was stopping me,\u201d she says. After two years of hard work, her art started to gain some recognition. \u201cThe second year I applied to be shown at York Open Studios I got in and this led to some small exhibitions in local cafes,\u201d she says. Douglas also started sharing her work on Instagram and began getting commissions. Since then, she has sold hundreds of paintings. \u201cI have lost count,\u201d she says. This summer \u2013 six years after completing the art foundation course \u2013 Douglas opened her biggest exhibition to date, Actually I Can, at Yorkshire Sculpture Park, which features 51 of her paintings. \u201cThe first time I saw the paintings in the gallery it was mind-boggling. Seeing your work in a really professional and beautiful space is quite something. I am unbelievably proud,\u201d she says. Douglas has had many messages of support about the exhibition, many praising her bravery for embarking on something new later in life \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cIf I was younger, I would have to be much more organised professionally and work harder on things like social media. But when you get older and are reasonably financially comfortable, you can take more risks and it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Douglas now wants to push herself to try other creative endeavours. \u201cIt has opened up other doors in my mind. I like the idea of incorporating my imagery on ceramics,\u201d she says. Most importantly, though, she wants to prioritise creating for her own enjoyment. \u201cIt is lovely what\u2019s happened with the sales and exhibitions. But if I\u2019d just sold a few paintings, I would enjoy it just as much.\u201d Looking back on her life, she no longer has regrets. \u201cI always wondered what would have happened if I had gone to art school, but now I think things come together when they are supposed to. I don\u2019t feel disappointed any more.\u201d Carol Douglas: Actually I Can is at Yorkshire Sculpture Park till 27 October \u2022 Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?

His insults against Harris have become more personal \u2013 during a rally Trump described his rival as \u201cmentally impaired\u201d and \u201cmentally disabled\u201d. In equally hyperbolic language, Trump is promising voters an \u201ceconomic boom\u201d if he wins the election.

In Michigan and Wisconsin, 49% support both candidates. In Nevada, 48% support Harris, 47% Trump, and in Arizona, 49% support Trump and 47% Harris.</p> <p>Other polls similarly show that the candidates are neck and neck in many major swing states. A national poll published by <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50661-kamala-harris-lead-vp-debate-hurricanes-health-care-pete-rose-october-6-7-2024-economist-yougov-poll\">YouGov/the Economist</a> found that Harris pulled ahead by four points, and another by the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4921203-kamala-harris-donald-trump-national-new-york-times-poll/\">New York Times/Siena College</a> found that she took a slim three-point lead.

Both teams are dashing across the country to scoop up every vote they can, in a final frenzied attempt to pull just ahead of the other.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The immigration \u2018issue\u2019</strong></p> <p>Trump has long blamed many of the country\u2019s ills on immigration, including unemployment, unaffordable housing, inflation and election tampering. In the last month, however, the rhetoric has become harsher and more violent. At one rally, Trump <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-already-harsh-rhetoric-migrants-is-turning-darker-election-day-nears-2024-10-04/\">told supporters</a> that migrants were \u201cstone cold killers\u201d that would \u201cgrab young girls and slice them up right in front of their parents\u201d without a second thought.</p> <p>The apocalyptic messaging relies on racist tropes, characterising migrants who have crossed the US-Mexico border as sexually violent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/trump-wisconsin-immigration-speech\">\u201cmonsters\u201d and \u201cvile animals\u201d</a>, who are the cause of a \u201ccrime wave\u201d. There is no evidence that immigration is a driving factor of crime.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s policy solution is simple: mass deportation. Stephen Miller, a former Trump White House adviser, has said that the goal is to eject 1 million people per year. There are few details about how this would work in practice but Trump himself admitted last month that it would be a \u201cbloody story\u201d.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx\">Gallup</a> poll found that 77% of Americans believe the southern border is experiencing either an ongoing crisis or is a major problem. Some 53% support an expansion of the border wall and 63% would support the president temporarily closing the border to asylum seekers when the border is \u201coverwhelmed\u201d.</p> <p>As Trump and Vance run towards immigration as an issue, throughout the campaign it has been an anchor for Harris. Although she has condemned Trump\u2019s rhetoric as divisive, the vice-president has seemingly conceded ground on the underlying Republican narrative on immigration: that the system is broken and that the fix is imposing some of the most restrictive immigration and asylum policies in decades. The shift on immigration is an attempt to dispel Republican criticism that she and Biden have been too permissive. Her plans include ramping up prosecutions for those who cross the border illegally, and curtailing asylum applications.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Trump bets on the economy</strong></p>    <p>Across the board, polls show that the economy is the top concern for voters.</p> <p>Trump has had a persistent advantage on the topic \u2013 earlier this year, one poll found that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/4447348-biden-trails-trump-by-20-points-on-handling-of-economy-poll/\">he was 20 points ahead of Biden</a> on the economy. Harris has narrowed that gap considerably, but Trump still has the edge. A <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx\">Gallup</a> poll found that 54% of voters view Trump as better equipped than Harris to handle the economy, in comparison to 45% who believed that Harris would be better.</p> <p>The Democrats have concentrated on making Harris the candidate for the middle class, as opposed to Trump, whom she claims is only interested in helping \u201chimself, and people like himself\u201d if he regains the presidency.</p> <p>Instead of focusing on the positive macroeconomic changes, as Biden did, Harris is centring the cost of living in her messaging, targeting families, small businesses, young people and manufacturers.</p> <p>She has offered first-time homebuyers a $25,000 tax credit; a $6,000 tax credit for parents of newborns; a universal preschool programme for 4-year-olds; a reintroduction of the pandemic-era expanded child tax credit; and the expansion of a small business creation tax break.</p> <p>Harris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/14/kamala-harris-economic-policy-aides\">has also pledged</a> to enact a federal ban on corporate price gouging and to hike taxes on the wealthiest Americans to pay for the social safety net that she wants to implement.</p> <p>Coasting on the perception of a strong economic record, Trump has maintained the line that the way to prosperity is through enormous tariffs on imported goods, cutting taxes \u2013 including capital gains tax to 15% \u2013 and widespread, aggressive deregulation. He also wants to boost US energy production and to invest more in fossil fuels. His policies, he says, will reduce inflation and improve the quality of life for the average American. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group, found that Trump\u2019s proposals <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans\">could add up to $15tn to national debt</a> over the next decade.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Abortion rights on the ballot?</strong></p> <p>Trump\u2019s shifting stance on abortion has raised concerns among his most ardent, religious supporters. Though he has taken credit on multiple occasions for overturning Roe v Wade, Trump recognises how fraught and potentially politically damaging the issue is for him, as 63% of Americans say abortion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/14/abortion-rights-support-poll\">should be legal in all or most cases</a>. Trump has confirmed that he would not sign a national abortion ban, to avoid alienating more moderate voters but has simultaneously angered his evangelical base. The former president has also publicly criticised Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban as too harsh and said that his policies would be great for the reproductive rights of women \u2013 though he has not given any examples of such policies.</p> <p>Democrats have long viewed abortion as a winning platform for them, and Harris has been much clearer and stronger on the issue than Biden. She has urged Congress to codify the rights enshrined in Roe v Wade, called for an end to the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/24/election-harris-filibuster-abortion-roe\"> Senate filibuster</a> and has rejected all efforts to restrict reproductive rights and abortion access.</p> <p>The clock is ticking, as both candidates continue to try and eke out the final votes that could take them to the Oval Office.</p> <p><em>For the latest </em><em>on the race, sign up to the Guardian\u2019s weekly US election newsletter,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-stakes-us-election-edition\"> The Stakes</a></em></p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/13/ezra-collective-dance-no-ones-watching-mercury-prize-youth-clubs\">Miranda Sawyer\u2019s interview</a> with <strong>Ezra Collective</strong> is a tribute to the jazz agitators who are rising the ranks of UK music while also fostering the next generation of talent. <em><strong>Hannah J Davies, deputy editor, newsletters</strong></em> </p></li> <li><p>Are you in a <strong>vampiric friendship?</strong> Not in the gothic-mythical way, in the energy-sucking way.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. As the US election slowly builds to its crescendo, there is little time left for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to convince the remaining undecided voters to pick them in this coin-toss race. To try to pull ahead, Harris went on an uncharacteristic media blitz last week. Largely avoiding traditional media, Harris\u2019s team opted to focus their strategy on talkshows like Howard Stern and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and podcasts like Call Her Daddy and All the Smoke, to reach audiences who are less likely to vote. The Democrat campaign has pushed hard to characterise Harris as the change candidate despite being the incumbent vice-president. Trump, meanwhile, has been holding at least two rallies a week during the election cycle, which have grown in terms of length and vitriol. With just three short weeks to go before US voters head to the polls, today\u2019s newsletter breaks down the state of the race. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Scotland | Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, has died at the age of 69. John Swinney, the incumbent first minister, has paid tribute to Salmond\u2019s \u201ccolossal contribution\u201d to Scottish and UK politics, as allies of the former first minister mourned his sudden death on Saturday. Middle East | A Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others on Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Politics | Keir Starmer will promise to slash red tape and \u201crip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment\u201d as he hosts hundreds of global business executives for a major summit in central London. US | A man armed with guns and false press and VIP passes was apprehended by authorities at a campaign rally in California on Saturday being held by Donald Trump. Water industry | Small companies in Suffolk that manufacture drinks have been told to keep a lid on their water usage for most of the next decade, amid concerns at their supplier that it will be unable to meet rising demand. In depth: The issues shaping the campaign The Democrats sent out their most iconic figures to throw their weight behind Harris last week, with Barack Obama beginning his swing state tour in Pennsylvania and Bill Clinton travelling through the south. This is an existential election, Harris\u2019s campaign argues, so they are throwing everything they have at it. Trump, meanwhile, has only grown more agitated and profane. His insults against Harris have become more personal \u2013 during a rally Trump described his rival as \u201cmentally impaired\u201d and \u201cmentally disabled\u201d. In equally hyperbolic language, Trump is promising voters an \u201ceconomic boom\u201d if he wins the election. Conversely, he said that a Harris victory would turn the US into a hellhole \u201clike Detroit\u201d \u2013 during a speech in Detroit. The tone and mood of the race will likely only sour as we get closer to polling day. *** Too close to call Despite Harris\u2019s campaign raising a record-breaking \u00a31bn in 80 days, the race in key battleground states remains extremely tight. A poll by Emerson College and the Hill found that in Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, 49% support Trump and 48% Harris. In Michigan and Wisconsin, 49% support both candidates. In Nevada, 48% support Harris, 47% Trump, and in Arizona, 49% support Trump and 47% Harris. Other polls similarly show that the candidates are neck and neck in many major swing states. A national poll published by YouGov/the Economist found that Harris pulled ahead by four points, and another by the New York Times/Siena College found that she took a slim three-point lead. And this past weekend alone three major polls showed that Harris was either ahead of former president Donald Trump or running a head-to-head race. Both teams are dashing across the country to scoop up every vote they can, in a final frenzied attempt to pull just ahead of the other. *** The immigration \u2018issue\u2019 Trump has long blamed many of the country\u2019s ills on immigration, including unemployment, unaffordable housing, inflation and election tampering. In the last month, however, the rhetoric has become harsher and more violent. At one rally, Trump told supporters that migrants were \u201cstone cold killers\u201d that would \u201cgrab young girls and slice them up right in front of their parents\u201d without a second thought. The apocalyptic messaging relies on racist tropes, characterising migrants who have crossed the US-Mexico border as sexually violent \u201cmonsters\u201d and \u201cvile animals\u201d, who are the cause of a \u201ccrime wave\u201d. There is no evidence that immigration is a driving factor of crime. Trump\u2019s policy solution is simple: mass deportation. Stephen Miller, a former Trump White House adviser, has said that the goal is to eject 1 million people per year. There are few details about how this would work in practice but Trump himself admitted last month that it would be a \u201cbloody story\u201d. A recent Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans believe the southern border is experiencing either an ongoing crisis or is a major problem. Some 53% support an expansion of the border wall and 63% would support the president temporarily closing the border to asylum seekers when the border is \u201coverwhelmed\u201d. As Trump and Vance run towards immigration as an issue, throughout the campaign it has been an anchor for Harris. Although she has condemned Trump\u2019s rhetoric as divisive, the vice-president has seemingly conceded ground on the underlying Republican narrative on immigration: that the system is broken and that the fix is imposing some of the most restrictive immigration and asylum policies in decades. The shift on immigration is an attempt to dispel Republican criticism that she and Biden have been too permissive. Her plans include ramping up prosecutions for those who cross the border illegally, and curtailing asylum applications. *** Trump bets on the economy Across the board, polls show that the economy is the top concern for voters. Trump has had a persistent advantage on the topic \u2013 earlier this year, one poll found that he was 20 points ahead of Biden on the economy. Harris has narrowed that gap considerably, but Trump still has the edge. A Gallup poll found that 54% of voters view Trump as better equipped than Harris to handle the economy, in comparison to 45% who believed that Harris would be better. The Democrats have concentrated on making Harris the candidate for the middle class, as opposed to Trump, whom she claims is only interested in helping \u201chimself, and people like himself\u201d if he regains the presidency. Instead of focusing on the positive macroeconomic changes, as Biden did, Harris is centring the cost of living in her messaging, targeting families, small businesses, young people and manufacturers. She has offered first-time homebuyers a $25,000 tax credit; a $6,000 tax credit for parents of newborns; a universal preschool programme for 4-year-olds; a reintroduction of the pandemic-era expanded child tax credit; and the expansion of a small business creation tax break. Harris has also pledged to enact a federal ban on corporate price gouging and to hike taxes on the wealthiest Americans to pay for the social safety net that she wants to implement. Coasting on the perception of a strong economic record, Trump has maintained the line that the way to prosperity is through enormous tariffs on imported goods, cutting taxes \u2013 including capital gains tax to 15% \u2013 and widespread, aggressive deregulation. He also wants to boost US energy production and to invest more in fossil fuels. His policies, he says, will reduce inflation and improve the quality of life for the average American. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group, found that Trump\u2019s proposals could add up to $15tn to national debt over the next decade. *** Abortion rights on the ballot? Trump\u2019s shifting stance on abortion has raised concerns among his most ardent, religious supporters. Though he has taken credit on multiple occasions for overturning Roe v Wade, Trump recognises how fraught and potentially politically damaging the issue is for him, as 63% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Trump has confirmed that he would not sign a national abortion ban, to avoid alienating more moderate voters but has simultaneously angered his evangelical base. The former president has also publicly criticised Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban as too harsh and said that his policies would be great for the reproductive rights of women \u2013 though he has not given any examples of such policies. Democrats have long viewed abortion as a winning platform for them, and Harris has been much clearer and stronger on the issue than Biden. She has urged Congress to codify the rights enshrined in Roe v Wade, called for an end to the Senate filibuster and has rejected all efforts to restrict reproductive rights and abortion access. The clock is ticking, as both candidates continue to try and eke out the final votes that could take them to the Oval Office.

      "body": "<p>Yesterday, I went to the cinema in the Dome prison in Haarlem. This monumental building \u2013 a vast, panopticon-style facility first opened in 1901 \u2013 is one of more than 20 Dutch prisons that have closed in the past decade. Some of them have ended up serving significantly more enjoyable purposes, such as this cultural hub.</p> <p>The Dutch have seen their prison population <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1477370819896220\">decrease by more than 40% </a>over the past 20 years. At the other end of the spectrum, Britain has the highest <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-overflowing-prisons-present-pm-starmer-with-early-crisis-2024-07-10/\">rate of incarceration</a> in western Europe, and is struggling with an unprecedented prisons crisis. Britain\u2019s minister of prisons, James Timpson, calls the Netherlands a source of inspiration. </p> <p>What could the Dutch system teach the rest of the world? First, the declining prison population is not actually the result of recent policies by visionary politicians. Much of it is due to changes in reported crime and the nature of crime. As in <a href=\"https://clcjbooks.rutgers.edu/books/international-crime-drop/\">many other western countries</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2023/35/47-procent-minder-verdachten-van-moord-en-doodslag-dan-20-jaar-geleden\">number of violent crimes</a> has significantly dropped in the Netherlands in recent decades.</p> <p>This does not necessarily mean that there is actually less crime overall, as Dutch criminologist Francis Pakes, professor at the University of Portsmouth, who has studied the reasons for the emptying Dutch prisons, told me: \u201cThere is less conventional, violent crime, like murder. On the other hand, a lot of conventional crime went online and is less visible. And it is quite possible that there is a kind of organised crime that we have little visibility on. But fewer serious cases are coming to the police and courts.\u201d And so fewer people end up in jail.</p> <p>But while the Dutch don\u2019t have a model policy the world can copy, the overall Dutch attitude towards imprisonment could be instructive. According to Pakes, the Dutch are much more aware that a stay in prison does more harm than good. Society may be rid of a criminal for a while, but in many cases, criminals simply resume their activities when they leave prison. They may become more ruthless, due to the violent prison climate in which they have had to survive. And perhaps they have a wider criminal network that they built up behind bars.</p> <p>This also applies to shorter sentences. Even these can completely turn an offender\u2019s life upside down. You can lose your job, home and social network. And you rarely become a better person during a short stay in jail.</p> <p>Due to the excesses during the Nazi occupation in the second world war, there is a culture in the Netherlands of not imposing long prison sentences. In Britain and also the US, the culture is different: many British and American politicians advocate for harsher sentences to present themselves as strong leaders. However, more politicians \u2013 often rightwing ones \u2013 in the Netherlands are now doing this, too.</p> <p>It is not uncommon for British judges to impose what seem to the Dutch relatively long sentences for minor offences. Dutch judges are much more inclined to give community service or a suspended sentence in similar cases. Research shows that this is <a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2023/11/short-prison-sentences-more-recidivism-and-expensive\">not only cheaper</a> but also reduces the likelihood of reoffending. Even in cases where prison time is given, the lengths of sentences for lesser crimes such as theft have <a href=\"https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/16171551/Collapse_Dutch_Prison.pdf\">declined significantly over the past decade</a>, although the lengths of sentences for <a href=\"https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie-en-contact/Organisatie/Raad-voor-de-rechtspraak/Nieuws/Paginas/Rechter-straft-zwaarder-dan-20-jaar-geleden.aspx\">violent and sexual crimes went up</a>.</p> <p>This attitude of Dutch judges is not the reason for the recent decline in the prison population. But the Netherlands has consistently had a lower proportion of people in prison <a href=\"https://www.prisonstudies.org/ten-country-prisons-project/changing-patterns-imprisonment\">than places such as England and Wales</a>, and especially the US. Long sentences put enormous pressure on the prison system. And, given the staggering costs on society, if this money were spent on prevention instead, it could pay for some wonderful things.</p> <p>In any case, the Netherlands has at least one hopeful message for other countries: it is not a given that prison populations must always increase. Moreover, it is not necessarily true that society becomes less safe with fewer people in jail. Despite their emptying prisons, the Dutch can still walk the streets safely at night, especially compared with say, Britain, where incidents of crime and <a href=\"https://www.numbeo.com/crime/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Netherlands&amp;country2=United+Kingdom\">concern about crime is higher</a>.</p> <p>Apart from looking at the Netherlands, Timpson might also consider the remarkable prison system of Norway. Its prisons are often small and very focused on reintegration. They are designed so that daily life can proceed as normally as possible.</p> <p>As a result, inmates are less alienated from society. It is easier for them to integrate than for a person coming from an overcrowded British prison, where they have been locked up for 22 hours a day because the staff couldn\u2019t manage otherwise. In such cases, the transition to the outside world can be extremely abrupt. You may see someone reoffend within the first few days after their release.</p> <p>You can argue whether a system from a sparsely populated country like Norway is suitable for Britain or other large countries. But it is also clear that the British system has reached its limits and that a new approach is not a luxury. James Timpson is willing. We in the Netherlands will be interested to see what plans he will come up with.</p> <ul> <li><p>Renate van der Zee is a Dutch writer and journalist<br></p></li> </ul>",

At the other end of the spectrum, Britain has the highest rate of incarceration in western Europe, and is struggling with an unprecedented prisons crisis. Britain\u2019s minister of prisons, James Timpson, calls the Netherlands a source of inspiration. What could the Dutch system teach the rest of the world? First, the declining prison population is not actually the result of recent policies by visionary politicians. Much of it is due to changes in reported crime and the nature of crime. As in many other western countries, the number of violent crimes has significantly dropped in the Netherlands in recent decades. This does not necessarily mean that there is actually less crime overall, as Dutch criminologist Francis Pakes, professor at the University of Portsmouth, who has studied the reasons for the emptying Dutch prisons, told me: \u201cThere is less conventional, violent crime, like murder. On the other hand, a lot of conventional crime went online and is less visible. And it is quite possible that there is a kind of organised crime that we have little visibility on. But fewer serious cases are coming to the police and courts.\u201d And so fewer people end up in jail. But while the Dutch don\u2019t have a model policy the world can copy, the overall Dutch attitude towards imprisonment could be instructive. According to Pakes, the Dutch are much more aware that a stay in prison does more harm than good. Society may be rid of a criminal for a while, but in many cases, criminals simply resume their activities when they leave prison. They may become more ruthless, due to the violent prison climate in which they have had to survive. And perhaps they have a wider criminal network that they built up behind bars. This also applies to shorter sentences. Even these can completely turn an offender\u2019s life upside down. You can lose your job, home and social network. And you rarely become a better person during a short stay in jail. Due to the excesses during the Nazi occupation in the second world war, there is a culture in the Netherlands of not imposing long prison sentences. In Britain and also the US, the culture is different: many British and American politicians advocate for harsher sentences to present themselves as strong leaders. However, more politicians \u2013 often rightwing ones \u2013 in the Netherlands are now doing this, too. It is not uncommon for British judges to impose what seem to the Dutch relatively long sentences for minor offences. Dutch judges are much more inclined to give community service or a suspended sentence in similar cases. Research shows that this is not only cheaper but also reduces the likelihood of reoffending. Even in cases where prison time is given, the lengths of sentences for lesser crimes such as theft have declined significantly over the past decade, although the lengths of sentences for violent and sexual crimes went up. This attitude of Dutch judges is not the reason for the recent decline in the prison population. But the Netherlands has consistently had a lower proportion of people in prison than places such as England and Wales, and especially the US. Long sentences put enormous pressure on the prison system. And, given the staggering costs on society, if this money were spent on prevention instead, it could pay for some wonderful things. In any case, the Netherlands has at least one hopeful message for other countries: it is not a given that prison populations must always increase. Moreover, it is not necessarily true that society becomes less safe with fewer people in jail. Despite their emptying prisons, the Dutch can still walk the streets safely at night, especially compared with say, Britain, where incidents of crime and concern about crime is higher. Apart from looking at the Netherlands, Timpson might also consider the remarkable prison system of Norway. Its prisons are often small and very focused on reintegration. They are designed so that daily life can proceed as normally as possible. As a result, inmates are less alienated from society. It is easier for them to integrate than for a person coming from an overcrowded British prison, where they have been locked up for 22 hours a day because the staff couldn\u2019t manage otherwise. In such cases, the transition to the outside world can be extremely abrupt. You may see someone reoffend within the first few days after their release. You can argue whether a system from a sparsely populated country like Norway is suitable for Britain or other large countries. But it is also clear that the British system has reached its limits and that a new approach is not a luxury. James Timpson is willing. We in the Netherlands will be interested to see what plans he will come up with. Renate van der Zee is a Dutch writer and journalist",

      "bodyText": "Network Ten has rejected an allegation by Bruce Lehrmann that it employed \u201cbullying tactics\u201d by insisting the Centrelink recipient pay a $200,000 security ahead of any appeal. Lehrmann has launched an appeal after a defamation trial judge ruled in favour of Network Ten, finding on the balance of probabilities that Lehrmann raped Brittany Higgins at Parliament House. On Monday, Lehrmann asked the court to stay the costs order of $2m made by Justice Michael Lee in the defamation case, and rejected a demand from Ten for a security of costs order to proceed with the appeal. Lehrmann\u2019s lawyer, Zali Burrows, said her client is too \u201cscared\u201d to attend court since becoming \u201carguably Australia\u2019s most hated man\u201d and the publicity surrounding the defamation trial has \u201csmashed\u201d his mental health. The court heard Lehrmann was an unemployed young man with his \u201cwhole life behind him\u201d after being \u201ccalled a rapist\u201d and he could not afford to pay his costs for losing the defamation case against Ten and Lisa Wilkinson or provide a $200,000 security bond. \u201cI cannot imagine a worse type of defamation than being called a rapist,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cThis application for security, of course, is pretty much a bullying tactic \u2026 [to] shut down this appeal because they know that my client will not be able to come up with $200,000. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit rich [Ten and Wilkinson] asking him to put up $200,000 when they are one of the contributors as to why he\u2019s pretty much unemployable,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only shot he\u2019d probably ever have in making money is by going on OnlyFans or something silly like that. But other than that, they know that he cannot come up with this.\u201d Ten\u2019s barrister, Dr Matt Collins KC, rejected the bullying claim and asked the court to ensure Lehrmann can at least pay some of his client\u2019s costs for the appeal. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be seen to be acquiescing to the allegation that there were \u2018bullying tactics\u2019 on the part of the respondents,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIn our submission there\u2019s nothing improper in a successful litigant [Ten] seeking to enforce a cost order made by this court, or seeking security for the cost of an appeal in respect of the enforcement of the bankruptcy.\u201d Burrows argued there was a \u201cgenuine public interest\u201d in allowing Lehrmann an appeal and a risk that if the security of costs is granted it may abort the appeal. Collins rejected the public interest claim. \u201cHe\u2019s had his day in court, he had a very expensive trial which was conducted in the full glare of the entire nation,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe was very ably represented and his honour had made findings at the end of the day.\u201d Barrister Sue Chrysanthou SC, for Wilkinson, agreed that Lehrmann \u201chad his day in court\u201d and should not be given a second chance. \u201cHe came to this court by choice,\u201d Chrysanthou said. \u201cHe came here pleading his first imputation as one of rape. He did so having escaped the criminal process. \u201cHe chose to enter the fray. He walked over the line and asked this court, knowing the likelihood that my client in Network Ten would plead truth, he made that decision, and that\u2019s a factor against the arguments that he would make on public interest.\u201d Collins said some of Lehrmann\u2019s appeal grounds are \u201cfaintly arguable\u201d while others are \u201chopeless\u201d. In an expanded appeal of his defamation loss, Lehrmann said Lee should not have ruled that Network Ten had proven its substantial truth defence. Collins told the court Lehrmann was served with a bankruptcy notice on 8 August, but his client would not move forward with the bankruptcy until Justice Wendy Abraham had made her decision. Abraham has reserved her decision. In April, Lee found Lehrmann was not defamed by Wilkinson and Ten when The Project broadcast an interview with Brittany Higgins on 15 February 2021 in which she alleged she was raped by a staffer. Lee found on the balance of probabilities Lehrmann raped Higgins on a minister\u2019s couch in Parliament House in 2019. Lehrmann has always denied the rape allegation and pleaded not guilty at his criminal trial in the Australian Capital Territory supreme court which was aborted. Prosecutors did not seek a retrial due to concerns about Higgins\u2019s mental health.",

      "body": "<p>When the aurora notifications pop up on my phone, at first I ignore them. It\u2019s already a busy evening: my son has an afterschool club, Scouts, and a convoluted homework project to complete between times, leaving scarcely space for tea. But he gets the alerts&nbsp;too, and shows me the red graph peaks indicating that Earth\u2019s magnetic field is already exceeding 800 nanoteslas.</p> <p>When the time comes for pick-up&nbsp;from Scouts, my husband, Roy, persuades me to come. On the return trip I doze off watching the fat, waxing half moon, and only wake when we pull up somewhere that isn\u2019t home. Roy has detoured to our habitual skywatching spot on&nbsp;the Stray, a long, straight road that undulates across the Castle Howard estate.</p> <p>I get out of the van almost grudgingly. The air is sharp with the first frost of winter. There\u2019s a pink glow to the north-west that needs a camera to see clearly. But as we watch, periodically flapping arms for warmth, eyes adjusting, a&nbsp;gauzy green curtain draws across the entire northern sky, its folds drifting in and out of focus.</p>    <p>Then, without warning, gold blooms beneath the rose, and all three colours intensify against the indigo sky. The silence rings loud in my blood, but beneath the&nbsp;commotion, two swans floating&nbsp;on an ornamental pond close to the road are somehow sleeping. Strangely, given all the colour above, their folded forms look not pink, or green, but grey. For all its intensity, this&nbsp;elfin light provides no illumination, and beneath its glow,&nbsp;the dark is darker.</p> <p>The sky is changing but I keep missing it happen, as if a blink is too long. Roy says that, in trying to take it all in, I\u2019m never focusing on the small areas where things begin. He\u2019s probably right, but the gaps in perception make the whole experience feel slippery \u2026 evanescent. For all that physics can explain them, the auroras seem to speak directly to all we cannot see or hear, and sing of things no Earthling will ever know.</p> <p>They are still singing when we finally go to bed, and although I can no longer see them, I know they are there, their eerie, quickening lullaby throbbing over the house.</p> <p>\u2022 Country diary is on Twitter/X at <a href=\"https://x.com/gdncountrydiary?lang=en\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p> <p>\u2022 Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian\u2019s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-changing-skies-9781783353101/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">guardianbookshop.com</a> and get a 20% discount</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the aurora notifications pop up on my phone, at first I ignore them. It\u2019s already a busy evening: my son has an afterschool club, Scouts, and a convoluted homework project to complete between times, leaving scarcely space for tea. But he gets the alerts too, and shows me the red graph peaks indicating that Earth\u2019s magnetic field is already exceeding 800 nanoteslas. When the time comes for pick-up from Scouts, my husband, Roy, persuades me to come. On the return trip I doze off watching the fat, waxing half moon, and only wake when we pull up somewhere that isn\u2019t home. Roy has detoured to our habitual skywatching spot on the Stray, a long, straight road that undulates across the Castle Howard estate. I get out of the van almost grudgingly. The air is sharp with the first frost of winter. There\u2019s a pink glow to the north-west that needs a camera to see clearly. But as we watch, periodically flapping arms for warmth, eyes adjusting, a gauzy green curtain draws across the entire northern sky, its folds drifting in and out of focus. Then, without warning, gold blooms beneath the rose, and all three colours intensify against the indigo sky. The silence rings loud in my blood, but beneath the commotion, two swans floating on an ornamental pond close to the road are somehow sleeping. Strangely, given all the colour above, their folded forms look not pink, or green, but grey. For all its intensity, this elfin light provides no illumination, and beneath its glow, the dark is darker. The sky is changing but I keep missing it happen, as if a blink is too long. Roy says that, in trying to take it all in, I\u2019m never focusing on the small areas where things begin. He\u2019s probably right, but the gaps in perception make the whole experience feel slippery \u2026 evanescent. For all that physics can explain them, the auroras seem to speak directly to all we cannot see or hear, and sing of things no Earthling will ever know. They are still singing when we finally go to bed, and although I can no longer see them, I know they are there, their eerie, quickening lullaby throbbing over the house. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter/X at @gdncountrydiary \u2022 Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian\u2019s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 20% discount",

      "body": "<p>The week Maria Bakalova was asked to consider playing Ivana Trump for the new film The Apprentice, she was in New York filming something else. With the meeting scheduled for her one day off, she spent the evening before trying to channel Donald Trump\u2019s first wife. The film is set in the 70s and 80s, so she spent hours wading through photos of Ivana in that era. \u201cA lot of makeup, a lot of hair,\u201d she says. Bakalova laughs as she remembers spending the evening experimenting with a mushroom-like hairstyle and \u201cheavy eyeliner with a lot of powder, like inches\u201d, although she didn\u2019t have an Ivana-esque wardrobe \u2013 \u201cAm I gen Z or a millennial?\u201d asks the 28-year-old. Either way, \u201cWe wear a lot of baggy clothes\u201d, so she chose her most skintight outfit.</p> <p>She met the director Ali Abbasi in the middle of the day, feeling a little clownish in her Ivana cosplay. They spoke for a couple of hours, \u201cabout people growing up in post-communist countries \u2013 because [Ivana] was from Czechoslovakia, and I was born and raised in Bulgaria \u2013 which shapes your inner world, your thoughts. We talked a lot about the similarities of our stories.\u201d</p>    <p>Ivana had been a competitive skier, with a place on the national junior team that allowed her to compete outside communist Czechoslovakia in the late 60s. By the mid-90s, when Bakalova was born, Bulgaria was no longer a socialist republic but, for most people, travel outside the country was still rare. As a child, Bakalova, a competitive singer, got to travel to competitions all around Europe. It opened her eyes and instilled a sense of independence.</p> <p>This is Bakalova\u2019s highest profile role since her big break in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s 2020 mockumentary sequel about the Kazakhstani reporter Borat Sagdiyev. She played Borat\u2019s daughter, Tutar, in a performance so cringingly brilliant it got her an Oscar nomination. Despite this early success, Bakalova says her agents warned her not to get her hopes up about the role of Ivana \u2013 higher profile US actors were also in the running. \u201cWhat I think is important is that [Abbasi] gave a chance to an eastern European to compete,\u201d she says. \u201cTo have the opportunity, rather than just playing a prostitute or a crazy Russian scientist or a mobster or somebody that is just in the background with a few lines.\u201d</p> <p>It was six months before she found out that she\u2019d got the role, followed by a tortuous journey to get the film made and released. In a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/inside-the-fight-to-release-the-apprentice\">Vanity Fair</a> piece, the film\u2019s screenwriter, Gabriel Sherman, detailed the various obstacles \u2013 actors who didn\u2019t want to \u201chumanise\u201d Trump, Hollywood studios and streamers who wouldn\u2019t finance it, Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban that made it difficult for Abbasi, who is Iranian and based in Denmark, to work in the US (as well as the actors\u2019 strikes and a global pandemic). The Apprentice\u2019s largest investor, a film-making son-in-law of a billionaire and prominent Trump donor, reportedly threatened to sink the film once he\u2019d seen it, because of a scene in which the Trump character appears to rape his wife. Ivana alleged Trump raped her in her divorce deposition, but later retracted. Trump\u2019s lawyers sent the film-makers cease-and-desist letters and the big American distributors wouldn\u2019t touch it. \u201cHollywood fashions itself as a community of truth tellers,\u201d wrote Sherman, \u201cbut here they were running from a movie to prepare for a Trump presidency.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tXEN0WNJUg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0tXEN0WNJUg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>The Apprentice trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been facing a bit of difficulty to release it,\u201d says Bakalova, with comic understatement.</p> <p>In the film, Trump (played by a toupeed Sebastian Stan) is ambitious but slightly awkward and in the shadow of his father. He is then mentored and moulded by nefarious lawyer Roy Cohn (played, typically magnificently, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/24/theyre-damaged-succession-jeremy-strong-on-sibling-hell-and-that-cringey-rap\">Succession\u2019s Jeremy Strong</a>), whom Bakalova describes as \u201cone of the most vicious people of our century\u201d.</p> <p>A cinephile, Bakalova was desperate to work with Abbasi \u2013 she was a huge fan of his work, including Holy Spider, the Iranian serial killer film. She wanted, she says, to be involved in his \u201cdive into the underbelly of the American empire\u201d. The more she researched Trump\u2019s first wife \u2013 and the mother of three of his children \u2013 the more she found herself fascinated by how much Ivana achieved on her own. \u201cShe wanted to be Donald\u2019s partner,\u201d she says. Ivana is credited with promoting the couple\u2019s 80s glitz, she was involved in running part of his businesses and managed New York\u2019s Plaza hotel. \u201cI think she was the reason he achieved so much early because she was very smart, very ambitious.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, the power balance between Ivana and Donald is in her favour at the start of their relationship; Ivana is horrified at the idea of a prenup, and the measly amount it would give her in the event of a separation, and negotiates a better deal. \u201cI saw an interview with her after the divorce, saying she didn\u2019t know anything about prenups, and why do you need to have them? But if you\u2019re going to play this game that way, if that\u2019s going to be the picture of our marriage, OK, I\u2019m going to play the same way.\u201d</p> <p>How did she feel about the inclusion of the alleged rape in the film? Trump has always denied the allegations, since retracted by Ivana, who died in 2022. Bakalova says she trusted Sherman. \u201cDo I think it\u2019s important to have it out there?\u201d she says. \u201cDo I think it\u2019s a crucial scene for both of the characters? It is, because we see somebody completely dismissing the person who built him in a lot of ways, who gave birth to his children. Not only physically, but verbally as well.\u201d</p> <p>She says she doesn\u2019t think it matters if the film \u201chumanises\u201d Trump (reviews have said it lacks bite). \u201cWhen you dive deeper into a human being, there\u2019s always good and bad sides, and there are always decisions that you make based on circumstances, people you surround yourself with, that change your point of view \u2026 I think we should step away from the idea of demonising people or creating idols, because people are complex.\u201d </p>    <p>The Borat sequel was released less than two weeks before the 2020 US election, with the words \u201cnow vote\u201d flashed up at the end. The Apprentice is also coming out around election time. Is it intended to have any influence? No, says Bakalova \u2013 it\u2019s been too long in the making for any kind of intentional timing. \u201cThis is not a political film, this is not a hit piece,\u201d she says. Although there are clear echoes, deafening in parts, of who the Trump character will later become. \u201cWill it change opinions? I don\u2019t know. But I feel like the biggest privilege that we have living in a democracy is to share our voices and to have an opinion, one way or another.\u201d</p> <p>Bakalova grew up in Burgas, a city on the Black Sea coast. Her mother was a nurse, and her father a chemist; she is an only child. They were considered middle-class, she says, but she remembers as a child that nobody in Bulgaria had much.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of communism and because of inflation, because of a lot of things. I remember back in the 90s, chewing gum going from 100 bucks to 10 bucks to one penny.\u201d They were comfortable, financially, she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not so easy that you can allow yourself to just rest and wait for something to happen. You know that you have to do something if you\u2019re going to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>Her love of the arts started with music. Her father would play the guitar at home, and she grew up listening to rock music and wanting to emulate those musicians. \u201cUnfortunately, again, growing up in Bulgaria and in a place that still has some kind of patriarchy mindset, playing guitar is a little bit too masculine.\u201d Instead, she became a flautist and was also singing in the choirs that would take her around Europe to various competitions.</p> <p>When she was 12, she damaged her voice and stopped singing for several months to rest it. \u201cI started reading a lot of books and imagining that I\u2019m in different places, I want to be like these characters. How can you somehow escape real life and imagine that you\u2019re somebody else? That was the starting point of me falling in love with acting.\u201d Later, Bakalova would study at Sofia\u2019s National Academy of Theatre and Film Arts.</p> <p>She loves theatre and arthouse cinema, but she laughs and says \u201cI\u2019m not going to hide that I was always dreaming about Hollywood and America and cinema.\u201d She remembers drawing the Hollywood sign in an exercise book at school, and writing that she was going to be \u201ca great movie star someday. But of course, my last name finishes with \u2018o-v-a\u2019, and I didn\u2019t see that in a lot of credits at the end of films.\u201d One teacher told her that if she wanted to expand beyond Bulgarian film, she should try to get involved in the types of films shown on the European festival circuit.</p>    <p>Bakalova discovered the Danish avant garde Dogme 95 movement and, during her final year of university, used some of her scholarship money to buy flights to Copenhagen for her and her parents. She had an ambitious plan to march into the offices of Lars von Trier\u2019s production company, Zentropa. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I\u2019m going there, and I\u2019m going to say, \u2018I am willing to work here for free, to study, to learn how you guys do all of these incredible movies.\u2019\u201d She laughs, remembering her and her mother in the rain, Googling the office address. (They were kind, but sent her away, saying she would have to be fluent in Danish, which she then vowed to study.)</p> <p>Not long afterwards, Bakalova was shooting a Bulgarian French film, Women Do Cry, in which she played a young woman with HIV, when she heard through a friend about a project, which she would later find out was Borat, which required an eastern European actor. So secretive was the process that she feared she was being conned into human trafficking, but she was also tempted by the chance to audition in the UK \u2013 she thought she might get a chance, somehow, to meet the British director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/15/cow-review-andrea-arnold-deeply-moving-chronicle-of-the-life-of-a-dairy-cow\">Andrea Arnold</a>.</p> <p>In Borat, her character Tutar dreams of becoming like \u201cPrincess Melania\u201d and becomes the \u201cgift\u201d Borat is supposed to deliver to one of Trump\u2019s men, first the vice-president Mike Pence, and then Rudy Giuliani, to strengthen relations between their countries. Bakalova was a revelation in the film, infusing her character with a life-changing feminist trajectory while also having to pull off some excruciating scenes with \u201creal\u201d people, including leading an anti-abortion campaigner at a clinic to believe she was pregnant with her father\u2019s baby and describing, to a group of women at a Republican conference, having just masturbated for the first time in the loos.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I did it,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I will I ever be able to do it again. It\u2019s so strange, and I think that is why Sacha\u2019s work is so brilliant. He challenges people, he does these movies that are like a social experiment of how far can you go?\u201d It was \u201cdefinitely difficult\u201d she says. With only one shot, did it feel like a lot of pressure not to mess it up, or come out of character? \u201cSacha was so gracious, he was holding my hand every step of the way and guiding me, and I trusted him.\u201d</p>    <p>There is a scene with Giuliani, which created a lot of attention. Tutar, by now a reporter for a rightwing news channel, is conducting a fawning interview with the former New York mayor and attorney to Trump in a hotel suite, before suggesting they go to the bedroom. Giuliani is filmed lying back on the bed with his hands down the front of his trousers (later, he claimed he was rearranging his clothes after removing a microphone). Was it the plan to get him in the bedroom? \u201cYou can only plan so much, but it\u2019s about real people, real places, real situations. You can have goals that you want to achieve, but it depends on the moment. It was ideal to see how far things can get.\u201d Was she nervous? \u201cIt was nerve-racking, because you don\u2019t know how these things are going to turn. We worked with a great team of people. We had a great security team, we had a great stunt team. We had a lot of people that made sure we were all safe.\u201d</p> <p>It helps, she says, having female producers \u2013 Monica Levinson on Borat, and Amy Baer on The Apprentice. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a female perspective behind the scenes, [and] if you\u2019re doing such challenging roles, both as Ivana or Tutar, having a female there looking after you, looking after the story.\u201d</p> <p>Bakalova has voiced a character in Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 (Cosmo the Spacedog), was in the dark comedy Bodies Bodies Bodies and has just finished shooting a family drama, Learning to Breathe Underwater \u2013 but in Borat and The Apprentice, her two standout films are about Trump. It is strange, she admits, but adds: \u201cI think Borat is not about Trump. I do find a few similarities between the movies because they explore the American empire, and that land that we all have heard is the place you can feel freedom and opportunity. But both movies show there is always a dark side to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Apprentice is released in cinemas on 18 October.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

      "bodyText": "The week Maria Bakalova was asked to consider playing Ivana Trump for the new film The Apprentice, she was in New York filming something else. With the meeting scheduled for her one day off, she spent the evening before trying to channel Donald Trump\u2019s first wife. The film is set in the 70s and 80s, so she spent hours wading through photos of Ivana in that era. \u201cA lot of makeup, a lot of hair,\u201d she says. Bakalova laughs as she remembers spending the evening experimenting with a mushroom-like hairstyle and \u201cheavy eyeliner with a lot of powder, like inches\u201d, although she didn\u2019t have an Ivana-esque wardrobe \u2013 \u201cAm I gen Z or a millennial?\u201d asks the 28-year-old. Either way, \u201cWe wear a lot of baggy clothes\u201d, so she chose her most skintight outfit. She met the director Ali Abbasi in the middle of the day, feeling a little clownish in her Ivana cosplay. They spoke for a couple of hours, \u201cabout people growing up in post-communist countries \u2013 because [Ivana] was from Czechoslovakia, and I was born and raised in Bulgaria \u2013 which shapes your inner world, your thoughts. We talked a lot about the similarities of our stories.\u201d Ivana had been a competitive skier, with a place on the national junior team that allowed her to compete outside communist Czechoslovakia in the late 60s. By the mid-90s, when Bakalova was born, Bulgaria was no longer a socialist republic but, for most people, travel outside the country was still rare. As a child, Bakalova, a competitive singer, got to travel to competitions all around Europe. It opened her eyes and instilled a sense of independence. This is Bakalova\u2019s highest profile role since her big break in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s 2020 mockumentary sequel about the Kazakhstani reporter Borat Sagdiyev. She played Borat\u2019s daughter, Tutar, in a performance so cringingly brilliant it got her an Oscar nomination. Despite this early success, Bakalova says her agents warned her not to get her hopes up about the role of Ivana \u2013 higher profile US actors were also in the running. \u201cWhat I think is important is that [Abbasi] gave a chance to an eastern European to compete,\u201d she says. \u201cTo have the opportunity, rather than just playing a prostitute or a crazy Russian scientist or a mobster or somebody that is just in the background with a few lines.\u201d It was six months before she found out that she\u2019d got the role, followed by a tortuous journey to get the film made and released. In a Vanity Fair piece, the film\u2019s screenwriter, Gabriel Sherman, detailed the various obstacles \u2013 actors who didn\u2019t want to \u201chumanise\u201d Trump, Hollywood studios and streamers who wouldn\u2019t finance it, Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban that made it difficult for Abbasi, who is Iranian and based in Denmark, to work in the US (as well as the actors\u2019 strikes and a global pandemic). The Apprentice\u2019s largest investor, a film-making son-in-law of a billionaire and prominent Trump donor, reportedly threatened to sink the film once he\u2019d seen it, because of a scene in which the Trump character appears to rape his wife. Ivana alleged Trump raped her in her divorce deposition, but later retracted. Trump\u2019s lawyers sent the film-makers cease-and-desist letters and the big American distributors wouldn\u2019t touch it. \u201cHollywood fashions itself as a community of truth tellers,\u201d wrote Sherman, \u201cbut here they were running from a movie to prepare for a Trump presidency.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been facing a bit of difficulty to release it,\u201d says Bakalova, with comic understatement. In the film, Trump (played by a toupeed Sebastian Stan) is ambitious but slightly awkward and in the shadow of his father. He is then mentored and moulded by nefarious lawyer Roy Cohn (played, typically magnificently, by Succession\u2019s Jeremy Strong), whom Bakalova describes as \u201cone of the most vicious people of our century\u201d. A cinephile, Bakalova was desperate to work with Abbasi \u2013 she was a huge fan of his work, including Holy Spider, the Iranian serial killer film. She wanted, she says, to be involved in his \u201cdive into the underbelly of the American empire\u201d. The more she researched Trump\u2019s first wife \u2013 and the mother of three of his children \u2013 the more she found herself fascinated by how much Ivana achieved on her own. \u201cShe wanted to be Donald\u2019s partner,\u201d she says. Ivana is credited with promoting the couple\u2019s 80s glitz, she was involved in running part of his businesses and managed New York\u2019s Plaza hotel. \u201cI think she was the reason he achieved so much early because she was very smart, very ambitious.\u201d In the film, the power balance between Ivana and Donald is in her favour at the start of their relationship; Ivana is horrified at the idea of a prenup, and the measly amount it would give her in the event of a separation, and negotiates a better deal. \u201cI saw an interview with her after the divorce, saying she didn\u2019t know anything about prenups, and why do you need to have them?

In its \u2018Gap Analysis\u2019, shared with the Guardian before publication, Liberties said that while it welcomed the commission\u2019s \u201ccommitment to prioritising the rule of law\u201d, its \u201ctriumphant rhetoric\u201d on the scale of the problem was unjustified. With von der Leyen\u2019s second commission due to take office by the end of the year, Liberties said \u201csignificant improvement is needed urgently\u201d in the executive\u2019s strategy to tackle democratic backsliding across several member states. The EU\u2019s executive paints \u201ctoo rosy a picture\u201d of the actual progress and impact of its recommendations, Liberties alleged, noting that the commission\u2019s 2024 report claims 68% of its 2023 rule of law recommendations were implemented by member states. In fact, the group said, many of these reforms had already been announced by capitals, or were allegedly under way but incomplete and not yet evaluated, meaning it would be truer to say only 19% of 2023 recommendations were implemented. Implementation in some countries is a huge problem, Liberties said, noting that in those where the rule of law is in decline, such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Romania, EU recommendations were \u201ccompletely or partly disregarded\u201d in 2023. Some mature democracies also \u201crefuse or make only minimal efforts to comply\u201d, it said. \u201cAustria, France and Germany really should be implementing the commission\u2019s recommendations,\u201d Kazai said. \u201cThe fact that they don\u2019t encourages others [not to].\u201d Plus, he said, \u201cthe commission tends to see progress where there isn\u2019t any, or when it simply hasn\u2019t been measured\u201d. Liberties said that to be genuinely effective, the commission\u2019s report must be fully incorporated into the EU rule of law toolkit, with insufficient implementation of the commission\u2019s recommendations rapidly triggering enforcement actions. There are some signs that the commission is listening to criticism, Kazai said, with the mission letter of the new justice commissioner referencing closer ties between the report and enforcement mechanisms. But Kazai also said more was needed. \u201cThe rule of law is being systematically dismantled by some governments and the next commission must do better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s 14 years since the rule of law crisis began. We can\u2019t wait \u2013 what has happened in Hungary can\u2019t happen in Slovakia.\u201d",

Trump called the lack of conversation between Biden and Netanyahu in nearly two months \u201cpathetic\u201d. Former president Bill Clinton urged churchgoers in Albany, Georgia, to rally behind Harris\u2019 campaign. \u201cUniting people and building, being repairers of the breach, as Isaiah says, those are the things that work,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBlaming, dividing, demeaning \u2013 they get you a bunch of votes at election time, but they don\u2019t work.\u201d Georgia is one of seven states seen as pivotal in this year\u2019s presidential race, and turnout among Black voters could hold the key for Democrats to winning the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian classifications review board has been ordered to review its assessment of the book Gender Queer, after the federal court found the board had ignored, overlooked or misunderstood public submissions for it to be censored. Last year, the Classification Review Board rejected calls to restrict access to a memoir about gender identity that was the target of conservative campaigns to have it banned in the US, and found the content was appropriate for its intended audience. Rightwing activist Bernard Gaynor had applied to the board early last year to review the classification of the graphic novel-style memoir about gender identity by writer Maia Kobabe. Complaints about the book \u2013 which details Kobabe\u2019s experience coming out as non-binary \u2013 are focused on the cartoon images of sex scenes, one of which has been described by critics seeking a ban as \u201cpornographic\u201d and \u201cpaedophilic\u201d. After a review of the classification last year, including seeking comment from the public, the board kept the original classification as unrestricted, with the consumer advice of \u201cM \u2013 not recommended for readers under 15 years\u201d. Gaynor appealed against the ruling to the federal court. Gaynor\u2019s barrister, Bret Walker SC, argued there was a \u201cbroadbrush dismissal\u201d of submissions the board claimed were anti-LGBTQ+. Walker said many of them objected to what they saw as depicting a man having sex with a minor \u2013 referring to an image portraying Plato\u2019s Symposium. Walker said many of those objections did not refer to the gender of the image\u2019s subjects, just that it appeared to depict paedophilia. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email In his ruling quashing the board\u2019s decision on Monday, Justice Ian Jackman agreed with Walker\u2019s argument. \u201cThe fundamental flaw in that submission is that, as I have said above, the Review Board\u2019s description of the public submissions overwhelmingly being \u2018broadly anti-LGBTQIA+\u2019 demonstrates that the review board ignored, overlooked or misunderstood those submissions,\u201d he said. \u201cIn light of that finding, the review board\u2019s view that the submissions contained little or no evidence that the writers had read the publication, understood the content within the context of the publication, or failed to demonstrate engagement with the publication also proceed from, and are infected by, the review board having ignored, overlooked or misunderstood the submissions.\u201d Jackman said only 66 of the 576 submissions opposing the classification \u201ccan be rationally treated\u201d as anti-LGBTQ, and that was not an overwhelming number as the board had said. \u201cOnly about 11.5% of the public submissions by number, and less than 1% of the individuals who made submissions, can thus be described as \u2018broadly anti-LGBTQIA+\u2019 \u2026 The majority of the review board whose reasons were published in the decision cannot have read and understood the public submissions in expressing the view that they did.\u201d Jackman ordered the previous classifications decision to be quashed, for the review board to reclassify the book, and for the government to pay Gaynor\u2019s costs. In the US, Gender Queer is one of the most challenged books in libraries. Kobabe told the ABC in May that the US push to ban the book had been frustrating and that the depiction of Plato\u2019s Symposium had been included as it was the only gay-themed texts Kobabe had encountered in college. Kobabe had said that the book would likely have been challenged even without the images that were the focus of this case. \u201cI think that the challenges are coming from a place of people just trying to limit queer, trans and non-binary voices in the public sphere,\u201d Kobabe said. \u201cAnd I think the fact that my book has the title Gender Queer, I think the fact that it\u2019s a comic, I think the fact that it\u2019s won several major literary awards in the United States, and also that it is a happy story. \u201cIt is a story of acceptance.

The 81% drop is the steepest decline in history for a comic book movie, and among the steepest domestic declines for any movie. An 81% drop places Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux in the top 20 biggest second weekend drops ever, according to charts by Box Office Mojo, which measures box office data gathered since 1982.

secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the direction of the President, Secretary Austin authorized the deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and associated crew of U.S. military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel\u2019s air defenses following Iran\u2019s unprecedented attacks against Israel on April 13 and again on October 1. </p> <p>The THAAD Battery will augment Israel\u2019s integrated air defense system. This action underscores the United States\u2019 ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran. It is part of the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months, to support the defense of Israel and protect Americans from attacks by Iran and Iranian-aligned militias.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Sunday\u2019s announcement marks the third THAAD system to be deployed to the region. Following Hamas\u2019s October 7 attacks on Israel, Joe Biden authorised the deployment of a THAAD battery to the region. In 2019, the US deployed a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training and an integrated air defense exercise, the Pentagon said. </p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670bf0788f08e1594c64c0b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-13T16:11:19.129Z\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Palestinian civilians and aid workers in the Gaza Strip say \u201cno one is talking about\u201d the bloodshed there and ceasefire hopes are receding as the world\u2019s attention shifts to Lebanon. </strong></p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s Bethan McKernan reports:</p> <p><em>As Israeli bombs began to fall across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon\">Lebanon</a>, the scenes of bloodshed and chaos were grimly familiar to the people of Gaza.

The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said late Sunday that a WHO-Red Cross operation had managed to resupply two hospitals in northern Gaza. WHO and partners finally managed to reach Kamal Adwan and Al-Sahaba hospitals yesterday after 9 attempts this past week.\u201d In his statement, Tedros said the team delivered 20,000 litres of fuel to keep Kamal Adwan and Al- Awda functional. 23,000 litres of fuel to Al-Sahaba Hospital. 800 blood units, along with essential medicines and medical supplies to Al-Sahaba Hospital. One-off missions are not enough. There is a sustained need for resupplying hospitals to keep them functioning. We reiterate our call for sustained facilitation of humanitarian missions and ensuring safety for humanitarian staff; and for a ceasefire. Israeli media is reporting that the head of Israel\u2019s security service \u2013 Shin Bet \u2013 secretly vistied Cairo on Sunday, where he met met with Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel. According to reports in the Times of Israel and the Jerusalem Post, the purpose of the visit was to find ways to restart the stalled talks over a possible hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza. According to the reports, this was the first visit by a top Israeli official to Cairo since late August, when ongoing negotiations for a pause in fighting in Gaza broke down. Since then, the focus of the conflict has moved north, with Israel\u2019s incursion into southern Lebanon and attacks on Hezbollah targets in Beirut. Lebanese journalists and activists have demanded justice for Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah, who was killed a year earlier in what multiple probes said was Israeli tank fire while covering cross-border clashes in south Lebanon. Two strikes in quick succession on 13 October, 2023 killed Abdallah and wounded six other journalists including AFP photographer Christina Assi and video journalist Dylan Collins. Assi later had a leg amputated and spent five months in intensive care in hospital as a result of the attack. Two investigations have pointed to an Israeli tank being behind the attack, but Israel has denied it targets \u201ccivilians, including journalists\u201d. Lebanese rights group Maharat called on the international community to \u201cimplement treaties, resolutions and commitments to protect journalist\u201d. In a post on X, journalist Salman Andary demanded \u201cjustice for Issam and for all the victims of this crime\u201d. On Thursday, the Committee to Protect Journalists decried a lack of accountability for Israel over the killing of Abdallah. CPJ chief executive Jodie Ginsberg said that \u201cin spite of extensive evidence of a war crime, a year on from the attack, Israel has faced zero accountability for the targeting of journalists\u201d. The journalists were working near the border village of Alma al-Shaab in an area that has been the site of near-daily clashes between the Israeli army and Hezbollah. An AFP investigation in December pointed to a tank shell only used by the Israeli army being fired in the attack. A separate Reuters probe, including initial findings from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), found two Israeli tank rounds fired from the same position across the border were used. An Israeli military spokesman said after the strike: \u201cWe are very sorry for the journalist\u2019s death\u201d, adding that Israel was \u201clooking into\u201d the incident, without taking responsibility. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry on Sunday said Israeli strikes across Lebanon a day earlier killed 51 people. Saturday\u2019s death toll included at least 22 people killed in three areas outside Hezbollah\u2019s traditional strongholds. Among those were 16 people killed in Maaysra, a Shiite village in a Christian-majority area north of Beirut, the ministry said. The strikes also killed four people in Barja in the Shouf district south of the capital. In the country\u2019s south, the ministry said strikes killed 10 people in the Nabatiyeh area, whose main market was hit by strikes late Saturday. Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,300 people since 23 September, according to an AFP news agency tally of official figures. Most strikes have targeted south and east Lebanon, as well as the densely populated Beirut southern suburbs where Hezbollah holds sway. But several air raids have also hit areas in central Beirut. Hezbollah threatened Israel with more attacks if its offensive in Lebanon continues, after a drone attack on a base killed four soldiers on Sunday. In a statement, the groups said it \u201cpromises the enemy that what it witnessed today in southern Haifa is nothing compared to what awaits it if it decides to continue its aggression against our... people.\u201d In what it described as a \u201ccomplex\u201d operation, the Iran-backed group said it had launched dozens of missiles towards Nahariya and Acre north of Haifa \u201cwith the goal of keeping Israeli defence systems busy\u201d. At the same time, it launched \u201csquadrons of various drones, some of which were being used for the first time, towards various areas in Acre and Haifa, where they were able to get past Israeli air defence radars without being detected\u201d and hit the training camp in Binyamina south of Haifa. They \u201cexploded in the rooms where dozens of officers and soldiers of the Israeli enemy were present\u201d. Israel\u2019s military said four soldiers were killed in the attack, the deadliest such assault on an Israeli base since 23 September, when Israel increased its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon. After claiming the Binyamina attack, Hezbollah said it had launched missiles at a \u201cmaintenance and rehabilitation base\u201d of the army, also south of Haifa. The incident comes two days after air raid sirens sounded in central Israel after two aerial drones entered the country from Lebanon. At least one building north of Tel Aviv was damaged during the incident. Hezbollah has been regularly firing rockets and drones into Israel for more than a year, but has reached further since the fighting escalated in late September. Israel\u2019s air defences, including the Iron Dome system, have intercepted most of the projectiles, with few casualties caused by strikes or falling debris. More now on the accusations that Israeli troops have fired on and endangered UN peacekeepers operating in southern Lebanon. Israel\u2019s UN ambassador Danny Danon said on Sunday it was \u201cincomprehensible\u201d that the United Nations would not move peacekeepers out of areas in southern Lebanon where Israeli forces are battling Hezbollah militants. His message cam after the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated Israeli calls for Unifil troops to evacuate. Netanyahu was speaking after the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon said two Israeli tanks destroyed a gate and forcibly entered a base in the south of the country. Danon also said in his statement that the details of that incident were being investigated. Hezbollah terrorists are using UNIFIL outposts as hiding places and as places of ambushes. The U.N.\u2019s insistence on keeping the UNIFIL soldiers in the line of fire is incomprehensible.\u201d Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said Israeli shelling late on Sunday on had killed at least 15 people at a school serving as a shelter for displaced Palestinians in central Gaza\u2019s Nuseirat camp. The Al-Mufti school was bombarded with a large volley of Israeli artillery, resulting in an initial death toll of 15 martyrs, including children, women and entire families, and 50 wounded.\u201d This school shelters hundreds of displaced people from different families, including some from Gaza, the south, and various parts of the Gaza Strip.\u201d The Israeli military said it was \u201clooking into the reports\u201d. The attack comes just days after an Israeli air strike on a school killed at least 28 people in Gaza\u2019s Deir el-Balah. Israel\u2019s military regularly accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter - a charge denied by the Palestinian militant group. Four Israeli soldiers were killed in a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base adjacent to Binyamina in northern Israel, the IDF has announced. Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said even others were severely injured. Previously, Israel\u2019s N12 News television said at least 67 people were wounded in the attack on the Israeli military\u2019s Golani Brigade in Binyamina, northern Israel. Hagari said the incident was being investigated. Last night (Sun), an unmanned aircraft belonging to the terrorist organisation Hezbollah hit a military base near Binyamin. All the injured were taken to the hospitals and a message was given to their families. In the incident, four IDF soldiers were killed and seven soldiers were seriously injured. A message was given to their families and their names were added for later publication.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: The US will send an antimissile system to Israel as well as a crew of US military personnel to operate the system. In a statement released on Sunday, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said that the US will also send an \u201cassociated crew of US military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel\u2019s air defenses\u201d. Israeli rescuers said more than 60 people were wounded in a Hezbollah claimed drone strike, Agence France-Presse reports. In a Facebook statement on Sunday, the Israeli rescue service United Hatzalah said: \u201cWith the help of United Hatzalah ambulance teams, we provided assistance to over 60 wounded people with varying degrees of injuries \u2013 critical, serious, moderate and mild.\u201d Sixteen people have been killed during Israel\u2019s raid on Al Ma\u2019asara in Lebanon\u2019s Keserwan district. In a post on Sunday updating the death toll from yesterday\u2019s attacks, the Lebanese health ministry said that in addition to the 16 people killed, 21 people were injured. United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned on Sunday that any attacks against peacekeepers \u201cmay constitute a war crime\u201d, his spokesperson said, after Israeli tanks burst through the gates of a peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon. Reuters reports it was the latest accusation of Israeli violations and attacks against the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, in recent days. French president Emmanuel Macron urged his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian to support a \u201cgeneral de-escalation\u201d in the Middle East during a phone conversation on Sunday, the presidential office said. Reuters reports that in a separate discussion, Macron reiterated to Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati the \u201cabsolute necessity\u201d of obtaining a ceasefire in Lebanon without further delay. Here are some images coming through the newswires from Lebanon, where Israeli forces have killed more than 2,000 people in recent weeks while forcibly displacing 1.2 million people across the country: Israeli rescuers said more than 60 people were wounded in a Hezbollah claimed drone strike, Agence France-Presse reports. In a Facebook statement on Sunday, the Israeli rescue service United Hatzalah said: With the help of United Hatzalah ambulance teams, we provided assistance to over 60 wounded people with varying degrees of injuries - critical, serious, moderate and mild. On Sunday, Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201csquadron of attack drones\u201d at a military training camp in Binyamina, south of Haifa, in response to Israeli airstrikes on the country, Agence France-Presse reports. The UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has said Israeli forces forcibly entered one of its bases in the southern part of the country. The Guardian\u2019s Bethan McKernan reports: The UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has said two Israeli tanks destroyed a gate and forcibly entered a base in the south of the country as Israel\u2019s ground operation against Hezbollah moved deeper into Lebanese territory. The incident in Ramyah on Sunday morning was the latest in a string of violations that Unifil, the UN force deployed since 1978 to southern Lebanon, has blamed on the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). After the tanks left, shells exploded about 100 metres from the base, and the ensuing smoke left 15 staffers needing medical treatment for unusual symptoms despite the use of gas masks. Unifil also accused the Israeli military of holding up a logistics convoy. Read the full story here: United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned on Sunday that any attacks against peacekeepers \u201cmay constitute a war crime\u201d, his spokesperson said, after Israeli tanks burst through the gates of a peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon. Reuters reports it was the latest accusation of Israeli violations and attacks against the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, in recent days. In a statement UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said: Unifil peacekeepers remain in all positions and the UN flag continues to fly. The Secretary-General reiterates that Unifil personnel and its premises must never be targeted. Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law, including international humanitarian law. They may constitute a war crime. French president Emmanuel Macron urged his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian to support a \u201cgeneral de-escalation\u201d in the Middle East during a phone conversation on Sunday, the presidential office said. Reuters reports that in a separate discussion, Macron reiterated to Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati the \u201cabsolute necessity\u201d of obtaining a ceasefire in Lebanon without further delay. Hunger in Lebanon could soar amid Israeli onslaught on the country, a leading UN expert has warned. The Guardian\u2019s Nina Lakhani reports: Hunger and malnutrition rates could rise \u201cexponentially\u201d in Lebanon, if Israel follows through with threats to escalate the current military operation which has so far killed more than 2,000 and displaced as many as a million people, according to a leading UN expert. \u201cIsrael has the ability to starve Lebanon \u2013 like it has starved Palestinians in Gaza,\u201d said Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food. \u201cIf you look at the geography of Lebanon, Israel has the power to absolutely put a stranglehold on the food system. There is a huge risk of hunger and malnutrition rates skyrocketing very quickly in Lebanon.\u201d Acute hunger rates could rise very quickly because food security in Lebanon was precarious even before Israel launched its full-scale aerial bombardment in mid-September, as growing hostilities with Hezbollah since 7 October had already displaced 40% of local farmers, disrupting local production and interrupting trade flows and access to markets, according to the UN World Food Programme. For the full story, click here: Sixteen people have been killed during Israel\u2019s raid on Al Ma\u2019asara in Lebanon\u2019s Keserwan district. In a post on Sunday updating the death toll from yesterday\u2019s attacks, the Lebanese health ministry said that in addition to the 16 people killed, 21 people were injured. In the last few weeks, Israel has killed more than 2,000 people in Lebanon while displacing 1.2 million people across the country. The UN refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi has warned that Lebanon is seeing a \u201cmajor displacement crisis\u201d as a result of Israel\u2019s deadly attacks. At least 39 people have been injured by a drone attack in northern Israel, according to Israeli media outlets. N12 News is reporting that among the 39 people injured near Binyamina in the northern Haifa district, five were seriously injured. The outlet added that an IDF spokesperson confirmed that the drone was launched from Lebanese territory and that large medical forces have been called to the scene to treat the injured. Hezbollah aired an audio recording on Sunday of Hassan Nasrallah, its veteran leader, a little over two weeks after an Israeli strike killed him in Lebanon. In the audio, which Reuters reported, Nasrallah could be heard saying: \u201cWe count on you \u2026 to defend your people, your families, your nation, your values and your dignity, and to defend this holy and blessed land and this honourable people.\u201d According to Reuters, the recording of Nasrallah was made during a military manoeuvre. The US will send an antimissile system to Israel as well as a crew of US military personnel to operate the system. In a statement released on Sunday, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said: At the direction of the President, Secretary Austin authorized the deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and associated crew of U.S. military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel\u2019s air defenses following Iran\u2019s unprecedented attacks against Israel on April 13 and again on October 1. The THAAD Battery will augment Israel\u2019s integrated air defense system. This action underscores the United States\u2019 ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran. It is part of the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months, to support the defense of Israel and protect Americans from attacks by Iran and Iranian-aligned militias.\u201d Sunday\u2019s announcement marks the third THAAD system to be deployed to the region. Following Hamas\u2019s October 7 attacks on Israel, Joe Biden authorised the deployment of a THAAD battery to the region. In 2019, the US deployed a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training and an integrated air defense exercise, the Pentagon said. Palestinian civilians and aid workers in the Gaza Strip say \u201cno one is talking about\u201d the bloodshed there and ceasefire hopes are receding as the world\u2019s attention shifts to Lebanon. The Guardian\u2019s Bethan McKernan reports: As Israeli bombs began to fall across Lebanon, the scenes of bloodshed and chaos were grimly familiar to the people of Gaza. Mai al-Afifa, 24, was teaching a workshop about how to identify unexploded ordnance in a school turned shelter in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday when an Israeli missile hit the next building in the compound. Twenty-eight people were killed and 54 injured, according to medics at the scene. Through the smoke and rubble dust Afifa saw the body parts of two women and a male aid worker as she stumbled to safety. The Israeli military said it had used a precise strike to target Hamas fighters using the school as a command centre. \u201cWe are very sad about what is happening now in Lebanon \u2026 We have experienced this pain and loss,\u201d Afifa said. \u201cBut we also fear that Gaza will be forgotten: the massacres have increased here and no one is talking about it. All the TV channels are talking about the regional war, Iran, Israel and what is happening in Lebanon.\u201d For the full story, click here: The US is planning to send an anti-missile system to Israel, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing US officials. According to the outlet, the US is also planning to send \u201cjust under 100 troops in all\u201d to operate the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system. The White House has not released an official statement yet. An Israeli airstrike killed five children in northern Gaza on Sunday, Reuters reports. Citing Palestinian news agency WAFA, Reuters reports that the children were playing near a cafe in the Al-Shati area when they were killed by a drone strike. Since last October, Israel has killed more than 16,400 children in Gaza, making the occupied Palestinian territory the deadliest place in the world for children, according to Save the Children. Former president Donald Trump, who is the Republican presidential candidate, said he spoke with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201clike two days ago\u201d. Trump made the comments in a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday. Hezbollah fighters will not be allowed back into south Lebanon\u2019s border villages, which they have turned into underground military posts stocked with hundreds of weapons, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said on Sunday. \u201cWe will not allow the terrorists back to these places. This is vital to ensure the safety of [Israel\u2019s] northern residents,\u201d Gallant said in a video statement from the Israel-Lebanon border. The Unifil peacekeeping force in Lebanon said that it had reported additional Israeli violations against its positions in the country, including what it described as the forcible entry of Israeli tanks through its main gate on Sunday. \u201cIsrael is not invading Lebanon, it is liberating it.\u201d So proclaimed France\u2019s pre-eminent liberal philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy as Israeli tanks drove across the border and its war planes bombed villages in the south and residential districts in Beirut. \u201cThere are moments in history,\u201d he exulted, \u201cwhen \u2018escalation\u2019 becomes a necessity and a virtue.\u201d For L\u00e9vy, it is not just Lebanon that Israel is liberating, but much of the Middle East, too. L\u00e9vy is not alone in rejoicing at Israel\u2019s spreading military offensive. For many, Israel is waging war, not merely in \u201cself-defence\u201d but, in the words of president Isaac Herzog, \u201cto save western civilisation, to save the values of western civilisation\u201d, a claim echoed by many of its supporters. And the destruction of Gaza, of its hospitals and universities, and the killing of 40,000 people? And the 2,000 people killed in Lebanon in a fortnight, and the fifth of its population displaced? Collateral damage en route to saving civilisation. I should not need to say this but, as it has become commonplace to portray anyone criticising Israel\u2019s wars in Gaza and Lebanon as supporting Hamas or Hezbollah or celebrating the slaughter on 7 October last year, let me say that what Hamas did was barbarous, and that, as I wrote at the time, \u201cHamas represents a betrayal of Palestinian hopes as well as a threat to Jews\u201d. The same can be said of Hezbollah. Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni has told her Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu that attacks on UN peacekeepers in Lebanon are unacceptable, her office said on Sunday. \u201cPrime minister Meloni reiterated the unacceptability of Unifil being attacked by Israeli armed forces,\u201d the Italian government said in a statement. Italy is a significant contributor to the UN mission known as Unifil. In a phone conversation with Netanyahu, Meloni also called for the \u201cfull implementation\u201d of the UN\u2019s Security Council Resolution 1701 on Lebanon and stressed the urgent need for a de-escalation of conflict in the region, her office said. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister has condemned Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s call to UN chief Antonio Guterres to remove peacekeepers from the Lebanese side of the border. Lebanon \u201ccondemns Netanyahu\u2019s position and the Israeli aggression against Unifil,\u201d said Najib Mikati. \u201cThe warning that Netanyahu addressed to \u2026 Guterres demanding the removal of the Unifil represents a new chapter in the enemy\u2019s approach of not complying [with international norms],\u201d he added. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), is a mission of about 9,500 troops of various nationalities and was created following Israel\u2019s 1978 invasion of Lebanon. As AFP reports, it is currently tasked with monitoring a ceasefire that ended a 33-day war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah. Forty contributor nations to Unifil said on Saturday that they \u201cstrongly condemn recent attacks\u201d on the peacekeepers. \u201cSuch actions must stop immediately and should be adequately investigated,\u201d said the joint statement, posted on X by the Polish UN mission and signed by nations including leading contributors Indonesia, Italy and India. Benjamin Netanyahu said the criticism of Israel was misplaced and should be directed at Hezbollah. \u201cInstead of criticising Israel, they should direct their criticism to Hezbollah, which uses Unifil as a human shield, just as Hamas in Gaza uses Unrwa as a human shield,\u201d he said of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. Associated Press has more on Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s comments about UN peacekeepers, saying they serve as \u201chuman shields\u201d for Hezbollah after Israeli strikes wounded five of them in recent days. The Israeli military has warned the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) to evacuate southern Lebanon as it carries out air and ground operations against Hezbollah militants, but the peacekeepers have so far refused. Netanyahu said Sunday that their refusal to clear out \u201chas the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields,\u201d saying they had become \u201chostages of Hezbollah\u201d. \u201cWe regret the injury to the Unifil soldiers and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injury. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone,\u201d he said in a video addressed to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who has been banned from entering Israel. The military has ordered the peacekeepers to move five kilometers (three miles) north, which would effectively keep them from doing their mission. They have already halted patrols because of air and ground attacks. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the United Nations on Sunday to evacuate troops in its Unifil peacekeeping force from combat areas in Lebanon. Netanyahu said the military had asked the UN to evacuate the soldiers repeatedly, adding that their presence in the area made them hostages of Hezbollah. The Israeli military ordered residents on Sunday of 21 more Lebanese villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali river which flows through southern Lebanon, as it intensifies its attacks in the region. Iran has \u201cno red lines\u201d when it comes to defending its people and interests, foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said in a post on X on Sunday, as the region braces for Israel\u2019s retaliation following Iran\u2019s recent missile attack. A family of eight, including six children, have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on central Gaza, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported, as Israel continued its devastating assault on the territory and its siege of the northern Jabalia refugee camp stretched into an eighth day. Eight members of the Abu Ghali family were killed in a strike on a home in Nuseirat refugee camp, Wafa reported, and their bodies taken to al-Awda hospital. The dead comprised Walid Abu Ghali, his wife, Shireen, and their six children: Mohammad, Ahmad, Yasmeen, Samah, Yara, and Tala. Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz reiterated on Sunday that the country considers UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres persona non grata due to his failure to condemn Iran\u2019s missile attack and what Katz described as antisemitic and anti-Israel conduct. Katz had said on 2 October that he was barring UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres from entering the country because he had not \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned the missile attack, Reuters reported. More than 42,227 Palestinians have been killed and 98,464 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Israeli forces widened their raid into northern Gaza, and tanks reached the north edge of Gaza City, pounding some districts of the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, residents said, forcing many families to leave their homes. Residents said Israeli forces have effectively isolated Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahiya in the far north of the territory from Gaza City, blocking access between the two areas except upon their permission for families willing to leave the three towns, heeding evacuation orders, Reuters reported. US officials believe Israel has narrowed down targets in its potential response to Iran\u2019s attack this month to military and energy infrastructure, NBC reported on Saturday. The Middle East remains on high alert for further escalation in a year of war as Israel battles Iran-backed groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has accused the Coalition of shifting positions on the US alliance and Middle East ceasefires for political reasons, after it appeared to abandon its insistence that US and Australian policy must always align. Wong called for Peter Dutton to clarify the Coalition\u2019s position on the United States\u2019 support for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon after the shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, distanced the Coalition from the US stance. Hunger and malnutrition rates could rise \u201cexponentially\u201d in Lebanon, if Israel follows through with threats to escalate the current military operation which has so far killed more than 2,000 and displaced as many as a million people, according to a leading UN expert. \u201cIsrael has the ability to starve Lebanon \u2013 like it has starved Palestinians in Gaza,\u201d said Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food. \u201cIf you look at the geography of Lebanon, Israel has the power to absolutely put a stranglehold on the food system. There is a huge risk of hunger and malnutrition rates skyrocketing very quickly in Lebanon.\u201d A top United Nations official said during a visit to Beirut on Saturday that he is concerned that Lebanon\u2019s ports and airport might be taken out of service, with serious implications for food supplies as Israel continues its offensive against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. \u201cWhat I have seen and heard today is devastating, but the sense is that this can get much worse still, and that needs to be avoided,\u201d said Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the UN World Food Program, in an interview with AP. The African Union has joined 104 UN member states in issuing a joint letter of support for UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres after Israel declared him persona non grata. In the letter, the UN member states wrote: \u201cSuch actions undermine the United Nations\u2019 ability to carry out its mandate, which includes mediating conflicts and providing humanitarian support.\u201d Thirty-four Unifil-contributing countries have signed a joint statement reaffirming the protection of Unifil peacekeepers in Lebanon and condemning the latest attacks against them. The letter, which was initiated by Poland, comes after five peacekeepers in Lebanon were wounded in recent days amid Israel\u2019s attacks on the country. Israeli raids on al-Maaysra, in the Keserwan district, in Lebanon have killed at least nine people while wounding 15 others, the Lebanese health ministry announced. The health ministry added that in Deir Bella, Batroun, Israeli attacks have killed at least two people and injured four others. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society evacuated 16 patients and 14 of their companions from Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The mission, which lasted 12 hours, comes as Israel expands its deadly invasion into north Gaza. In recent days, Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians sheltering in north Gaza, including 22 people in the area\u2019s Jabalia refugee camp. UN peacekeepers will remain in south Lebanon, despite five of their members being wounded amid Israeli airstrikes on the country. In a statement to Agence France-Presse on Saturday, Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), said that despite Israel\u2019s request to Unifil to withdraw from positions \u201cup to five kilometers from the blue line\u201d, the peacekeepers refused. Israeli airstrikes have forced 40% of students from their homes in Lebanon, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on Friday. Additionally, more than 60% of public schools in the country are being used as shelters. Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed 2,255 people while wounding 10,524 more since Israel launched its attacks on the country several weeks ago, the Lebanese health ministry reported on Saturday. The rising death toll also comes amid Israel\u2019s forced displacement of 1.2 million people in Lebanon, approximately a quarter of the country\u2019s population. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has accused the Coalition of shifting positions on the US alliance and Middle East ceasefires for political reasons, after it appeared to abandon its insistence that US and Australian policy must always align. Wong called for Peter Dutton to clarify the Coalition\u2019s position on the United States\u2019 support for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon after the shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, distanced the Coalition from the US stance. \u201cA few days ago, Mr Dutton said the prime minister should be condemned for calling for a ceasefire,\u201d Wong said on Sunday, referring to Dutton\u2019s refusal to back a government motion in parliament on Monday marking the first anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks. \u201cNow the Liberals finally realise they\u2019re at odds with the international community, including the United States, who are all pressing for peace \u2013 but he [Dutton] still can\u2019t bring himself to do so.\u201d Iran has \u201cno red lines\u201d when it comes to defending its people and interests, foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said in a post on X on Sunday, as the region braces for Israel\u2019s retaliation following Iran\u2019s recent missile attack The Israeli military ordered residents on Sunday of 21 more Lebanese villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali river which flows through southern Lebanon, as it intensifies its attacks in the region.

Katz had said on 2 October that he was barring UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres from entering the country because he had not \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned the missile attack, Reuters reported. Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on 1 October amid an escalation in fighting between Israel and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. Many were intercepted in flight but some penetrated missile defences. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the United Nations on Sunday to evacuate troops in its Unifil peacekeeping force from combat areas in Lebanon. Netanyahu said the military had asked the UN to evacuate the soldiers repeatedly, adding that their presence in the area made them hostages of Hezbollah. Earlier this week, Israeli troops fired on UN headquarters in southern Lebanon, injuring two peacekeepers for the second time in as many days. On Saturday, it was reported by the United Nations that another peacekeeper was injured by gunfire in the country\u2019s south. More than 42,227 Palestinians have been killed and 98,464 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Hunger and malnutrition rates could rise \u201cexponentially\u201d in Lebanon, if Israel follows through with threats to escalate the current military operation which has so far killed more than 2,000 and displaced as many as a million people, according to a leading UN expert. \u201cIsrael has the ability to starve Lebanon \u2013 like it has starved Palestinians in Gaza,\u201d said Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food. \u201cIf you look at the geography of Lebanon, Israel has the power to absolutely put a stranglehold on the food system.

Access to adequate food is becoming increasingly challenging, as entire communities have been forced to abandon their homes and farmland in southern Lebanon and as civilian areas in Beirut come under heavy aerial attack. Israeli forces widened their raid into northern Gaza, and tanks reached the north edge of Gaza City, pounding some districts of the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, residents said, forcing many families to leave their homes. Residents said Israeli forces have effectively isolated Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahiya in the far north of the territory from Gaza City, blocking access between the two areas except upon their permission for families willing to leave the three towns, heeding evacuation orders, Reuters reported. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said the eight-day-old Israeli incursions in the north have so far killed dozens of Palestinians, with dozens of others feared dead on roads and under rubble of their houses, beyond the reach of medical teams. Many Jabalia residents posted on social media platforms: \u201cWe will not leave, we die, and we don\u2019t leave.\u201d US officials believe Israel has narrowed down targets in its potential response to Iran\u2019s attack this month to military and energy infrastructure, NBC reported on Saturday. The Middle East remains on high alert for further escalation in a year of war as Israel battles Iran-backed groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Israel has repeatedly said it will respond to Iran\u2019s missile barrage on 1 October, which was launched in retaliation for Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza and Lebanon and the killings of a string of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. There is no indication that Israel will target nuclear facilities or carry out assassinations, the NBC report said, citing unnamed US officials and adding that Israel has not made final decisions about how and when to act. US and Israeli officials said a response could come during the current Yom Kippur holiday, according to the report. When the Sabra family fled Israeli bombardments in the southern Lebanese town of Marjayoun for Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in October last year, a monthly stipend in dollars from Hezbollah meant they did not fear going hungry. When they were displaced a second time, to the mountains around the capital by a wave of Israeli attacks on southern Beirut, regular deliveries of meals, food parcels and even cleaning supplies from organisations connected to the group have kept them afloat. \u201cThey are taking incredible care of us even with everything that is happening. They never leave us alone,\u201d said Hind Sabra, whose name has been changed. Their house of 14 people contains three families, each receiving a $200 (\u00a3150) monthly stipend in cash as well as cut-price medications, and food parcels containing rice, oil, tuna and beans. The food, medication and cash are all part of a network of support long maintained by Hezbollah, including a de facto bank that has flourished amid Lebanon\u2019s years-long financial crisis, a fund that cares for the families of those killed in battle, and a social care organisation responsible for distributing cash payments to tens of thousands displaced earlier this year, according to a Hezbollah official. Over the past two decades, Hezbollah has come to dominate the various groups that make up Lebanon\u2019s fractured and sectarian politics, as well as exerting control over key industries such as agriculture and construction in the south. Lina Khatib of Chatham House said the group\u2019s status had grown to \u201cinfluence and control the state in Lebanon from within state institutions as well as outside them\u201d. Western countries, including the US and UK, have placed sanctions on Hezbollah and regard it as a terrorist organisation. Meanwhile the group, which comprises a paramilitary organisation and a political party, maintains a support base mainly among Lebanon\u2019s working-class Shia Muslim community that see Hezbollah as a defender of their interests, and essential protection against Israeli military power. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. A family of eight, including six children, have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on central Gaza, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported, as Israel continued its devastating assault on the territory and its siege of the northern Jabalia refugee camp stretched into an eighth day. Eight members of the Abu Ghali family were killed in a strike on a home in Nuseirat refugee camp, Wafa reported, and their bodies taken to al-Awda hospital. The dead comprised Walid Abu Ghali, his wife, Shireen, and their six children: Mohammad, Ahmad, Yasmeen, Samah, Yara, and Tala. Israel, meanwhile, kept up strikes on Jabalia, farther north, where aid agencies have said thousands of people are trapped as supplies dwindle and have accused Israel of shooting on those trying to flee. Residents told the news agency Associated Press that bodies were uncollected in the streets as bombing hampered rescue efforts. \u201cWhat is happening in northern Gaza now is a genocide within the genocide,\u201d Palestinian UN envoy Majed Bamya wrote in a post on X. Elsewhere, a top United Nations official said during a visit to Beirut on Saturday that he is concerned that Lebanon\u2019s ports and airport might be taken out of service, with serious implications for food supplies as Israel continues its offensive against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. \u201cWhat I have seen and heard today is devastating, but the sense is that this can get much worse still, and that needs to be avoided,\u201d said Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the UN World Food Program, in an interview with AP. He appealed for \u201call diplomatic efforts possible to try to find a political solution\u201d to the war and for supply lines to remain open. \u201cWe have huge concerns and there are many, but one of them is indeed that we need the ports and we need the supply routes to continue to be able to operate,\u201d Skau said. In other developments: The African Union has joined 104 UN member states in issuing a joint letter of support for UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres after Israel declared him persona non grata.

      "bodyText": "The mother of murdered nine-year-old Charlise Mutten has said she hates herself for putting relationships first when her daughter already loved her unconditionally. Kallista Mutten has spoken publicly for the first time since her then-fiance, Justin Stein, shot and killed Charlise in the Blue Mountains and dumped her body in a barrel in January 2022. In an emotional interview with Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes on Sunday night, Mutten described Stein \u2013 whom she had begun a relationship with while they were both in prison for serious drug-related crimes \u2013 as a \u201cmonster\u201d and \u201cpure evil\u201d. Mutten said her daughter had \u201calways longed for a dad\u201d. \u201cI am forced to live with the fact that I trusted someone with my daughter and that because of my trust in someone I put my daughter in harm\u2019s way,\u201d she said. Stein, 33, was found guilty of Charlise\u2019s murder in June and was sentenced in the New South Wales supreme court in August to the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Police located Charlise\u2019s body on 18 January 2022 near the Colo River north-west of Sydney. She had gunshot wounds to her face and lower back. Mutten told Nine she had been in a \u201cdark place\u201d after her daughter\u2019s murder because she felt the whole country was against her. \u201cI wish I had been there more. I see that now I\u2019ve got to live with that \u2013 Charlise deserved more,\u201d she said. Mutten said while she hadn\u2019t committed murder she did \u201ctake accountability for the things I have done\u201d. \u201cI regret a lot, putting relationships first. I hate myself for it. I really do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken this for me to wake up and realise that I already had someone that loved me unconditionally and he took that away from me.\u201d Mutten described Charlise as \u201cjust the most amazing little girl\u201d and said they had a deep connection even though she had been in prison and her daughter lived with her grandparents on the Gold Coast. In December 2021, Charlise went to stay with her mother and Stein, who were both in the grips of drug addiction. Charlise had an apparently happy Christmas with her mother before she was murdered. The young girl spent the night of 11 January 2022 alone with Stein at a property in the Blue Mountains owned by his parents, while Mutten stayed at the caravan park they had been holidaying at, about a 90-minute drive away. Justice Helen Wilson, who sentenced Stein, said he likely shot the girl once in the back while she was trying to flee, before approaching her and firing another shot directly into her head, on or around 12 January. Toxicology results revealed Charlise had traces in her body of the anti-psychotic drug Seroquel for which Stein had a prescription to treat schizophrenia. Wilson said it was a \u201cshockingly callous crime\u201d.",
