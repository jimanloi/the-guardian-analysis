      "bodyText": "Three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis is ending his retirement from acting to star in his son\u2019s directorial debut. The 67-year-old British actor quit acting after starring in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 2017 film Phantom Thread, and has largely stayed out of public life since. But he is now set to star in a film titled Anemone, directed by his son Ronan Day-Lewis, US independent production company Focus Features confirmed on Tuesday. The film will feature actors including Sean Bean, Samantha Morton, Samuel Bottomley and Safia Oakley-Green, and is currently shooting in Manchester. Father and son wrote the screenplay, which \u201cexplores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\u201d, Focus Features said. Daniel Day-Lewis made his screen debut as a teenager in Sunday Bloody Sunday before moving on to a number of memorable period drama roles, including as Hawkeye in The Last Of The Mohicans. He is known for his dedication to method acting, and has won three best actor Oscars, for playing disabled Irish writer Christy Brown in My Left Foot, oil man Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg\u2019s Lincoln. Day-Lewis was made a knight bachelor of the British empire by the Duke of Cambridge in 2014. In June 2017 it was announced he was retiring from acting, months before Phantom Thread was released. \u201cDaniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor,\u201d the statement, issued by his representative, read. \u201cHe is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years.

      "body": "<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Russian troops have nearly reached the centre of Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine, according to the regional governor,</strong> Vadym Filashkin, who told Ukrainian TV the situation was very difficult. Public broadcaster Suspilne quoted two soldiers of Ukraine\u2019s 72nd Mechanized Brigade defending Vuhledar as saying that while Russian forces were in control of most of the town \u201ccertain parts\u201d remained under Ukrainian control. \u201cThe brigade has received no order to leave the city,\u201d Suspilne quoted the soldiers as saying.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Vuhledar has strategic significance because of its high ground and location near the junction of the two main fronts</strong>, in eastern and southern Ukraine. The popular war blog DeepState reported that Russian forces held Vuhledar and had hoisted Russian flags throughout. Footage online showed Russian soldiers waving a flag from atop a bombed-out multi-storey building and unfurling another flag on a metal spire. Reuters said it had matched the footage to street patterns of Vuhledar.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Russia\u2019s plan to hike defence spending next year \u201cis an outrage\u201d</strong>, 80-year-old pensioner Irina told Agence France-Presse in Moscow on Tuesday. \u201c<strong>We need to end this war, and spending the budget on war is a crime</strong>.\u201d Russia is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/russias-defence-spending-to-rise-by-25-next-year-the-highest-since-the-cold-war\">spend more than 40% of its total budget on defence and security</a> \u2013 more than the money allocated for social welfare and education combined.</p></li> \n <li><p>\u201cThere is not enough for anything at all. Not for treatment, not for anything,\u201d said another Irina, 70, who complained her pension was only 25,000 rubles (US$260) a month. \u201cIt\u2019s pennies. People are unprotected. It\u2019s a shame and a disgrace that the country has no money to treat its own children.\u201d Another pensioner, Elena, 68, told AFP: \u201cThe population of the country does not live so well \u2026 I am <strong>generally against military action of any kind</strong>, in any country, in ours, and in general the whole world.\u201d</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Some in Moscow were supportive of the budget plans.</strong> \u201cIf it is not to the detriment of education, medicine, some other social programmes \u2026 <strong>In the current situation</strong>, an increase in the amount of funding is understandable,\u201d said 49-year-old lawyer Vladimir. Another Vladimir, 50, told AFP: \u201cIn the current times, it is necessary to spend money on defence, because Nato is playing against us. We have to do something and we can\u2019t do it any other way.\u201d</p></li> \n <li><p>Authorities in Ukraine have launched an investigation into what they said was an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-executing-16-pows-on-eastern-front\">apparent summary execution by Russian troops</a> of 16 Ukrainian soldiers <strong>who had surrendered on the eastern frontline</strong>. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said the alleged war crime, shown in video footage, took place on the Pokrovsk front.</p></li> \n <li><p>An apparent <strong>Russian artillery strike</strong> hit a market in the southern Ukraine city of Kherson on Tuesday, <strong>killing at least six people and wounding three others</strong>, authorities said, on a morning when people were observing a minute\u2019s silence for their military and war dead. Across Ukraine on Tuesday, traffic stopped and people on sidewalks came to a halt at 9am to commemorate <strong>those defending Ukraine and those who have sacrificed their lives</strong>.</p></li> \n <li><p>People gathered at Independence Square in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, carrying pictures of fallen soldiers.

      "bodyText": "Russian troops have nearly reached the centre of Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine, according to the regional governor, Vadym Filashkin, who told Ukrainian TV the situation was very difficult. Public broadcaster Suspilne quoted two soldiers of Ukraine\u2019s 72nd Mechanized Brigade defending Vuhledar as saying that while Russian forces were in control of most of the town \u201ccertain parts\u201d remained under Ukrainian control. \u201cThe brigade has received no order to leave the city,\u201d Suspilne quoted the soldiers as saying. Vuhledar has strategic significance because of its high ground and location near the junction of the two main fronts, in eastern and southern Ukraine. The popular war blog DeepState reported that Russian forces held Vuhledar and had hoisted Russian flags throughout. Footage online showed Russian soldiers waving a flag from atop a bombed-out multi-storey building and unfurling another flag on a metal spire. Reuters said it had matched the footage to street patterns of Vuhledar. Russia\u2019s plan to hike defence spending next year \u201cis an outrage\u201d, 80-year-old pensioner Irina told Agence France-Presse in Moscow on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to end this war, and spending the budget on war is a crime.\u201d Russia is to spend more than 40% of its total budget on defence and security \u2013 more than the money allocated for social welfare and education combined. \u201cThere is not enough for anything at all. Not for treatment, not for anything,\u201d said another Irina, 70, who complained her pension was only 25,000 rubles (US$260) a month. \u201cIt\u2019s pennies. People are unprotected. It\u2019s a shame and a disgrace that the country has no money to treat its own children.\u201d Another pensioner, Elena, 68, told AFP: \u201cThe population of the country does not live so well \u2026 I am generally against military action of any kind, in any country, in ours, and in general the whole world.\u201d Some in Moscow were supportive of the budget plans. \u201cIf it is not to the detriment of education, medicine, some other social programmes \u2026 In the current situation, an increase in the amount of funding is understandable,\u201d said 49-year-old lawyer Vladimir. Another Vladimir, 50, told AFP: \u201cIn the current times, it is necessary to spend money on defence, because Nato is playing against us. We have to do something and we can\u2019t do it any other way.\u201d Authorities in Ukraine have launched an investigation into what they said was an apparent summary execution by Russian troops of 16 Ukrainian soldiers who had surrendered on the eastern frontline. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said the alleged war crime, shown in video footage, took place on the Pokrovsk front. An apparent Russian artillery strike hit a market in the southern Ukraine city of Kherson on Tuesday, killing at least six people and wounding three others, authorities said, on a morning when people were observing a minute\u2019s silence for their military and war dead. Across Ukraine on Tuesday, traffic stopped and people on sidewalks came to a halt at 9am to commemorate those defending Ukraine and those who have sacrificed their lives. People gathered at Independence Square in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, carrying pictures of fallen soldiers. Angelina Stashenko held a portrait of her 30-year-old brother, Denys Stashenko, who was killed in action in May in the Donetsk region. His mother, Halyna Stashenko, said: \u201cI hope future generations will never forget the price our loved ones paid for their freedom \u2026 I hope Ukraine\u2019s future will be bright.\u201d Volodymyr Zelenskyy used the occasion to appeal for further support from western allies: \u201cThe daily Russian terror, the daily attempts to destroy life \u2013 all this can be stopped.

      "bodyText": "San Francisco recorded its hottest day of the year on Tuesday, and Phoenix set a record for the hottest 1 October on record, as the National Weather Service predicted record-high fall temperatures across the south-western US. With temperatures hitting 100F (38C) or higher in many places, officials and local media outlets issued warnings that the heat posed \u201ca significant threat to property or life\u201d. Excessive heat warnings were in place across the region, bringing with it warnings about elevated wildfire risk, the potential for sweeping power outages in California and a rising toll of heat-related deaths, a particularly deadly risk for unhoused people and the elderly. In San Francisco, temperatures hit 93F, while across the Bay Area, multiple cities were recording temperatures \u201cas much as 25 degrees above normal\u201d for October, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, and many Bay Area public schools cancelled outdoor athletics as a result of the heat. In Arizona, Phoenix continued to break heat record after heat record, with temperatures expected to break previous daily highs for October every day of the week. On Tuesday, the high was around 113F (45C). So far in 2024, the city has recorded 67 days with temperatures above 110F, compared with an average of about 21 in previous decades. Earlier in the summer, the city saw 100 straight days with temperatures above 100F. The record heat is bringing with it a record number of heat-related deaths. More than 666 deaths in Phoenix this year have been confirmed as heat-related, or are still under investigation as potentially heat-related, according to local public health data. Nearly half of heat-related deaths in Phoenix this year were among unhoused people, according to the public health data. In extreme heat, sidewalks and asphalt can get hot enough to give people severe burns. But dozens of recorded heat deaths in Phoenix were recorded indoors as well, including in homes where air conditioners were broken, or turned off, potentially because of concerns about cost. While older people were more at risk of heat deaths, about 40% of the Phoenix victims were under 50, according to the public health data. In Las Vegas and the rest of southern Nevada, officials said heat was a factor in the deaths of at least 342 people this year, the most ever recorded, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported last week.",

      "body": "<p>Whether fuelled by social media or prompted by the Covid lockdowns, the years between 2019 and 2022 saw a huge surge in interest in mudlarking on the foreshore of the River Thames in London.</p> <p>The practice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/20/mudlarking-thames-unlocks-london-secret-riches\">exploring the riverbank for archaeology</a> is permitted only with a permit from the Port of London authority (PLA), which owns much of the shoreline. But so dramatic was the growth in demand for permits \u2013 from 200 applications in 2018-19 to more than 5,000 three years later \u2013 that the port suspended the scheme in 2022 to \u201cprotect the integrity and archaeology of the foreshore\u201d.</p> <p>Now, after consultations with the crown estate, the London Museum and Historic England, the PLA is reopening the scheme for applications, having introduced changes that it says will make mudlarking accessible to everyone while safeguarding the river.</p> <p>Overall permit numbers will now be capped at 4,000, and these will be valid for one year rather than three. In addition, the option for permit-holders to automatically renew has been removed. Those interested can instead sign up for <a href=\"https://pla.co.uk/thames-foreshore-permits\">a waiting list</a>, which launches at midday on Wednesday 2 October.</p> <p>The changes were introduced because demand had surged to a level \u201cthat was just too much for the foreshore to sustain\u201d, said Pippa Barber, head of statutory consents and compliance at the PLA. \u201cThere is only a certain amount of foreshore, and there is only a certain amount of history. History only happens once, a pipe only gets dropped once, and once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone for ever.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the longest archeological site in the UK, with finds going back thousands and thousands of years.

      "bodyText": "Whether fuelled by social media or prompted by the Covid lockdowns, the years between 2019 and 2022 saw a huge surge in interest in mudlarking on the foreshore of the River Thames in London. The practice of exploring the riverbank for archaeology is permitted only with a permit from the Port of London authority (PLA), which owns much of the shoreline. But so dramatic was the growth in demand for permits \u2013 from 200 applications in 2018-19 to more than 5,000 three years later \u2013 that the port suspended the scheme in 2022 to \u201cprotect the integrity and archaeology of the foreshore\u201d. Now, after consultations with the crown estate, the London Museum and Historic England, the PLA is reopening the scheme for applications, having introduced changes that it says will make mudlarking accessible to everyone while safeguarding the river. Overall permit numbers will now be capped at 4,000, and these will be valid for one year rather than three. In addition, the option for permit-holders to automatically renew has been removed. Those interested can instead sign up for a waiting list, which launches at midday on Wednesday 2 October. The changes were introduced because demand had surged to a level \u201cthat was just too much for the foreshore to sustain\u201d, said Pippa Barber, head of statutory consents and compliance at the PLA. \u201cThere is only a certain amount of foreshore, and there is only a certain amount of history. History only happens once, a pipe only gets dropped once, and once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone for ever. \u201cThis is the longest archeological site in the UK, with finds going back thousands and thousands of years. And we wanted to make sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing to protect that historic foreshore, not just for the current but for future generations as well.\u201d Permits allow mudlarkers to explore the tidal riverbank between Teddington lock in Twickenham, west London, and the Thames Barrier, close to London City airport in the east, with a few exceptions, such as around Queenhithe dock in the City and the Great Eastern slipway in the Isle of Dogs, both of which are scheduled ancient monuments. The popularity of mudlarking is reflected in a forthcoming exhibition Secrets of the Thames: Mudlarking London\u2019s Lost Treasures, which opens next April at the London Museum, and promises to showcase a range of riverside finds from coins and clay pipes to a Viking-era dagger. Despite the promise of lost treasure, however, everything found by mudlarkers remains the property either of the PLA or the crown estate as landowners, and legally must be reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme at the London Museum. That applied even if items were not in themselves terribly valuable, said Barber. \u201cWhat it means is that we can keep an archeological record of the Thames,\u201d she said. \u201cIf things aren\u2019t reported, then we just don\u2019t know that they were ever there in the first place.\u201d Given the huge interest, does she fear the river\u2019s archaeology might be at risk of being exhausted? \u201cPartly; restricting the number to 4,000 is to try to stop that. But the amount that is still being found shows that that\u2019s not necessarily the case,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s about making sure that we have a wide range of people who are able to access the unique history of the foreshore, that they do it safely, and that we can protect the foreshore and its history for future generations.\u201d",

The scene where Yas is summoned to a meeting with Muck, to find the supposedly funky green innovator shirtless on the fives court of a Piccadilly gentleman\u2019s club, is blackly hilarious \u2013 but by the end of episode two, Yas\u2019s encounters with the toxic men in her life have become powerfully shocking. Lifting the veil on the caprices of the super-wealthy is one way in which Industry is a post-Succession show; another lighter pleasure the two series share is the writers\u2019 command of cultural flotsam and how people in the digital age interact. We are reacquainted with Harper (Myha\u2019la) at her desk in her new dogsbody job at an ethical investment firm \u2013 you\u2019ll need to hit pause to read the text she\u2019s just received (\u201cMy Mubi account is about to expire and we still haven\u2019t watched Decision to Leave \u2013 thoughts?\u201d), and to see that she\u2019s responding with a photo of herself with her hand down her knickers. By Industry standards that\u2019s pretty mild, but it\u2019s earned the right to be the wildest drama on TV and it doesn\u2019t pass the opportunity up. \u201cMy cortisol levels!\u201d says Anna\u2019s boss as her position on Lumi turns to ash. \u201cI constantly feel like there\u2019s an active shooter in the building.\u201d Industry thrives on that danger. \u2022 Industry airs on BBC One and is on iPlayer in the UK, and on Foxtel and Binge in Australia.",

Celtic\u2019s goal difference from the 5-1 trouncing of Slovan Bratislava had been cancelled out in one dizzying half. Rodgers believed his players had been \u201cspooked\u201d during that opening period. A disconsolate Adeyemi limped off, three minutes after the restart. This felt the biggest boost of Celtic\u2019s night. Schmeichel turned Julien Duranville\u2019s shot round a post as Dortmund pursued their half dozen. There was, however, a notable drop in intensity from Nuri Sahin\u2019s team. Their work was essentially done. Number six did come. Alistair Johnston passed the ball straight to the opposition, which led to Guirassy facing down Liam Scales. Celtic\u2019s centre-back was comfortably beaten before Guirassy wrong-footed Schmeichel. Further comedic defending brought the Dortmund seventh. Trusty, enduring a torrid time, gave the ball away. Felix Nmecha returned it with interest. There endeth Celtic\u2019s latest horror show.",

Harris will receive an on-the-ground briefing and will also provide updates on federal actions that are being taken to support emergency response and recovery efforts in Georgia and other impacted states in the southeast. The White House said on Tuesday that president Joe Biden will be traveling to North Carolina and South Carolina on Wednesday. Biden will take an aerial tour of areas impacted by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina, receive operational briefings, and greet with first responders and local officials, the White House said in an announcement. The federal government has delivered more than 2.6 million ready-to-eat meals and more than 1 million liters of water, homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. \u201cAt its peak, there were 5.1 million customers without power \u2026 we\u2019ve reduced that number of customers without power by 3.8 million people,\u201d he added. Xavier Becerra, the US health and human services secretary, has declared a public health emergency for South Carolina and Tennessee to address the health impacts of Hurricane Helene. \u201cWe will do all we can to help officials in South Carolina and Tennessee respond to the health impacts of Hurricane Helene,\u201d Becerra said in an announcement. The justice department has launched its first federal investigation of the Tulsa Race Massacre. On Monday, assistant attorney general Kristen Clarke announced the opening of the investigation under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Here is Joe Biden\u2019s statement on the negotiations between United States Maritime Alliance and the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association: \u201cNow is not the time for ocean carriers to refuse to negotiate a fair wage for these essential workers while raking in record profits. My administration will be monitoring for any price gouging activity that benefits foreign ocean carriers, including those on the USMX board.\u201d A new survey from AARP published on Tuesday has vice-president Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump 50% to 47% among likely voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. The survey, conducted between the 14th and 24th of September, also showed a significant gender gap, with Harris ahead by 19 percentage points among female voters and Trump leading by 16 points with male voters. Jimmy Carter, a Democrat who served in the White House between 1977 and 1981, celebrates his 100th birthday today, making him the first US president to reach the milestone. Carter, who has suffered from health issues, including a melanoma that spread to his liver and brain, has been in hospice care at home in Plains, Georgia, since February 2023. Democratic US vice-president Kamala Harris and former Republican president Donald Trump are expected to watch the VP debate tonight. Trump has said he would offer a play-by-play commentary of the event on social media. Here are some of the latest images coming through the newswires of Hurricane Helene: Here is Joe Biden\u2019s statement on the negotiations between United States Maritime Alliance and the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association: \u201cCollective bargaining is the best way for workers to get the pay and benefits they deserve. I have urged USMX, which represents a group of foreign-owned carriers, to come to the table and present a fair offer to the workers of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association that ensures they are paid appropriately in line with their invaluable contributions. Ocean carriers have made record profits since the pandemic and in some cases profits grew in excess of 800 percent compared to their profits prior to the pandemic. Executive compensation has grown in line with those profits and profits have been returned to shareholders at record rates. It\u2019s only fair that workers, who put themselves at risk during the pandemic to keep ports open, see a meaningful increase in their wages as well. As our nation climbs out of the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, dockworkers will play an essential role in getting communities the resources they need. Now is not the time for ocean carriers to refuse to negotiate a fair wage for these essential workers while raking in record profits. My administration will be monitoring for any price gouging activity that benefits foreign ocean carriers, including those on the USMX board.\u201d The federal government has delivered more than 2.6 million ready-to-eat meals and more than 1 million liters of water, homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. \u201cAt its peak, there were 5.1 million customers without power \u2026 we\u2019ve reduced that number of customers without power by 3.8 million people,\u201d he added. In response to a question about communities on the ground that have been badly affected by Hurricane Helene and feel that the government is not doing enough, Mayorkas said: \u201cWe are there, and we will continue to be there, and we will reach the most difficult to access locations. We are relentless in our efforts to ensure the safety and security of all.\u201d More than 100 people have been killed by Hurricane Helene across multiple states in recent days. Homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is giving an update on Hurricane Helene. During the White House press briefing, Mayorkas said, \u201cHurricane Helene is of a historic magnitude, this many states hit this hard, the wind field of the hurricane stretched 350 miles from its center.\" He added, \u201cWe are in different phases of a post hurricane environment, depending on the state and the location within the state. In some areas, we are still in search and recovery, search and rescue operations. And others, we are in the response and recovery phase.\u201d The Federal Emergency Management Agency has made federal assistance available to Georgia residents in 30 additional counties to help those impacted by Hurricane Helene. In a news release issued on Tuesday, Fema said: Individuals in Atkinson, Bacon, Ben Hill, Berrien, Bulloch, Burke, Candler, Chatham, Clinch, Colquitt, Cook, Echols, Emanuel, Evans, Glascock, Irwin, Jeff Davis, Jenkins, Johnson, Lanier, Laurens, Lincoln, McDuffie, Montgomery, Screven, Telfair, Treutlen, Ware, Washington and Wheeler counties may be eligible for grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help them recover from the effects of the disaster. According to Fema, in addition to housing expenses, survivors may be eligible for other serious disaster-related needs such as replacement of damaged personal property and expenses for transportation, childcare, moving and storage. Republicans in Nevada are dismissing an effigy of a nude Donald Trump as \u201cdeplorable\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Edward Helmore reports: A 43ft (13 meters) effigy of an entirely nude Donald Trump on the interstate from Las Vegas to Reno, Nevada, has been dismissed as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cpornographic\u201d by Republicans in the state. In a statement, the Nevada Republican party said it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the effigy of the former president, which hangs from a crane, weighs 6,000lbs, is made from foam and rebar, is titled Crooked and Obscene and is expected to be brought to other cities as part of a nationwide tour. \u201cWhile families drive through Las Vegas, they are forced to view this offensive marionette, designed intentionally for shock value rather than meaningful dialogue,\u201d said the party\u2019s statement, invoking the name of a city that was essentially founded to capitalize on gambling and sex. The artists behind the graphic effigy \u2013 who want to remain anonymous \u2013 told the Wrap that Trump\u2019s nudity was \u201cintentional, serving as a bold statement on transparency, vulnerability and the public personas of political figures\u201d. For the full story, clicl here: Kamala Harris will travel to Georgia to survey the impacts of Hurricane Helene on Wednesday, her office announced. Harris will receive an on-the-ground briefing and will also provide updates on federal actions that are being taken to support emergency response and recovery efforts in Georgia and other impacted states in the southeast. As of Monday, at least 15 people in Georgia have been killed by Hurricane Helene, including a first responder, according to local outlets. The justice department has launched its first federal investigation of the Tulsa Race Massacre. On Monday, assistant attorney general Kristen Clarke announced the opening of the investigation under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Under the act, the federal government is able to investigate civil and violent crimes committed before 1970. \u201cWe acknowledge descendants of the survivors, and the victims continue to bear the trauma of this act of racial terrorism,\u201d Clarke said, the Associated Press reports, referring to the tragedy in 1921 where white supremacists killed around hundreds of residents in Oklahoma while destroying around 1,250 homes and businesses. The event is largely considered one of the most horrific incidents of racial violence in the history of the US. Joe Biden has urged port operators to increase wages after 45,000 workers went on strike. The Guardian\u2019s Michael Sainato reports: Biden has urged port operators to give workers a \u201cmeaningful increase\u201d in pay after tens of thousands went on strike, prompting some of the busiest ports in the US to brace for crippling disruption. About 45,000 port workers represented by the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA) began walking off the job after their contracts expired at midnight, with 36 ports along the east and Gulf coasts affected. They typically handle about half of the nation\u2019s ocean shipping. Talks over a new contract between the ILA and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) have broken down, and the union dismissed a last-ditch offer from operators hours before the strike was due to began. Hours after the strike began, the White House issued a robust statement calling on USMX to negotiate a \u201cfair\u201d contract that reflects \u201cthe substantial contribution\u201d of ports workers to America\u2019s economy.

Biden will take an aerial tour of areas impacted by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina, receive operational briefings, and greet with first responders and local officials, the White House said in an announcement. Good afternoon US politics readers. We are hours away from the vice-presidential debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance, which will start at 9pm ET, and will be held in a studio without an audience. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Donald Trump said that he will be offering a play-by-play commentary of the vice-presidential debate on social media. A new poll found that a majority of voters want to hear from Tim Walz and JD Vance on immigration and economy during the debate tonight. President Joe Biden is continuing to monitor the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. Biden said that thousands of federal personnel are being deployed to help support search and rescue missions and remove debris from collapsed buildings. Biden will be traveling to North Carolina and South Carolina on Wednesday, the White House said. The president will be taking an aerial tour of the areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, receive operational briefings, and meet with first responders and local officials. The Georgia hand-count trial, regarding a lawsuit filed by Democrats challenging two new rules passed by the Georgia state election board got under way this morning. Former president Jimmy Carter is celebrating his 100th birthday today. Donald Trump is campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin on Tuesday. Public health emergencies were declared for South Carolina and Tennessee over hurricane impact. The death toll in South Carolina as a result of Hurricane Helene has now risen to 33, according to WCSC, quoting the state\u2019s department of public safety. Before Tuesday morning, the death toll was at 29. At least 133 deaths in six states in the south-east of the US have been attributed to Hurricane Helene so far, according to the Associated Press. A new survey from AARP published on Tuesday has vice-president Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump 50% to 47% among likely voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. The survey, conducted between the 14th and 24th of September, also showed a significant gender gap, with Harris ahead by 19 percentage points among female voters and Trump leading by 16 points with male voters. The survey also found that Trump leads Harris by 8 points with voters 50 years old and older. A new CBS/YouGov poll released on Monday ahead of the vice-presidential debate tonight, found that both Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance are described as \u201ccompetent\u201d by more than 50% of the registered voters surveyed. In regards to the debate tonight, 86% of respondents said they wanted to hear from the candidates about the economy, and three-quarters said they wanted to hear the candidates\u2019 views on immigration. Xavier Becerra, the US health and human services secretary, has declared a public health emergency for South Carolina and Tennessee to address the health impacts of Hurricane Helene. \u201cWe will do all we can to help officials in South Carolina and Tennessee respond to the health impacts of Hurricane Helene,\u201d Becerra said in an announcement. \u201cWe are working closely with state and local health authorities, as well as with our partners across the federal government, and stand ready to provide additional public health and medical support.\u201d Public health emergencies were also issued for Florida, Georgia and North Carolina last week, as a result of the hurricane. Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary, said on Tuesday morning that over the last several days, the Department of Defense had mobilized personnel and resources to support the ongoing disaster relief, rescue, and recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. His statement continued: I am grateful to the over 6,300 Guardsmen from over 12 states, US Northern Command, the US Army Corps of Engineers, and other DOD teammates who continue to work alongside federal, state, and local partners to provide assistance where it is needed most. We continue to stand by the people and communities of North Carolina and all those affected. Republican nominee Donald Trump will be campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin on Tuesday, ahead of vice-presidential debate. One of his stops in Wisconsin today is in Dane county, a Democratic stronghold. The former president is scheduled to appear at a manufacturing facility in Waunakee. According to the Associated Press, Trump has never campaigned in Dane county before and did not visit the county when he was president. Recent polls have shown Kamala Harris and Trump neck and neck in Wisconsin, with Harris leading narrowly by one percentage point. Kamala Harris\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign is launching a new ad focused on healthcare, it said on Tuesday. The ad features clips from the presidential debate between Harris and Republican nominee, Donald Trump, last month, in which Trump discussed having a \u201cconcept of a plan\u201d to replace the Affordable Care Act but did not give any details. In the ad, Harris says that if elected, she will extend the price caps that Joe Biden has signed for seniors, such as the price cap on insulin at $35 a month and a cap on prescription drug costs to no more than $2,000 a year, to all Americans. As of this morning, there are still more than 1 million homes and businesses without power across multiple states in the south-east of the US, from Florida to West Virginia, as the region continues to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. In South Carolina, more than 600,000 power outages are being recorded, according to PowerOutage.us. In Georgia and North Carolina, each state is recording over 450,000 power outages as of Tuesday morning. Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Saginaw, Michigan, on Thursday at 3pm ET. In 2016, the former president narrowly won Saginaw county, which sits around 100 miles north-west of Detroit and is home to around 200,000 people. However, in 2020, Joe Biden won the county. A win for Trump in Saginaw and in the battleground state of Michigan in November would be a significant blow to Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign. Last year, Trump supporters in Saginaw led a takeover of the Republican party there, and packed the local party with delegates aligned with the America First movement. You can read more about that here. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are closely monitoring the strike at the east coast and Gulf coast ports, the White House has said. Dockworkers on the two coasts began a strike earlier today, in effect halting the flow of about half the nation\u2019s ocean shipping after negotiations for a new labor contract broke down over wages. As my colleague Michael Sainato explains in this story, talks over a new contract between the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association and the United States Maritime Alliance have faltered, and the union dismissed a last-ditch offer from operators hours before the strike was due to begin. Biden\u2019s administration \u2013 which has tried to forge close relations with trade unions \u2013 has repeatedly ruled out the use of federal powers to break a strike in the event of an impasse. Alex Gangitano, the White House correspondent for the Hill, said Biden has directed his team to reiterate his message to both sides that they need to negotiate terms \u201cat the table\u201d fairly, quickly and in good faith. Jimmy Carter, a Democrat who served in the White House between 1977 and 1981, celebrates his 100th birthday today, making him the first US president to reach the milestone. Carter, who has suffered from health issues, including a melanoma that spread to his liver and brain, has been in hospice care at home in Plains, Georgia, since February 2023. \u201cI\u2019m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris\u201d in November\u2019s election, he said, according to his grandson. We reported in an earlier post about Joe Biden, the US president, issuing stark comments about the devastating impact of Hurricane Helene. Donald Trump has said he has spoken to Elon Musk and would enlist the billionaire owner of X to help restore communications to communities ravaged by the hurricane. \u201cWe want to get Starlink hooked up, because they have no communication whatsoever,\u201d Trump was quoted by Bloomberg as having said yesterday during a visit to Georgia, a state expected to be decisive in November\u2019s presidential election. The Harris campaign believes she has a chance to win Georgia, which Biden narrowly won in 2020. \u201cThroughout the region, our hearts are with you, and we are going to be with you as long as you need it,\u201d Trump said. Georgia is the state with the second most power outages caused by the storm, according to PowerOutage.US, which estimates about 471,000 customers were without power as of 05.18ET on Tuesday morning. Starlink \u2013 Musk\u2019s satellite network and the world\u2019s largest satellite operator \u2013 provides internet services via a huge network of satellites. It is typically aimed at people who live in remote areas who otherwise would not be able to get fast-speed internet connections. He said that SpaceX has sent \u201cas many Starlink terminals as possible to help areas in need\u201d of internet connection after Hurricane Helene, including those in North Carolina he says Trump alerted him to. A trial is set to get under way today on a lawsuit filed by Democrats challenging two new rules passed by the Georgia state election board that have to do with county certification of election results. The Associated Press has the following report: Supporters of the rules say they are necessary to ensure the accuracy of the vote totals before county election officials sign off on them. But critics say they worry that supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could use the rules to delay or deny certification if the former president loses the state to Democratic vice president Kamala Harris, causing confusion and casting doubt on the results. The lawsuit is to be decided in a bench trial, which means there\u2019s a judge but no jury, before Fulton county superior court judge Robert McBurney. One of the rules provides a definition of certification that includes requiring county officials to conduct a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d before certifying results, but it does not specify what that means. The other includes language allowing county election officials \u201cto examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections\u201d\u2026 The lawsuit was filed against the state election board, which is dominated by three Republican partisans whom Trump praised by name at a recent rally in Atlanta. The state and national Republican parties have joined the lawsuit on the side of the election board. My colleague Sam Levine has more: Joe Biden said entire communities have been \u201cwiped out\u201d by the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact of Hurricane Helene which has left about 600 people missing or unaccounted for, according to White House estimates. In a video clip of Biden speaking with North Carolina governor, Roy Cooper, the US president said thousands of federal personnel are being deployed to help support search and rescue missions and remove debris from collapsed buildings. The other priorities are getting cell networks back online and power restoration, Biden said, adding that recovery is \u201cgoing to take a while\u201d as the destruction of roads poses a huge logistical challenge to relief efforts. He said: I want to express condolences to all the families, to all the families whose loved ones have died or are missing. Matter of fact, it\u2019s almost equally as bad missing, not knowing whether or not your brother or sister, husband, wife, son or daughter are alive. And to the survivors, I want you to know the administration is going to be there til we finish the job. Helene made landfall last Thursday in Florida\u2019s Big Bend region as a category 4 hurricane. Even though it weakened to a tropical storm before moving through Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee, the storm\u2019s winds, rainfall, storm surge and flooding ravaged entire communities in its path and has left over 1 million Americans without power. More than 120 people are reported to have been killed across several states. The Biden administration and local officials have struggled to deliver support to the most heavily impacted states areas, where many survivors have been stranded with no electricity or running water. Biden will visit North Carolina, where the western part of the state has been devastated by flooding, tomorrow. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have expressed condolences to those impacted by the hurricane and are receiving recovery briefings from Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). Democratic US vice-president Kamala Harris and former Republican president Donald Trump are expected to watch the VP debate tonight, and Trump has said he would offer a play-by-play commentary of the event on social media. Harris was viewed by many as the winner of her debate with Trump on 10 September in Philadelphia, which was watched by an estimated 67 million people. Most of the national polls carried out in the week after indicated that her performance had helped her make small gains in the race. Her lead over Trump rose from 2.5 percentage points on the day of the debate to 3.3 points just over a week later. However, the battleground states \u2013 where the election will be decided \u2013 remain too close to call. Only one or two percentage points are separating the presidential candidates. According to Reuters/Ipsos polling, 51% of registered voters say they view JD Vance unfavorably, compared with 39% who view him favourably. That\u2019s a contrast with Tim Walz, who 44% of registered voters view favourably, with 43% reporting an unfavorable view. These results came from a poll conducted between 20 and 23 September. Kit Maher, a campaign producer with CNN\u2019s political unit, has been told by two sources that these are the surrogates for JD Vance who will be in the spin room for him tonight at the debate: Jason Miller, senior adviser to Donald Trump Donald Trump Jr, Donald Trump\u2019s son Tom Cotton, Arkansas senator Katie Britt, Alabama senator Elise Stefanik, a congresswoman representing New York\u2019s 21st district in the House of Representatives and serves as the House Republican conference chair Byron Donalds, a Republican Florida congressman Howard Lutnick, the longtime chief executive officer of Cantor Fitzgerald LP The 90-minute debate between Vance, 40, a senator for Ohio, and Tim Walz, the 60-year-old governor of Minnesota, will kick off at 9pm New York time and can be viewed on host network CBS News. We will be bringing you the latest updates in our live blog. My colleague Rachel Leingang took a look at what we know so far about Vance and Walz\u2019s debate style. She writes: Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, and Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, have been honing their public speaking skills \u2013 and their pointed barbs at each other \u2013 in TV appearances and at events around the country in the past few months. Their experiences in electoral debates haven\u2019t reached the levels or notoriety that come along with a presidential campaign, but both have faced opponents in public debates in past elections. And given the tightness of the presidential race, and how poorly the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump went, there will probably be more people tuned in to the vice presidential debate than in past cycles. While VP debates don\u2019t usually tip the scales much, they could matter in a close race \u2013 and they build profiles for lower-profile politicians who will probably stay on the national scene for years to come. You can read the full story here: Good morning, US politics readers. It\u2019s the day of the vice-presidential debate and Tim Walz and JD Vance are preparing to go head to head in New York City. The debate will start at 9pm ET and, like the Harris-Trump debate, it will be held in a studio without an audience. Unlike the main presidential debate, the candidates\u2019 microphones will not be muted when it is not their turn to speak \u2013 but moderators can mute mics throughout the event. To practice before Tuesday\u2019s VP debate, Walz has used Pete Buttigieg, transportation secretary and frequent TV news interviewee, as a Vance stand-in \u2013 both Buttigieg and Vance are Ivy Leaguers from the midwest and roughly the same age. Vance has been preparing for the debate with Minnesota Republican congressman Tom Emmer as a stand-in for Walz. On Monday, Emmer gave an insight into how debate practice has been going, telling reporters about portraying Walz: \u201cQuite frankly it\u2019s tough because he is really good on the debate stage.\u201d Republicans are seeking to frame Walz, the folksy Minnesota governor who has proved to be the most popular figure in the presidential race, as a mean-spirited, ogreish figure. Emmer, who ran unsuccessfully for Minnesota governor in 2010, said: \u201c[Walz] is going to stand there and he lies with conviction, and he has these little mannerisms where he\u2019s just, hey, I\u2019m the nice guy, but he\u2019s not nice at all.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Nike pulled its financial guidance for the year, reported a steep drop in revenue and postponed a highly anticipated update for shareholders, days after announcing the replacement of its CEO. Profits at the American sportswear giant, grappling with falling sales and intense competition from fast-growing rivals, also declined. \u201cA comeback at this scale takes time,\u201d it said. Shares in the firm dropped 8% during out-of-hours trading in New York. Revenue at Nike fell 10% to $11.59bn in the three months to 31 August. Net income dropped 28% to $1.05bn over the same period. As shareholders await plans to revive the company\u2019s performance, it said an investor day scheduled for next month had been postponed. A new date was not provided. \u201cNike\u2019s first quarter results largely met our expectations,\u201d Matthew Friend, executive vice-president at the firm, claimed in a statement. \u201cA comeback at this scale takes time, but we see early wins \u2013 from momentum in key sports to accelerating our pace of newness and innovation.\u201d On an earnings call, Friend suggested that ditching the company\u2019s financial guidance would provide Elliot Hill, Nike\u2019s incoming CEO, with the \u201cflexibility\u201d to examine current strategies and trends \u201cand develop our plans to best position the business\u201d for the future. Analysts say Nike has done little to drive demand and take back market share from brands like Deckers\u2019 Hoka and Roger Federer-backed On. It said last month that Hill, who was at Nike for 32 years before retiring in 2020, will take over as new CEO on 14 October, tasked with reviving sales and winning back market share. With Hill at the helm, analysts expect Nike to begin from scratch and rebuild wholesale partnerships that had tapered under John Donahoe, the outgoing CEO. While Donahoe focused instead on bolstering sales through the company\u2019s own stores and website, US retailers like Foot Locker and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods quickly filled the shelf space Nike had vacated with fashionable competitors like On, Hoka and New Balance. Nike executives in March acknowledged that their direct-to-consumer push was not driving growth and had instead led to a drop in its market share. The sportswear giant has been hurt by a lull in consumer spending in China after a frail post-pandemic recovery driven by high youth unemployment and a protracted property downturn. Consumers in the region have also begun preferring locally made products. Reuters contributed reporting",

The match at the Emirates finished 2-2, Cavani and Giroud scoring in the correct nets, Verratti and Alex Iwobi putting through their own.

      "bodyText": "David Hytner was at the Emirates tonight. His report has landed, and here it is. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night. Mikel Arteta talks to Amazon Prime. \u201cReally happy \u2026 we played a big opponent \u2026 a team with a lot of personality \u2026 but we were very dominant in the first half \u2026 the second half was a different story \u2026 Champions League brings different demands but we handled it very well \u2026 Kai Havertz has been unbelievable \u2026 his work ethic \u2026 a real threat \u2026 he\u2019s one of our main players \u2026 set pieces are another weapon we have \u2026 we have great takers \u2026 a very physical team \u2026 the players understand these are game-changers \u2026 if we dominate every phase of play, we become a much better team \u2026 I love Luis Enrique to bits \u2026 he helped me when I was little \u2026 I will invite him [for a glass of wine].\u201d Arsenal\u2019s stand-in captain Bukayo Saka, a picture of contentment, has a chat with Amazon. \u201cWe work most days on a lot of set pieces \u2026 it\u2019s not a coincidence that we\u2019re scoring every game \u2026 we could have scored more goals \u2026 overall we deserved the win \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of hunger in my belly \u2026 in previous years I have come runner-up a lot \u2026 I believe in myself a lot \u2026 we believe in ourselves \u2026 we\u2019re a top team, we showed that tonight \u2026 we had to make a statement \u2026 wearing the armband is amazing \u2026 I will cherish this night \u2026 we\u2019re already thinking about Southampton at the weekend \u2026 we have to be so focused \u2026 we\u2019re getting closer \u2026 we have to do whatever it takes to win \u2026 set pieces or our beautiful football.\u201d Post-game postbag. \u201cWhile Luis Enrique presumably had good reasons for dropping Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, if the purpose was to show that PSG would do just fine without him, then that\u2019s not been entirely successful. Even when his end product is lacking, his unpredictable dribbles pull defenses out of shape, giving space to his less chaotic but more clinical teammates\u201d \u2013 K\u00e1ri Tulinius Kai Havertz, named Player of the Match, speaks to Amazon Prime. \u201cWe played very well, especially in the first half \u2026 in the second half we were sometimes too passive \u2026 it was a good game \u2026 great result \u2026 good three points \u2026 it feels great to play here \u2026 I love the stadium \u2026 I am so thankful to play here and be a party of the team \u2026 back in the day I wasn\u2019t a player who loved the duels, but now I just love it \u2026 if we win against teams like this, it gives us a big boost \u2026 last year it was tough to go out against Bayern but we grew as a team \u2026 we want to give something back to the fans.\u201d That result moves Arsenal up to eighth in the table. PSG drop from 15th to 18th, though they\u2019re now above Celtic, whose goal difference took something of a hit in Dortmund. It wasn\u2019t a classic, like Arsenal will give two hoots about that. Mikel Arteta\u2019s side did a thoroughly professional number on PSG, securing two goals midway through the first half \u2013 a brave header from Kai Havertz and a mind-scrambling free-kick routine instigated by Bukayo Saka \u2013 before gliding home. PSG rallied a bit in the second period without ever really testing David Raya, and Arsenal follow up their hard-won point in Atalanta with a much more easily gained three at home. PSG were pretty toothless without the dropped Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Luis Enrique may have to answer a few questions about that. Barcola crosses from the left, Raya claims, and the Gunners secure their first three-point haul of this year\u2019s Champions League without too much fuss or drama. Two-nil to the Arsenal. 90 min +3: Nuno Mendes wins a corner off Calafiori down the left. Lee delivers into a crowded six-yard box. It pings awkwardly off Havertz but ends up in the arms of Raya. 90 min +2: Myles Lewis-Skelly comes on for his Champions League debut. Bukayo Saka makes way and receives the warm applause he deserves. 90 min +1: The first of four additional minutes goes by without incident. 90 min: Hakimi has a dig from the edge of the Arsenal box. He only succeeds in blasting the ball straight at his team-mate Kolo Muani. 88 min: Hakimi bombs down the right again. He crosses low, hoping to find Kolo Muani, rushing into the box down the middle. Kolo Muani is hauled back by Rice, and wants a penalty. Play is waved on. VAR has a look. It\u2019s a foul alright, but not inside the box, so VAR can do nothing. Not even a free kick for PSG. Rice knew what he was doing. 86 min: Hakimi chases a long pass down the right but Kiwior, who hasn\u2019t put a foot wrong since coming on at the break, gets across to cover. 85 min: \u2026 but Marquinhos heads Lee\u2019s corner harmlessly over the bar. 84 min: Nuno Mendes turns on the jets from a standing start to zip past Saka down the left. He wins a corner. A goal for PSG here would make things interesting all right. 82 min: PSG have quickly lost the brief head of steam they\u2019d built up. This match is now going nowhere, and hats off to Arsenal for wresting back control. 80 min: Arsenal draw some of the sting from the game with the old sterile domination. 78 min: Barcola competes for a loose ball in the Arsenal box. It pings off the lunging Saliba and onto the outstretched arm of Calafiori. PSG scream for a penalty, and VAR has a quick check, but the sheer lack of distance between Saliba and Calafiori saves Arsenal. The correct decision, though with Calafiori\u2019s arm well away from his torso, a few home hearts were in mouths for a split second there. 76 min: Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz and Calafiori with some of the old playground-style shoving. It\u2019s over nothing, as well, a throw in the midfield. Both are booked. 75 min: Some pinball on the edge of the PSG box, the visitors unable to deal with Arsenal\u2019s press. Saka tees up Martinelli, who attempts to shoot across Donnarumma and towards the bottom right, but can\u2019t beat the keeper. PSG go up the other end, Saliba denying an in-flight Kolo Muani. This is suddenly more exciting than Arsenal and their fans would want it to be. 74 min: Leandro Trossard is replaced by Gabriel Jesus. 72 min: PSG have the aura of a team who suddenly fancy getting back into this, and the denizens of the Emirates sense it. The first half was comfortable for the hosts; the second, despite the scoreline, doesn\u2019t feel the same. 70 min: The Arsenal fans, sensing that danger, find their voice for the first time in a while. Their team do well to calm things down, too, with some game-management passing in the middle of the park. 68 min: Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz cuts in from the left and sends a curler towards the top left. Always a tad too high. But PSG suddenly have their tails up, and Lee\u2019s low swerving shot nearly deceives Raya, who does well to readjust and block. For the first time this evening, there\u2019s a vague whiff of danger coming from the visitors. 66 min: Lee sends the corner towards the near post. Jo\u00e3o Neves flicks. Raya flaps. The ball cannons off the crossbar and away. So close to a mood-changer! 65 min: Nuno Mendes crosses from a deep position on the left. There\u2019s nobody in the box, but a deflection earns PSG a corner. Lee to take. 64 min: Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz and Randal Kolo Muani replace D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9 and Vitinha, while Thomas Partey makes way for Arsenal debutant Mikel Merino. A huge ovation as the new signing takes to the field at last. 62 min: PSG stroke it around, but go nowhere in particular. Arsenal seem happy enough to sit back and let them achieve nowt. 60 min: Lee slips a pass down the right for Hakimi, who gets to the ball ahead of Rice and enters the box. He goes over, but Kiwior\u2019s challenge is a good one, and the claim for a penalty almost dies the split second it\u2019s vocalised. 58 min: Martinelli dinks a cross long from the left. From eight yards at the far stick, Havertz can\u2019t get any power on his downward header and Donnarumma smothers as the ball trundles towards the bottom right. 57 min: \u2026 but now it\u2019s Arsenal who overplay out from the back. Partey gifts possession to Nuno Mendes, who barrels down the inside left and should take a whack from the edge of the box, but hesitates in looking for Dou\u00e9 and the chance is gone. 56 min: \u2026 nothing comes. Donnarumma plucks Rice\u2019s floater out of the sky with ease. 55 min: PSG attempt to play out from the back, but can\u2019t get through the Arsenal press. Martinelli takes up possession and drives down the left to win a corner. From which \u2026 54 min: Trossard is down, having taken a whack to the thigh. He felt that, though after quite a lot of grimacing, the Arsenal winger gathers himself up and continues. 52 min: Trossard, then Havertz flick cutely down the inside-right channel and infield. Martinelli, ten yards out, can\u2019t take advantage, sending a soft effort straight at Donnarumma. That could (should?) have put this game \u2013 and any PSG notion of a Leicester-style comeback \u2013 to bed. 50 min: Saka sends Calafiori scampering into acres down the right \u2026 but then the whistle goes, very late, for a handball, Saka having knocked the ball past Nuno Mendes with his arm. The correct decision, but the time it took caused plenty of irritation. 49 min: PSG don\u2019t bother sending the free kick directly into the box, and eventually win a throw on the halfway line. Arsenal more than happy with that. 48 min: PSG are on the front foot early doors. Lee crosses from the right. Calafiori half clears. A loose ball. Havertz then flings an arm into the face of Vitinha, and it\u2019s a free kick for the visitors, 30 yards out, just left of centre. 47 min: No word yet as to whether there\u2019s anything wrong with Timber. His place at right-back has been taken by Calafiori. Arsenal get the second half underway. Jakub Kiwior has replaced Jurri\u00ebn Timber. Half-time entertainment. Faye Carruthers and Suzanne Wrack reflect on an rhythmically pleasing list of 1-0 wins ruined by a seven-goal thrashing. The Gunners comfortable and in control. As for PSG, their fans are back in fine voice, at least. 45 min: Hakimi skitters down the right and whips a dangerous cross into the Arsenal box. Well, it would be dangerous had PSG committed anyone else in attack. Nobody in blue in the box. There will be one minute of added time. 44 min: Another Arsenal free kick out on the right. Saka hits this one long, hoping to spring Trossard clear on the other flank. He overhits it. Goal kick. Nobody, not even the Arsenal set-piece coach, is perfect. 42 min: Za\u00efre-Emery crosses from the right. Deflected. Easy for Raya. Arsenal are well on top now, though they\u2019ll surely have Leicester\u2019s (admittedly futile) two-goal comeback on Saturday in the back of their mind. A long way to go yet. 40 min: PSG were beginning to build up a little momentum, but that second goal has taken the wind out of their sail. They\u2019re struggling to contain Saka, who dribbles dangerously down the right before eventually being flagged offside. 38 min: Saka sashays along the byline to the right of goal and fizzes a ball towards Trossard, three yards out. Trossard becomes the latest Arsenal player to miss the ball altogether, but this time his air-swish doesn\u2019t fox Donnarumma and PSG clear their lines. 37 min: \u201cYou\u2019re not singing any more,\u201d holler the Holloway Road faithful, goading the previously vocal 3,000-strong away end. Arsenal showcase their set-piece smarts. From the right touchline, Saka curls low towards the near post, six yards out. Martinelli swipes and misses. Partey takes an air shot. No matter, because both lunges have befuddled Donnarumma, and Saka\u2019s delivery bounces straight through and into the net! 34 min: Saka is skittled by Nuno Mendes while going nowhere down the right flank. A free kick, and a chance for Arsenal to showcase their set-piece smarts. 33 min: Za\u00efre-Emery backs himself in a footrace with Gabriel down the right \u2026 but he\u2019s wrong to do so. As Gabriel ushers the ball out for a goal kick, holding the PSG man off with alpha-ease, he gestures to the crowd, celebrating his achievement as a striker would a goal. He\u2019s within his rights. Fine defending. The crowd respond gleefully. 31 min: Dou\u00e9 sends Hakimi off down the right. Calafiori is left in his dust. He enters the box and lashes a fierce cross-cum-shot that Raya deflects behind for a corner, from which nothing comes. PSG haven\u2019t panicked since falling behind, and now they\u2019re beginning to ask a couple of questions. 29 min: Rice should send Saka clear down the right but clanks his diagonal pass straight at Nuno Mendes, who is in the thick of it at the minute. 28 min: Nuno Mendes finds a little space down the inside-left channel. He reaches the edge of the box, Saliba giving him a little too much time. He lashes a low outswinging shot towards the bottom right. It clips the base of the post and out for a goal kick. Raya didn\u2019t have that covered. Inches away from a spectacular equaliser. 26 min: Barcola is sent scampering down the left. He enters the box, with only Timber to beat for the opportunity to shoot. He shows Timber the ball, with a view of dragging it around a lunging defender \u2026 but Timber\u2019s not to be diddled, and toe pokes the ball away from the winger before clearing his lines. That\u2019s outrageously good defending. The small matter of a whole season out injured aside, it\u2019s not taken Timber long to show his quality in Arsenal colours. 24 min: Kai Havertz can\u2019t stop scoring at the Emirates. Six matches in a row now. 22 min: Hats off to Partey, as well, for winning the ball to set Trossard and Havertz on their way. The 3,000 travelling Parisians had been making most of the noise, but now it\u2019s all Arsenal as you\u2019d imagine. \u2026 but never mind, because seconds later, Trossard swings a delicious high ball in from the left, having cut inside with determination. Donnarumma comes out and misses. Havertz times his run ahead of Pacho, and loops a header over the flapping keeper and into the top left! 19 min: Saka slips Havertz into space down the right. He reaches the byline and fizzes a cross into the six-yard box. Donnarumma is out of the picture, beaten at his near post, but Rice hasn\u2019t gambled by making a forward run and Hakimi can hook clear. A disappointing end to an incisive move by Arsenal. 17 min: PSG have enjoyed 55 percent of possession so far. A measure of how well they\u2019ve settled after their slightly slow start. 16 min: Nuno Mendes goes down after running slap-bang into Saka, who wasn\u2019t in the mood to give way. The PSG defender receives a quick spot of treatment before springing back up again. 14 min: Arsenal then go up the other end, Saka crossing deep from the right, Donnarumma catching confidently. Nothing much wrong with the keeper\u2019s thigh if that leap was anything to go by. 13 min: Nuno Mendes sends a simple ball down the middle, and Dou\u00e9 is clear. He whistles a low drive inches wide of the right-hand post, then the flag goes up for offside. On Amazon, co-commentator Alan Shearer bemoans the late whistle, saying it was clearly off, but had that gone in, VAR might have had to get the rulers out. 12 min: PSG are beginning to settle. They string a few passes together and push Arsenal back in doing so. 10 min: Calafiori shows his worth down the other edge of the pitch. He\u2019s nearly turned by Hakimi down the right, but sticks out a leg to concede a corner before a dangerous cross can be delivered. From the resulting set piece, Nuno Mendes shanks a wild shot miles right of goal. 9 min: The exciting Calafiori strides down the middle and slips a pass to Saka on his right. Saka cuts back into the box and aims a curler for the top-left corner. Just too high. Just a bit too far wide. Tonight\u2019s first shot in anger sails over the bar. 8 min: \u2026 but apart from that, Arsenal are winning the majority of the 50-50s. Most of the game is being played in the PSG half, albeit nowhere near their goal. Not yet. 6 min: Saka dozes 30 yards from his own goal and has the ball taken away from him by Barcola, who should take a speculative dig from the edge of the box but pauses in the hope that a better option shows itself. A better option does not show itself. Arsenal clear their lines. 4 min: Donnarumma is thankfully fine to continue. He gets up and restarts the game. 3 min: Raya goes long down the middle. Very long. Donnarumma comes to the edge of his box to claim confidently, though he\u2019s clattered by the extended leg of Martinelli, who was within his rights to compete for the ball. The keeper holds on, then the doctors come on to have a look at the thigh that\u2019s kept him out for the previous three matches. 2 min: All a bit scrappy during the opening exchanges. Frantic and fast. Then Saka and Havertz threaten to get in behind PSG on the right, but the flag pops up for offside after they exchange passes. PSG kick off. The 3,000-strong away end have their back in the noisy style. The teams are out. Arsenal in their famous red and white, PSG in first-choice blue. A crackling atmosphere in north London, despite the rain falling with extreme prejudice. We\u2019ll be off in a minute, once fists have been bumped, coins are tossed, and Bukayo Saka takes receipt of the best pennant. Some great news already for Ligue 1 tonight. Brest have just won 4-0 at Red Bull Salzburg, and for a couple of hours at least, sit atop Big Table. Some story this: they\u2019ve never even won a major domestic trophy! Rob Smyth has the details of that, plus news of Stuttgart\u2019s 1-1 draw with Sparta Prague, as part of this evening\u2019s Clockwatch. Pennant watch. There\u2019s nothing at all wrong with this \u2026 \u2026 until you see how PSG have taken things up several notches. Poor Marquinhos getting the bum deal in the merch swap tonight. The MegaLeague, as it stands after one round of matches. This is quite sweet, isn\u2019t it. Mikel Arteta speaks to Amazon Prime. \u201cVery excited \u2026 looking forward to it \u2026 the kind of scenario we want to be involved in \u2026 [the starting team] is the right fit \u2026 a lot of quality \u2026 physicality \u2026 goal threat \u2026 everything we are looking for \u2026 [PSG coach Luis Enrique is] a very tough opponent \u2026 it\u2019s a great test for us \u2026 we have to play with a lot of courage and determination \u2026 use the crowd \u2026 make it a very tough place to be.\u201d Arsenal and PSG don\u2019t have too much in the way of shared history, but what there is between them favours the Gunners. The clubs met in the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup back in 1994: Ian Wright and David Ginola ensured the spoils were shared 1-1 in Paris, then the much-loved Kevin Campbell scored the only goal in the second leg. Arsenal went on to beat Parma in the final. Fast forward to 2016-17 and two games in the Champions League groups: it was 1-1 in Paris again, Edinson Cavani scoring after just 44 seconds, Alexis S\u00e1nchez equalising, Marco Verratti and Olivier Giroud receiving their marching orders in added time. The match at the Emirates finished 2-2, Cavani and Giroud scoring in the correct nets, Verratti and Alex Iwobi putting through their own. Both teams went through to the knockouts, and PSG boss Unai Emery joined Arsenal the year after. Arsenal\u2019s starting XI \u2013 and their tweet doesn\u2019t lie \u2013 is the same named for the 4-2 nail-biter against Leicester City three days ago. Their new midfield signing Mikel Merino has recovered from injury and is on the bench, waiting to debut for his new club. Ben White remains injured and absent. There\u2019s no Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 for PSG. He\u2019s in the doghouse despite scoring four times in six Ligue 1 matches so far this season. Fortunately for the Parisians, Bradley Barcola has six in six to date. Gianluigi Donnarumma returns in goal having missed the last three matches with a thigh problem. Arsenal: Raya, Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori, Saka, Partey, Rice, Martinelli, Havertz, Trossard. Subs: Neto, Porter, Gabriel Jesus, Kiwior, Jorginho, Merino, Sterling, Kacurri, Lewis-Skelly, Nwaneri, Robinson, Butler-Oyedeji. PSG: Donnarumma, Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho, Nuno Mendes, Zaire Emery, Vitinha, Neves, Doue, Lee, Barcola. Subs: Safonov, Tenas, Fabian, Asensio, Muani, Mayulu, Lucas Beraldo, Skriniar, Zague, Naoufel El Hannach, Mbaye. Referee: Slavko Vincic (Slovenia). Arsenal could only manage a draw at Atalanta in their first game in the all-new Champions League mega-table stage. PSG by contrast are coming off the back of a 1-0 win over Girona. But with seven games still to play \u2013 and nobody really knows how this will pan out until it does \u2013 they\u2019re hardly in must-win territory. So is this a big game or not? In strict dramatic terms, no, not really. But it\u2019s still one of the giants of the English game against the leading team in France, and it\u2019ll feel nice to win, so while there\u2019s no full-blown jeopardy for either side tonight, we\u2019re nevertheless in marker-down territory, where victory allied to an impressive performance will augur well for the long road stretching out ahead. Big game, then? Big enough! Kick-off is at 8pm BST. It\u2019s on.",

He said: \u201cSome say that, according to the statements made by the Zionist authorities, if we respond to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, we will cause a war. I must say that we are not afraid of going to war. We are not warmongers, but we are ready for any war.

With his critics claiming he is out of his depth, naive or sidelined, he leads a regime that is under its greatest external pressure for many decades.</p> \n<p>The government spokesperson on Tuesday appealed for the sniping to end. She said: \u201cWe should not forget that our biggest enemy is division within the nation, and if national unity and unity are replaced by division, the smallest threats will cause the greatest danger to us.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Iran said its supreme leader made the decision to fire dozens of missiles into Israel as retaliation for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the recent killings of leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas, two of the main groups in Iran\u2019s so-called axis of resistance. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said the decision had been made by Ali Khamenei with the backing of the supreme national security council (SNSC) and the Iranian defence ministry. Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, hailed the attack as \u201ca decisive response to the aggression of the Zionist regime\u201d, adding: \u201cLet Netanyahu know that Iran is not a belligerent, but it stands firmly against any threat \u2026 Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.\u201d The Iranian mission at the UN said the actions were a \u201clegal, rational and legitimate response to the terrorist attacks of the Zionist regime, which involved the targeting of Iranian nationals and interests and infringing on the national sovereignty of Iran\u201d. It added that, should Israel \u201cdare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue \u2026 Regional states and the Zionists\u2019 supporters are advised to part ways with the regime.\u201d Iranian officials added there were further waves of ballistic missiles ready to go and said the launch of the attacks was signalled to western forces in advance. It was not clear if Middle Eastern states such as Jordan or Saudi Arabia played any part in protecting Israel\u2019s defences as they were alleged to have done when Iran attacked Israel in April in response to the killing of Iranian officials inside a consulate in Damascus. The IRGC said the assault on Israel was a response both to the death on Friday of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July. Iran\u2019s high-risk decision to launch ballistic missiles against Israel reflects a growing consensus inside the Iranian elite that its decision not to mount a military reprisal after the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran in July was a strategic mistake. Hardliners say the restraint gave a green light to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to mount further assassinations against \u201cresistance leaders\u201d. They contrasted it with the firm response taken in April by the previous administration, led by the now deceased then president, Ebrahim Raisi, after the attack on Iran\u2019s consulate in Damascus. The current president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said he did not respond to Haniyeh\u2019s death because he had been given assurances that Israel was on the verge of signing a ceasefire deal within a week or two. No such deal occurred, and Pezeshkian felt betrayed. Iranian officials had also been alarmed by Netanyahu\u2019s claim at the UN last week that one of his war objectives is to impose a change in the balance of power in the Middle East. In such circumstances, Iran felt it simply could not abandon Hezbollah and start to look weak across the region. Anyway, they believed, Netanyahu was determined to go up the escalatory ladder, so it was necessary to confront him. There had even been claims spread by some Gulf states that Iran was abandoning Hezbollah. The marked hardening of tone was first signalled by the SNSC chair, Ali Akbar Ahmadian, who declared early on Tuesday that Iran was at war and claimed Hezbollah had not been forced on the back foot by the recent string of Israeli military and intelligence successes. Ahmadian instead argued: \u201cThe enemy is in a state of desperation and is trying to prove himself successful with psychological operations, with one or two operations that mainly rely on terror, but there is no such success for him.\u201d He said the work of Hezbollah had not been disrupted and no damage had been done to Hezbollah and its combat power. \u201cAfter this, Hezbollah will start a new era,\u201d he added. But that optimistic assessment was not widely shared. In a sign of how the rhetoric is heating up, Hamid Rasaei \u2013 who is an ally of Saeed Jalili, the hardliner who was defeated by the reformist Pezeshkian in Iran\u2019s presidential elections in July \u2013 asked: \u201cWhy has the Islamic Republic of Iran become passive in the face of the threats and aggressions of the Zionist regime after the martyrdom of Ismail Haniyeh, the prominent figure of Hamas in Iran? Why is the demand for blood of this martyr delayed? Hasn\u2019t this passivity caused the fake regime [Israel] to attack more? Isn\u2019t Hassan Nasrallah\u2019s martyrdom, the symbol of religious zeal, the result of this inaction? Won\u2019t these delays cause the fake regime to be more bold in martyring other resistance leaders?\u201d He attacked those who \u201cconstantly repeat that, no matter what happens, we will not fall into the trap of war with Israel\u201d. Ebrahim Rezaei, the spokesperson of the parliament\u2019s national security and foreign policy commission, also insisted war held no fear for Iran. He said: \u201cSome say that, according to the statements made by the Zionist authorities, if we respond to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, we will cause a war. I must say that we are not afraid of going to war. We are not warmongers, but we are ready for any war. On the other hand, we are used to the chants of the Zionist regime and we are not afraid or worried by it.\u201d Alireza Panahian, one of the speakers of Khamenei\u2019s office, said: \u201cIf the delay in revenge is due to a more complete destruction and a more terrible blow to the Zionist regime, we will accept it, and otherwise we will not accept it.\u201d Inside parliament there had also been calls from some conservatives for Iran to lift the fatwa on building a nuclear bomb, but Iranian officials played down such rhetoric. The likelihood that Iran would make such a dramatic strategic switch in the midst of the current tension is low, especially since it hands Netanyahu an excuse to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. Iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is for civil use, but the west has feared Iran is seeking a bomb. In 2015 the two sides struck a deal that allowed Iran to enrich low stocks of uranium in return for an intrusive UN inspection regime to check the programme remained civilian. In 2018 Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal and reimposed harsh sanctions, leading Iran to gradually increase its uranium stocks to levels of purity that would only be required if the country intended to make a nuclear bomb. The new government has said it is willing to return to the 2015 deal. Khamenei is due to lead the Friday prayers this week. It will be the first time he has done so since the assassination of Qassem Suleimani, the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps\u2019 al-Quds brigade. It was also confirmed that Pezeshkian is due in Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday. With his critics claiming he is out of his depth, naive or sidelined, he leads a regime that is under its greatest external pressure for many decades. The government spokesperson on Tuesday appealed for the sniping to end. She said: \u201cWe should not forget that our biggest enemy is division within the nation, and if national unity and unity are replaced by division, the smallest threats will cause the greatest danger to us.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight\u2019s Clockwatch. Thanks as always for your company and emails. It wasn\u2019t the greatest advert for the new Champions League, but it beats watching Pine Barrens again. Right? Match report: Slovan Bratislava 0-4 Manchester City This had become akin to an attacking exercise for City. A Foden attempt was parried by Takac on to the post and Slovan escaped again, as the drummer behind the keeper\u2019s goal led Slovan\u2019s tifosi in endless chants that created a festive atmosphere despite the score. Guardiola was not content, though, with City\u2019s sloppiness, Foden a main culprit, as when losing the ball, forcing Haaland to gallop back to help, the manager wheeling round to grumble to his coaching staff at this. Match report: Arsenal 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain Three years ago Arsenal weren\u2019t even in Europe; now they\u2019re one of the best teams in Europe. David Hytner was at the Emirates to watch them beat PSG. Match report: Dortmund 7-1 Celtic The Champions League has a habit of inflicting these inglorious episodes on Celtic. It is difficult to shake the notion that this big fish simply cannot swim when removed from its small domestic pond. Tomorrow\u2019s fixture list is reasonably mouthwatering, with Aston Villa v Bayern Munich standing out to this weary pair of eyes. Girona v Feyenoord Shakhtar v Atalanta Aston Villa v Bayern Benfica v Atletico Madrid Dinamo Zagreb v Monaco Lille v Real Madrid Liverpool v Bologna RB Leipzig v Juventus Sturm Graz v Club Brugge The updated Champions League table Ignore the bit at the bottom; apparently our automated feed is trolling Celtic. It\u2019s all over in Leverkusen, where the home side have held on to beat Milan 1-0, and that completes our business. There were nine games, 32 goals, a few mismatches and a couple of exciting contests. Arsenal 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain Barcelona 5-0 Young Boys Dortmund 7-1 Celtic Inter 4-0 Red Star Leverkusen 1-0 Milan PSV Eindhoven 1-1 Sporting CP Slovan Bratislava 0-4 Manchester City Salzburg 0-4 Brest Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague \u201cDoes losing 7-1 to a German team mean Celtic are the Brazil of Europe?\u201d asks Adam Becker. Another good night for Arsenal, probably their best Champions League victory since they beat Bayern Munich nine years ago. Scott Murray has more. Are you not entertained? 87 min: Leverkusen 1-0 Milan Ruben Loftus-Cheek hooks a shot on the turn that is punched away by the keeper Hradecky. Sounds like it\u2019s been all Milan since Leverkusen took the lead. GOAL! PSV 1-1 Sporting CP (Braganca 84) The Portuguese leaders are level in Eindhoven thanks to the substitute Daniel Braganca. It was a neat finish, volleyed into the roof of the net from a deflected left-wing cross. Actually, replays suggest he might have shinned it, not that he\u2019ll care. 83 min: Leverkusen 1-0 AC Milan Theo Hernandez hits the bar with a deflected long-range, and the substitute Alvaro Morata heads the rebound just wide. Eek, that was a terrific chance. Newcastle have beaten AFC Wimbledon 1-0 in the Carabao Cup. Fabian Schar scored a penalty just before half-time; the stats (77 per cent possession, 20 shots to none) suggest a deceptively comfortable win. The latest scores Arsenal 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain Barcelona 5-0 Young Boys Dortmund 7-1 Celtic Inter 4-0 Red Star Leverkusen 1-0 Milan PSV Eindhoven 1-0 Sporting CP Slovan Bratislava 0-4 Manchester City Salzburg 0-4 Brest (FT) Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague (FT) GOAL! Barcelona 5-0 Young Boys (Camara own goal 81) GOAL! Inter 4-0 Red Star (Taremi 82 pen) After a VAR review that went on for a couple of millennia, Mehdi Taremi scores from the spot to put Inter 4-0 ahead. The substitute Felix Nmecha has made it S-I-E-B-E-N for Dortmund, slamming a loose ball into the net from 15 yards. Most of the matches are petering out, though Milan are pushing hard for an equaliser in Leverkusen. Xabi Alonso is happy to cut his clo- oh lordy, hang on. 72 min: Arsenal 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain PSG have the aura of a team who suddenly fancy getting back into this, and the denizens of the Emirates sense it. The first half was comfortable for the hosts; the second, despite the scoreline, doesn\u2019t feel the same. The substitute James McAtee gets his first Champions League goal, emphatically finishing a lovely move that involved Lewis, Foden and about half the team. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Peter Oh, and here it comes folks. \u201cCeltic are getting licked like an envelope!\u201d The value of the exclamation mark, right there. GOAL! Inter 3-0 Red Star (Lautaro Martinez 72) Look, not every game can be infused with jeopardy! Mehdi Taremi gets his second pressing-based assist, winning the ball before playing in Lautaro Martinez to make it three. \u201cAs soon as I saw that Brendan Rogers had been talking next levels before Dortmund had been played,\u201d begins Ian Copestake, \u201cI began to have recurring visions of envelopes.\u201d I felt sorry for Brendon over that business. Lord Ferg did a similar thing 19 years earlier and everyone said he was a genius fae Govan. 68 min: Dortmund 6-1 Celtic \u201cWelp,\u201d says James Humphries, \u201cmy (Celtic-supporting) mate had a bet on there being seven goals in it; but cashed out at half time, so I imagine he\u2019s adopting the foetal position about now.\u201d His internal monologue in the 120 seconds preceding that decision would make for a cracking little radio play. Serhou Guirassy makes it 6-1 to Dortmund with a lovely, slick finish. The good news for Brendan Rodgers is that Celtic\u2019s heaviest European defeat is 7-0; the bad news is he was the manager then as well. The latest scores Arsenal 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain Barcelona 4-0 Young Boys Dortmund 5-1 Celtic Inter 2-0 Red Star Leverkusen 1-0 Milan PSV Eindhoven 1-0 Sporting CP Slovan Bratislava 0-3 Manchester City Salzburg 0-4 Brest (FT) Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague (FT) GOAL! Inter 2-0 Red Star (Arnautovic 59) Marko Arnautovic gets his first goal of the season, sliding the ball in from 10 yards after Mehdi Taremi won the ball on the edge of the area and then picked him out with a low pass. 59 min: Slovan Bratislava 0-3 Man City Erling Haaland has done his business for the night. walking round the keeper after running onto a deadly through ball from Rico Lewis. The defending was, a-hem, imperfect but that\u2019s not City\u2019s problem. Look, not every game can be infused with jeopardy. Boniface\u2019s effort means we\u2019ve had at least one goal in all nine Champions League games. And here\u2019s the proof. Arsenal 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain Barcelona 4-0 Young Boys Dortmund 5-1 Celtic Inter 1-0 Red Star Leverkusen 1-0 Milan PSV Eindhoven 1-0 Sporting CP Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Manchester City Salzburg 0-4 Brest (FT) Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague (FT) For the second time tonight, Victor Boniface scores the opening goal. The first goal was disallowed for offside in the build-up; this one counts despite Milan appealing for offside again. Frimpong\u2019s shot was saved and Boniface helped himself to the rebound from four yards. GOAL! Barcelona 4-0 Young Boys (Lewandowski 51) Two for Robert Lewandowski, four for Barcelona. It was another simple close-range finish after Martinez headed a corner back across the face of goal. Nuttin but a number Peep peep! Half two or Matchday Two (Evening One) is under way. I\u2019m off to put drops in my eyes. No, Oz, not those drops. Here\u2019s some half-time reading to lighten the mood. A very good half for Arsenal and Dortmund, a stroll in Slovakia for City. And an abject nightmare for Celtic. These are the half-time scores. Arsenal 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain Barcelona 3-0 Young Boys Dortmund 5-1 Celtic Inter 1-0 Red Star Leverkusen 0-0 Milan PSV Eindhoven 1-0 Sporting CP Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Manchester City Salzburg 0-4 Brest (FT) Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague (FT) \u201cIt was a penalty because he was kicked after the ball had gone,\u201d says Andy Flintoff. \u201cTheatrical falls aside, that\u2019s exactly what the referee would have seen to give it. Hope that helps.\u201d Well, I haven\u2019t had chance to analyse it to the nth degree because I\u2019m trying to cover seven games and my eyes stopped working properly after that flurry of goals around 8.10pm, but contact doesn\u2019t always warrant a penalty. Maybe it did on this occasion, maybe it didn\u2019t. When did we all \u2013 and I include myself in this, hence the words \u2018we\u2019 and \u2018all\u2019 - become so humourlessly certain? 39 min: Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Man City Ilkay Gundogan becomes the third City player, after Doku and Foden, to hit the woodwork. 44 min: Dortmund 5-1 Celtic Emre Can misses a chance to make it 6-1 after another electric run from Adeyemi. Brendan Rodgers shakes his head, his soul weeping silently. Here\u2019s Adeyemi\u2019s second goal, a right banger. My word. Karim Adeyemi rifles a 20-yarder into the bottom corner to complete a first half hat-trick and compound Celtic\u2019s misery. Truly, there are levels to this thing. Dortmund 4-1 Celtic \u201cHow in god\u2019s name is that a penalty?\u201d says James Humphries. \u201cEven softer than Kane getting his delicate wee toesies hurt at the Euros. You can see the Dortmund lad have a wee think and then hit the deck, ffs.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, these mistakes won\u2019t happen once they bring in video referees. Dortmund are awarded a soft-looking penalty for a foul on Adeyemi. He\u2019s on a hat-trick, Emre Can took the first penalty \u2013 but it\u2019s Serhou Guirassy who walks up to slam the ball past Schmeichel. Celtic are being marmalised. The latest bleedin\u2019 scores Arsenal 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain Barcelona 3-0 Young Boys Dortmund 3-1 Celtic Inter 1-0 Red Star Leverkusen 0-0 Milan PSV Eindhoven 1-0 Sporting CP Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Manchester City Salzburg 0-4 Brest (FT) Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague (FT) GOAL! Barcelona 3-0 Young Boys (Martinez 37) Inigo Martinez heads Pedri\u2019s free-kick into the net to put Barcelona three up. Arsenal find another way to score from a set-piece: Bukayo Saka\u2019s free-kick is missed by everyone and goes into the net. Scott Murray has more. GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Young Boys (Raphinha 34) Raphinha made the first; now he\u2019s scored the second from close range. Milk Cup A Fabian Schar penalty on the stroke of half time has put Newcastle ahead against AFC Wimbledon. 30 min: Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Man City Phil Foden had a shot fumbled onto the post a couple of minutes ago. City are winning without an ounce of bother. The latest scores Arsenal 1-0 Paris Saint-Germain Barcelona 1-0 Young Boys Dortmund 3-1 Celtic Inter 1-0 Red Star Leverkusen 0-0 Milan PSV Eindhoven 1-0 Sporting CP Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Manchester City Salzburg 0-4 Brest (FT) Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague (FT) Celtic\u2019s perfect start to the season has gone south inside half an hour. Karim Adeyemi has scored his second goal, and this time it needed no deflection. It was a ferocious finish, thrashed past Schmeichel at the near post from a very tight angle. Schmeichel was probably expecting a cross. As things stand, the three Bs are top of the Champions League 24 min: Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Man City Jeremy Doku is in unplayable mode tonight. He played a part in the first goal, made the second and has just hit the bar with an extravagant left-foot curler. 26 min: Dortmund 2-1 Celtic This game looks really open, particularly when Dortmund are attacking. Pascal Gross was clean through on goal but tried to give the goal to somebody else and failed. Carabao Cup department \u201cStill 0-0 between Newcastle and AFC Wimbledon in the Worthington Cup,\u201d writes Chris Paraskevas. \u201cWaking up for this at 4am is pretty much my impersonation of Paul Bettany torturing himself repeatedly in The Da Vinci Code, but there is a local magpie I\u2019ve recently befriended and I\u2019m expecting it over for breakfast. \"Is the Champions League really more entertaining than my morning?\u201d It? Are you respecting its privacy? NO GOAL! Leverkusen 0-0 Milan Frimpong was slightly offside, so he can keep his superb cross. GOAL! Leverkusen 1-0 Milan (Boniface 21) Milan\u2019s false start to the Champions Leaue continues: Victor Boniface has volleyed Leverkusen into a deserved lead from Jeremie Frimpong\u2019s superb cross. Kai Havertz has opened the scoring at the Emirates. Scott Murray will give you chapter and vertz. 17 min: Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Man City Rico Lewis pokes a nice pass through to Erling Haaland, whose close-range shot is very well saved. Jerdy Schouten intercepts a dodgy pass 25 yards from goal, takes a couple of touches and crashes the ball into the far corner. What a sweet finish. The latest scores Arsenal 0-0 Paris Saint-Germain Barcelona 1-0 Young Boys Dortmund 2-1 Celtic Inter 1-0 Red Star Leverkusen 0-0 Milan PSV Eindhoven 0-0 Sporting CP Slovan Bratislava 0-2 Manchester City Salzburg 0-4 Brest (FT) Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague (FT) Phil Foden, starting his first League game of the season, has doubled City\u2019s lead with a fine finish. Doku played the ball back to him on the edge of the box, and Foden guided it beautifully into the far corner. GOAL! Inter 1-0 Red Star (Calhanoglu 11) A spectacular, if also deflected, free-kick from Hakan Calhanoglu has put Inter ahead. 12 min: Dortmund 2-1 Celtic Adeyemi\u2019s goal came seconds after the Dortmund keeper Gregor Kobel had the ball at his feet. His long kick was laid off superbly by Guirassy to Brandt, who put Adeyemi through on goal. His shot took a big deflection off Trusty and beat Schmeichel at the near post. Dortmund are back in front through Karim Adeyemi! Maeda had only just equalised, although he didn\u2019t know much about it. Can made a mess of Arne Engels\u2019 cross and the ball hit Maede, six yards out, before flying in. GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Young Boys (Lewandowski 8) An open goal from Raphinha\u2019s cross on the turn. Daizen Maeda has equalised straight away! Ilkay Gundogan gets the first goal of his second spell at Manchester City. Savinho\u2019s volley was blocked and rebounded to Gundogan on the edge of the area. He belted a first-time shot that took a big deflection and flew into the top corner. Emre Can pings the penalty nonchalantly down the middle. Penalty to Dortmund Jamie Bynoe-Gittens takes advantage of a fortuitous ricochet, goes round Kasper Schmeichel and is brought down. A clear penalty. 5 min: Dortmund 0-0 Celtic All Dortmund, it says here. 2 min: Slovan Bratislava 0-0 Man City A City corner almost leads to a goal \u2013 for Bratislava. They broke with pace and precision, covering almost the length of the field before Tigran Barseghyan rifled just wide from the edge of the area. It\u2019s almost time for kick-off in the seven late games. Don\u2019t forget that Arsenal v Paris Saint-Germain has a liveblog all to itself. The things we do for page impressions our readers, eh. Friends/former colleagues reunited I swear you\u2019ll never see anything like this ever again. So gawp at it. Drink it in. Brest have run riot in Austria to continue their perfect start to Champions League life. Next up: Bayer Leverkusen at home. In their last home game, Stuttgart plugged Dortmund 5-1. Tonight they\u2019ve been held by Sparta Prague, who earned a point through Kaan Kairinen\u2019s mighty free-kick. There are nine more games tomorrow, including Aston Villa v Bayern Munich\u2026 \u2026 and Liverpool v Bologna. Read Jamie Jackson\u2019s preview of Slovan Bratislava v Manchester City \u201cAccording to your preamble no team has ever qualified from the league stage after losing its first two games,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cBut can this apply to new Bigger Cup, with a very different league stage? Are we in a Schrodinger\u2019s-league situation, with the league existing and not existing at the same time?\u201d We\u2019re not in a Schrodinger\u2019s-league situation so much as a weary-hack-cracking-facile-gags situation. Dortmund v Celtic preview We\u2019re playing against a team that are challenging the very top end of elite football. But for us, I\u2019ve always said, whether it\u2019s domestically or whether it\u2019s away in this competition, it\u2019s making us a really difficult team to play against, with and without the ball. That\u2019s what we want to be able to do. GOAL! Salzburg 0-4 Brest (Pereira Lage 75) GOAl! Salzburg 0-3 Brest (Sima 71) The greatest story in football history continues. Abdallah Sima has scored his second and Brest\u2019s third, strengthening their hold on this season\u2019s Champions League. \u201cHi Rob, from a finally sunny Indianapolis, after four days of Helene-inspired gloom and rain!\u201d writes Joe Pearson. \u201cThanks to the vast buffet that is Paramount+, I have my choice of matches. Which one is the gem of the bunch? I\u2019m tempted by Leverkusen-Milan, but I might just go for the whiparound show. Or there\u2019s baseball playoffs. The dilemmas of a retired American.\u201d If I wasn\u2019t working I\u2019d probably be watching Pine Barrens for the 497th time Arsenal v PSG, though the Leverkusen and Dortmund games are also appealing. It\u2019s David Squires, it\u2019s great GOAL! Salzburg 0-2 Brest (Camara 66) Mahdi Camara has doubled Brest\u2019s lead in Austria, and you know what that means. A piece of advice: if you ever need team news for Young Boys, don\u2019t type \u2018Young Boys Twitter\u2019 into Google. Breaking news that has nothing whatsoever to do with the Champions League or any European competition because the ban would only have applied to domestic games. 56 min: Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague \u201cI recommend you look up Kairinen\u2019s goal for Sparta Prague,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cIt\u2019s the type of free kick that isn\u2019t in fashion these days, the ball flew like it was on a VHS tape called 101 Great Free Kicks, hitting the top of the post before flying in, with the goalkeeper an inch from getting a hand to it.\u201d Celtic have been walloping allcomers so it\u2019s no surprise they\u2019re unchanged. So are Dortmund, who beat VfL Bochum on Friday night. Mikel Arteta has named an unchanged team. You can read all about that and the PSG XI with Scott Murray. Plenty of rotation from Pep, as you\u2019d expect. Stefan Ortega Moreno, John Stones, Phil Foden, Savinho, Matheus Nunes and Jeremy Doku all come into the side. Foden starts for the first time this season in either the Premier League or Champions League. Slovan Bratislava Takac, Blackman, Kashia, Bajric, Wimmer, Savvidis, Ignatenko, Barseghyan, Tolic, Weiss, Strelec. Substitutes: Trnovsky, Hrdina, Voet, Medvedev, Marcelli, Mustafic, Mak, Zuberu, Pauschek, Gajdos, Szoke, Metsoko. Big Cup is dead, long live Bigger Cup It\u2019s half-time in the two early games. Abdallah Sima has put Brest ahead at Salzburg \u2013 and top of the as-it-stands Champions League table and yes we are milking this \u2013 while Stuttgart are level at home to Sparta Prague. Enzo Millot scored for Stuttgart; Kaan Kairinen equalised for Sparta. Good evening one and all. Life moves pretty fast, and by tomorrow night we\u2019ll be a quarter of the way through the new league stage of the Champions League. A quarter! Two-eighths! Before you know it it\u2019ll be 31 May 2025 and Carlo Ancelotti will be eating another celebratory cigar. Carlo\u2019s men aren\u2019t in action tonight, but there are nine games involving eight former winners of the competition. The most eyecatching contest is between two teams who have never been champions of Europe: Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, who meet at the Emirates Stadium. That match has its own liveblog right here. There are two meetings of former champions: Borussia Dortmund (1997) v Celtic (1967) and Internazionale (1964, 1965, 2010) at home to Red Star Belgrade (1991). Manchester City and Barcelona have winnable matches, while AC Milan have a tricky trip to Leverkusen. They were well beaten by Liverpool a fortnight ago and their manager Paulo Fonseca will be conscious that no team has ever qualified from the league stage after losing their first two games. These are the fixtures, all 8pm BST kick-offs unless otherwise stated. Salzburg 0-1 Brest (5.45pm) Stuttgart 1-1 Sparta Prague (5.45pm) Arsenal v Paris Saint-Germain Barcelona v Young Boys Dortmund v Celtic Inter v Red Star Leverkusen v Milan PSV Eindhoven v Sporting CP Slovan Bratislava v Manchester City",

      "bodyText": "Eddie Howe was evidently not exaggerating when, on the eve of kick-off, he described AFC Wimbledon as \u201cwell organised\u201d. If anything it proved quite an understatement as Johnnie Jackson\u2019s League Two players not merely prevented Newcastle from scoring in open play but succeeded in frequently silencing St James\u2019 Park. It took a coolly dispatched first-half penalty from the excellent Fabian Sch\u00e4r to book Howe\u2019s team an intriguing last 16 tie at home to Chelsea at the end of a night when Wimbledon failed to produce a shot of note on target but their excellent captain Joe Lewis proved obduracy personified at the heart of his team\u2019s central defensive trinity. Maybe it was more by accident than design but Riley Harbottle proved emblematic of Wimbledon\u2019s collective defiance when Joe Willock\u2019s volley smacked straight into his face. Not that any of that pair\u2019s similarly committed teammates were exactly shabby as many of a crowd of almost 52,000 probably had to pinch themselves when they recalled that this time last year, Newcastle were beating Paris Saint-Germain 4-1 here in the Champions League. As recently as last Saturday Manchester City\u2019s Pep Guardiola suggested that Newcastle are \u201cimpossible\u201d to contain for a full 90 minutes but, much as Howe\u2019s players dominated around 80% possession and were never in real danger of defeat, Wimbledon made a pretty good fist of thwarting them. \u201cA brilliant effort from our guys,\u201d said Jackson, who maintained the penalty should never have been awarded. Howe had reason to thank his lucky stars it was given following a debate between referee and linesman. \u201cJob done,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s relieved manager. \u201cWe\u2019re through to the next round. It was a very difficult game and I\u2019m frustrated with our attacking play but credit to Wimbledon for the way they defended. They frustrated us.\u201d The tie was supposed to have been played in London a week ago but when torrential rain led to a sinkhole opening up on the sodden Plough Lane pitch postponement beckoned. It prompted a switch of venues almost 300 miles north yet Jackson\u2019s team arrived buoyed not merely by a highly promising start to their League Two campaign but having eliminated Premier League Ipswich in the previous round. Despite making eight changes from the XI that started last Saturday\u2019s draw with City here, Howe \u2013 whose club donated \u00a315,000 to the Plough Lane repair efforts \u2013 named a strong side constructed around the talents of, among others, Joelinton, Willock and Harvey Barnes. Given that it was augmented by an even stronger bench featuring Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, Sandro Tonali and Anthony Gordon Wimbledon had reason to look daunted. Instead they largely held their own, looking pretty comfortable as Newcastle struggled to create clear cut chances. It dictated that Howe\u2019s former Sheffield United forward, Will Osula, found himself intelligently second guessed and starved of service on his first start. Granted Jackson\u2019s players were far too concerned with damage limitation to conjure many attacks of their own yet, at times, it was hard to believe 60 League places separated this pair at kick-off. If the moments when Sch\u00e4r\u2019s brilliant throughball to Miguel Almir\u00f3n very nearly undid Jackson\u2019s rearguard and a swerving shot unleashed by Barnes\u2019s right boot curved fractionally wide served as reminders that Newcastle could play a bit after all, they were strictly isolated. Indeed an unapologetically direct Wimbledon could conceivably have taken the lead when Joe Pigott slipped a low pass to the onrushing Omar Bugiel who was denied by Martin Dubravka\u2019s brave block, leaving the goalkeeper nursing a knee injury that necessitated his replacement by the debutant Odysseas Vlachodimos at the start of the second half. By then Sch\u00e4r, Howe\u2019s best player here, had sealed victory after being upended in the box by Joe Piggott before Piggott then sent Almir\u00f3n crashing. \u201cI\u2019m fuming about it; the first one is a dive and should be a yellow card and the second is a coming together,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cThe referee wasn\u2019t going to give the penalty then the linesman got involved.

J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku claimed a corner, which G\u00fcndogan delivered from the right. Vladimir Weiss\u2019s side defended and as Phil Foden tracked the manager\u2019s son, also Vladimir Weiss, he received the ball. Watching from the sideline, Guardiola winced as Weiss beat City\u2019s No 10 and steered the ball across to Marko Tolic, who missed.</p> \n<p>The home fans adored this but not what followed \u2013 the opener. City clipped possession about, creating openings for Erling Haaland to surge down the left and, then, for a flying Savinho scissor-kick. The latter was blocked, the ball bounced to a lurking G\u00fcndogan outside Slovan\u2019s area: his shot pinballed via Kyriakos Savvidis beyond the helpless goalkeeper, Dominik Takac.</p> \n<p>Weiss Jnr, Slovan\u2019s captain, and Weiss Snr exchanged words but soon their side were 2-0 down. This had been billed as a mismatch and Foden, making his first start of the season against Slovakia\u2019s champions of the past six years, suggested why with a curled finish of poise, courtesy of Doku\u2019s pass.</p> \n<p>In a switch typical of Guardiola\u2019s ever-active brain, Doku operated on the right and Savinho on the left: a first designed to throw the opposition, and which reaped several corners and an array of bisecting moves. Rico Lewis and Doku combined and the right-back shot, Takac saved, and then the winger saw an effort thump off the left post.</p> \n<p>This had become akin to an attacking exercise for City. A Foden attempt was parried by Takac on to the post and Slovan escaped again, as the drummer behind the keeper\u2019s goal led Slovan\u2019s <em>tifosi</em> in endless chants. Guardiola was not content, with City\u2019s sloppiness, Foden a main culprit, as when losing the ball, forcing Haaland to gallop back to help, the manager wheeling round to grumble to his coaching staff.</p> \n<p>Foden, too, blasted the ball wide when Haaland was available and miscued when trying to continue a sequence that involved Josko Gvardiol and Lewis. But the No 47\u2019s rustiness did not matter as long as City kept probing.</p> \n<p>Next to take aim and hit the frame of the goal was G\u00fcndogan, from 19 yards out, the bar denying the visiting captain his second, as this opening 45 minutes ended as it started: with City tormenting their hosts and the drummer drumming.</p> \n<p>Keeping the ball against City is tough due to the ruthlessness of their hunt-in-numbers press. So Cesar Blackman killing the chance to do this by spearing a wild crossfield ball that Kevin Wimmer failed to stop going out was criminal. Guardiola spotted the same from his men in the ongoing vulnerability to transitions, which pointed to Rodri\u2019s absence, as City were not the efficient unit who could move Slovan around in continual passages.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The issue eased when relief came following the type of break that worried the Catalan. One moment, Tigran Barseghyan was unloading near City\u2019s goal, the next Haaland was slaloming in on Lewis\u2019s pass, rounding Takac, and slotting in coolly to make it 3-0, in what proved the Norwegian\u2019s sign-off. He was replaced soon after by McAtee, with R\u00faben Dias also coming on \u2013 for Manuel Akanji, the defender taking the armband from G\u00fcndogan.</p> \n<p>McAtee\u2019s goal to remember came from a Foden pass and was an expertly drilled shot into the bottom corner. \u201cBuzzing to score,\u201d he said.</p>",

This had been billed as a mismatch and Foden, making his first start of the season against Slovakia\u2019s champions of the past six years, suggested why with a curled finish of poise, courtesy of Doku\u2019s pass. In a switch typical of Guardiola\u2019s ever-active brain, Doku operated on the right and Savinho on the left: a first designed to throw the opposition, and which reaped several corners and an array of bisecting moves. Rico Lewis and Doku combined and the right-back shot, Takac saved, and then the winger saw an effort thump off the left post. This had become akin to an attacking exercise for City. A Foden attempt was parried by Takac on to the post and Slovan escaped again, as the drummer behind the keeper\u2019s goal led Slovan\u2019s tifosi in endless chants. Guardiola was not content, with City\u2019s sloppiness, Foden a main culprit, as when losing the ball, forcing Haaland to gallop back to help, the manager wheeling round to grumble to his coaching staff. Foden, too, blasted the ball wide when Haaland was available and miscued when trying to continue a sequence that involved Josko Gvardiol and Lewis. But the No 47\u2019s rustiness did not matter as long as City kept probing. Next to take aim and hit the frame of the goal was G\u00fcndogan, from 19 yards out, the bar denying the visiting captain his second, as this opening 45 minutes ended as it started: with City tormenting their hosts and the drummer drumming. Keeping the ball against City is tough due to the ruthlessness of their hunt-in-numbers press. So Cesar Blackman killing the chance to do this by spearing a wild crossfield ball that Kevin Wimmer failed to stop going out was criminal. Guardiola spotted the same from his men in the ongoing vulnerability to transitions, which pointed to Rodri\u2019s absence, as City were not the efficient unit who could move Slovan around in continual passages. The issue eased when relief came following the type of break that worried the Catalan. One moment, Tigran Barseghyan was unloading near City\u2019s goal, the next Haaland was slaloming in on Lewis\u2019s pass, rounding Takac, and slotting in coolly to make it 3-0, in what proved the Norwegian\u2019s sign-off. He was replaced soon after by McAtee, with R\u00faben Dias also coming on \u2013 for Manuel Akanji, the defender taking the armband from G\u00fcndogan. McAtee\u2019s goal to remember came from a Foden pass and was an expertly drilled shot into the bottom corner. \u201cBuzzing to score,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>A terminal cancer diagnosis isn\u2019t usually something that makes anyone feel hopeful. TV portrayals, fictional and otherwise, tend to depict the disease as tragic and cataclysmic (which, of course, it can be), with the patient relegated to bed to \u201cbattle\u201d the disease from the off. But Kris Hallenga \u2013 the focus of the BBC documentary Living Every Second: The Kris Hallenga Story, who was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at just 23<em> </em>years old \u2013 didn\u2019t want her story to unfurl like that. Instead, she decided, she would live harder, fuller and with even more purpose. \u201cShe was oozing with life and ideas and she was desperate to make big shit happen,\u201d her twin sister Maren tells the camera. \u201cWanting to get every ounce out of this life was a way of controlling this disease.\u201d</p> <p>For Hallenga, that sense of purpose came in the form of telling as many young people as possible to check their breasts \u2013 a widespread campaign that would turn into the still-active charity organisation <a href=\"https://coppafeel.org/\">CoppaFeel!</a>. Women in the UK don\u2019t get invited to breast screenings until the age of 50 (when they\u2019re most at risk), though of course, breast cancer can strike at any age. Hallenga wanted to make sure other young people knew this. She wanted to save lives. But also, she wanted to make even <em>talking</em> about cancer less scary. So in 2013, she made a film for the BBC about living with breast cancer,<em> </em>Kris: Dying to Live. And then, in the decade that followed, invited the cameras back in again and again. This film, from the director Neil Bonner, is the result of that footage.</p> <p>Though The Kris Hallenga Story is ostensibly based around a cancer diagnosis, the film is more generally about Kris\u2019s life, which was bigger than that. She grew up in Germany with her twin sister, whom she obviously adored. She liked running around the garden and making dens. She was articulate, imaginative, fun to be around. She was directionless as a young adult, as we all are, but breast cancer awareness became something she was passionate about. \u201cCancer gave me a life I never could have imagined,\u201d she says early on in the documentary. She was fearless in a way that seems completely contagious, even through a screen. In 2009, she won a Pride of Britain award for her charity work. \u201cYou can\u2019t say no to Kris,\u201d says Fearne Cotton, who ran a half marathon for CoppaFeel! and became her friend straight away. \u201cI loved her from the minute I met her.\u201d</p> <p>The film doesn\u2019t always make for easy viewing. You watch as she\u2019s diagnosed with multiple brain tumours and then as her cancer progresses. But there are also moments in which she is alarmingly animated: projecting \u201c1 in 3 are diagnosed. #RETHINKCANCER\u201d on to the side of the Houses of Parliament like it\u2019s a heist movie, or being there for the birth of Maren\u2019s son, Herbie. Which is life, isn\u2019t it? There are hideous moments and there are beautiful moments, and some lives end up being a lot shorter than others. By 2017, she had stepped down as the CEO of CoppaFeel! to focus on herself and how she wanted to spend her time. \u201cWhen I held Herbie,\u201d says Kris, \u201che confirmed something very reassuring that I sort of already knew: that life goes on.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s astonishing that Kris was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in 2013 and went on to live a full and remarkable life for another decade or so. And it\u2019s also astonishing \u2013 and funny, and fun \u2013 that she decided to throw her own funeral, so she could be alive to attend it. Which we see at the start and towards the end: Kris with her head painted a dramatic, sparkling silver, while Dawn French delivers a eulogy to a packed-out church. \u201cRight now I am really happy, and I feel such heart-bursting love,\u201d she says at her own funeral. \u201cLife can be so good. But I think mine has been especially good because I\u2019ve had Maren by my side since we met in the womb. When you have a Maren, you never feel true loneliness. How lucky am I?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/06/coppafeel-breast-cancer-charity-founder-kris-hallenga-dies\">CoppaFeel! breast cancer charity founder Kris Hallenga dies aged 38</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kris died earlier this year, and her sister and friends sprinkled her ashes all over the waves on a sunny day.

Women in the UK don\u2019t get invited to breast screenings until the age of 50 (when they\u2019re most at risk), though of course, breast cancer can strike at any age. Hallenga wanted to make sure other young people knew this. She wanted to save lives. But also, she wanted to make even talking about cancer less scary. So in 2013, she made a film for the BBC about living with breast cancer, Kris: Dying to Live. And then, in the decade that followed, invited the cameras back in again and again. This film, from the director Neil Bonner, is the result of that footage. Though The Kris Hallenga Story is ostensibly based around a cancer diagnosis, the film is more generally about Kris\u2019s life, which was bigger than that. She grew up in Germany with her twin sister, whom she obviously adored. She liked running around the garden and making dens. She was articulate, imaginative, fun to be around. She was directionless as a young adult, as we all are, but breast cancer awareness became something she was passionate about. \u201cCancer gave me a life I never could have imagined,\u201d she says early on in the documentary. She was fearless in a way that seems completely contagious, even through a screen. In 2009, she won a Pride of Britain award for her charity work. \u201cYou can\u2019t say no to Kris,\u201d says Fearne Cotton, who ran a half marathon for CoppaFeel! and became her friend straight away. \u201cI loved her from the minute I met her.\u201d The film doesn\u2019t always make for easy viewing. You watch as she\u2019s diagnosed with multiple brain tumours and then as her cancer progresses. But there are also moments in which she is alarmingly animated: projecting \u201c1 in 3 are diagnosed. #RETHINKCANCER\u201d on to the side of the Houses of Parliament like it\u2019s a heist movie, or being there for the birth of Maren\u2019s son, Herbie. Which is life, isn\u2019t it? There are hideous moments and there are beautiful moments, and some lives end up being a lot shorter than others. By 2017, she had stepped down as the CEO of CoppaFeel! to focus on herself and how she wanted to spend her time. \u201cWhen I held Herbie,\u201d says Kris, \u201che confirmed something very reassuring that I sort of already knew: that life goes on.\u201d It\u2019s astonishing that Kris was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in 2013 and went on to live a full and remarkable life for another decade or so. And it\u2019s also astonishing \u2013 and funny, and fun \u2013 that she decided to throw her own funeral, so she could be alive to attend it. Which we see at the start and towards the end: Kris with her head painted a dramatic, sparkling silver, while Dawn French delivers a eulogy to a packed-out church. \u201cRight now I am really happy, and I feel such heart-bursting love,\u201d she says at her own funeral. \u201cLife can be so good. But I think mine has been especially good because I\u2019ve had Maren by my side since we met in the womb. When you have a Maren, you never feel true loneliness. How lucky am I?\u201d Kris died earlier this year, and her sister and friends sprinkled her ashes all over the waves on a sunny day. She also managed to save a lot of lives. In the film, you see her receiving reams of letters from young women in their 20s and beyond who were diagnosed with breast cancer early enough to receive treatment after being aware of the signs and symptoms, thanks to the charity Kris launched. \u201cThe thing about death is it\u2019s, well, so terribly final,\u201d says Kris, addressing the crowd at her own funeral. \u201cWhereas life, well, life is full of opportunities. So let\u2019s seize these opportunities. Let\u2019s live fully, love deeply and make today count.\u201d \u2022 Living Every Second: The Kris Hallenga Story aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now",

For context, 8.4in over that time span would have been considered a once-in-1,000-year event by a metric created prior to climate change. Camp said local infrastructure wasn\u2019t designed to be resilient even under once-in-100-year or once-in-500-year circumstances. Had they been, \u201cthose design guidelines and standards kind of got thrown out the window\u201d. Authorities in North Carolina resumed search and rescue efforts Tuesday with hopes of delivering aid and making contact with hundreds of people left isolated after Helene washed out roads and damaged cellphone towers, Reuters reported. More than 1.7 million homes and businesses in six states from Florida to West Virginia remained without power Tuesday.",

The Iranian regime (the IRGC in particular) is feeling the pressure to show its regional proxies and allies, from Hezbollah to the Houthis in Yemen, that it is not a weakling but a regional power of substance, the leader of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has a freer hand. With Iranian missiles over Tel Aviv, it is far harder for Washington to try to influence his actions, and much tougher for the prime minister\u2019s opponents to call for his ousting. Today, Netanyahu is also significantly closer to his longstanding ambition: to involve the US in a war on Iran which will destroy its nuclear programme, now close to the capacity to make a weapon after the collapse of the 2015 multilateral agreement, the JCPOA, which kept the programme within limits. According to the latest reports on Tuesday night, Iran\u2019s missiles had caused minimal injuries, but raised the spectre of what might be to come in the next few years: missiles 12 minutes from Israel, carrying nuclear warheads. Israel\u2019s wars of destruction against its regional enemies, first Hamas and then Hezbollah, are bound to add urgency to arguments from Iranian hawks that only a nuclear weapon can keep the country safe and powerful. In turn, the fear that those arguments might carry the day in Tehran will fuel calls in Israel for a pre-emptive war. In such dangerous times, the region has historically looked to Washington to contain and reverse the logic of escalation. But the man currently inhabiting the Oval Office is a lame duck president who has been ignored to the point of humiliation in recent months by the US\u2019s closest ally in the Middle East. There have long been voices in the US defence establishment calling for the US to act preemptively against the Iranian nuclear programme. Those will now increase in an effort to influence a president who has vowed to defend Israel against the Iranian threat. Biden\u2019s administration has generally been cautious when it comes to military ventures abroad, and Harris is expected to follow a similar path, with less of a sentimental attachment to Israel. But the escalating violence in the Middle East will damage her chances of succeeding Biden in the White House, and bring closer the prospect of the return of the greatest wild card of all, Donald Trump.",

      "bodyText": "As research finds that the deadly Hurricane Helene was greatly exacerbated by global warming, Donald Trump is continuing to deny the climate crisis and court donations from the industry most responsible for planetary heating. Environmentalists worry that he will also gut flood protections and climate policy if he wins November\u2019s presidential election. Hours before Helene made landfall in Florida\u2019s Big Bend region Thursday night as a major category 4 hurricane, Trump baselessly said nuclear \u201cwarming\u201d, not the climate crisis, is \u201cthe warming that you\u2019re going to have to be very careful with\u201d. The following day, he said the \u201clittle hurricane\u201d was partially responsible for attendees leaving his rallies early. As the hurricane continued to ravage the region over the weekend, the former president dismissed global warming in a Saturday speech, and the following day referred to the climate crisis as \u201cone of the great scams of all time\u201d. Helene has now killed more than 150 people across the region. On Tuesday in Wisconsin, Trump incorrectly said that under the \u201cgreen new scam\u201d, Democrats \u201cwanted to rip down all the buildings in Manhattan and they wanted to rebuild them without windows\u201d. No environmental plans included removing windows from buildings, though Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act did include incentives for replacing windows with more energy-efficient models. A preliminary study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, published on Monday night, found that climate change caused 50% more rainfall during the hurricane in some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas. \u201cIt\u2019s obscene that communities \u2026 are suffering and dying from the reality of the climate emergency while Donald Trump denies that it even exists,\u201d said Brett Hartl, political director at the environmental non-profit Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund. When Trump visited hurricane-ravaged Georgia on Monday, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re here today to stand with complete solidarity with the people of Georgia and all those suffering in the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\u201d But he is now headed back to the campaign trail to court donations from the fossil fuel industry, which accounts for over 75% of all planet-heating pollution and nearly 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions. On Wednesday, Trump will attend two fundraisers in oil-rich Texas. First, he will hold an invite-only lunch in the Permian Basin, the world\u2019s most productive oilfield. Later, he\u2019ll reportedly hold a Houston cocktail party co-hosted by Jeff Hildebrand, who runs Hilcorp Oil and has been a major donor to Trump since 2017. Last week, Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, also attended two fundraisers thrown by oil industry executives in Dallas and Fort Worth, before being forced to cancel two Georgia fundraisers due to the hurricane. The events come months after Trump reportedly offered a brazen \u201cdeal\u201d to oil bosses, proposing that they give him $1bn for his White House re-election campaign and vowing that once back in office he would shred dozens of environmental regulations and prevent any new ones, sparking congressional investigations. Plans to gut emergency management Trump has also come under fire for his ties to Project 2025, a wide-ranging policy blueprint from which he has tried to distance himself, but which was written by allies and previous advisers of his. The plan leave US communities with far fewer resources to rebuild after climate disasters. If enacted, the plan would end the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (Fema) federal flood insurance program \u2013 the primary source of federal flood insurance across the country \u2013 and replace it with private insurance plans \u201cstarting with the least risky areas currently identified by the program\u201d. The playbook calls for an end to Fema\u2019s disaster preparedness grants. And it calls to break up and privatize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency should \u201cfully commercialize its forecasting operations and focus on providing data to private companies\u201d, the plan says, referring to forecasts done by the National Weather Service, the country\u2019s main source of weather forecasting which sends out warnings about disasters like Helene. \u201cWhile roads, bridges and entire towns are being washed away, Trump and Project 2025 plan to gut Fema and roadblock every agency from confronting the climate crisis,\u201d said the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Hartl. Project 2025 additionally calls for a \u201creview\u201d of the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service which provides warnings, forecasts and analysis on dangerous storms. Data collected by the center should be \u201cpresented neutrally, without adjustments intended to support any one side in the climate debate\u201d, the project says. But scientists have long warned that the climate crisis is strongly linked to increased hurricane intensity. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Heritage Foundation, the rightwing thinktank that led Project 2025, said the plan \u201cdoes not call for the elimination of NOAA, the NWS, or the NHC\u201d. \u201cRather than \u2018cutting\u2019 FEMA, Project 2025 is advocating for a realignment of the agency\u2019s mission and focus \u2013 away from DEI and climate change initiatives and restoring it to that of helping people before, during, and after disasters,\u201d the agency said. But the proposal would slash protections for flood-affected communities. And it would also more broadly catalyze a dismantling of climate policy, including efforts to curb planet-heating emissions. \u201cDonald Trump just denied climate change for a week straight, is raising money from big oil billionaires tomorrow, and is planning to gut disaster aid with his Project 2025 agenda next year,\u201d said Pete Jones, rapid response director for the climate-focused advocacy group Climate Power. \u201cWhen American communities are devastated by extreme weather, Trump\u2019s plan is to increase their suffering while handing out $110bn in tax breaks to big oil.\u201d",

Five of the wounded were described as being in a serious condition. CCTV footage showed two men, reportedly armed with an assault rifle and a knife, dressed in black emerging from a train near the light-rail stop along Jerusalem Boulevard where they opened fire on passersby as well as on a second nearby street. Video in the aftermath of the attack showed a number of bodies slumped under the awning of the station, while one image shared on social media purported to show the men executing one of wounded as they lay on the ground. According to one report, the attackers shot and stabbed passengers on the Tel Aviv light rail before continuing on foot and attacking people on Jerusalem Boulevard.

      "body": "<p>British novelist Ross Raisin has won the 2024 BBC national short story award for Ghost Kitchen, a story narrated by a bicycle courier and inspired by the gig economy.</p> <p>Raisin was announced as the winner of the \u00a315,000 prize, which is run in collaboration with Cambridge University, on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>\u201cI feel very happy,\u201d said Raisin shortly after finding out that he had won. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bit of a struggle for quite a while with wondering whether writing is still a viable thing for me to continue doing as a living. This moment really does give me fuel. Financial fuel, for sure, but more importantly, creative fuel\u201d.</p> <p>Ghost Kitchen follows Sean, a young man who becomes a courier after a tragic family incident. Raisin said he became interested in the growth of ghost kitchens \u2013 food businesses that exclusively serve customers by delivery or pick-up, with no dine-in space \u2013 while writing his last novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/31/a-hunger-by-ross-raisin-review-his-most-ambitious-novel-yet\">A Hunger</a>, which was published in 2022.</p> <p>Ghost kitchens, or dark kitchens, are \u201cso-called in part because they have no windows, no way for anybody on the outside to see in\u201d; they are \u201coften on the outskirts of urban areas\u201d, \u201cconcealed islands that sometimes create the conditions for darkness to flourish,\u201d said Raisin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/31/a-hunger-by-ross-raisin-review-his-most-ambitious-novel-yet\">A Hunger by Ross Raisin review \u2013 his most ambitious novel yet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He had also been thinking about food delivery models and having some \u201cfascinating conversations\u201d with couriers, which \u201cled naturally to a deeper level of critical and creative thinking about the gig economy\u201d.</p> <p>Some background knowledge for the story came from \u201cyears of working either in kitchens or around kitchens, in hotels and bars and restaurants,\u201d Raisin said. New details came from talking to food service workers. \u201cThe guy ends up working in a fish and chip kitchen, and so I had to understand how deep fat fryers work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a lovely afternoon going with my daughter to the B&amp;Q car park on the Hull Road in York, which has a chip van in it\u201d serving \u201cthe best chips that I know of in York.\u201d He asked the man running it: \u201cTell me everything about that deep fat fryer \u2013 how it works, and what the temperature should be, and how do you clean it at the end of the night, and what do you do with your spent oil?\u201d</p> <p>Ghost Kitchen was a \u201cstandout story from the beginning,\u201d said novelist and prize judge Jenn Ashworth. \u201cWe loved the delicacy of the prose, the pitch perfect handling of memory and backstory.\u201d</p> <p>Raisin was born in Keighley, Yorkshire, and now lives in York. He has written four novels and is the author of the creative writing guide Read This If You Want to Be a Great Writer, published in 2018. In 2013, he was named on Granta\u2019s once-a-decade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/15/granta-list-british-novelists\">Best of young British novelists list</a>.</p> <p>He said that he has begun developing a novel which \u201ctakes the same world and characters and themes\u201d as Ghost Kitchen but explores new topics related to the gig economy and \u201cdifferent kinds of violence \u2013 physical violence, corporate violence \u2013 and also the justice system, the asylum system\u201d.</p> <p>Raisin was shortlisted alongside finance lawyer Manish Chauhan and novelists Will Boast, Vee Walker and Lucy Caldwell, who won the prize in 2021. The shortlisted authors receive \u00a3600 each. Their stories are available to listen to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079gw3/episodes/player\">on BBC Sounds</a> and are also featured in an anthology published by Comma Press.</p> <p>Alongside Ashworth on this year\u2019s judging panel were writers Michael Donkor and Xiaolu Guo, BBC Audio\u2019s books editor Di Speirs, and chair of judges, presenter Paddy O\u2019Connell.</p> <p>\u201cI am absolutely delighted that Ross Raisin, a writer whose novels have stopped me in my tracks and made me see afresh, has turned his undoubted talent to the short story, and with similarly powerful effect,\u201d said Speirs. \u201cA brilliantly rendered glimpse into life in the edge-lands, Ghost Kitchen combines the tension of a dark plot with an unexpected and moving exploration of male friendship.\u201d</p> <p>Previous winners of the award include Jonathan Buckley, Sarah Hall and Saba Sams. In 2023, Naomi Wood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/26/bestselling-author-naomi-wood-wins-2023-bbc-national-short-story-award\">won the prize</a> for her story Comorbidities, a story about a couple who decide to make a sex tape.</p> <p>Also announced was the winner of the BBC young writer\u2019s award, open to 14- to 18-year-olds, which went to Lulu Frisson, a 17-year-old sixth former from Birmingham. Her story, Special, is about a neurodiverse student who is struggling at school until an empathic teacher encourages her creativity.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Ghost Kitchen by Ross Raisin</h2>    <p>Already, he had mastered these streets. He knew the cuts through the alleyways and service areas; where there would be vehicles parked over the cycle lanes; which lights could be run. He had also, finally, mastered the bike \u2013 which had been Frank\u2019s and was, in truth, a piece of shit \u2013 and as he rode now onto Museum Street, past the theatre, the memorial park, the old boy playing his penny whistle outside the library, he knew to downshift softly, before the bike got wind of the climb ahead, letting the gears decide for themselves when to catch.</p> <p>At the crest of the hill \u2013 the momentary view over yellow fields beyond the city \u2013 Sean pushed on, down towards the outskirts. He was two minutes behind. He moved into the middle of the lane and pedalled harder, nervous energy coursing through him, until at the end of the street he was forced to stop. Commuter traffic crawled thickly across the junction in front of him. For a whole minute he waited, watching the slow procession of drivers alone in their cars \u2013 before the release of the light when he could slice through the congestion, out onto the other side of the ring road.</p> <p>The roads were at once quieter here. Sean rode quickly, feeling the new strength in his legs. The dark was coming on but he left his lights in his jacket pocket, not wanting to stop and lose more time attaching them, or to make himself more visible. There was nobody about, though. No figures in the shadows of the buildings, no police, yet he remained watchful, checking around him at every turning, the entrance to every enclosed street. The dyke was close to here. He could turn to look down the passageway where part of it would be visible, but he resisted the impulse. He glanced at the wristwatch on his handlebar. He\u2019d gained almost a minute. Still he kept up his pace, moving deeper into this untouched part of the city where blue, spiked metal fencing ran along the backs of industrial units \u2013 an electrical distributors, a meat wholesaler, a document shredding firm \u2013 and massive tangles of blackthorn and brambles grew undisturbed on the roadside scrubland. When he turned onto the final lane he twisted round to look behind him. Nobody. The roller shutters of the house clearance depot were down and the only sound anywhere was the clicking of the front wheel as he slowed, stealing around the side of the next warehouse building, and dismounted. However long he was made to wait, he was exactly on time.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The door was open. Sean left the bike and walked up to it. Behind the grilles of the warehouse wall\u2019s two thin, cracked windows, the glass was fogged with condensation. Sean paused briefly, just outside the entrance, then went inside. Syrupy heat immediately enveloped him. He could see all the way down the gangway. A snarled mass of cables, dangling wires, hung down through the cloud above it. Below, the hands and arms of men, silent as ghouls, were moving in the brightly-lit mist of each pod. Even now, a couple of months since he had first come to this place, Sean was amazed by the smell. The smell was wild. Pungent. Weird. On that first night, he had walked down the gangway looking into each pod in turn, mesmerised by the stink and lights, the men with their quick hands, working without speaking inside their small caverns, until a man had appeared and told him to get back to the collection area.</p> <p>An order was on one of the collection shelves, the paper bag stapled and ready. Sean checked the code on his phone against the one on the wall screen. It was his. Outside, a car was pulling up, its engine just perceptible underneath the churning of the ventilation fans. He took off his bag and put the order inside \u2013 stooping to take in the smell of it through the mingled fumes of beefburgers and shawarma and Vietnamese food. He lingered for a few seconds before zipping the bag shut. Fish and chips. A smell that reminded him of childhood, of Frank; reminded him too that he had not eaten before coming out to work. He registered the collection and studied quickly the route that came up on his phone. He was about to set off when a movement in one pod, Unit 3, caught his eye. He stepped to the opening of the gangway, from where he could spy in. A tall, thick-set man, foreign, it seemed to Sean through the mist, stood with his back against one of the line of deep-fat fryers. A shorter man was standing in front of him, their faces close together. The short man laughed, pointing to the floor \u2013 and the tall man, bending down, went out of Sean\u2019s view, then stood up again. He held out a pair of tongs, which the short man took from him. Laughing again, and speaking to somebody out of Sean\u2019s sight, he raised the tongs towards the tall man\u2019s face and arranged the pincers around him, first from cheek to cheek, then from his chin to the top of his forehead, as if measuring his head. Sean could feel a familiar trickle of fear entering his blood. Suddenly, the short man threw the tongs to the floor, again the other man bent to retrieve them. There was a sound behind him \u2013 the man from the car coming into the building. Sean stepped back from the opening, put his bag onto his back, and went outside.</p> <p>He got on the bike and raced into the growing dark \u2013 security lights, mounted beneath the barbed wire coiled along the warehouse roof, firing on him, one by one, like search beams. In the shower, he let out a long moan of exhaustion. He knew that he should massage his legs, or at least stretch them out, but he was too tired to bother. And the aching in his thighs, his calves, felt good, a kind of release; it felt, as the water slid down the expanding muscular shapes of his legs, like somebody else\u2019s body.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The rain was good. The rain meant more deliveries, higher fees, because most riders turned the work down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He towelled himself dry and left the bathroom with the towel wrapped around him, crossing the corridor into his room. For a moment, the incident at the warehouse played again in his mind \u2013 he was too tired, though, to think about that, and it was nothing to do with him. He was doing okay. This was what he needed now. He could do as many, or as few, deliveries as he wanted. There was nobody to tell him otherwise; there was nobody to tell him anything at all. He could go whole days without having to see or speak to anybody, other than a fleeting transaction on a doorstep. He had become invisible. He picked his jeans up from the floor and fished out the night\u2019s surprising, pathetic, tip from his pocket, to put into the Tupperware on his window sill. Then he collapsed, naked and already almost asleep, onto the bed.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Long brown puddles had begun to form at the road edges. He was mostly able to steer around them, until a cabbie or a van driver, speeding past, pinned him to the kerb. The rain had been coming down heavily all afternoon. His skin burned under his sodden jeans but he did not care \u2013 he barely took any notice of the downpour as he rode and arrived at each office reception, each student house, or waited inside the steaming entrances of chain restaurants. The rain was good. The rain meant more deliveries, higher fees, because most riders turned the work down. Sometimes, when Sean did see another rider gliding by on the opposite side of the road, a necklace of water arcing from their rear wheel, he wondered at the strength of their need to come out into it, to be doing this too.</p> <p>The flat\u2019s button was the first of three grubby, peeling labels on the entry system. Rain drummed on the top of his bag while he waited on the doorstep. He pressed the button again. When it opened, a boy looked at him and laughed.</p> <p>\u201cHey, man \u2013 you look wet.\u201d</p> <p>Sean took the pizzas out of the bag and handed them to him.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d The boy lifted the stack of boxes up to his face, inspecting for damp. \u201cNice one.\u201d He turned to go back inside \u2013 \u201cSee you later!\u201d \u2013 and closed the door. The good thing about students: there was no awkward moment of pause when they didn\u2019t tip you. For a little while longer, rain tickling the skin of his back, Sean stayed on the doorstep. The boy\u2019s face, laughing. He was at least five years younger than Frank would be now, but something about his eyes, the mischief in them. A new request was pinging on his phone. He shielded the rain from the screen with his hand and saw, below the request, a message notification from earlier: Alright mate, how\u2019s things? None of us have... He swiped to clear it, and pressed on the order request. \u00a35.42. The Harbour Fisheries. Unit 3. He accepted, and got back onto his bike.</p> <p>He crossed over the ring road and into the industrial zone, where the hard metallic sound of rain on the warehouse roofs was all around him. At the top of the passageway to the dyke, he paused, looking down it to the wall above the water. Then he forced himself once again to move, and pressed on.</p> <p>He arrived at the warehouse two minutes late, but the order was not ready. He stepped through the collection area and looked into the pod. Four men were at four fryers, all of them working at speed \u2013 shaking baskets of chips, lifting golden bars of fish from the hot oil \u2013 the backs of their necks slick with sweat. The tall man from last night was putting a completed meal box into a paper bag, then carrying it into the service corridor, vanishing momentarily, before coming back into view behind the shelves of the collection area. When Sean moved forward towards the order, he was already on his way back to the pod.</p> <p>\u201cWant to earn some more?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A man with a big, moist beard and white, rubber boots had appeared, like a real fisherman, in the gangway entrance.</p> <p>Sean steadied himself, packing the order correctly into his bag. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cTwo of my staff fucked off this week, no warning for me, and tonight is last Friday of the month \u2013 busy, busy \u2013 so if you want that to be your last delivery today, job is yours.\u201d He was watching Sean put the bag over his shoulders. \u201cWe pay better than them.\u201d Sean gazed through the collection shelves to where the tall man had just been. He thought about all the hours he had ridden since signing to the app, to gain tonight\u2019s priority-access shift; a part of him, however, had already decided.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be worth it for you.\u201d The man looked down at the pool of water on the floor around Sean. \u201cAnd it is more dry in here.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The rain had eased off by the time he returned. The short man from last night, who, from his clothing, Sean now took to be the site manager, was smoking outside the building. When Sean went inside and looked down the gangway trench into the Unit 3 pod, only the tall man and one other worker were stood at the fryers. The man with the beard was approaching through the service corridor, into the space behind the collection shelves.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He lifted the metal counter flap to let Sean through. \u201cMehmet,\u201d he said, clapping himself on the chest. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p> <p>Mehmet led him into a windowless breeze-block room behind the pods. Towers of meal boxes, differently branded for each of the four pods, were lined against one wall. Further down the room, where it ran behind the other pods, Sean could see a large, clear bag full of burger buns, plump and squished like faces against the plastic. Mehmet beckoned him to the far corner, where it was darker, away from the light of the bare bulb above the door. \u201cHere.\u201d Mehmet handed him a navy apron. \u201cI will put you next to Zac. He can show you, but you can start with just chips. Should be easy now. No rain, less orders.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the pod, Mehmet spoke briefly to a young man with short, stiff blond hair, Zac, while Sean waited by the storeroom. The tall man was close to him, at the far end of the line. He was working quickly, extracting fish from the fryer with one hand at the same time as spooning mushy peas into a frilled paper pot with his other.</p> <p>Zac turned to face him. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d He pointed at the fryer next to his own. \u201cMr Chips.\u201d Zac showed him the correct amount of chips to get onto the shovel, how to mount and detach the basket, how to submerge it without splashing oil. \u201cCooked chips go in that tray. Keep them coming for now. I\u2019ll tell you when you can slow down.\u201d</p> <p>\u2018How do I know when they\u2019re cooked?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Ever eaten chips before?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Then you\u2019ll know.\u2019</p>    <p>For the next five or ten or twenty minutes he fell into the timeless dulled rhythm of the work, plunging the basket, again and again, watching the bubble and pop of tiny exhalations that rose to the surface of the black pond of fat. A low hum of unbroken labour was all around him: the shuffle of feet, the soft fizz of frying food, the drone of the extraction fan. Zac, he noticed, sometimes spoke quietly to himself while he worked, as if he was inside a dream. Once, a bang and a muffled shout came through the wall from the next pod \u2013 within touching distance, but as separate as another universe.</p> <p>Sean had forgotten to eat again, and his stomach reeled as he processed the baskets and baskets of chips. He saw with alarm that the short man was looking at him from the gangway. Sean focused on another shovel of pale, frozen chips, his skin tightening as he heard the man laugh. But when he peeked up, he realized with relief that the man was in fact looking past him \u2013 to the end of the line where Mehmet was standing directly behind the tall man. One of the frilly paper pots was balanced, upside-down on his head, like a miniature hat. Sean tried to ignore the frightened quickening of his blood when the short man came past behind him. He was laughing again, and when Sean turned to look, Mehmet was positioning another pot behind the first one. The man carried on at his tasks with the pots on his head, like it was a party game, and then Mehmet put down a third to make a line, a mohican of pots down the centre of his skull.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Dougie,\u201d Mehmet said to the short man, who was bent over with laughter, his hands on his knees. \u201cThat\u2019s how big their heads are!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He was able to lose himself in work \u2013 the pod was a place where the rest of the world, and his family, and the past no longer existed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Next to Sean, between him and the tall man, Zac was staring at the fish floating in front of him. Sean plunged another basket, his eyes following the flotsam of lost, blackened chips drifting against the scummy fatline of the metal, not allowing himself to look up again until the basket was done.</p> <p>A pyramid of pots was now stacked on the man\u2019s head. Mehmet stood with his arms folded, admiring his work, Dougie at his side losing his shit as Mehmet stepped forward, puckering his lips, to blow the pots off the man\u2019s head. They fell to the floor \u2013 except for one, which dropped into the boiling liquid of the man\u2019s fryer. For an instant, Sean was sure that he saw anger flicker in the man\u2019s face, and excitement rushed through him in anticipation of the man retaliating. Whatever instinct of reprisal had come into the man, however, he swiftly restrained. Sean watched him \u2013 Zac was openly watching now too \u2013 use his tongs to carefully pluck out the pot, brown and crumpled, from the fryer and put it into the bin by his knees, while Mehmet and Dougie walked away together into the storeroom.</p> <p>By the end of the night, Sean\u2019s clothes had dried to a crust, and the continuous mizzle of oil had caused red patches to bloom up his right forearm. Mehmet came up to him while Zac was demonstrating how to drain and clean down his fryer. He told Sean that he could work the rest of the weekend if he wanted. \u201cThen we see. Maybe you stay longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Sean said.</p> <p>When he looked down the line of fryers, the tall man had gone.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Over the next two days, he fell into a new routine: delivering from late morning through the afternoon; then, after a quick sandwich which he had foiled and tucked into the bottom of his bag, riding to the warehouse to stand at the fryers, into the night. He was upgraded to fish. Zac told him the cooking times for the different ones, which Sean wrote onto the base of one of the meal boxes. The tall man was there, at his usual fryer at the end of the line, on both days. A mute agitation moved through Sean each time Mehmet or Dougie went near him, although nothing happened, that Sean could see. The man simply got on quickly and silently with his work, uninterrupted.</p> <p>As the weekend went on, time continued to stretch, to lose its shape. There were some occasional stiller moments; long periods, too, of intense heat and sweat. The orders never stopped coming in. Day and night. With every ping on his phone, and every new order appearing on the pod\u2019s blinking screen, he gave himself over to the ceaseless current of demand, a digitized hunger that could never be satisfied. This new life, he told himself, was the right one for him now. He was his own man, on his own time, able to lose himself in work \u2013 and the pod, hidden from the city, from people, was a place where the rest of the world, and his family, and the past, no longer existed.</p> <p>Late on Sunday night, when he had drained the oil from his fryer and was shaving the black warts of congealed batter from the sides with a metal scraper, he heard Mehmet calling him from inside the storeroom. When he went inside, Mehmet was sitting in the corner on an upturned crate. Two of the others were there: a boy who had worked on Saturday, and the tall man. From an inside pocket of his denim jacket, Mehmet took out a handful of white envelopes, which he placed on top of the giant tub of curry sauce beside him. Both of the others moved forward slightly. \u2018Queue,\u2019 Mehmet said plainly. The tall man automatically moved behind Sean as the boy stepped in front of him. The boy, taking the envelope that Mehmet handed to him, mumbled thank you and left the room.</p> <p>\u201cYou are okay with cash,\u201d Mehmet said, not looking up at Sean for a reply, instead opening one of the envelopes. He pulled out a twenty pound note from the small stash that was there, raising his face now, grinning, at the man behind Sean. \u201cOops.\u201d He slid the note into a different envelope. \u201cMust have counted wrong.\u201d He held out the envelope with the extra twenty towards Sean. A compulsion to not take the envelope, to not leave the man alone in this room with Mehmet, rooted Sean where he was \u2013 Mehmet watching him, interested \u2013 until Sean felt it weaken, and leave him.</p> <p>Mehmet gave a short laugh. \u201cThere will be more next week. Now go on \u2013 fuck off. Same time tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>His legs were no longer his own. They ached all of the time, a discomfort that he became able, for the most part, to ignore. Some nights, when he left the warehouse, he stopped off at the petrol station on the ring road and bought two bags of ice. When he got back to his room he arranged a ragged stretch of tarpaulin, that he had found hanging in a bush, over his mattress and lay down with the bags of ice under his thighs. Whole days passed without sitting down \u2013 apart from on the saddle, or for the short pause between his two jobs when he would set himself up a little distance down the lane from the warehouse to eat his sandwich, in a gap between the bushes, perched on a tyre behind the fencing of a corrugated lock-up unit. At that time of day there was still some activity in the zone: the shapes of men behind the metal-meshed windows of the house clearance depot; vans leaving the security-fenced area. Mainly, though, it was riders. A stream of them, back and forth, each one inside their own cocoon of music and wind, all indifferent to the risk they might be taking, cycling into this industrial wilderness, the threat of violence.</p> <p>A couple of times, he got to the warehouse a few minutes early and joined Zac round the side of the building for a cigarette. Here, during the strange brief intimacy of leaning back together against the old mattress that had been propped on the wall by the smokers, he learned from Zac that the pods had been in operation for almost a year. Zac had been here almost since the beginning, after being tipped off by a friend. \u201cCouldn\u2019t believe it when I first saw. Like finding a drug factory in the middle of a forest.\u201d He told Sean that Unit 3\u2019s owners, men Sean had never seen, used to have two fish and chip shops in the city. \u201cWent bust, didn\u2019t they? Near as, anyway. So they got a unit out here when all the dark kitchen stuff started. All the expensive stuff gets paid for them, energy and rent and whatever, so all they\u2019ve got to pay for is us, fish, and a shit ton of frozen chips. And the commission, obviously, which won\u2019t be cheap \u2013 but as long as the orders are coming in, who\u2019s complaining?\u201d While he was saying this, the tall man became visible through the fencing and scrub, walking down the lane. \u201cThey\u2019ve put me on the roll now, and fair enough \u2013 they\u2019ve got to be careful, right? The only ones not on the roll, except for newbies like you, is the illegals.\u201d He nodded to where the man was going out of sight past the corner of the building. \u201cBut they\u2019ll hardly cost much. Far as anyone else is concerned, they don\u2019t exist. Just ghosts.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Whether the orders were coming in hard or steady, the tall man always seemed to work at the same pace \u2013 his movements rapid and nimble, his station always immaculate. Sean had noticed, too, that he took more care than the others to assemble his meals, positioning the elements precisely \u2013 the fish, the pot of peas or curry sauce, the pointless wedge of lemon \u2013 instead of cramming it all in with a slump of chips like Zac and the other boy did. Most nights, he would be hassled at least once by Mehmet or Dougie: dropping his tongs to the floor; standing behind him to whisper in his ear, or flick it repeatedly. The hat game was clearly a favourite. Balancing as many of the pots on his head as they could, trying to break their record. How easy it was, to do nothing; to let it become normal. But every night, when Sean pedalled away down the lane and through the dark industrial shapes of the buildings, a rekindled feeling of guilt would cling to him, as he replayed each incident, and imagined all the ways that he could have stopped them. Thoughts which, by the time he got back to his bedsit with his party bags of ice, had always taken him back to the dyke.</p> <p>One afternoon, two weeks into the routine of his parallel jobs, Sean\u2019s first collection was a Vietnamese order from Unit 1. When he went into the collection area, where his order was waiting for him on a shelf, he heard a shout coming through the gangway. He moved closer and could see Dougie in Unit 3, holding the tall man from behind, pinning his arms. Mehmet was in front of him, their noses almost touching, speaking into the man\u2019s face while he poked him in the belly. Sean could hear his own breathing while he watched the man start to struggle. Dougie\u2019s face and neck were red with the effort of detaining him, the man bigger, stronger than Dougie \u2013 and, with a cry, he pulled himself free. His fists were for a moment outstretched, either side of Mehmet\u2019s head, and Sean was certain \u2013 the man shouting now in another language \u2013 that he was about to strike him. But Dougie slammed his knee into the man\u2019s back and immediately he went limp, Dougie pinning his arms once more, and together he and Mehmet began dragging him backwards towards the storeroom.</p> <p>Sean cycled away, slowly at first, as if a bolder part of him might yet pull up, and go back. Soon, however, he was speeding faster and faster, the chain grinding beneath him. What, really, could he have done? There were two of them, both stronger than him. He fought back the nagging awareness of what Frank would have thought about it; what Frank, in his shoes, would have done. A sudden crunching sound came from below him, the chain wrenching free of the sprocket. The bike became unsteady, careening, and Sean tilted to one side with the abrupt weight of the bag on his back, until he was able to bring the bike to a halt. He paused briefly to regain his composure. Here in the quiet of the passageway behind the shredding firm, his breath was coming thickly again. He dismounted, and when he bent to attend to the chain a spasm of pain shot through his side. He fell to the ground, the bike landing clumsily on top of his body. There were voices \u2013 darting white faces above him \u2013 and new pain in his right knee, somebody kicking him.</p> <p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sake, take it off him.\u201d</p> <p>He was being pulled backwards across the tarmac \u2013 then forcefully sat upright, his chest echoing with the scrabble of hands that were groping at the bag on his back. Three boys, keyed up, wild. A new terror surged in him, making him attempt to turn his body so that he could see their faces \u2013 but he did not recognise them, he was sure; these were different boys. One of them knelt in front of him and straddled his legs. His face when he leant forward was so close that Sean could see a small rash through the hair above his ear, while he slipped the straps from Sean\u2019s shoulders with a skill and delicacy that was like tenderness, and the others pressed down painfully on his ankles.</p> <p>\u201cGot it. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p> <p>Sean watched them run away down the passageway with the bag. Then he looked at Frank\u2019s bike, still sprawled beside where he sat, too shit to steal. On the ground near him a line of paper scraps followed the contour of the building like a trail of confetti. The boys had stopped running and were opening the bag. The image of the man being dragged into the storeroom flashed in Sean\u2019s mind; the thought seizing him that he had brought this attack on himself.</p> <p>\u201cTaking the piss?\u201d The voice of one of the boys reverberated between the buildings. He threw the bag to the ground and held out the stacked meal boxes towards the others. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking Japanese.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Sean stayed in bed, awake, long into the morning. The pings were starting to come in \u2013 he had turned the app on out of habit \u2013 but he let them sound, even though he knew he was not going to deliver today. There was a pain above his hip, bruises on both of his ankles. He lay on his back, his thoughts hovering over him. Each new ping, interrupting the floating dream of yesterday, prompting him to get up. Frank \u2013 leaning over him, grinning and shaking his head \u2013 badgering him to get his arse out of bed.</p> <p>He got up and walked gingerly to the corner of the room. He was still in his clothes, so he just picked up the hoodie that was on the floor and slowly, carefully, put it on and went out. The rear derailleur mechanism was not right. He had threaded the chain back on yesterday but something was catching more than usual, newly kinked. He would need to get the bike serviced, or finally let it go. When he got to the petrol station, he locked it to the cycle stand by the cash dispenser. An old woman was filling up her little brown car at the pump closest to the shop. She stood in a square of sunshine, gripping the hilt of the fuel nozzle with both hands, her body braced with the physical effort of holding it there. Sean walked towards the entrance, watching her finish filling up, struggling then to pull out the nozzle. He hesitated, unsure whether it would be rude to offer his help, but with a final effort the woman slid it out \u2013 and for a moment she stood there, triumphant, the metal dripping in her hands, like a warrior.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Numbness was beginning to spread through him: the slow drug of ritual moving up his spine, his neck, entering his brain.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sean went inside the shop. He moved straight to the flowers and gave no thought to which of the two varieties he would buy; he had paid and left the shop before the old woman had even reached the sliding doors of the entrance.</p> <p>With the flowers laid across his handlebars, attached by the wristwatch at one end and an elastic band at the other, the petals quivered as he rode. Numbness was beginning to spread through him: the slow drug of ritual moving up his spine, his neck, entering his brain. Only the twinge of his right knee, with every push down on the pedal, cut through. He was close now. The warehouses were spaced further apart here. Between some of them, sunlit clearings of abandoned ground had filled with long grasses, burrows, solitary poppies. Sean cycled on, constantly vigilant, until he came to the dyke.</p> <p>A worm of dirty water trickled below the far bank. The grass of the bank was bathed in sun \u2013 and Sean could already see them all there, laughing, drinking, their feet dangling over the water. He got off the bike and leant it up against the crumbling, graffitied wall that ran along the top of the near side, then walked along the wall to the spot. There was not much there: the remnants of some previous flowers, not his, and their tattered plastic sleeve. The document pouch on its rusty spike in the wall, a blue halo of ink diffused around each of the words on the letter. He slung the old flowers over the wall and put down the new ones. For a moment, he stood there. Then he stepped down the bank and jumped across the dyke, before climbing to the place where the bank creased into a grassy shelf, and he sat down. Behind him, beyond the wall on this side, there was the passing thunder of a train. He took off his shoes and socks and let the brown water swallow his toes, closing his eyes now to the memory of the other group arriving, the four of them stepping through the broken wall. Their catcalls coming across the dyke. Goading \u2013 playful, at first \u2013 but Frank and his friends bristling, a history with these other lads, and the first bit of brick striking the bank close to Frank\u2019s hand, his friends getting to their feet, shouting, leaping the dyke to get to the boys. Sean could feel it strongly now: the intensity of his need for Frank not to join in, to stay there with him. The mangled sound that had left his throat, pleading for Frank to come back.</p> <p>He opened his eyes. A tiny bird was hopping about on the other side. It moved down to the water and took a drink. Sean watched the bird as it hopped back up the bank to the top, where the phantoms of young, male bodies were closing upon each other, straining with intent \u2013 one of the other group, his face dark with blood, being held back by his mate but breaking free and in an instant both groups charging towards each other in a chaos of motion \u2013 arms and fists and shouts and the hand, reaching down, to pick up the chunk of broken brick. Sean not able to see yet, in the speed of it all, whose body it was, dropping to the ground as everybody else scarpered.</p> <p>He kept to the middle of the streets, taking the longer routes around the warehouses instead of cutting through the alleys. But there was nobody about, the air dead except for the muted rumble of traffic girdling the city and the occasional noise of a train distantly behind him. When he turned onto the lane to the pods he slowed down and cycled towards the gap in the thick mess of bushes. He dismounted and walked his bike into the space, to lean against the metal fence that was exposed to the sunshine like a ribcage, and sat down on the tyre, to wait.</p> <p>Every few minutes a rider rushed past on the lane. They did not notice him, in his tucked away position. With each bright flash of colour, Sean had the strange sensation that he was watching himself: collecting, delivering, accelerating always towards the next order, the next order. Here, in this leafy bunker, everything else became heightened. The faraway hydraulic scoop and lift of a machine. The close, low laughter of a man behind the wall of the lock-up unit. As he listened to these things, his hand, as if separate from the goings-on of his brain, went to his pocket. He took out his phone and put his finger to one of the column of notifications, a voicemail \u2013 which, when he opened the list, brought up a uniform queue of attempts to speak to him. He put the phone to his ear and the voice of his mum was at once inside his head, as easy and familiar as if she was calling him in for tea. \u201c...wondering how you\u2019re getting on and if you need anything. We just wanted to let you know as well that we\u2019re going to pay a visit, and we know you might not want to, but if you want to come with us then \u2013\u201d He stopped the message, but before the phone was back in his pocket his mind was already on the dyke. They did not know that he went there; they thought he had severed that from his life, that it was only them who kept the memory of what happened there.</p> <p>Through the fringe of foliage, Sean could see the tall man approaching. It struck Sean for the first time that he travelled in on foot, and he found himself curious about how far the man came in from; the same distance again walking back home into the dark later. Home. The thought of his parents \u2013 then the alien picture of his bedsit came into his head: a place that had become, through the press of time, a kind of home; or, at least, a refuge from it. The man was near enough that Sean could hear his boots on the lane. When he was a few metres away, Sean emerged from his hiding place. The man stopped still, staring at Sean, confused.</p> <p>\u201cGot in a bit early,\u201d Sean said. Then, when the man did not say anything: \u201cI work where you do \u2013 Unit 3\u201d.</p> <p>The man was looking at the tyre, the drift of rubbish against the fence.</p> <p>\u201cShall we walk in?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>The man still said nothing, but waited for Sean to wheel his bike away from the fence, and they set off together towards the warehouse. Sean had not thought about what to say to him.</p> <p>When he did glance across at the man, he saw that he was older than Sean had presumed. There were small lines at the corner of his eye, a slim silver current running through his hair. When they were almost at the warehouse, Sean could see Zac reclining against the mattress, smoking alongside a couple of workers from the other pods. Zac was looking at them coming down the lane and Sean could feel his heart rate increasing, until Zac went out of view as they came to the front of the building. Sean pushed his bike to lock up in the shelter, while the man, without a word, went inside the building.</p>    <p>The orders came in smoothly, a Tuesday night. Neither Mehmet nor Dougie were in and Sean felt himself relax into the flow of work. His hip ached, standing still, but he did not think about the attack, or about his visit to the dyke. At the fryer beside him, Zac was keeping to himself; there was only, every now and again, one of his daydream whispers audible above the fans and the roiling liquid. Further down the line, the tall man was focused as intently as always on his orders. Sean wondered what went through his mind as he worked; whether he was fearful of Mehmet and Dougie returning, or if he imagined, sometimes, what he might do in response to them.</p> <p>At the end of the shift, when they had drained and scraped and paper-towelled the fryers, swept and mopped, refrigerated the unused fish, the man was first to complete his clean-down tasks, and left straight away \u2013 giving, as he walked out, a single nod goodbye to Sean.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The next day, Sean went back to riding. He accepted his first ping at midday \u2013 a large order of deli sandwiches to an assembly of mothers and babies in a park, which filled his bag so tightly that the zip would not properly do up \u2013 and he carried on riding all through the afternoon until he could arrange himself, fifteen minutes before the start of his kitchen shift, in the gap in the bushes. The man did not seem surprised this time. He stopped and waited as before for Sean to get his bike, then they walked off silently down the lane. When they arrived, Sean turned to the man before he went to lock up his bike.</p> <p>\u201cSean.\u201d</p> <p>The man looked at him. \u201cEbdo.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next couple of days, the short walk together became a routine. The same time each evening, the same nod hello and the quiet walk down the lane. On the Sunday evening, however, Ebdo was a few minutes late. An anxious thought quickly took hold of Sean that something had happened, or that he should not be doing this \u2013 until there the man was, walking up to him again, just as normal. Sean realized, wheeling out the bike to move away down the lane together, that his arms and legs were streaming with relief, and he wanted in that moment to know more about Ebdo; to talk to him. He wondered whether Ebdo thought it was strange, this ritual that Sean had begun. It was raining, very lightly \u2013 the mist of it so fine that Sean, still wearing his helmet, had barely noticed \u2013 but Ebdo\u2019s hair was wet through, and Sean realised that he must walk in from some distance away.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do you come in from?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>For a few seconds, Ebdo did not answer. Then, as Sean was thinking that he had not understood, he said, \u201cKurdistan\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Sean said. \u201cLong walk, then.\u201d</p> <p>Sean turned his head, at once worried that he had spoken out of turn, but Ebdo was smiling.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbelieve me.\u201d</p> <p>They were halfway to the warehouse and Sean felt a longing to keep talking like this, for the conversation not to be shut down as soon as they were amongst the others. \u201cYou\u2019re good at the job, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cReally fast.\u201d When Ebdo again did not respond, Sean added, \u201cMuch faster than me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you have two jobs.\u201d He gestured to Sean\u2019s bag.</p> <p>\u201cRight, yeah. Sucker for punishment.\u201d</p> <p>Mehmet was in the entrance, watching them. When they got nearer, Sean could see his eyes moving between them both. \u201cCome on,\u201d he called, clapping his hands twice together as they came past the drums of spent oil. \u201cChoppity fucking chop.\u201d</p> <p>The orders started coming in immediately, before Sean had chance to get his station ready or even bring his oil to temperature. Some national event was happening in the real world, Sean remembered dimly \u2013 a match, or a TV competition \u2013 and a tension was in the air of the pod: Mehmet walking up and down behind their backs, clapping or shouting for them to go faster; the pink streak of Dougie in the gangway going between the pods. At one point, Mehmet leant in to speak a few words out of Sean\u2019s earshot to the weekend boy, who was struggling to keep up at the fryer next to him. The boy nodded and went at his work with still more haste.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It was about three hours into the shift, when the orders were progressively slowing down, that they started. They began in the usual way \u2013 the paper-pot hats \u2013 and Sean detected again the spark of almost-retaliation in Ebdo, but he carried on, transporting his final completed orders to the collection shelves with the pots on his head for all the couriers to see. A fierce heat of shame flared in Sean \u2013 and then anger, that Ebdo let them do this to him. Mehmet was standing against the wall opposite the fryers. In one hand, he held a plastic box of lemon wedges. He picked one out, holding it up level with his eye, like a darts player, then threw it. The wedge landed \u2013 with a spurt of oil \u2013 in Ebdo\u2019s fryer. The next one dropped in just as Ebdo was tonging out the first and his hats at last tumbled from his head. A barrage of Mehmet\u2019s lemons were now flying through the air, hitting the fryer, hitting Ebdo\u2019s back, and a cord of panic twisted in Sean\u2019s spine at the memory of the pieces of brick firing across the dyke. Ebdo carefully removed each foaming wedge from the liquid, like it was just another part of the job. A desperation for Ebdo to defend himself was climbing inside Sean\u2019s chest. Mehmet, though, had become distracted, moving away to show something on his phone to Dougie. Sean slit open a new bag of chips and emptied them into his drawer.</p> <p>There was a lemon wedge on the floor near his feet. He tried to bend to pick it up but suddenly his body would not move. He could see the chunk of brick, still in Frank\u2019s hand. He remembered the brief moment of nothingness afterwards, Frank muttering, \u201cShit, shit, shit\u201d. Then, the boy\u2019s head cradled in his own fingers, and not knowing what to do, and looking up to see everybody else, Frank, running away.</p> <p>By the time the orders stopped coming in, Mehmet was already in the storeroom, on his phone, or preparing the wages. He had not spoken to Sean yet about putting him on the books. When he came out, he had the envelopes in his hand. He went down the line and told each worker apart from Ebdo that they could turn off their fryer and finish cleaning down. A short time later, the weekend boy and Zac had left. Only Sean and Ebdo, Dougie and Mehmet remained. Mehmet held the envelopes up above his head.</p> <p>\u201cCome and get them!\u201d</p> <p>Fleetingly, Sean and Ebdo met each other\u2019s eyes. Sean went forward to where Mehmet, standing behind Ebdo, was already holding out his wage packet. Once he had taken it, Sean did not move. Mehmet\u2019s glare was on him but Sean kept his eyes on the envelope in his hand, and stayed where he was.</p> <p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Mehmet said.</p> <p>Dougie was by the entrance to the storeroom. At the edge of his vision, Sean could see him waving. \u201cBye, bye,\u201d Dougie cooed.</p> <p>Sean did not look at Ebdo as he walked out of the pod. In the collection area, he stopped. A dark rectangle of night was in front of him. Frank\u2019s bike, waiting in the shelter, the ride home \u2013 he could visualise himself moving towards it, as if a different person was now stepping out of his body to get away from here, to be on the road and then alone in his bedsit, clambering stiffly and blissfully onto his bed. But he could sense \u2013 even as he watched the ghost of himself leaving \u2013 his feet still planted on the floor, and he knew, before he turned to see Mehmet crumpling the banknotes, Dougie laughing, that he would not come back to this place again after tonight.</p> <p>None of them noticed him at first. Ebdo was looking into his fryer. Mehmet had the flat of his hand against Ebdo\u2019s back, coaxing him towards the fryer, and Sean understood. \u201cBetter get it out quick,\u201d Dougie was saying \u2013 and then he turned to see Sean. \u201cFuck you still here for?\u201d His attention, though, went straight back to Mehmet and Ebdo, the spectacle at the fryer. If Mehmet knew that Sean was there, he was ignoring him. He was studying Ebdo, watching closely as he reached for his tongs.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mehmet said quietly. \u201cWith your hands.\u201d</p> <p>Ebdo stared into the fryer, at his money seething in the oil. His expression gave nothing away although Sean, treading closer, could see that Ebdo\u2019s hand, when he raised it to hover above the fryer, was shaking.</p> <p>The pain, for the first second or two, did not register. Then it came \u2013 tearing like a barb of metal up Sean\u2019s wrists and forearm.</p> <p>Mehmet and Dougie stood, powerless, while Ebdo reacted quickly \u2013 lifting Sean\u2019s hand out of the oil and guiding him away to a sink, the yellowed money still gripped in his hand until Ebdo could tease it out and place Sean\u2019s hand and arm under the running water \u2013 holding him there \u2013 a pure, exhilarating pain moving through Sean\u2019s arm and into his shoulder, his chest, until his whole body was alight, a rapture of fire.</p> <p>He did not know how much time had passed when he heard the dim wail of the ambulance coming through the industrial zone. He was sitting outside, on a plastic chair that Ebdo had found in Unit 2; a fire blanket, the only soft thing in the building, gathered around his shoulders. He could piece together only fragments: Mehmet and Dougie running away into the night, the boiled banknotes lying on the floor like damp flowerheads, the shock of new pain when Ebdo had slowly wrapped his hand with cling film. Ebdo, sitting on the ground beside him, had heard the siren too. He started to get to his feet and Sean hurriedly reached his good hand into his jeans pocket for his own wage envelope. Ebdo, standing above Sean now, shook his head, smiling, and Sean let the stillness of the night begin to seep through him \u2013 the glow of the city, and further out, his parents at home; Frank, waiting for their visit \u2013 as he watched the ambulance arrive and Ebdo walking away, his outline gradually disappearing into the soft blue pulse of air.</p> <p>\u2022 Ghost Kitchen appears in the BBC National Short Story Award 2024 anthology (Comma Press, \u00a38.99).</p>",

      "bodyText": "British novelist Ross Raisin has won the 2024 BBC national short story award for Ghost Kitchen, a story narrated by a bicycle courier and inspired by the gig economy. Raisin was announced as the winner of the \u00a315,000 prize, which is run in collaboration with Cambridge University, on Tuesday evening. \u201cI feel very happy,\u201d said Raisin shortly after finding out that he had won. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bit of a struggle for quite a while with wondering whether writing is still a viable thing for me to continue doing as a living. This moment really does give me fuel. Financial fuel, for sure, but more importantly, creative fuel\u201d. Ghost Kitchen follows Sean, a young man who becomes a courier after a tragic family incident. Raisin said he became interested in the growth of ghost kitchens \u2013 food businesses that exclusively serve customers by delivery or pick-up, with no dine-in space \u2013 while writing his last novel, A Hunger, which was published in 2022. Ghost kitchens, or dark kitchens, are \u201cso-called in part because they have no windows, no way for anybody on the outside to see in\u201d; they are \u201coften on the outskirts of urban areas\u201d, \u201cconcealed islands that sometimes create the conditions for darkness to flourish,\u201d said Raisin. He had also been thinking about food delivery models and having some \u201cfascinating conversations\u201d with couriers, which \u201cled naturally to a deeper level of critical and creative thinking about the gig economy\u201d. Some background knowledge for the story came from \u201cyears of working either in kitchens or around kitchens, in hotels and bars and restaurants,\u201d Raisin said. New details came from talking to food service workers. \u201cThe guy ends up working in a fish and chip kitchen, and so I had to understand how deep fat fryers work.\u201d \u201cI had a lovely afternoon going with my daughter to the B&amp;Q car park on the Hull Road in York, which has a chip van in it\u201d serving \u201cthe best chips that I know of in York.\u201d He asked the man running it: \u201cTell me everything about that deep fat fryer \u2013 how it works, and what the temperature should be, and how do you clean it at the end of the night, and what do you do with your spent oil?\u201d Ghost Kitchen was a \u201cstandout story from the beginning,\u201d said novelist and prize judge Jenn Ashworth. \u201cWe loved the delicacy of the prose, the pitch perfect handling of memory and backstory.\u201d Raisin was born in Keighley, Yorkshire, and now lives in York. He has written four novels and is the author of the creative writing guide Read This If You Want to Be a Great Writer, published in 2018. In 2013, he was named on Granta\u2019s once-a-decade Best of young British novelists list. He said that he has begun developing a novel which \u201ctakes the same world and characters and themes\u201d as Ghost Kitchen but explores new topics related to the gig economy and \u201cdifferent kinds of violence \u2013 physical violence, corporate violence \u2013 and also the justice system, the asylum system\u201d. Raisin was shortlisted alongside finance lawyer Manish Chauhan and novelists Will Boast, Vee Walker and Lucy Caldwell, who won the prize in 2021. The shortlisted authors receive \u00a3600 each. Their stories are available to listen to on BBC Sounds and are also featured in an anthology published by Comma Press. Alongside Ashworth on this year\u2019s judging panel were writers Michael Donkor and Xiaolu Guo, BBC Audio\u2019s books editor Di Speirs, and chair of judges, presenter Paddy O\u2019Connell. \u201cI am absolutely delighted that Ross Raisin, a writer whose novels have stopped me in my tracks and made me see afresh, has turned his undoubted talent to the short story, and with similarly powerful effect,\u201d said Speirs. \u201cA brilliantly rendered glimpse into life in the edge-lands, Ghost Kitchen combines the tension of a dark plot with an unexpected and moving exploration of male friendship.\u201d Previous winners of the award include Jonathan Buckley, Sarah Hall and Saba Sams. In 2023, Naomi Wood won the prize for her story Comorbidities, a story about a couple who decide to make a sex tape. Also announced was the winner of the BBC young writer\u2019s award, open to 14- to 18-year-olds, which went to Lulu Frisson, a 17-year-old sixth former from Birmingham. Her story, Special, is about a neurodiverse student who is struggling at school until an empathic teacher encourages her creativity. *** Ghost Kitchen by Ross Raisin Already, he had mastered these streets. He knew the cuts through the alleyways and service areas; where there would be vehicles parked over the cycle lanes; which lights could be run. He had also, finally, mastered the bike \u2013 which had been Frank\u2019s and was, in truth, a piece of shit \u2013 and as he rode now onto Museum Street, past the theatre, the memorial park, the old boy playing his penny whistle outside the library, he knew to downshift softly, before the bike got wind of the climb ahead, letting the gears decide for themselves when to catch. At the crest of the hill \u2013 the momentary view over yellow fields beyond the city \u2013 Sean pushed on, down towards the outskirts. He was two minutes behind. He moved into the middle of the lane and pedalled harder, nervous energy coursing through him, until at the end of the street he was forced to stop. Commuter traffic crawled thickly across the junction in front of him. For a whole minute he waited, watching the slow procession of drivers alone in their cars \u2013 before the release of the light when he could slice through the congestion, out onto the other side of the ring road. The roads were at once quieter here. Sean rode quickly, feeling the new strength in his legs. The dark was coming on but he left his lights in his jacket pocket, not wanting to stop and lose more time attaching them, or to make himself more visible. There was nobody about, though. No figures in the shadows of the buildings, no police, yet he remained watchful, checking around him at every turning, the entrance to every enclosed street. The dyke was close to here. He could turn to look down the passageway where part of it would be visible, but he resisted the impulse. He glanced at the wristwatch on his handlebar. He\u2019d gained almost a minute. Still he kept up his pace, moving deeper into this untouched part of the city where blue, spiked metal fencing ran along the backs of industrial units \u2013 an electrical distributors, a meat wholesaler, a document shredding firm \u2013 and massive tangles of blackthorn and brambles grew undisturbed on the roadside scrubland. When he turned onto the final lane he twisted round to look behind him. Nobody. The roller shutters of the house clearance depot were down and the only sound anywhere was the clicking of the front wheel as he slowed, stealing around the side of the next warehouse building, and dismounted. However long he was made to wait, he was exactly on time. *** The door was open. Sean left the bike and walked up to it. Behind the grilles of the warehouse wall\u2019s two thin, cracked windows, the glass was fogged with condensation. Sean paused briefly, just outside the entrance, then went inside. Syrupy heat immediately enveloped him. He could see all the way down the gangway. A snarled mass of cables, dangling wires, hung down through the cloud above it. Below, the hands and arms of men, silent as ghouls, were moving in the brightly-lit mist of each pod. Even now, a couple of months since he had first come to this place, Sean was amazed by the smell. The smell was wild. Pungent. Weird. On that first night, he had walked down the gangway looking into each pod in turn, mesmerised by the stink and lights, the men with their quick hands, working without speaking inside their small caverns, until a man had appeared and told him to get back to the collection area. An order was on one of the collection shelves, the paper bag stapled and ready. Sean checked the code on his phone against the one on the wall screen. It was his. Outside, a car was pulling up, its engine just perceptible underneath the churning of the ventilation fans. He took off his bag and put the order inside \u2013 stooping to take in the smell of it through the mingled fumes of beefburgers and shawarma and Vietnamese food. He lingered for a few seconds before zipping the bag shut. Fish and chips. A smell that reminded him of childhood, of Frank; reminded him too that he had not eaten before coming out to work. He registered the collection and studied quickly the route that came up on his phone. He was about to set off when a movement in one pod, Unit 3, caught his eye. He stepped to the opening of the gangway, from where he could spy in. A tall, thick-set man, foreign, it seemed to Sean through the mist, stood with his back against one of the line of deep-fat fryers. A shorter man was standing in front of him, their faces close together. The short man laughed, pointing to the floor \u2013 and the tall man, bending down, went out of Sean\u2019s view, then stood up again. He held out a pair of tongs, which the short man took from him. Laughing again, and speaking to somebody out of Sean\u2019s sight, he raised the tongs towards the tall man\u2019s face and arranged the pincers around him, first from cheek to cheek, then from his chin to the top of his forehead, as if measuring his head. Sean could feel a familiar trickle of fear entering his blood. Suddenly, the short man threw the tongs to the floor, again the other man bent to retrieve them. There was a sound behind him \u2013 the man from the car coming into the building. Sean stepped back from the opening, put his bag onto his back, and went outside. He got on the bike and raced into the growing dark \u2013 security lights, mounted beneath the barbed wire coiled along the warehouse roof, firing on him, one by one, like search beams. In the shower, he let out a long moan of exhaustion. He knew that he should massage his legs, or at least stretch them out, but he was too tired to bother. And the aching in his thighs, his calves, felt good, a kind of release; it felt, as the water slid down the expanding muscular shapes of his legs, like somebody else\u2019s body. He towelled himself dry and left the bathroom with the towel wrapped around him, crossing the corridor into his room. For a moment, the incident at the warehouse played again in his mind \u2013 he was too tired, though, to think about that, and it was nothing to do with him. He was doing okay. This was what he needed now. He could do as many, or as few, deliveries as he wanted. There was nobody to tell him otherwise; there was nobody to tell him anything at all. He could go whole days without having to see or speak to anybody, other than a fleeting transaction on a doorstep. He had become invisible. He picked his jeans up from the floor and fished out the night\u2019s surprising, pathetic, tip from his pocket, to put into the Tupperware on his window sill. Then he collapsed, naked and already almost asleep, onto the bed. *** Long brown puddles had begun to form at the road edges. He was mostly able to steer around them, until a cabbie or a van driver, speeding past, pinned him to the kerb. The rain had been coming down heavily all afternoon. His skin burned under his sodden jeans but he did not care \u2013 he barely took any notice of the downpour as he rode and arrived at each office reception, each student house, or waited inside the steaming entrances of chain restaurants. The rain was good. The rain meant more deliveries, higher fees, because most riders turned the work down. Sometimes, when Sean did see another rider gliding by on the opposite side of the road, a necklace of water arcing from their rear wheel, he wondered at the strength of their need to come out into it, to be doing this too. The flat\u2019s button was the first of three grubby, peeling labels on the entry system. Rain drummed on the top of his bag while he waited on the doorstep. He pressed the button again. When it opened, a boy looked at him and laughed. \u201cHey, man \u2013 you look wet.\u201d Sean took the pizzas out of the bag and handed them to him. \u201cThanks.\u201d The boy lifted the stack of boxes up to his face, inspecting for damp. \u201cNice one.\u201d He turned to go back inside \u2013 \u201cSee you later!\u201d \u2013 and closed the door. The good thing about students: there was no awkward moment of pause when they didn\u2019t tip you. For a little while longer, rain tickling the skin of his back, Sean stayed on the doorstep. The boy\u2019s face, laughing. He was at least five years younger than Frank would be now, but something about his eyes, the mischief in them. A new request was pinging on his phone. He shielded the rain from the screen with his hand and saw, below the request, a message notification from earlier: Alright mate, how\u2019s things? None of us have... He swiped to clear it, and pressed on the order request. \u00a35.42. The Harbour Fisheries. Unit 3. He accepted, and got back onto his bike. He crossed over the ring road and into the industrial zone, where the hard metallic sound of rain on the warehouse roofs was all around him. At the top of the passageway to the dyke, he paused, looking down it to the wall above the water. Then he forced himself once again to move, and pressed on. He arrived at the warehouse two minutes late, but the order was not ready. He stepped through the collection area and looked into the pod. Four men were at four fryers, all of them working at speed \u2013 shaking baskets of chips, lifting golden bars of fish from the hot oil \u2013 the backs of their necks slick with sweat. The tall man from last night was putting a completed meal box into a paper bag, then carrying it into the service corridor, vanishing momentarily, before coming back into view behind the shelves of the collection area. When Sean moved forward towards the order, he was already on his way back to the pod. \u201cWant to earn some more?\u2019\u201d A man with a big, moist beard and white, rubber boots had appeared, like a real fisherman, in the gangway entrance. Sean steadied himself, packing the order correctly into his bag. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cTwo of my staff fucked off this week, no warning for me, and tonight is last Friday of the month \u2013 busy, busy \u2013 so if you want that to be your last delivery today, job is yours.\u201d He was watching Sean put the bag over his shoulders. \u201cWe pay better than them.\u201d Sean gazed through the collection shelves to where the tall man had just been. He thought about all the hours he had ridden since signing to the app, to gain tonight\u2019s priority-access shift; a part of him, however, had already decided. \u201cIt will be worth it for you.\u201d The man looked down at the pool of water on the floor around Sean. \u201cAnd it is more dry in here.\u201d *** The rain had eased off by the time he returned. The short man from last night, who, from his clothing, Sean now took to be the site manager, was smoking outside the building. When Sean went inside and looked down the gangway trench into the Unit 3 pod, only the tall man and one other worker were stood at the fryers. The man with the beard was approaching through the service corridor, into the space behind the collection shelves. \u201cGood.\u201d He lifted the metal counter flap to let Sean through. \u201cMehmet,\u201d he said, clapping himself on the chest. \u201cFollow me.\u201d Mehmet led him into a windowless breeze-block room behind the pods. Towers of meal boxes, differently branded for each of the four pods, were lined against one wall. Further down the room, where it ran behind the other pods, Sean could see a large, clear bag full of burger buns, plump and squished like faces against the plastic. Mehmet beckoned him to the far corner, where it was darker, away from the light of the bare bulb above the door. \u201cHere.\u201d Mehmet handed him a navy apron. \u201cI will put you next to Zac. He can show you, but you can start with just chips. Should be easy now. No rain, less orders.\u201d Inside the pod, Mehmet spoke briefly to a young man with short, stiff blond hair, Zac, while Sean waited by the storeroom. The tall man was close to him, at the far end of the line. He was working quickly, extracting fish from the fryer with one hand at the same time as spooning mushy peas into a frilled paper pot with his other. Zac turned to face him. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d He pointed at the fryer next to his own. \u201cMr Chips.\u201d Zac showed him the correct amount of chips to get onto the shovel, how to mount and detach the basket, how to submerge it without splashing oil. \u201cCooked chips go in that tray. Keep them coming for now. I\u2019ll tell you when you can slow down.\u201d \u2018How do I know when they\u2019re cooked?\u2019 \u2018Ever eaten chips before?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Then you\u2019ll know.\u2019 For the next five or ten or twenty minutes he fell into the timeless dulled rhythm of the work, plunging the basket, again and again, watching the bubble and pop of tiny exhalations that rose to the surface of the black pond of fat. A low hum of unbroken labour was all around him: the shuffle of feet, the soft fizz of frying food, the drone of the extraction fan. Zac, he noticed, sometimes spoke quietly to himself while he worked, as if he was inside a dream. Once, a bang and a muffled shout came through the wall from the next pod \u2013 within touching distance, but as separate as another universe. Sean had forgotten to eat again, and his stomach reeled as he processed the baskets and baskets of chips. He saw with alarm that the short man was looking at him from the gangway. Sean focused on another shovel of pale, frozen chips, his skin tightening as he heard the man laugh. But when he peeked up, he realized with relief that the man was in fact looking past him \u2013 to the end of the line where Mehmet was standing directly behind the tall man. One of the frilly paper pots was balanced, upside-down on his head, like a miniature hat. Sean tried to ignore the frightened quickening of his blood when the short man came past behind him. He was laughing again, and when Sean turned to look, Mehmet was positioning another pot behind the first one. The man carried on at his tasks with the pots on his head, like it was a party game, and then Mehmet put down a third to make a line, a mohican of pots down the centre of his skull. \u201cLook, Dougie,\u201d Mehmet said to the short man, who was bent over with laughter, his hands on his knees. \u201cThat\u2019s how big their heads are!\u201d Next to Sean, between him and the tall man, Zac was staring at the fish floating in front of him. Sean plunged another basket, his eyes following the flotsam of lost, blackened chips drifting against the scummy fatline of the metal, not allowing himself to look up again until the basket was done. A pyramid of pots was now stacked on the man\u2019s head. Mehmet stood with his arms folded, admiring his work, Dougie at his side losing his shit as Mehmet stepped forward, puckering his lips, to blow the pots off the man\u2019s head. They fell to the floor \u2013 except for one, which dropped into the boiling liquid of the man\u2019s fryer. For an instant, Sean was sure that he saw anger flicker in the man\u2019s face, and excitement rushed through him in anticipation of the man retaliating. Whatever instinct of reprisal had come into the man, however, he swiftly restrained. Sean watched him \u2013 Zac was openly watching now too \u2013 use his tongs to carefully pluck out the pot, brown and crumpled, from the fryer and put it into the bin by his knees, while Mehmet and Dougie walked away together into the storeroom. By the end of the night, Sean\u2019s clothes had dried to a crust, and the continuous mizzle of oil had caused red patches to bloom up his right forearm. Mehmet came up to him while Zac was demonstrating how to drain and clean down his fryer. He told Sean that he could work the rest of the weekend if he wanted. \u201cThen we see. Maybe you stay longer.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Sean said. When he looked down the line of fryers, the tall man had gone. *** Over the next two days, he fell into a new routine: delivering from late morning through the afternoon; then, after a quick sandwich which he had foiled and tucked into the bottom of his bag, riding to the warehouse to stand at the fryers, into the night. He was upgraded to fish. Zac told him the cooking times for the different ones, which Sean wrote onto the base of one of the meal boxes. The tall man was there, at his usual fryer at the end of the line, on both days. A mute agitation moved through Sean each time Mehmet or Dougie went near him, although nothing happened, that Sean could see. The man simply got on quickly and silently with his work, uninterrupted. As the weekend went on, time continued to stretch, to lose its shape. There were some occasional stiller moments; long periods, too, of intense heat and sweat. The orders never stopped coming in. Day and night. With every ping on his phone, and every new order appearing on the pod\u2019s blinking screen, he gave himself over to the ceaseless current of demand, a digitized hunger that could never be satisfied. This new life, he told himself, was the right one for him now. He was his own man, on his own time, able to lose himself in work \u2013 and the pod, hidden from the city, from people, was a place where the rest of the world, and his family, and the past, no longer existed. Late on Sunday night, when he had drained the oil from his fryer and was shaving the black warts of congealed batter from the sides with a metal scraper, he heard Mehmet calling him from inside the storeroom. When he went inside, Mehmet was sitting in the corner on an upturned crate. Two of the others were there: a boy who had worked on Saturday, and the tall man. From an inside pocket of his denim jacket, Mehmet took out a handful of white envelopes, which he placed on top of the giant tub of curry sauce beside him. Both of the others moved forward slightly. \u2018Queue,\u2019 Mehmet said plainly. The tall man automatically moved behind Sean as the boy stepped in front of him. The boy, taking the envelope that Mehmet handed to him, mumbled thank you and left the room. \u201cYou are okay with cash,\u201d Mehmet said, not looking up at Sean for a reply, instead opening one of the envelopes. He pulled out a twenty pound note from the small stash that was there, raising his face now, grinning, at the man behind Sean. \u201cOops.\u201d He slid the note into a different envelope. \u201cMust have counted wrong.\u201d He held out the envelope with the extra twenty towards Sean. A compulsion to not take the envelope, to not leave the man alone in this room with Mehmet, rooted Sean where he was \u2013 Mehmet watching him, interested \u2013 until Sean felt it weaken, and leave him. Mehmet gave a short laugh. \u201cThere will be more next week. Now go on \u2013 fuck off. Same time tomorrow.\u201d *** His legs were no longer his own. They ached all of the time, a discomfort that he became able, for the most part, to ignore. Some nights, when he left the warehouse, he stopped off at the petrol station on the ring road and bought two bags of ice. When he got back to his room he arranged a ragged stretch of tarpaulin, that he had found hanging in a bush, over his mattress and lay down with the bags of ice under his thighs. Whole days passed without sitting down \u2013 apart from on the saddle, or for the short pause between his two jobs when he would set himself up a little distance down the lane from the warehouse to eat his sandwich, in a gap between the bushes, perched on a tyre behind the fencing of a corrugated lock-up unit. At that time of day there was still some activity in the zone: the shapes of men behind the metal-meshed windows of the house clearance depot; vans leaving the security-fenced area. Mainly, though, it was riders. A stream of them, back and forth, each one inside their own cocoon of music and wind, all indifferent to the risk they might be taking, cycling into this industrial wilderness, the threat of violence. A couple of times, he got to the warehouse a few minutes early and joined Zac round the side of the building for a cigarette. Here, during the strange brief intimacy of leaning back together against the old mattress that had been propped on the wall by the smokers, he learned from Zac that the pods had been in operation for almost a year. Zac had been here almost since the beginning, after being tipped off by a friend. \u201cCouldn\u2019t believe it when I first saw. Like finding a drug factory in the middle of a forest.\u201d He told Sean that Unit 3\u2019s owners, men Sean had never seen, used to have two fish and chip shops in the city. \u201cWent bust, didn\u2019t they? Near as, anyway. So they got a unit out here when all the dark kitchen stuff started. All the expensive stuff gets paid for them, energy and rent and whatever, so all they\u2019ve got to pay for is us, fish, and a shit ton of frozen chips. And the commission, obviously, which won\u2019t be cheap \u2013 but as long as the orders are coming in, who\u2019s complaining?\u201d While he was saying this, the tall man became visible through the fencing and scrub, walking down the lane. \u201cThey\u2019ve put me on the roll now, and fair enough \u2013 they\u2019ve got to be careful, right? The only ones not on the roll, except for newbies like you, is the illegals.\u201d He nodded to where the man was going out of sight past the corner of the building. \u201cBut they\u2019ll hardly cost much. Far as anyone else is concerned, they don\u2019t exist. Just ghosts.\u201d *** Whether the orders were coming in hard or steady, the tall man always seemed to work at the same pace \u2013 his movements rapid and nimble, his station always immaculate. Sean had noticed, too, that he took more care than the others to assemble his meals, positioning the elements precisely \u2013 the fish, the pot of peas or curry sauce, the pointless wedge of lemon \u2013 instead of cramming it all in with a slump of chips like Zac and the other boy did. Most nights, he would be hassled at least once by Mehmet or Dougie: dropping his tongs to the floor; standing behind him to whisper in his ear, or flick it repeatedly. The hat game was clearly a favourite. Balancing as many of the pots on his head as they could, trying to break their record. How easy it was, to do nothing; to let it become normal. But every night, when Sean pedalled away down the lane and through the dark industrial shapes of the buildings, a rekindled feeling of guilt would cling to him, as he replayed each incident, and imagined all the ways that he could have stopped them. Thoughts which, by the time he got back to his bedsit with his party bags of ice, had always taken him back to the dyke. One afternoon, two weeks into the routine of his parallel jobs, Sean\u2019s first collection was a Vietnamese order from Unit 1. When he went into the collection area, where his order was waiting for him on a shelf, he heard a shout coming through the gangway. He moved closer and could see Dougie in Unit 3, holding the tall man from behind, pinning his arms. Mehmet was in front of him, their noses almost touching, speaking into the man\u2019s face while he poked him in the belly. Sean could hear his own breathing while he watched the man start to struggle. Dougie\u2019s face and neck were red with the effort of detaining him, the man bigger, stronger than Dougie \u2013 and, with a cry, he pulled himself free. His fists were for a moment outstretched, either side of Mehmet\u2019s head, and Sean was certain \u2013 the man shouting now in another language \u2013 that he was about to strike him. But Dougie slammed his knee into the man\u2019s back and immediately he went limp, Dougie pinning his arms once more, and together he and Mehmet began dragging him backwards towards the storeroom. Sean cycled away, slowly at first, as if a bolder part of him might yet pull up, and go back. Soon, however, he was speeding faster and faster, the chain grinding beneath him. What, really, could he have done? There were two of them, both stronger than him. He fought back the nagging awareness of what Frank would have thought about it; what Frank, in his shoes, would have done. A sudden crunching sound came from below him, the chain wrenching free of the sprocket. The bike became unsteady, careening, and Sean tilted to one side with the abrupt weight of the bag on his back, until he was able to bring the bike to a halt. He paused briefly to regain his composure. Here in the quiet of the passageway behind the shredding firm, his breath was coming thickly again. He dismounted, and when he bent to attend to the chain a spasm of pain shot through his side. He fell to the ground, the bike landing clumsily on top of his body. There were voices \u2013 darting white faces above him \u2013 and new pain in his right knee, somebody kicking him. \u201cFuck\u2019s sake, take it off him.\u201d He was being pulled backwards across the tarmac \u2013 then forcefully sat upright, his chest echoing with the scrabble of hands that were groping at the bag on his back. Three boys, keyed up, wild. A new terror surged in him, making him attempt to turn his body so that he could see their faces \u2013 but he did not recognise them, he was sure; these were different boys. One of them knelt in front of him and straddled his legs. His face when he leant forward was so close that Sean could see a small rash through the hair above his ear, while he slipped the straps from Sean\u2019s shoulders with a skill and delicacy that was like tenderness, and the others pressed down painfully on his ankles. \u201cGot it. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Sean watched them run away down the passageway with the bag. Then he looked at Frank\u2019s bike, still sprawled beside where he sat, too shit to steal. On the ground near him a line of paper scraps followed the contour of the building like a trail of confetti. The boys had stopped running and were opening the bag. The image of the man being dragged into the storeroom flashed in Sean\u2019s mind; the thought seizing him that he had brought this attack on himself. \u201cTaking the piss?\u201d The voice of one of the boys reverberated between the buildings. He threw the bag to the ground and held out the stacked meal boxes towards the others. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking Japanese.\u201d *** Sean stayed in bed, awake, long into the morning. The pings were starting to come in \u2013 he had turned the app on out of habit \u2013 but he let them sound, even though he knew he was not going to deliver today. There was a pain above his hip, bruises on both of his ankles. He lay on his back, his thoughts hovering over him. Each new ping, interrupting the floating dream of yesterday, prompting him to get up. Frank \u2013 leaning over him, grinning and shaking his head \u2013 badgering him to get his arse out of bed. He got up and walked gingerly to the corner of the room. He was still in his clothes, so he just picked up the hoodie that was on the floor and slowly, carefully, put it on and went out. The rear derailleur mechanism was not right. He had threaded the chain back on yesterday but something was catching more than usual, newly kinked. He would need to get the bike serviced, or finally let it go. When he got to the petrol station, he locked it to the cycle stand by the cash dispenser. An old woman was filling up her little brown car at the pump closest to the shop. She stood in a square of sunshine, gripping the hilt of the fuel nozzle with both hands, her body braced with the physical effort of holding it there. Sean walked towards the entrance, watching her finish filling up, struggling then to pull out the nozzle. He hesitated, unsure whether it would be rude to offer his help, but with a final effort the woman slid it out \u2013 and for a moment she stood there, triumphant, the metal dripping in her hands, like a warrior. Sean went inside the shop. He moved straight to the flowers and gave no thought to which of the two varieties he would buy; he had paid and left the shop before the old woman had even reached the sliding doors of the entrance. With the flowers laid across his handlebars, attached by the wristwatch at one end and an elastic band at the other, the petals quivered as he rode. Numbness was beginning to spread through him: the slow drug of ritual moving up his spine, his neck, entering his brain. Only the twinge of his right knee, with every push down on the pedal, cut through. He was close now. The warehouses were spaced further apart here. Between some of them, sunlit clearings of abandoned ground had filled with long grasses, burrows, solitary poppies. Sean cycled on, constantly vigilant, until he came to the dyke. A worm of dirty water trickled below the far bank. The grass of the bank was bathed in sun \u2013 and Sean could already see them all there, laughing, drinking, their feet dangling over the water. He got off the bike and leant it up against the crumbling, graffitied wall that ran along the top of the near side, then walked along the wall to the spot. There was not much there: the remnants of some previous flowers, not his, and their tattered plastic sleeve. The document pouch on its rusty spike in the wall, a blue halo of ink diffused around each of the words on the letter. He slung the old flowers over the wall and put down the new ones. For a moment, he stood there. Then he stepped down the bank and jumped across the dyke, before climbing to the place where the bank creased into a grassy shelf, and he sat down. Behind him, beyond the wall on this side, there was the passing thunder of a train. He took off his shoes and socks and let the brown water swallow his toes, closing his eyes now to the memory of the other group arriving, the four of them stepping through the broken wall. Their catcalls coming across the dyke. Goading \u2013 playful, at first \u2013 but Frank and his friends bristling, a history with these other lads, and the first bit of brick striking the bank close to Frank\u2019s hand, his friends getting to their feet, shouting, leaping the dyke to get to the boys. Sean could feel it strongly now: the intensity of his need for Frank not to join in, to stay there with him. The mangled sound that had left his throat, pleading for Frank to come back. He opened his eyes. A tiny bird was hopping about on the other side. It moved down to the water and took a drink. Sean watched the bird as it hopped back up the bank to the top, where the phantoms of young, male bodies were closing upon each other, straining with intent \u2013 one of the other group, his face dark with blood, being held back by his mate but breaking free and in an instant both groups charging towards each other in a chaos of motion \u2013 arms and fists and shouts and the hand, reaching down, to pick up the chunk of broken brick. Sean not able to see yet, in the speed of it all, whose body it was, dropping to the ground as everybody else scarpered. He kept to the middle of the streets, taking the longer routes around the warehouses instead of cutting through the alleys. But there was nobody about, the air dead except for the muted rumble of traffic girdling the city and the occasional noise of a train distantly behind him. When he turned onto the lane to the pods he slowed down and cycled towards the gap in the thick mess of bushes. He dismounted and walked his bike into the space, to lean against the metal fence that was exposed to the sunshine like a ribcage, and sat down on the tyre, to wait. Every few minutes a rider rushed past on the lane. They did not notice him, in his tucked away position. With each bright flash of colour, Sean had the strange sensation that he was watching himself: collecting, delivering, accelerating always towards the next order, the next order. Here, in this leafy bunker, everything else became heightened. The faraway hydraulic scoop and lift of a machine. The close, low laughter of a man behind the wall of the lock-up unit. As he listened to these things, his hand, as if separate from the goings-on of his brain, went to his pocket. He took out his phone and put his finger to one of the column of notifications, a voicemail \u2013 which, when he opened the list, brought up a uniform queue of attempts to speak to him. He put the phone to his ear and the voice of his mum was at once inside his head, as easy and familiar as if she was calling him in for tea. \u201c...wondering how you\u2019re getting on and if you need anything. We just wanted to let you know as well that we\u2019re going to pay a visit, and we know you might not want to, but if you want to come with us then \u2013\u201d He stopped the message, but before the phone was back in his pocket his mind was already on the dyke. They did not know that he went there; they thought he had severed that from his life, that it was only them who kept the memory of what happened there. Through the fringe of foliage, Sean could see the tall man approaching. It struck Sean for the first time that he travelled in on foot, and he found himself curious about how far the man came in from; the same distance again walking back home into the dark later. Home. The thought of his parents \u2013 then the alien picture of his bedsit came into his head: a place that had become, through the press of time, a kind of home; or, at least, a refuge from it. The man was near enough that Sean could hear his boots on the lane. When he was a few metres away, Sean emerged from his hiding place. The man stopped still, staring at Sean, confused. \u201cGot in a bit early,\u201d Sean said. Then, when the man did not say anything: \u201cI work where you do \u2013 Unit 3\u201d. The man was looking at the tyre, the drift of rubbish against the fence. \u201cShall we walk in?\u201d Sean asked. The man still said nothing, but waited for Sean to wheel his bike away from the fence, and they set off together towards the warehouse. Sean had not thought about what to say to him. When he did glance across at the man, he saw that he was older than Sean had presumed. There were small lines at the corner of his eye, a slim silver current running through his hair. When they were almost at the warehouse, Sean could see Zac reclining against the mattress, smoking alongside a couple of workers from the other pods. Zac was looking at them coming down the lane and Sean could feel his heart rate increasing, until Zac went out of view as they came to the front of the building. Sean pushed his bike to lock up in the shelter, while the man, without a word, went inside the building. The orders came in smoothly, a Tuesday night. Neither Mehmet nor Dougie were in and Sean felt himself relax into the flow of work. His hip ached, standing still, but he did not think about the attack, or about his visit to the dyke. At the fryer beside him, Zac was keeping to himself; there was only, every now and again, one of his daydream whispers audible above the fans and the roiling liquid. Further down the line, the tall man was focused as intently as always on his orders. Sean wondered what went through his mind as he worked; whether he was fearful of Mehmet and Dougie returning, or if he imagined, sometimes, what he might do in response to them. At the end of the shift, when they had drained and scraped and paper-towelled the fryers, swept and mopped, refrigerated the unused fish, the man was first to complete his clean-down tasks, and left straight away \u2013 giving, as he walked out, a single nod goodbye to Sean. *** The next day, Sean went back to riding. He accepted his first ping at midday \u2013 a large order of deli sandwiches to an assembly of mothers and babies in a park, which filled his bag so tightly that the zip would not properly do up \u2013 and he carried on riding all through the afternoon until he could arrange himself, fifteen minutes before the start of his kitchen shift, in the gap in the bushes. The man did not seem surprised this time. He stopped and waited as before for Sean to get his bike, then they walked off silently down the lane. When they arrived, Sean turned to the man before he went to lock up his bike. \u201cSean.\u201d The man looked at him. \u201cEbdo.\u201d Over the next couple of days, the short walk together became a routine. The same time each evening, the same nod hello and the quiet walk down the lane. On the Sunday evening, however, Ebdo was a few minutes late. An anxious thought quickly took hold of Sean that something had happened, or that he should not be doing this \u2013 until there the man was, walking up to him again, just as normal. Sean realized, wheeling out the bike to move away down the lane together, that his arms and legs were streaming with relief, and he wanted in that moment to know more about Ebdo; to talk to him. He wondered whether Ebdo thought it was strange, this ritual that Sean had begun. It was raining, very lightly \u2013 the mist of it so fine that Sean, still wearing his helmet, had barely noticed \u2013 but Ebdo\u2019s hair was wet through, and Sean realised that he must walk in from some distance away. \u201cWhere do you come in from?\u201d Sean asked. For a few seconds, Ebdo did not answer. Then, as Sean was thinking that he had not understood, he said, \u201cKurdistan\u201d. \u201cOh,\u201d Sean said. \u201cLong walk, then.\u201d Sean turned his head, at once worried that he had spoken out of turn, but Ebdo was smiling. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbelieve me.\u201d They were halfway to the warehouse and Sean felt a longing to keep talking like this, for the conversation not to be shut down as soon as they were amongst the others. \u201cYou\u2019re good at the job, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cReally fast.\u201d When Ebdo again did not respond, Sean added, \u201cMuch faster than me.\u201d \u201cBut you have two jobs.\u201d He gestured to Sean\u2019s bag. \u201cRight, yeah. Sucker for punishment.\u201d Mehmet was in the entrance, watching them. When they got nearer, Sean could see his eyes moving between them both. \u201cCome on,\u201d he called, clapping his hands twice together as they came past the drums of spent oil. \u201cChoppity fucking chop.\u201d The orders started coming in immediately, before Sean had chance to get his station ready or even bring his oil to temperature. Some national event was happening in the real world, Sean remembered dimly \u2013 a match, or a TV competition \u2013 and a tension was in the air of the pod: Mehmet walking up and down behind their backs, clapping or shouting for them to go faster; the pink streak of Dougie in the gangway going between the pods. At one point, Mehmet leant in to speak a few words out of Sean\u2019s earshot to the weekend boy, who was struggling to keep up at the fryer next to him. The boy nodded and went at his work with still more haste. *** It was about three hours into the shift, when the orders were progressively slowing down, that they started. They began in the usual way \u2013 the paper-pot hats \u2013 and Sean detected again the spark of almost-retaliation in Ebdo, but he carried on, transporting his final completed orders to the collection shelves with the pots on his head for all the couriers to see. A fierce heat of shame flared in Sean \u2013 and then anger, that Ebdo let them do this to him. Mehmet was standing against the wall opposite the fryers. In one hand, he held a plastic box of lemon wedges. He picked one out, holding it up level with his eye, like a darts player, then threw it. The wedge landed \u2013 with a spurt of oil \u2013 in Ebdo\u2019s fryer. The next one dropped in just as Ebdo was tonging out the first and his hats at last tumbled from his head. A barrage of Mehmet\u2019s lemons were now flying through the air, hitting the fryer, hitting Ebdo\u2019s back, and a cord of panic twisted in Sean\u2019s spine at the memory of the pieces of brick firing across the dyke. Ebdo carefully removed each foaming wedge from the liquid, like it was just another part of the job. A desperation for Ebdo to defend himself was climbing inside Sean\u2019s chest. Mehmet, though, had become distracted, moving away to show something on his phone to Dougie. Sean slit open a new bag of chips and emptied them into his drawer. There was a lemon wedge on the floor near his feet. He tried to bend to pick it up but suddenly his body would not move. He could see the chunk of brick, still in Frank\u2019s hand. He remembered the brief moment of nothingness afterwards, Frank muttering, \u201cShit, shit, shit\u201d. Then, the boy\u2019s head cradled in his own fingers, and not knowing what to do, and looking up to see everybody else, Frank, running away. By the time the orders stopped coming in, Mehmet was already in the storeroom, on his phone, or preparing the wages. He had not spoken to Sean yet about putting him on the books. When he came out, he had the envelopes in his hand. He went down the line and told each worker apart from Ebdo that they could turn off their fryer and finish cleaning down. A short time later, the weekend boy and Zac had left. Only Sean and Ebdo, Dougie and Mehmet remained. Mehmet held the envelopes up above his head. \u201cCome and get them!\u201d Fleetingly, Sean and Ebdo met each other\u2019s eyes. Sean went forward to where Mehmet, standing behind Ebdo, was already holding out his wage packet. Once he had taken it, Sean did not move. Mehmet\u2019s glare was on him but Sean kept his eyes on the envelope in his hand, and stayed where he was. \u201cGo home,\u201d Mehmet said. Dougie was by the entrance to the storeroom. At the edge of his vision, Sean could see him waving. \u201cBye, bye,\u201d Dougie cooed. Sean did not look at Ebdo as he walked out of the pod. In the collection area, he stopped. A dark rectangle of night was in front of him. Frank\u2019s bike, waiting in the shelter, the ride home \u2013 he could visualise himself moving towards it, as if a different person was now stepping out of his body to get away from here, to be on the road and then alone in his bedsit, clambering stiffly and blissfully onto his bed. But he could sense \u2013 even as he watched the ghost of himself leaving \u2013 his feet still planted on the floor, and he knew, before he turned to see Mehmet crumpling the banknotes, Dougie laughing, that he would not come back to this place again after tonight. None of them noticed him at first. Ebdo was looking into his fryer. Mehmet had the flat of his hand against Ebdo\u2019s back, coaxing him towards the fryer, and Sean understood. \u201cBetter get it out quick,\u201d Dougie was saying \u2013 and then he turned to see Sean. \u201cFuck you still here for?\u201d His attention, though, went straight back to Mehmet and Ebdo, the spectacle at the fryer. If Mehmet knew that Sean was there, he was ignoring him. He was studying Ebdo, watching closely as he reached for his tongs. \u201cNo,\u201d Mehmet said quietly. \u201cWith your hands.\u201d Ebdo stared into the fryer, at his money seething in the oil. His expression gave nothing away although Sean, treading closer, could see that Ebdo\u2019s hand, when he raised it to hover above the fryer, was shaking. The pain, for the first second or two, did not register. Then it came \u2013 tearing like a barb of metal up Sean\u2019s wrists and forearm. Mehmet and Dougie stood, powerless, while Ebdo reacted quickly \u2013 lifting Sean\u2019s hand out of the oil and guiding him away to a sink, the yellowed money still gripped in his hand until Ebdo could tease it out and place Sean\u2019s hand and arm under the running water \u2013 holding him there \u2013 a pure, exhilarating pain moving through Sean\u2019s arm and into his shoulder, his chest, until his whole body was alight, a rapture of fire. He did not know how much time had passed when he heard the dim wail of the ambulance coming through the industrial zone. He was sitting outside, on a plastic chair that Ebdo had found in Unit 2; a fire blanket, the only soft thing in the building, gathered around his shoulders. He could piece together only fragments: Mehmet and Dougie running away into the night, the boiled banknotes lying on the floor like damp flowerheads, the shock of new pain when Ebdo had slowly wrapped his hand with cling film. Ebdo, sitting on the ground beside him, had heard the siren too. He started to get to his feet and Sean hurriedly reached his good hand into his jeans pocket for his own wage envelope. Ebdo, standing above Sean now, shook his head, smiling, and Sean let the stillness of the night begin to seep through him \u2013 the glow of the city, and further out, his parents at home; Frank, waiting for their visit \u2013 as he watched the ambulance arrive and Ebdo walking away, his outline gradually disappearing into the soft blue pulse of air. \u2022 Ghost Kitchen appears in the BBC National Short Story Award 2024 anthology (Comma Press, \u00a38.99).",

Inflation has cooled across advanced economies in recent months, paving the way for interest rate cuts by policymakers at the world\u2019s top central banks.</p> <p>Yet experts believe financial markets could still avoid panic, citing three key reasons: expectations for the future path of the Middle East conflict, geopolitics, and the increasingly shaky health of the world economy.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite surprising when you see escalations and nothing moves, it\u2019s not generally what you expect from markets,\u201d said Nuwan Goonetilleke, the head of capital markets at the London-listed insurer Phoenix Group. \u201cBut it\u2019s been escalating over the past 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cThe market will continue to watch to see if the conflict draws in other regional powerhouses. Iran is the one that could be potentially dramatic.\u201d</p> <p>First, analysts remain hopeful that the recent escalation can be dialled back.</p> <p>The stakes are high, however.

      "bodyText": "As Israeli troops moved into Lebanon and Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, the risk of a jump in oil prices that could trigger another global inflation shock appeared to be materialising. Oil prices rose by more than 4% to about $75 a barrel on Tuesday. However, experts said investors had remained relatively sanguine against a backdrop of escalating tensions in the Middle East, with oil prices having fallen more than 10% in the past three months and the US stock market remaining close to an all-time high. Western financial capitals could be troubled by an uptick in oil prices, especially ahead of next month\u2019s US presidential election. Inflation has cooled across advanced economies in recent months, paving the way for interest rate cuts by policymakers at the world\u2019s top central banks. Yet experts believe financial markets could still avoid panic, citing three key reasons: expectations for the future path of the Middle East conflict, geopolitics, and the increasingly shaky health of the world economy. \u201cIt\u2019s quite surprising when you see escalations and nothing moves, it\u2019s not generally what you expect from markets,\u201d said Nuwan Goonetilleke, the head of capital markets at the London-listed insurer Phoenix Group. \u201cBut it\u2019s been escalating over the past 12 months. \u201cThe market will continue to watch to see if the conflict draws in other regional powerhouses. Iran is the one that could be potentially dramatic.\u201d First, analysts remain hopeful that the recent escalation can be dialled back. The stakes are high, however. Iran is a major oil producer, supplying about 3m barrels a day \u2013 or about 3% of world output \u2013 despite western sanctions. Tehran has significant influence over the Strait of Hormuz, a key chokepoint for oil and gas tanker shipments handling as many as 20m barrels a day, almost 30% of the world oil trade. Iran also exerts control over the Red Sea through its backing of Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been targeting shipping. Earlier this year, this was among the biggest fears in global financial markets. This is where geopolitics come in. Other major oil and gas exporters \u2013 including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar \u2013 rely heavily on Hormuz, raising the prospect that Iran closing the chokepoint could have wider consequences. Analysts at the consultancy Capital Economics said such a step could drive oil close to $100 a barrel. However, even if Iran restricted shipping, Tehran\u2019s relatively warm relations with Qatar meant its supplies could still be allowed through. \u201cIn any case, given the likelihood of a military response \u2013 probably led by the US \u2013 we doubt that Iran would, in practice, be able to close the strait for long.\u201d After the 2022 Russian energy crisis, many countries moved to diversify energy supplies, including from renewables. Members of Opec+, a wider group of oil-producing nations including Russia, meeting on Wednesday are also expected to stick to plans to raise supply volumes. These include Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest producer, which has reportedly abandoned a $100 price target. Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00f6rnqvist, the chief executive of trading firm Gunvor, said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d supplies would not be impacted, Reuters reported. \u201cWe have a situation around the Red Sea, Yemen, but by and large it\u2019s more like a nuisance, but not really disruptive in any way,\u201d he said. The third factor that could avert a financial market panic is the economy itself. Oil demand has sagged amid a slowdown in global growth \u2013 particularly in China, the world\u2019s largest consumer, where Beijing is battling to revive flagging activity. European industry is also in the doldrums, with surveys on Tuesday showing factory output fell in September at the sharpest rate this year. Demand in China had dipped to \u201ca few hundred thousand barrels a day\u201d from about 1.3m a day in 2023, according to Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. \u201cWe believe these considerations point to a Brent crude price stuck in the $70s for the foreseeable future, with a geopolitical event or a recovering China the possible drivers of any upside surprise,\u201d he said. Two years ago the Russian energy shock came on top of an inflationary burst triggered by the easing of Covid restrictions and involving supply bottlenecks and red-hot demand from consumers eager to spend after lockdown. This time, inflation is cooling and consumer demand is weaker, reflecting the toll on household finances from the recent period of fast-rising prices, and higher borrowing costs used in response to the shock. Oil prices have fallen back from over $90 a barrel in April to about $70 \u2013 reflected in pump prices for motorists \u2013 helping further to ease inflationary pressures, at a time when the big focus in markets is on central banks cutting interest rates to avoid derailing economic growth. However, further escalation in the Middle East could change all this. \u201cWe\u2019re yet to see it, but escalating conflict would have more dramatic impact,\u201d said Goonetilleke.",

It said: \u201cWoking borough council completed a door knock which received no answer. It was at the end of May that New Vision Homes were told she had been found dead.\u201d The statement added that it was \u201cclear she was vulnerable\u201d and that \u201cshe should have been flagged as vulnerable as this would have alerted New Vision Homes and Woking borough council to her vulnerability\u201d. The inquest also heard that numerous attempts had been made by the authorities and energy suppliers to contact Winham before her body was discovered. The council told the inquest that it had changed its policies since taking back control of its housing in 2022. It said: \u201cSince bringing housing function back in-house strict measures have been put in place. Home visits, calls and contacting next of kin to assist the situation. New process ensures injunctions can be sought to gain access to homes.\u201d Winham\u2019s sister Nicky said her family had been unable to maintain contact with her after years of schizophrenia caused her to believe they would harm her. Nicky told the court the family last saw her in person in 2009, and contact over social media stopped in 2014 after she sent them a message on Facebook urging them to keep away. It said: \u201cIt is best to have minimum/no contact,\u201d the court heard. Her sister said: \u201cAs a family we believed that we were doing the right thing by respecting her wishes to have no contact with us. We knew that contact with us exacerbated her mental health difficulties.\u201d She added that the family had tried to visit Laura in January 2021 as her father\u2019s health was deteriorating. After getting no response from her, New Vision Homes told her sister that due to privacy and confidentiality they could not help her. She said when her brother and mother visited her flat and got no reply they decided to look through the letterbox. She said: \u201cThey were shouting her name and looking through the letterbox. My brother saw what he thought was a seriously decomposed body.\u201d She added: \u201cThey called the police and forced entry. Inside they found a mummified and almost skeletal body. Both of them saw this and the shock can never be forgotten.\u201d The inquest continues.",

There is some evidence to support this in a 36-page pamphlet her team released last night, called Conservatism in Crisis. Described as an essay based on a forthcoming book, Your New Rules: Rise of the Bureaucratic Class, it does not seem to be available online, although the foreword, by Badenoch, has been <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2024/09/30/kemi-badenoch-conservatism-is-in-crisis-and-we-need-to-be-serious-about-getting-it-back-on-track/\">published on ConservativeHome</a>. (Who wrote the rest of the pamphlet is not clear.)</p> <p>In her foreword, Badenoch argues that the Tories cannot win power again just by being a Brexit party. She explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the general election result this year was disastrous for us, we need to consider a wider problem.</p> <p>Since 1992, the Conservative party has only won a majority when Brexit was on the ballot paper; in 2015, through a pledge to hold a referendum on the European Union and in 2019, to \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019.</p> <p>By 2029 we will have not won a majority without this issue in nearly four decades.</p> <p>So, when people say we just need to deliver policy X or policy Y, and then everything will be fine again, they are kidding us and themselves. This is not just about politics. It is about a wider economic and cultural malaise that has set in across a complacent west that is living off the inheritance built by previous generations.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, if the party needs a new cause, what should it be? The pamphlet proposes war on the \u201cbureaucratic class\u201d. In a passage explain who these people are, the pamphlet says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bureaucratic class derives much of their income, or more widely, their justification, from government, through state spending but also an ever-growing regulatory state. They are very different from the market class of entrepreneurs and general market focused workers.</p> <p>There is a microeconomic link between the bureaucratic class and the government. The key question in assessing the bureaucratic class is: Does this job primarily relate to providing goods or services in the market or administering rules set by government?</p> <p>Another way to see the difference is the market orientated class gives people what they want and will pay for, and the bureaucratic class gives people what the bureaucratic class thinks they should want and what government can force or require people to have.</p> </blockquote> <p>The pamphlet argues that the emergence of the bureaucratic class is linked to the expansion of HR departments, the growth in regulation in the financial sector and the rise of what it calls \u201csafetyism\u201d.</p> <p>On HR and regulation, it says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On human resources, in 2001, the ONS recorded 119,000 or so people working as personnel managers. By 2023, this had risen to 221,000, an increase of 86%. This happened at a time when productivity rose at historically low levels of 0.8% a year \u2026</p> <p>The ratio of regulators to financial services workers had increased from 1:11,000 in 1980 to 1:300 in 2011 and now stands at roughly 1:75. In a single decade, the proportion of Citigroup\u2019s workforce devoted to compliance and risk went from 4% to 15%.</p> </blockquote> <p>And it describes \u201csafetyism\u201d as an issue in universities. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Safetyism benefits progressive academics, allied student activists, and most of all, the growing army of administrators. In the USA, a staggering 64% of those who work for universities are now not academics or researchers.</p> </blockquote> <p>The pamphlet concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are moving to a new politics. The Conservatives have to realise the bureaucratic class and the new progressive ideology are their opponents. The idea that as Labour fails, then simply because a voter has a comfortable middle-class job, they will return to us is false.</p> <p>There will have to be a new type of politics. To take on the bureaucratic class means to ditch radical environmental politics, unpick identity politics, focus on a strong positive national identity, limit migration, streamline HR, compliance, sustainability, planning, to focus on bringing down the cost of the welfare state and much more.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Peter Walker</strong> has more on the report, including Badenoch\u2019s triangle theory of modern politics, in his story here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/30/right-left-kemi-badenoch-cryptic-tory-pamphlet\">Right is left and left is right: Kemi Badenoch gets cryptic in Tory pamphlet</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-01T09:25:13.181Z\">at 10.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-66fbb8288f082c6bd51550ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-01T08:54:50.528Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In his interview on the Today programme, when asked to explain why he had gone from being an MP who voted against Brexit to one who is now, not just a supporter of Brexit but an advocate of leaving the European convention on human rights, <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong> said his values had not changed, but that his policies views had adapted in response to what he had learned.</p> <p>Jenrick said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My values haven\u2019t changed, but it\u2019s certainly true that over time the things I have seen in the ministerial jobs that I have done have led me to conclusions that the British state isn\u2019t working in the interests of the British people, and in particular my time at the Home Office where I saw that we were not able to secure our borders and to keep the public safe, which to my mind is the most basic duty of our country.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-66fbb69a8f08409702c12e60\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-01T08:49:27.650Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>These are from my colleague <strong>Peter Walker</strong>, who is at a fringe meeting organised by Popular Conservatism (PopCon), the rightwing group set up by Liz Truss supporters.

As Sky reports, it suggests that over the last six weeks Kemi Badenoch\u2019s 18-point lead with Tory members as their favourite for next leader has massively shrunk. Sky\u2019s <strong>Sam Coates</strong> reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tory members opted for Ms Badenoch by 59% to Mr Jenrick\u2019s 41% six weeks ago - an 18-point lead - if the pair were head to head in the final round.</p> <p>Now they would choose Ms Badenoch by 52% to Mr Jenrick\u2019s 48%, only a four-point lead, according to the new Sky News poll of 802 Tory members conducted over nine days to Sunday night.</p> </blockquote> <p>Badenoch is still ahead on this measure. But it seems likely that Badenoch won\u2019t make the final two (that\u2019s why Jenrick is the bookmakers\u2019 favourite, not Badenoch), and if Badenoch is not on the final ballot, the YouGov polling suggests Jenrick would beat any other potential contender.</p> <p>Why do people think Badenoch won\u2019t make the final two, when voting in the last MPs\u2019 ballot was relatively close (Jenrick 33, Badenoch 28, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat both on 21)?</p> <p>First, because when MPs vote again next week, the 16 votes for Mel Stride (eliminated) will be up for grabs, and it is assumed they will go for someone more in the One Nation tradition rather than Badenoch, who is arguably the most rightwing candidate in the race (even though she has not adopted the hardest line on immigration and the ECHR).</p> <p>And, second, it is assumed that Tugendhat (high chance) and Cleverly (low chance) are the candidates most likely to be knocked out in the next vote. That means, because of their politics, it is not thought many of their votes will go to Badenoch when MPs vote for the second time next week, on Thursday, to choose the top two from a list of three.</p> <p>The YouGov polling also suggests that, if Jenrick and Cleverly are the two names on the final ballot (a reasonable assumption, although no one can say for sure), Jenrick has a narrow lead, but not enough to make the result a foregone conclusion. Coates says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The polls show Mr Cleverly trailing Mr Jenrick by just four points in the final round. If they are head to head, Mr Jenrick gets 52% and Mr Cleverly 48%. Against Ms Badenoch, the gap is slightly bigger - eight points - with her on 54% and him on 46%.</p> <p>Mr Tugendhat fares the worst in the final round, according to the polling. He would lose to both Ms Badenoch and Mr Jenrick 58% to 42% - by 16 points.</p> </blockquote> <p>Coates has put all the final round scenarios from the polling on social media.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1841000031450775790\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sky News / YouGov Tory members poll  <br>20-29 Sept  <br><br>Final round scenarios   <br>Jenrick 48 - Badenoch 52 <br>Jenrick 52 - Cleverly 48 <br>Jenrick  58 - Tugendhat 42 <br>Badenoch 54 - Cleverly 46 <br>Badenoch 58 - Tugendhat 42 <br>Cleverly 55 - Tugendhat 45 <a href=\"https://t.co/Ww5MS40bO7\">https://t.co/Ww5MS40bO7</a></p>&mdash; Sam Coates Sky (@SamCoatesSky) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1841000031450775790?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 1, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-66fbae588f0894769732d592\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-01T08:12:10.859Z\">9.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from <strong>Kevin Schofield</strong> from HuffPost UK on Robert Jenrick\u2019s Today programme interview.

In a leadership contest, sometimes the dynamic changes because one candidate has a postive breakthrough moment (like David Cameron did in 2005, when his passionate, no-notes speech to the Tory conference turned him almost overnight into the favourite). But more often the odds shift because someone has messed up. Kemi Badenoch\u2019s campaign faltered this week after her maternity pay gaffe. And now <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, the bookmakers\u2019 favourite, has also made an error serious enough to cost him support.</p> <p>Yesterday he released a video claiming that that UK special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists because of fears that European laws would free any detained assailants. As<strong> Rajeev Syal, Jessica Elgot</strong> and<strong> Dan Sabbagh</strong> report, he has been condemned for saying this by Labour and by figures in the military.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/30/jenrick-faces-scrutiny-over-claim-uk-special-forces-kill-rather-than-capture-terrorists\">Jenrick condemned for claim UK special forces \u2018kill rather than capture terrorists\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now fellow leadership candidates are also piling in, saying that he is wrong and suggesting that his comments are maligning special forces.</p> <p>In an interview on Sky News this morning, <strong>Tom Tugendhat</strong>, a former soldier, was asked if he agreed with Jenrick that the SAS were killing rather than capturing people because of human rights laws. Tugendhat replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, I don\u2019t. I think what he said is wrong, and I\u2019m afraid demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of military operations and the law of armed conflict.</p> <p>I\u2019m extremely concerned that such words should not be seen in any way to encourage people to take any action other than surrender to British forces when asked to do so.</p> <p>I think he\u2019s wrong, and demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>James Cleverly,</strong> the former foreign secretary who has also served in the military, also refused to back Jenrick\u2019s claim. Asked on Sky News if Jenrick was right to say the SAS were acting in this way, Cleverly replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You\u2019re going to have to ask Robert to justify that statement.</p> <p>That\u2019s not something which I have heard, that\u2019s not something which I\u2019m comfortable repeating.</p> <p>As I say, if Robert is able to justify that, I think he should.</p> <p>The British military always abide by international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict.

He would not accept that he was wrong, or that he should have chosen his words more carefully, but when asked repeatedly if he was sure the armed forces were \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists now because of human rights law, he just repeatedly referred to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/09/12/human-rights-laws-protecting-terrorists-ben-wallace/\">a Telegraph interview</a> that <strong>Ben Wallace</strong>, the former defence secretary, gave last year where he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When we have a threat to the UK, this lunacy of being unable to render people across borders or arrest people in countries whose police forces are unacceptable, means that we are more often than not forced into taking lethal action than actually raiding and detaining.</p> </blockquote> <p>I will post more from the Jenrick interview soon.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> The Tory conference opens, with sessions on the main stage covering policing, the future generation and policy.</p> <p><em>2pm:</em> Robert Jenrick takes part in a Q&amp;A on the main stage at conference.</p> <p><em>2pm:</em> Tom Tugendhat takes part in an conversation event at a fringe organised by Onward.

      "bodyText": "Tom Tugendhat, the former UK security minister, has criticised the claim by one of his Conservative leadership rivals that UK special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorism suspects, saying the comment showed a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d of the law of war. Kemi Badenoch has told a fringe meeting that up to 10% of civil servants are \u201cvery, very bad\u201d, jokingly adding that they are \u201cshould be in prison bad\u201d. (See 6.36pm.) Robert Jenrick has almost caught up with Badenoch in terms of popularity with members, a poll suggests. (See 9.37am.) Jenrick has confirmed that he has given his daughter the middle name \u201cThatcher\u201d. During the Q&amp;A at the Spectator Kemi Badenoch was asked if she approved of term limits for civil servants, an idea proposed by Vivek Ramaswamy when he was running to be the Republican candidate for president in the US. Badenoch replied: I don\u2019t want people to get me wrong \u2013 I think that civil servants are like everybody else. They come in to do a job, and I\u2019d say about 10% of them are absolutely magnificent. And the trick to being a good minister is to find the good ones quickly, keep them close and try and get the bad ones out of your department. There\u2019s about 5 to 10% of them who are very, very bad \u2013 you know, should be in prison bad \u2013 leaking official secrets, undermining their ministers, agitating - I have some of it in my department \u2013 usually union led. But most of them actually want to do a good job. And the good ones are very frustrated by the bad ones. The audience laughed when Badenoch used the \u201cshould be in prison bad\u201d line, so she was not being 100% serious at this point. But she may not have been entirely frivolous either, and the comments are likely to reignite her feud with the civil service. As Pippa Crerar reported in a Guardian exclusive in July, Badenoch had a difficult relationship with officials in her department when she was business secretary because some of them thought she was a bully. Pippa wrote: Kemi Badenoch, the frontrunner to be the next Conservative party leader, has been accused of creating an intimidating atmosphere in the government department she used to run, with some colleagues describing it as toxic, the Guardian can reveal. At least three officials found her behaviour so traumatising that they felt they had no other choice but to leave, sources claimed. Q: What is your view on tuition fees? Badenoch says she thinks a lot of students are being \u201csold a pup\u201d. She does not think people should have to have higher debts. There was meant to be a market, she says, with some universities charging less than others. That has not happened. She says this is an issue a policy review would have to look at. Q: So do you oppose Labour\u2019s plan to let tuition fees go up? Badenoch says the system is broken. She would change it. If lots of people are going to university, they should be going into graduate jobs. But lots of them are going into jobs that are not, or did not used to be, graduate jobs. She mentions nurses as an example. They getting a huge amount of debt that they cannot pay off, she says. She says Labour came into office unprepared for government. The Tories have to start doing their thinking now. Badenoch ends the event by praising Nelson, saying she does not think the magazine has ever had a better editor. Q: Should the UK continue to support Ukraine, and allow it to use Storm Shadow missiles to strike Ukraine? Badenoch says she thinks the UK should support Ukraine as much as it can. On the missiles, she says she does not know how much difference that would make. If Ukraine were to lose, that would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the rest of Europe, she says. Badenoch is asked about the news that Iran has fired missiles at Israel. She says 7 October changed everything for her. It was like 9/11. It highlighted that \u201cthe bad guys, as I like to call them\u201d think the west has become less serious. During the cold war, the west was \u201cvery muscular\u201d, she says. She says the government should stop messing around, talking about football regulators and \u201csmoking in gardens\u201d, because issues like this are a \u201cdistraction from the real issues we face\u201d. (That is a jibe at Rishi Sunak\u2019s government as much as Keir Starmer\u2019s. Badenoch voted againt Sunak\u2019s bill to introduce a gradual smoking ban.) Nelson says, if a byelection comes up, Boris Johnson might be a candidate. He takes a straw poll of the audience to see if people favour him coming back. To Nelson\u2019s surprise, the result comes out 3 or 4 to 1 against Johnson returning. Nelson says, when Johnson\u2019s book comes out, he thinks it will read like a manifesto for Johnson\u2019s return. Q: How much freedom should local associations get at byelection, choosing candidates? Badenoch says at byelections associations normally get a choice over candidates. She says selections get stitched up more ahead of general elections. It happened to her, she says. When she was selected as MP for Saffron Walden, before the 2017 election, a No 10 aide (Stephen Parkinson) had been lined up for it. He had been told in advice it was likely to become vacant. She got two days\u2019 notice. Nelson points out that she had already been rejected by one association at that point. He says that Badenoch was put on the list as the London candidate, already rejected by one association, who was expected to be rejected by Saffron Walden, a rural constituency. Badenoch claims we have stopped seeing business as a producing entity. Instead people see it as a random thing that people do that produces tax. She wants to change that, she says. But she says she is not talking about policy now. She explains: We need to end what I call governmentitis, which is this belief that we\u2019re going to be in government very soon. She criticises the national service policy that was announced in the election. It was thrown out without any preparation, she says. I was extremely frustrated because I don\u2019t like policy that just floats without being anchored. You haven\u2019t been talking enough about citizenship, you haven\u2019t been talking enough about patriotism. You haven\u2019t been talking enough about belonging, about community. So just throwing out national service because someone said it in the focus group and it polled well - that it was a policy that nobody really cared about. The national service policy was also criticised in the confernce hall this morning. See 1.01pm. Nelson takes a poll in the room to see which candidates people prefer. Most of the hands that go up are either for Badenoch, or undecided. Very few people say they are backing Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly or Tom Tugendhat. Badenoch says politicians are too afraid of criticism. Sometimes you have to deal with the stuff now. Sometimes you have to walk through the fire to get to the place that you\u2019re going to, and what I see is actually a lot of MPs just being afraid of not being right, being scared of the mob - the online mob \u2026 I\u2019m prepared to have difficult conversations now, and I don\u2019t care what people say. If we as conservatives buckle every time we get criticism, you\u2019re not going to get anything done. Nelson puts it to Badenoch that she likes a fight. Badenoch says she does not choose to have a fight. But if she has to have a fight, she is willing to do that. And she makes sure she wins, she claims. Nelson says Badenoch claims she was misquoted over the maternity pay issue. But she seems to get misquoted a lot, he says. Badenoch claims that is what happens to conservatives. She repeats the point about Margaret Thatcher she made in the conference hall yesterday. And she goes on: Whoever wins this competition is going to get misrepresented or misquoted. It is a conservative thing. But the difference is that if they are misrepresenting our values, when I am leading, I will make sure that I come up and defend us. I\u2019m not going to apologise to the BBC or the Guardian or any of the leftwing media or press. Badenoch says there is also a problem with the goverrnment not doing enough. She says when she was in office people talked about \u201cannounceables\u201d. Those were things that were not real decisions, but just things they could announce. Nelson asks about the essay Badenoch released last night. (See 10.24am.) Badenoch says the average Tory association is full of what she thinks of as the old middle class \u2013 people who produce things. But now the middle class is full of people who work in bureaucracy. She explains: It\u2019s people who rely on government. It\u2019s not just civil service or people who work as equality, diversity and inclusion instructors. It\u2019s also people who need the government in order to make money. That happened to me when I worked in banking, I went into tech, building things, and I had to move into compliance, working out regulations, because that\u2019s where the promotions were. An extreme example of this is a hotelier that I met just after Covid, and I said \u2018My daughter working hotels. This must have been the worst time ever.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Kemi, I\u2019ve never made so much money in my life. My hotel is full of asylum seekers.\u2019 This is not producing. This is people living off government. Fraser Nelson starts by saying it is his last public event as the Spectator editor. He recalls that Badenoch worked as head of digital at the Spectator for a while before she became an MP. Q: Did working for the Spectator shape you? Badenoch says she was \u201calready shaped\u201d. But she took a pay cut to go there. She was in banking before. She took the job because he liked the magazine. It is a luxury product, she says. Asked how she got on with Andrew Neil (the Spectator publisher), she was she found got on with him fine. Kemi Badenoch is about to speak at a fringe meeting organised by the Spectator. She is being interviewed by Fraser Nelson, the outgoing editor. It should be a friendly audience. In Blue Ambition, Lord Ashcroft\u2019s biography of Badenoch, Nelson is quoted as saying that in 2022, when Badenoch first ran for leader, he had to impose a limit on how many positive articles the website could run about her \u2013 because so many of his contributors were huge fans. Nelson is being replaced as Spectator editor by Michael Gove, the former levelling up secretary, who at one point was seen as one of her biggest supporters at the top of government. The room is packed, and people were queuing at least an hour before to get in. During the Q&amp;A on the conference stage earlier, James Cleverly, the former home secretary, claimed \u201cdozens\u201d of asylum seekers would have been sent to Rwanda by now under the Tory deportation scheme if the election had not been held in the summer. Asked if the policy would have worked, he said: I reckon at this point we could have sent dozens of people to Rwanda. It\u2019s not just about the people that you sent to Rwanda, because ideally you don\u2019t want to be receiving people in the UK and sending them to Rwanda, you want people to stop coming to the UK. He compared the plan to the success of the agreement with Albania, which saw illegal arrivals from the country drop by 90%. The deal that we had with Albania \u2026 we didn\u2019t need to send very many Albanians back to Albania before the message cut through \u2018Don\u2019t waste your time and money trying to get to the UK, because all they do is kick you out again\u2019. That\u2019s what would have happened once we got Rwanda up and running. Tom Tugendhat has escalated his criticism of Robert Jenrick over Jenrick\u2019s claim that human rights law means special forces are having to kill terrorists, not capture them (see 8.46am), suggesting his rival knows \u201cnothing about\u201d sensitive military matters. Speaking at a fringe event, Tugendhat said: It is an extremely serious allegation and without very specific examples it would be \u2013 I think \u2013 irresponsible to [say that] \u2026 If you present a legitimate military threat to the United Kingdom, then we have under the laws of armed conflict today a legal ability and in fact a military capability to conduct operations to keep the British people safe. I am afraid that is simply a fact, and if you don\u2019t know it please don\u2019t comment on military matters you know nothing about. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, has said that the Conservative party will be on its way out if it is not recovering by the time of the next election. As Sky News reports, he told the Sky podcast: What we need to understand is what do the public feel about the Conservative party that made them so determined - and they were determined - to have us out. They didn\u2019t just desert us. They deserted us with a very clear agenda. Duncan Smith said the party needed to work out why it lost before it started coming up with new policy. Asked if there was a way back at the next election, he replied: There has to be a way back within one parliament, because if we\u2019re not on our way back within one parliament, we\u2019re on our way out. Q: Would you wear a top saying Hamas are terrorists (as Robert Jenrick did)? Cleverly replies: I think it was Margaret Thatcher who said you don\u2019t need to wear a T-shirt to show what your principles are. Asked if he would support an assisted dying bill, Cleverly says he voted against it last time MPs voted on this (in 2015) because he was worried it would be \u201cthe thin end of the wedge\u201d. He says he would not want older people to feel obliged to commit suicide because they were worried about being a burden. UPDATE: Cleverly said: On assisted dying, if you want to know where I stand now, look at what I did last time we had a vote on this. I voted against assisted dying not because I\u2019m religious, because I\u2019m not, it\u2019s not a religious point of view, but I know that it is the thin end of the wedge. And I know that people have seen loved ones suffer and of course it is natural to want to ease their suffering. But we also know that many particularly older people hate the idea that they are a burden on their family or their society, and I do not want someone killing themselves or being killed because they feel guilty that they are a burden. They are not a burden. They have been a contributor to society through their life. We owe them a debt of gratitude not a poison pill. Cleverly says he is opposed to all-women shortlists. He says using all-women shortlists implies women cannot get selected in competition with men, and he says this suggests it\u2019s a \u201csexist\u201d party. The Conservative party is not, he says. Cleverly says he thinks the date of the end of the leadership contest should be brought forward so the new leader can respond to the budget. He says the budget will be a defining moment for Labour, and the new leader should be opposing it. Q: So, if you make the final two, will you go to Richard Fuller, the party chair, to say the contest should be shortened? Cleverly says it is \u201cwhen\u201d he makes the final two. On the basis of what he has said, if he and Robert Jenrick make the final shortlist, the CCHQ will come under strong pressure to have a rethink. Kemi Badenoch, who is not in favour, would no longer be relevant to the decision. (See 2.44pm.) UPDATE: Cleverly said: I have already said to the party board that I would prefer that we nibble away a couple of days from the leadership [election] \u2026 I want to get at them at the first possible opportunity. This budget will define this Labour party. If we hit them hard, where it hurts, in their economic incompetence that will be a good starting point for the new leader of the party. Cleverly says he is in favour of changing the BBC licence fee. He says the BBC should move to a subscription model. It has \u201ca back catalogue of some of the best television in the world\u201d, he says. UPDATE: Cleverly said: I had a delegation from the BBC come along to me and say, when I was a new MP, and they did the usual thing: \u2018Oh, because of the unique way the BBC is funded ya-ya-ya.\u2019 And I said to them, and I said to them at the time, this was back in 2015, I said \u2018if I were you, at the next renegotiation of the licence fee, I would start your planning to become a subscription service. \u2018You have a back catalogue of some of the best television in the world\u2019. If Disney and Netflix can make money on the subscription model, the BBC should, because the bottom line is, in the era of streaming services, the tax to watch television is an unsustainable business model. And that back catalogue of content that we have already paid for, why don\u2019t we make sure that when China obsesses about Peppa Pig \u2013 apparently Peppa Pig is very popular in China \u2013 and other content, that they pay for it rather than demanding that we pay for it all over again? Cleverly says he won\u2019t rule out accepting gifts as leader of the opposition. I will accept gifts every now and then. He ways the problem with Keir Starmer was not that he accepted gifts, but the hypocrisy. He says: The problem is not the accepting of gifts, particularly if those gifts are properly declared. The problem is the stench of hypocrisy because whilst [Starmer] was accepting those gifts, he was attacking us for what he did. James Cleverly attacks the way David Lammy, the foreign secretary, gave a speech at the UN security council in which he referred to his own slave ancestry when attacking Russia. He says: David Lammy went to the UN security council for a debate about the plight of Ukraine and Ukrainians, who are being brutalized by the Russian oppressors and invaders as we speak. And somehow he made it about him the went on about my ancestors, I get it. He\u2019s very proud of being the first black foreign secretary. Referring to his support for Brexit, James Cleverly recalls writing to David Cameron when he was a new MP saying Cameron was not getting enough out of the EU from his renegotiation. He says: It is now very fashionable for everyone to be a Brexiteer, but I was doing it before it was cool. This is another jibe at Jenrick, who voted remain. Cleverly voted leave. Cleverly says, if members elect him as leader, they will know what they are getting. I do not pretend to be perfect, but with me, you know what you get and what I was, what I am and what I will be is consistent. I don\u2019t chop and change. I don\u2019t U turn. I don\u2019t flip flop. If you like it, vote for me. If you don\u2019t like it, vote for someone else. But the point is, you know where you stand [with me]. This is aimed primarily at Robert Jenrick, who is standing on a rightwing platform that he would never have been associated with two years ago, when Rishi Sunak made him immigration minister in the Home Office supposedly as the mainstream foil to Suella Braverman, the very rightwing home secretary. Polling suggests a final ballot contest between Cleverly and Jenrick would be very close. (See 9.37am.) Asked about the timing of the election, Cleverly implies he did not approve of having it in the summer. But he says, by the time Rishi Sunak told people, he had told the king, and it was too late to change it. Cleverly says at that point he focused on trying to win the election. He also implies some of his rivals were more interested in preparing their leadership bids. At that point, the die was cast. And from that point, you have a choice. Do you do everything in your power to win the general election. That\u2019s what I did. Or do you start perhaps daydreaming about what might be next, doing preparatory work for a leadership bid? Asked if that is what some of his rivals were doing, Cleverly says: \u201cYou will have to ask them.\u201d But, when Jenrick resigned from the Home Office in December last year, colleagues thought that he was preparing for a future leadership run. James Cleverly is up now. Asked why he thinks he is the best candidate, he says: I am the only one who has run a great office of state. In fact, I\u2019m the only one that has run two great offices of state and delivered in both of them. I\u2019m the only one who has been chairman of the Conservative party. I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s been instrumental in winning a general election. I\u2019m the only one who has the experience to deal with people like you, Chopper, the forensic media, and I know that I\u2019m going to be the best advocate for this party, the best spokesman for this party, and the best leader, not only of this party, but of this country. Jenrick says he would keep the two-child benefit cap. Getting rid of it would be expensive, he says. He says the benefits system must be fair. Jenrick defends going running in a top saying \u201cHamas are terrorists\u201d. He complains about Kay Burley from Sky News suggesting he might be inciting people. He says he is not worried about inciting Hamas supporters. They should be arrested, he says. Jenrick said the Tories should be \u201cobsessed\u201d with reforming the NHS. He said: Our party needs to be obsessed with how we can reform the NHS. Don\u2019t treat it like a religion to be worshipped. Treat it like a public service to be reformed. Q: Would you vote for assisted dying? Jenrick says he would allow a free vote, but he thinks he would vote against. He says his grandmother lived with their family. It was a formative experience. He goes on: She had a very long and terminal illness, a very severe form of emphysema, and the last years of her life were extremely difficult and painful, and it was painful for us to watch. Now, we never had a conversation, obviously, about what she might have done if we\u2019d lived in a different society with different laws. I understand where the motivation to change the law comes from, and it is a noble one in that sense. But I am very concerned about the unintended consequences of changing the rule. A few months ago, just before the general election, I went to Canada to meet the Canadian Conservative party who I take great inspiration from. I think, incidentally, they are the model, really, for what we should be doing as a party. But one of the things in conversation they spoke about was the very severe unintended consequences that they have experienced from their own [assisted dying law]. And so I would just urge everyone \u2013 my parliamentary colleagues, Keir Starmer and the Labour party \u2013 to think this through very, very carefully. Jenrick says he does not approve of all-women shortlists for candidates. He says that this system does a disservice to women, because it implies they are not selected on merit. Q: Was there two-tier policing over the summer? Jenrick says the police gave the appearance of two-tier policing, which was worrying. He goes on: I worry that the police, at times, are too concerned about community relations than enforcing the law without fear or favour. And he claims there is two-tier politics. He says some politicians are afraid to discuss Islamist extremism. Q: You said people should be arrested for shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d. Jenrick says context is important. There is nothing wrong with saying that in a peaceful context. But if you shout it in an intimidatory manner, action should be taken, he says. Q: Will you remove VAT on private schools if you become PM? Yes, says Jenrick. He says his parents were from a working class background and he went to a state primary school. When his grandfather died, his grandmother decided to use the money she inherited to pay for him and his sister to go to a private school. He went to Wolverhampton grammar school. It wasn\u2019t Eton, but it was a good school. His Labour opponent described it as the Eton of Wolverhampton, he says. Jenrick says it was a \u201cbad decision\u201d to schedule the end of the Tory leadership contest for after the budget, which means the new leader won\u2019t respond to the budget statement in the Commons. Q: If you make it to the final two, will you go and see Richard Fuller, the party chair, the following morning, and demand that the end of the contest is brought forward. Jenrick says he will \u201c100%\u201d. (One reason why CCHQ has not cut short the contest is because not all candidiates are in favour. Kemi Badenoch is the person who has been most critical of the idea of shortening the contest.) Jenrick says there were more people in his sixth form at school than there are Conservative MPs now. So the era of \u201cfive families\u201d must end. They must unite, and be one Conservative team. Hope has now finished his questions. He is now reading out questions from members. Q: How would you be different from previous administrations which have talked right, governed left and been incompetent? Jenrick says he would like to government as a conservative, and be competent. Jenrick defeneded his comment in a video released yesterday about special forces killing rather than capturing terrorists because of human rights law. He said: Our very respected former colleague Ben Wallace, one of the best defence secretaries in modern times, used his first intervention after leaving office to make almost this very point. He said that he would think it was difficult for the UK, our armed forces, to conduct a similar operation to the one that the United States did to kill or capture Osama bin Laden. That\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t want our human rights apparatus to be standing in the way of taking the right operational decisions for our national security and for protecting the lives of the brave men and women who serve in our special forces. This is what Dominic Grieve, a former Tory attorney general, posted on social media this morning explaining why he thought Jenrick was wrong. His next argument is even odder. He claims that UKForces are being obliged to kill rather than detain on combat operations because the ECHR requires prisoners to be released. This is just wrong. The ECHR requires no such thing. Indeed there is a case called Hassan v U.K. at the Court ofHuman Rights that makes clear that the ECHR has to be read alongside the Geneva Conventions and that detention of prisoners taken in combat or suspected of being combatants is allowed. There was a problem in Afghanistan with detention of suspected combatants due to Afghan law, not the ECHR. On immigration, Jenrick said he fought hard while he was in government for a tougher line on immigration. And he said that at one he secured changes by threatening to resign. He said: I think everybody knows I fought pretty darn hard to get the changes. Without lifting the veil entirely on what happened, the reason that we got the changes [to immigration policy] was because I sat in the prime minister\u2019s office late at night and said to him, I\u2019m not going to continue in this government unless we do this, because it felt was so important to me. Hope asks Jenrick about his daughter\u2019s middle name. Jenrick confirms that its \u201cThatcher\u201d \u2013 something that Hope knew already, because Jenrick mentioned it in an interview for Hope\u2019s \u201cChopper\u2019s Political Podcast\u201d. (Chopper is Hope\u2019s nickname.) But the revelation still provokes a gasp of astonishment. Liz Truss called one of her daughter\u2019s Liberty because she (Truss) is a libertarian. Keir Starmer\u2019s parents called him Keir because they admired Keir Hardie, the Labour party founder. But to have Thatcher as a middle name is a bit more extreme. Jenrick says he chose the name because of his admiration for the former PM, and because she died the year his daughter was born. Jenrick has a better joke when asked about his family, and whether they want him to stand. He says his daughter has asked if they will get free Taylor Swift tickets if he wins. Maybe that\u2019s true, and not a joke, but it gets a laugh anyway. Jenrick says he told his daughter free Taylor Swift tickets were only for Labour leaders. To his credit, Hope asks Jenrick if he will refuse to accept freebies if he is elected leader. Jenrick did not seem to see this coming, looks momentarily flummoxed, but quickly concludes there is only one answer he can give, and says he will turn them down. If he does win, it may be an answer he regrets. Robert Jenrick is being interviewed on the main conference stage by Christopher Hope, political editor of GB News. The format is the same as yesterday, when Hope interviewed Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. He will start by putting questions himself for half an hour, and then ask questions submitted by members. After the Q&amp;A with Jenrick, Hope will do the same again with James Cleverly. Jenrick is explaining why he wants to be leader. He starts with a joke about how he said the Tory defeat was the worst since 1832, only to be corrected by Jacob Rees-Mogg who told him it was the worst defeat since 1760. And someone joked Rees-Mogg was probably around then, he says. Jenrick has told this joke at every event where I\u2019ve seen him speak since Sunday, and given that the leadership candidate events are best attractions, most people must have heard it already. But it gets a small laugh anyway. Kemi Badenoch has posted this on social media, quoting an article that Nigel Farage wrote during the 2022 leadership contest in which he praised her stance on immigration. It seems to be a response to the Reform UK leader posting messages on social media at the weekend saying he did not believe a word she said on immigration, or anything. I preferred Nigel\u2019s earlier work. He used to talk about me as the only one with conviction to tackle illegal and legal immigration.. but since seeing me as the next Conservative leader and a threat to winning back Reform voters, he\u2019s stopped doing so. Oh well Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser in No 10 until the two men fell out spectacularly, has posted a message on social media broadly backing what Robet Buckland said about human rights law leading the military to kill terrorist suspects instead of seeking to detail them. Cummings says: I explained this 2 years ago but obv the media ignored. It is NOT that there is \u2018extra-judicial\u2019 killing. It\u2019s that the perversities/absurdities of the HRA combined with Gvt legal advice means that in rooms with no phones and decisions to make, \u2018drone them\u2019 is sometimes seen as \u2018lawful\u2019 but \u2018arrest them\u2019 is seen as impractical/unlawful/shitshow - so \u2018drone them\u2019 happens. This is far from the worst such absurdity forced by the HRA. A worse problem: we do not keep even *convicted* terrorists who MI5 predict will kill again shortly under surveillance because govt \u2018legal advice\u2019 is that this is \u2018unlawful\u2019 because of terrorists\u2019 \u2018right to privacy\u2019 under the ECHR/HRA. I have sat in the bunker under No10 watching this explained by deep state officials after meetings where the abysmal Buckland went to great lengths *not* to let the PM understand what was happening and why... MPs don\u2019t want to know, the old media haven\u2019t reported these issues - just like the classified nuclear budget multi-tens of billions corrupt-incompetent-horrorshow (which also renders all OBR numbers fake)... Robert Buckland was justice secretary when Cummings worked in No 10. Cummings is describing in a more colourful terms the dilemma described by Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, in a Telegraph interview last year. Jenkins was basing his remarks on what Wallace said. Wallace told the Telegraph: When we have a threat to the UK, this lunacy of being unable to render people across borders or arrest people in countries whose police forces are unacceptable, means that we are more often than not forced into taking lethal action than actually raiding and detaining. Grant Shapps, the former defence secretary, has said that he has seen \u201cno evidence at all\u201d to back up Robert Jenrick\u2019s claim that special forces have been \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists because human rights laws would prevent them being detained. He made the comment in an interview with Matt Chorley from Radio 5 Live. \u201cIt\u2019s not true in the terms of special forces. I have seen no evidence of that at all.\u201d Former defence secretary Grant Shapps rejects Jenrick\u2019s claim that that British special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing terrorists\u201d. Shapps was defence secretary for about a year before the general election, having held several other cabinet posts in the past. Bookmakers have cut their odds on James Cleverly to win the Tory leadership, in a sign that events at Tory conference over the past 48 hours may have helped his chances more than anyone else\u2019s. Robert Jenrick remains the favourite. But, according to Oddschecker, a betting website, Cleverly\u2019s odds were cut from 10/1 to 5/1 this morning after he attracted a surge of bets at short notice. Leon Blackman from Oddschecker said: The Conservative party leadership race has been a two-horse contest between Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch, with both swapping positions as favorites since Rishi Sunak\u2019s departure. However, James Cleverly has emerged as a serious contender today, with his odds shortening from 10/1 to 5/1 and his bet share rising from 23% to 39%. Meanwhile, Badenoch\u2019s bet share has sharply declined from 33% to 7% and her odds drifting by the minute. Oddchecker has Jenrick favourite at 4/6, followed by Badenoch at 3/1, Cleverly at 5/1 and Tom Tugendhat at 16/1. That means Jenrick has a 56% implied probability of winning, Badenoch 23%, Cleverly 16% and Tugendhat 6%. Ladbrokes has reported the same trend. Its spokesperson Alex Apati said: James Cleverly has emerged as a genuine contender to replace Rishi Sunak over the last 24 hours or so. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see him leapfrog Badenoch in the betting by the end of the week. In a speech in the conference hall this morning a councillor complained about the national service policy announced in a surprise move at the start of the election campaign. Olly Scargill, a councillor from North Tyneside, said this was a wedge issue that alienated younger voters. He said: I think in the general election some of what we campaigned upon was a wedge issue, wedge issues between young people and older people. Things like national service was probably designed to play off younger people and older people, and when you\u2019ve got a rising age of Conservative voter it is incredibly unsustainable. What we need to do I think is we need to find a way to move the party to become more pro-housebuilding. And delivering more credible options for young people who want to be economically secure, and who are aspirational, that is a Conservative, those people should be voting Conservative, but they\u2019re not. Green party candidates could be more of a threat to the Tories in next year\u2019s council elections than Reform UK, a senior councillor has said. Phil Broadhead, who chairs the Conservative Councillors\u2019 Association, told a fringe meeting that Nigel Farage\u2019s party were a challenge, but that Green candidates had also won in \u201cposh Tory areas\u201d. He said: We have a lot of issues that are kind of cross-party nowadays, you know, environmental issues, for instance. I know that there are some people that are on the kind of opposite side of it. But I can tell you, being out there in communities, travelling around the country as we did for the general election, this is a huge issue and actually politically we\u2019re talking a lot about the threats \u2013 who knows what the threats might be when they manifest themselves in May - of Reform etc. I\u2019m more worried about the Greens actually. In my campaigning at this election, I was going to places as far apart as Bristol and Bury St Edmunds where we have Greens running the council now. And these are areas that \u2013 it\u2019s not because they\u2019re socialists, these are kind of posh Tory areas but people care about these particularly environmental protection issues. So I think we need to occupy that space and regain it. At the same meeting the Essex County Council leader Kevin Bentley said that his party had lost a lot of councillors because of infighting at Westminster and that he did not want to hear any more talk of the \u201cfive families\u201d \u2013 a term used by rebels to refer to the five Tory factions at Wesminster that were coordinating opposition to Rishi Sunak on the Rwanda bill. Bentley said: Whoever the winner is, we all get behind them. None of this five families and all that nonsense. I don\u2019t wanna hear it. All I want to hear about is getting Conservatives into power at the town hall, county hall, parliament or wherever we possibly can, so we all rally around that new leader and no backbiting, no arguments. The More in Common poll also suggests that almost a third of Tory voters think it would be good for Britain if Reform UK were to replace the Conservatives as the main rightwing party. This ought to be encouraging for those Tories who are actively encouraging some sort of pact with Nigel Farage\u2019s party. (See 11.30am.) But Luke Tryl, the UK director for More in Common, points out that his research also shows that, on some issues, Conservative voters and Reform UK voters have very different views. Voters overall narrowly prefer the last Conservative govenment led by Rishi Sunak to the current one led by Keir Starmer, according to polling by the campaign group More in Common being unveiled at a conference fringe meeting today. In a sign of how volatile the electorate are voters are actually slightly more likely to say they preferred the previous Government led by Rishi Sunak than the current Government led by Keir Starmer. Although even more say they don\u2019t know which they prefer. Luke Tryl, More in Common\u2019s UK director, says this is because, even though Reform UK voters did not vote for Sunak at the election, they overwhelmingly think his government was better than Starmer\u2019s. Labour &amp; Conservative voters are more likely to say they prefer the respective Governments of their parties. But Reform voters are more likely to say they preferred the last Conservative Government, Lib Dem voters are more split but lean towards preferring the current Government Tryl also points out this does not mean Reform UK voters are all desperate to vote Tory again. But Reform voters preference for the last Government doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re about to return to the fold Con-Ref switchers are the least likely to say they\u2019ll vote Tory again in this Parliament, only 1 in 10 say they will, compared to 1 in 4 Lib Dem switchers &amp; 1 in 5 Lab switchers Popular Conservatism, or PopCon, has released the results of a survey of party members suggesting more than half of them favour a merger with Reform UK. Some 30% of the respondents said they tended to support the idea, and 23% were strongly in favour. The survey covered 470 members. Annunziata Rees-Mogg, PopCon\u2019s head of communications and a former Brexit party MEP, said: Every Conservative activist and canvasser knows people who had been Tories, but voted Reform UK in July. It is no surprise our panellists understand that the next leader of the party needs to take action to bring many like-minded voters back to the Tories. Almost three-quarters want a relationship with Reform in order to unite the right. Rees-Mogg\u2019s brother Jacob has called for the Tories to form an electoral pact with Reform UK. Popular Conservatism is a rightwing group run by Mark Littlewood, one of Liz Truss\u2019s strongest supporters. Talking about opinion polls, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the rightwing former business secretary, has told the Telegraph he is not in favour of them. He said: The answer I was often given by people in government at the time was that lockdowns were very popular. They were getting 60, 70, 80% popularity ratings in the opinion polls. But you mustn\u2019t believe those opinion polls, they\u2019re basically nonsense. People want to give the worthy answer. You\u2019ve got to recognise that government by focus group, government by opinion poll, doesn\u2019t work. You need to govern by what you believe in ... That\u2019s what Margaret Thatcher did and I think we were much too seduced by government by focus group, government by opinion poll. In party leadership contests sometimes members end up choosing the candidates who is also most popular with the public at large. This is what Labour did in 1994, the Tories in 2005 and Labour in 2020, and generally it turns out to be a sensible move if a party wants to win a general election. But sometimes the person most popular with members is the person least popular with the the public at large. This happened with Labour in 2015, and with the Conservatives in 2022, and the Tories seem to be doing the same thing again. As the latest YouGov polling suggests, Kemi Badenoch is the members\u2019 favourite, and Tom Tugendhat is their last choice. (See 9.37am.) A recent ConservativeHome survey said the same. But polling released by Savanta last night suggests that Tugendhat is the most popular candidate with voters overall. Savanta says: Tom Tugendhat is the most popular Conservative leadership candidate among the wider public (net favourability -4) and 2024 Conservative voters (+32), according to new research from Savanta \u2026 Robert Jenrick (-7) is the second most popular candidate among the public, alongside James Cleverly (-8), the most well-known candidate among public with the lowest proportion of Don\u2019t Know\u2019s (21%). Kemi Badenoch (-11) is the least popular, in research taken before her controversial comments about maternity pay. An Ipsos poll yesterday also had Tugendhat as the candidate with the best net ratings amongst the public at large. Choosing a leader unpopular with the public large isn\u2019t always a disastrous move for a party; in 1975 the Conservatives would not have gone for Margaret Thatcher if YouGov had been around and polling figures had been the main consideration. But, more often than not, it is indicative of a party only loosely tethered to what the country as a whole is thinking. And that is a problem for the Conservative party at the moment, as Polly Toynbee argues in her column today. Earlier I suggested that, even though Robert Jenrick is more hardline on the ECHR, Kemi Badenoch is the most rightwing candidate in the contest. There is some evidence to support this in a 36-page pamphlet her team released last night, called Conservatism in Crisis. Described as an essay based on a forthcoming book, Your New Rules: Rise of the Bureaucratic Class, it does not seem to be available online, although the foreword, by Badenoch, has been published on ConservativeHome. (Who wrote the rest of the pamphlet is not clear.) In her foreword, Badenoch argues that the Tories cannot win power again just by being a Brexit party. She explains: While the general election result this year was disastrous for us, we need to consider a wider problem. Since 1992, the Conservative party has only won a majority when Brexit was on the ballot paper; in 2015, through a pledge to hold a referendum on the European Union and in 2019, to \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019. By 2029 we will have not won a majority without this issue in nearly four decades. So, when people say we just need to deliver policy X or policy Y, and then everything will be fine again, they are kidding us and themselves. This is not just about politics. It is about a wider economic and cultural malaise that has set in across a complacent west that is living off the inheritance built by previous generations. So, if the party needs a new cause, what should it be? The pamphlet proposes war on the \u201cbureaucratic class\u201d. In a passage explain who these people are, the pamphlet says: The bureaucratic class derives much of their income, or more widely, their justification, from government, through state spending but also an ever-growing regulatory state. They are very different from the market class of entrepreneurs and general market focused workers. There is a microeconomic link between the bureaucratic class and the government. The key question in assessing the bureaucratic class is: Does this job primarily relate to providing goods or services in the market or administering rules set by government? Another way to see the difference is the market orientated class gives people what they want and will pay for, and the bureaucratic class gives people what the bureaucratic class thinks they should want and what government can force or require people to have. The pamphlet argues that the emergence of the bureaucratic class is linked to the expansion of HR departments, the growth in regulation in the financial sector and the rise of what it calls \u201csafetyism\u201d. On HR and regulation, it says: On human resources, in 2001, the ONS recorded 119,000 or so people working as personnel managers. By 2023, this had risen to 221,000, an increase of 86%. This happened at a time when productivity rose at historically low levels of 0.8% a year \u2026 The ratio of regulators to financial services workers had increased from 1:11,000 in 1980 to 1:300 in 2011 and now stands at roughly 1:75. In a single decade, the proportion of Citigroup\u2019s workforce devoted to compliance and risk went from 4% to 15%. And it describes \u201csafetyism\u201d as an issue in universities. It says: Safetyism benefits progressive academics, allied student activists, and most of all, the growing army of administrators. In the USA, a staggering 64% of those who work for universities are now not academics or researchers. The pamphlet concludes: We are moving to a new politics. The Conservatives have to realise the bureaucratic class and the new progressive ideology are their opponents. The idea that as Labour fails, then simply because a voter has a comfortable middle-class job, they will return to us is false. There will have to be a new type of politics. To take on the bureaucratic class means to ditch radical environmental politics, unpick identity politics, focus on a strong positive national identity, limit migration, streamline HR, compliance, sustainability, planning, to focus on bringing down the cost of the welfare state and much more. Peter Walker has more on the report, including Badenoch\u2019s triangle theory of modern politics, in his story here. In his interview on the Today programme, when asked to explain why he had gone from being an MP who voted against Brexit to one who is now, not just a supporter of Brexit but an advocate of leaving the European convention on human rights, Robert Jenrick said his values had not changed, but that his policies views had adapted in response to what he had learned. Jenrick said: My values haven\u2019t changed, but it\u2019s certainly true that over time the things I have seen in the ministerial jobs that I have done have led me to conclusions that the British state isn\u2019t working in the interests of the British people, and in particular my time at the Home Office where I saw that we were not able to secure our borders and to keep the public safe, which to my mind is the most basic duty of our country. These are from my colleague Peter Walker, who is at a fringe meeting organised by Popular Conservatism (PopCon), the rightwing group set up by Liz Truss supporters. Peter is not impressed by their strategic acumen. I\u2019m at a Tory fringe event about how to see off Reform, and already we\u2019re hearing that the solution is - yes, for them to be more right wing on issues like migration, crime, tax, culture wars. The event hasn\u2019t actually been organised by the Lib Dem\u2019s, but it might as well be. It\u2019s worth stressing that this event is a particular strand of Tory thought - it\u2019s organised by the Truss-friendly PopCons - but the wider, \u201cIf we\u2019re properly right wing we\u2019ll win again\u201d idea is all over the Tory conference. Another big conference theme, also echoed at this event, is the implicit idea that Labour are doing so badly in government that the Tories basically just need to get their act together and they\u2019ll win in 2029. Who knows, it *could* happen. But it\u2019s not an actual strategy. Another speech, by ex-MP Marco Longhi, says Reform only exists because the Tories have given them the space to do so. That\u2019s very arguably a misunderstanding of how populism works. As the ever-hardening of Brexit showed, there will *always* be room to shout, \u2018Betrayal!\u2019 This fringe event has now been told that the behaviour of Keir Starmer in government is already \u201cmuch worse\u201d than that of Boris Johnson. Hmmmmm. A dose of realism from Marco Longhi - he tells the panel that of the Tories\u2019 121 MPs, only about 20 share the views at this event. However, he then says a new leader might need to remove the whip from a number of more liberal types, as Boris Johnson did over Brexit. While Robert Jenrick is under pressure this morning because of his SAS/ECHR comments, there is good news for him in some YouGov polling for Sky News. As Sky reports, it suggests that over the last six weeks Kemi Badenoch\u2019s 18-point lead with Tory members as their favourite for next leader has massively shrunk. Sky\u2019s Sam Coates reports: Tory members opted for Ms Badenoch by 59% to Mr Jenrick\u2019s 41% six weeks ago - an 18-point lead - if the pair were head to head in the final round. Now they would choose Ms Badenoch by 52% to Mr Jenrick\u2019s 48%, only a four-point lead, according to the new Sky News poll of 802 Tory members conducted over nine days to Sunday night. Badenoch is still ahead on this measure. But it seems likely that Badenoch won\u2019t make the final two (that\u2019s why Jenrick is the bookmakers\u2019 favourite, not Badenoch), and if Badenoch is not on the final ballot, the YouGov polling suggests Jenrick would beat any other potential contender. Why do people think Badenoch won\u2019t make the final two, when voting in the last MPs\u2019 ballot was relatively close (Jenrick 33, Badenoch 28, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat both on 21)? First, because when MPs vote again next week, the 16 votes for Mel Stride (eliminated) will be up for grabs, and it is assumed they will go for someone more in the One Nation tradition rather than Badenoch, who is arguably the most rightwing candidate in the race (even though she has not adopted the hardest line on immigration and the ECHR). And, second, it is assumed that Tugendhat (high chance) and Cleverly (low chance) are the candidates most likely to be knocked out in the next vote. That means, because of their politics, it is not thought many of their votes will go to Badenoch when MPs vote for the second time next week, on Thursday, to choose the top two from a list of three. The YouGov polling also suggests that, if Jenrick and Cleverly are the two names on the final ballot (a reasonable assumption, although no one can say for sure), Jenrick has a narrow lead, but not enough to make the result a foregone conclusion. Coates says: The polls show Mr Cleverly trailing Mr Jenrick by just four points in the final round. If they are head to head, Mr Jenrick gets 52% and Mr Cleverly 48%. Against Ms Badenoch, the gap is slightly bigger - eight points - with her on 54% and him on 46%. Mr Tugendhat fares the worst in the final round, according to the polling. He would lose to both Ms Badenoch and Mr Jenrick 58% to 42% - by 16 points. Coates has put all the final round scenarios from the polling on social media. This is from Kevin Schofield from HuffPost UK on Robert Jenrick\u2019s Today programme interview. (See 9.08am.) Pretty clear, having listened to Robert Jenrick\u2019s interview with @MishalHusain, that he doesn\u2019t have any evidence to back up his claim that the SAS are killing terrorists rather than capturing them because they believe the ECHR will just let them go. And this is from my colleague Ben Quinn. Robert Jenrick almost *more* uncomfortable about being reminded he backed Remain\u2620\ufe0f than the lack of evidence around his claim UK special forces are now killing rather than capturing because of the ECHR#r4today This is what Robert Jenrick told the Today programme this morning when Mishal Husain asked him to defend the line in the video he released yesterday where he said: \u201cOur special forces are killing rather than capturing terrorists because our lawyers tell us that if they\u2019re caught, the European court [of human rights] will set them free.\u201d Husain asked where this was happening. In response, Jenrick said he was just reflecting what Ben Wallace told the Telegraph last year. (See 8.46am.) Jenrick said: The point I was making is one that former defense secretary Ben Wallace has made, which is that our human rights apparatus, including the ECHR [European convention on human rights], is encroaching on the battlefield, and it is impacting the decisions that our generals and military decision makers are taking as to what kind of action is required in these difficult situations. And I think that\u2019s putting an unnecessary and unfair burden upon them when they should be taking the right decisions for our safety as a country. Husain said Jenrick says special forces \u201care killing\u201d not capturing terrorists. She asked again if he thought this was happening now. And, again, Jenrick just referred to what Wallace said. Husain tried again at least a couple more times, but just got the same answer. When she put it to him that he should have chosen his words more carefully, Jenrick said he did not agree. \u201cThe point I was making was absolutely correct,\u201d he said. Husain also pointed out that, although Jenrick was quoting Wallace to defend his point, Wallace in his Telegraph interview explicitly said he was not calling for the UK to leave the ECHR. Good morning. In a leadership contest, sometimes the dynamic changes because one candidate has a postive breakthrough moment (like David Cameron did in 2005, when his passionate, no-notes speech to the Tory conference turned him almost overnight into the favourite). But more often the odds shift because someone has messed up. Kemi Badenoch\u2019s campaign faltered this week after her maternity pay gaffe. And now Robert Jenrick, the bookmakers\u2019 favourite, has also made an error serious enough to cost him support. Yesterday he released a video claiming that that UK special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists because of fears that European laws would free any detained assailants. As Rajeev Syal, Jessica Elgot and Dan Sabbagh report, he has been condemned for saying this by Labour and by figures in the military. Now fellow leadership candidates are also piling in, saying that he is wrong and suggesting that his comments are maligning special forces. In an interview on Sky News this morning, Tom Tugendhat, a former soldier, was asked if he agreed with Jenrick that the SAS were killing rather than capturing people because of human rights laws. Tugendhat replied: No, I don\u2019t. I think what he said is wrong, and I\u2019m afraid demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of military operations and the law of armed conflict. I\u2019m extremely concerned that such words should not be seen in any way to encourage people to take any action other than surrender to British forces when asked to do so. I think he\u2019s wrong, and demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding. And James Cleverly, the former foreign secretary who has also served in the military, also refused to back Jenrick\u2019s claim. Asked on Sky News if Jenrick was right to say the SAS were acting in this way, Cleverly replied: You\u2019re going to have to ask Robert to justify that statement. That\u2019s not something which I have heard, that\u2019s not something which I\u2019m comfortable repeating. As I say, if Robert is able to justify that, I think he should. The British military always abide by international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict. We have the the most professional military in the world are military. Our military do not murder people. Jenrick was on the Today programme this morning where he had a difficult time defending what he said. He would not accept that he was wrong, or that he should have chosen his words more carefully, but when asked repeatedly if he was sure the armed forces were \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists now because of human rights law, he just repeatedly referred to a Telegraph interview that Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, gave last year where he said: When we have a threat to the UK, this lunacy of being unable to render people across borders or arrest people in countries whose police forces are unacceptable, means that we are more often than not forced into taking lethal action than actually raiding and detaining. I will post more from the Jenrick interview soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: The Tory conference opens, with sessions on the main stage covering policing, the future generation and policy. 2pm: Robert Jenrick takes part in a Q&amp;A on the main stage at conference. 2pm: Tom Tugendhat takes part in an conversation event at a fringe organised by Onward. At 3.10pm he will doing the same at a Centre for Policy Studies fringe. 3pm: James Cleverly does his Q&amp;A on the main stage. 5pm: Kemi Badenoch takes part in an in conversation event at a fringe meeting with the outgoing Spectator editor, Fraser Nelson.

I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian). I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct). And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

An ambulance technician, Mark Tilley, came close to tears on Tuesday as he described how the experience still \u201cplayed on his mind\u201d. Ambulance crews had been told they could not put on PPE before arriving at the scene and had to wait to put on plastic Tyvek suits and protective hoods or masks. Tilley told the inquiry that the delays could cost crews vital minutes before they were able to start treatment. \u201cWe could have actually been at the patient\u2019s side a minute, minute and a half quicker in those really most serious cases,\u201d he said. \u201cTurning up at people\u2019s houses where someone was unfortunately dead inside the front window or just on the pathway up to their property \u2026 I would have normally gone over and started bouncing up and down on their chest [to perform CPR], but we went and got our masks and suits on, and all of that \u2013 that plays on my mind all the time.\u201d Tilley, an ambulance technician at South East Coast ambulance service who was giving evidence as a representative of the GMB union, also described how the inadequate PPE made him consider making his own protective equipment. Aprons were so poorly made and in such short supply, he said, that \u201cwe seriously considered using bin bags and literally cutting a hole in them, because that way they wouldn\u2019t blow up in front of your face\u201d when outside. In addition to flimsy aprons, protective gloves were out of date, \u201creally cheap and nasty\u201d, and ripped and tore easily.

Or even that the election actually took place. The same people who haven\u2019t yet been told that Margaret Thatcher is not immortal. There\u2019s a surprising number of them.</p> \n<p>Most, though, are only too happy to embrace the new world order. It\u2019s as if they needed a break from the stress of government. It had all become a bit too serious. Now they are in opposition they are free to say what they actually think. Best of all, the delegates now feel as if they have a sacred purpose. For too long they have been mere irritations. Conference fodder. But now their elected politicians are pretending to like them. To pay attention to them.</p> \n<p>Weirdly, they even think that the whole country is tuned into them. Their wishes and desires. That their role in choosing the next Tory leader is the focus of everyone\u2019s attention.

      "bodyText": "A biopic of the Dutch extreme athlete and wellness guru Wim Hof has been put on hold after allegations of domestic violence against the man who calls himself \u201cthe Iceman\u201d emerged in the Dutch media over the weekend. A report published in de Volkskrant newspaper on Saturday claimed the 65-year-old had subjected his former partner, their son and her two children from a previous marriage to physical and verbal abuse over a period of 13 years. On Tuesday, Hof announced he had filed a complaint for alleged defamation and slander and said: \u201c\u2026 one of the sources had previously filed a false report against Wim Hof\u201d. He also intended to take legal action against de Volkskrant, which he said had provided a \u201cplatform for false accusations without conducting its own investigation\u201d.

The allegations that his father had abused his ex-wife were \u201centirely false\u201d, he said, and \u201cthe allegations of domestic violence, as portrayed, are not only grossly exaggerated but also deeply hurtful\u201d. Enahm added: \u201cWe remain committed to our mission of helping people and also want to clear Wim\u2019s name from these unfounded accusations.\u201d The Volkskrant report said Wim Hof\u2019s former partner had contacted the newspaper after being informed by a British film producer of plans for a film about his life. Starring the Shakespeare in Love actor Joseph Fiennes and scripted by the writer of Philomena, Jeff Pope, the film is previewed on the website of the film sales company Cornerstone Film as the story of \u201ca widower who worked as a postman and struggled to support his four children\u201d, before turning \u201cto the cold and breathing to find peace and strength\u201d. On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the London-based production company Genesius Pictures said: \u201cGenesius Pictures can confirm that due to the severity of the allegations, this production, which was in development only and had not begun filming, is on hold.\u201d Initially known for record-breaking feats, such as swimming under ice, scaling Mount Everest in only a pair of shorts and hiking boots, and running a marathon in the Arctic barefoot, Hof has become an influential wellness guru through a series of motivational books. His \u201cWim Hof method\u201d, which promises to boost the immune system and reduce chronic inflammation through regular cold immersion, has been feted by celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and Jim Carrey. The most recent filings for his company, Hof Holding BV, show revenues of more than \u20ac6m in 2022. The Volkskrant report is based on an interview with Hof\u2019s ex-partner, named only as Caroline, testimony from their son, and responses from Hof and his four oldest children, including Enahm, who told the paper they had never seen him commit acts of violence. It includes claims that Hof was sentenced in 2012 by the Amsterdam magistrates court to community service and a fine for assaulting Caroline\u2019s oldest son, then 18. The Amsterdam court confirmed that Hof went before the magistrates court in 2012 and was given a sentence of 40 hours of community service and fined \u20ac350. Enahm Hof said the domestic violence conviction related to \u201ca single incident involving Caroline\u2019s son, adult at the time, for which Wim Hof expressed regret and offered an apology.

A spokesperson for the board confirmed on Tuesday that its conclusion had been to advise that he should no longer have contact with the boy. The claims of domestic abuse follow allegations that the Wim Hof method does not adequately warn of the risk of drowning from practising breathing exercises, if done in water. He and his business partners insist the method is safe as long as it is practised properly, and that they consistently draw attention to potential risks across their platforms and products.

      "bodyText": "Iran has launched a wave of missiles at Israel hours after White House officials warned Tehran was \u201cimminently\u201d planning to attack. Guardian reporters in Jerusalem witnessed dozens of missiles flying overhead towards Israel\u2019s main coastal cities in a huge attack not long after 7.30pm, with the engines of the rockets clearly visible from below. While some interceptions could be heard over Jerusalem, many of the missiles appeared to continue on towards the coast and central Israel to the sound of distant bombs. On the edge of the Old City many stopped to watch the missiles flying overhead in what appears to have been an unprecedented attack. Barely 10 minutes later a second wave of missiles passed over the city, apparently from a different direction, with the bright flashes of interceptions lighting up the sky as loud booms rang out. Tehran had vowed retaliation against Israel for a series of attacks against Iran and the militias it backs across the Middle East, including Hezbollah. The White House earlier warned it had \u201cindications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack\u201d against Israel. \u201cWe are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack,\u201d a senior official said in a statement, warning that such an action \u201cwill carry severe consequences for Iran\u201d. Iran launched a salvo of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles at Israel in April: 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles. Most were downed by Israel and its allies before they hit their targets. The IDF spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, had said the US had warned Israel about the impending attack and that Israeli forces were at their \u201chighest readiness \u2013 offensive and defensive\u201d. He added: \u201cIranian fire on the state of Israel will have consequences. We have plans and we have capabilities.\u201d The attack will increase concerns that the escalating violence in the region could spiral into a war between Israel and Iran. On Tuesday evening, the US embassy called on all its employees and their families to shelter in place until further notice. \u201cThe US embassy in Jerusalem reminds US citizens of the continued need for caution and increased personal security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire and unmanned aircraft system intrusions, often take place without warning,\u201d the warning read. \u201cThe security environment remains complex and can change quickly depending on the political situation and recent events,\u201d it continued. \u201cIn response to security incidents and without advance notice, the US embassy may further restrict or prohibit US government employees and their family members from travelling to certain areas of Israel (including the Old City of Jerusalem) and the West Bank.\u201d Israel began a ground incursion into southern Lebanon, which it has called Operation Northern Arrow, on Monday evening with a barrage of shelling across the border. The ground incursion marks the first time Israeli troops have launched sustained operations in Lebanon since 2006, when the two countries signed a peace deal that ended a 34-day war between Israel and the Shia militia Hezbollah, which dominates large swaths of southern Lebanon. In the first concrete demands since the military launched its incursion, Israeli officials on Monday ordered the residents of about 30 villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate. An Israeli military spokesperson told people to evacuate to north of the Awali River, nearly 35 miles (55km) from the blue line between the two countries, as the IDF targeted what it called Hezbollah \u201cattack infrastructure\u201d along the UN boundary.

Others stayed, as they didn\u2019t have a place to go or they didn\u2019t have the money to leave,\u201d he said, adding that \u201ceveryone\u201d in the town was scared. As of midday on Tuesday, the scope of the ground operation remained unclear. Airstrikes against targets in Beirut and shelling in southern Lebanon had continued overnight, and Lebanese emergency workers said they had recovered 25 bodies and rescued 13 wounded people since 8pm on Monday. Local people told Reuters that at least 600 had sought refuge in a monastery in the town of Rmeish near the blue line as airstrikes continued. The Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, met UN officials on Tuesday and said it was \u201cone of the most dangerous stages in [Lebanon\u2019s] history\u201d. He claimed that \u201cabout 1 million of our people have been displaced due to the devastating war waged by Israel on Lebanon\u201d. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, called for an immediate ceasefire and warned that \u201cnone of us want to return to the years in which Israel found itself bogged down in a quagmire in southern Lebanon\u201d. \u201cNone of us want to see a regional war,\u201d Lammy said in remarks broadcast on the BBC. \u201cThe price would be huge for the Middle East and it would have a significant effect on the global economy.\u201d At the same time, US officials have voiced cautious support for the operation, with the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, agreeing with the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, \u201con the necessity of dismantling [Hezbollah\u2019s] attack infrastructure along the border\u201d. The Israeli offensive has followed a number of Israeli successes against Hezbollah that appear to have emboldened the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to move against the Iran-backed organisation despite considerable diplomatic efforts to avert an escalation in the war. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed by an Israeli strike on Beirut on Friday, dealing a heavy blow to the militant group and raising fears that conflict could spread across the Middle East. That followed two weeks of strikes that began with the explosion of pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members that killed dozens of people and injured thousands more. Israel has since continued to pound Beirut and has also launched strikes on Yemen and Syria, saying it was launching attacks against Iranian-backed militias across the Middle East.",

Members of the cabinet have been asked to model cuts to their investment plans of up to 10% of their annual capital spending as part of this month\u2019s spending review, government sources said. The demands would mean big projects such as hospital improvements, road building and defence projects being slowed down or stopped altogether as the government looks for ways to repair what they say is a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances. Economists warn that such cuts to capital spending could end up damaging the economy and Britain\u2019s creaking public infrastructure.

      "body": "<p>To drive away from Beirut\u2019s Mediterranean coastline is to climb, up into the rugged, unrelenting ridges of Mount Lebanon. The limestone mountain range that traverses huge lengths of Lebanon lent the country not just its name but beauty, diversity \u2013 and a combustible political culture that risks being inflamed again as Israeli forces invade.</p> \n<p>For centuries before modern Lebanon was established, its mountains were a natural barrier to invading armies. For the region\u2019s religious minorities \u2013 especially Christians and Druze \u2013 they became a sanctuary. Ensconced in remote mountain villages, the kaleidoscope of communities that would eventually form the Lebanese nation developed distinct identities, histories and anxieties over their own survival. Lebanon, wrote one of it great historians, Kamal Salibi, was \u201ca house of many mansions\u201d.</p> \n<p>How to govern such a diverse country \u2013 the constitution recognises and apportions power across 18 official faiths \u2013 is unresolved to this day. With the fall of the Ottomans, power over Lebanon passed to French colonial authorities, who carved out borders and imposed a constitution that blatantly favoured the country\u2019s Maronite Catholics. They were guaranteed the presidency, a Christian majority in parliament and control of the Lebanese army.</p> \n<p>It was unviable from the outset. For years, the country\u2019s fast-growing Sunni and Shia populations agitated for a fairer share of power. Tensions regularly boiled over into street battles in Beirut. The influx of displaced Palestinians after the creation of Israel strained the social fabric even further.</p> \n<p>In 1975, it tore. Over the next 15 years, the Lebanese state dissolved and the country descended into a civil war fought between a bewildering array of militias allied to different political causes and religious creeds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6f3b1dbd-f8a3-40a5-84a4-afce583158c3\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Lebanese civil war, from 1975 until 1990, was a hugely complex conflict that ultimately&nbsp;claimed the lives of at least 100,000 people, pitting Sunnis, Christians, Shia and Druze against each other.</p>\n    <p>The war was further complicated by interventions from Lebanon\u2019s neighbours Israel and Syria, and by the presence of a sizeable Palestinian refugee population which was also targeted, most notoriously during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2004/sep/17/sabrashatilaan\">Sabra and Shatila massacre</a> in 1982.</p>\n    <p>Although some of the politically aligned militias involved were not initially sectarian, as the war developed it became increasingly sectarian in nature.</p>\n    <p>The start of the war is generally dated as 13 April 1975, when Christian militiamen attacked a bus carrying Palestinians to a refugee camp. As clashes&nbsp;between&nbsp;militias from different communities spread, the country\u2019s armed&nbsp;forces&nbsp;and political system split, with Beirut itself dividing along what would be known as the green line between Muslim west Beirut and Christian east Beirut.</p>\n    <p>In a conflict that would be marked by massacres and inter-communal brutality, the first external intervention was by Syria\u2019s armed forces in 1976 to address the imbalance of power. Israel became increasingly involved, launching a full-scale invasion in 1982 (the first Lebanese war) and laying siege to Muslim areas of west Beirut. During this period, Christian militias were permitted entry by Israeli forces into the Palestinian Sabra and Shatila refugee camps where they killed hundreds in revenge for the assassination of the Christian Phalangist leader Bashir Gemayel.</p>\n    <p>The conflict finally ended in 1990 with an agreement on political power-sharing based on representation for the different communities.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>East Beirut, predominantly Christian, was divided from majority-Muslim west Beirut by a \u201cgreen line\u201d that snaked across the centre of the city and was riddled with snipers and armed checkpoints. Depending on the political temperature of the day, or the whims of the young militiamen stationed at them, crossing these borders could be deadly. About 17,000 Lebanese people were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/feb/27/the-desperate-last-ditch-search-for-lebanons-missing-war-victims\">forcibly disappeared</a> during the war, many for belonging to the \u201cwrong\u201d faith and crossing the wrong checkpoint at the wrong time.</p> \n<p>Past Israeli governments have sought to exploit Lebanon\u2019s ruptures. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1982/jun/07/fromthearchive\">Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982</a>, trying to drive out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/terrorism-israel-palestine-lebanon-language-1982\">Palestinian militants using the country as a launching pad</a>, it formed alliances with rightwing Christian militias, who saw the opportunity to reassert their primacy over the country.</p> \n<p>Infamously, in September 1982 the Israeli army fired illumination flares into the sky above two areas of Beirut, Sabra and Shatila, populated by Palestinian families, allowing their Christian collaborators to go house to house <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/30/film.syria\">slaughtering mostly women and children</a>.</p> \n<p>By 1989, Israel had long given up on its Christian allies and all sides of the Lebanese civil war were exhausted. They gave up their arms in exchange for a new political deal that distributed power along more equitable lines. Lebanese people who had spent years confined to particular Beirut neighbourhoods or mountain villages started the process of reweaving a diverse society.</p> \n<p>Just one militia was permitted to keep its weapons: Hezbollah, representing Lebanon\u2019s Shia Muslims, in order to fight a continued Israeli occupation of Lebanon\u2019s south.</p> \n<p>War gave way in the 1990s to rebuilding and a debt-fuelled economic boom, and though Lebanon\u2019s social divisions are thought to have lessened, they remain unhealed, a toxic legacy passed down the generations. Marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody disputes are still decided according to religious, not civil law. Political offices are still decided along sectarian lines. Too often, Lebanese people meeting each other still ask innocuous-sounding questions (What\u2019s your last name?

      "bodyText": "To drive away from Beirut\u2019s Mediterranean coastline is to climb, up into the rugged, unrelenting ridges of Mount Lebanon. The limestone mountain range that traverses huge lengths of Lebanon lent the country not just its name but beauty, diversity \u2013 and a combustible political culture that risks being inflamed again as Israeli forces invade. For centuries before modern Lebanon was established, its mountains were a natural barrier to invading armies. For the region\u2019s religious minorities \u2013 especially Christians and Druze \u2013 they became a sanctuary. Ensconced in remote mountain villages, the kaleidoscope of communities that would eventually form the Lebanese nation developed distinct identities, histories and anxieties over their own survival. Lebanon, wrote one of it great historians, Kamal Salibi, was \u201ca house of many mansions\u201d. How to govern such a diverse country \u2013 the constitution recognises and apportions power across 18 official faiths \u2013 is unresolved to this day. With the fall of the Ottomans, power over Lebanon passed to French colonial authorities, who carved out borders and imposed a constitution that blatantly favoured the country\u2019s Maronite Catholics. They were guaranteed the presidency, a Christian majority in parliament and control of the Lebanese army. It was unviable from the outset. For years, the country\u2019s fast-growing Sunni and Shia populations agitated for a fairer share of power. Tensions regularly boiled over into street battles in Beirut. The influx of displaced Palestinians after the creation of Israel strained the social fabric even further. In 1975, it tore. Over the next 15 years, the Lebanese state dissolved and the country descended into a civil war fought between a bewildering array of militias allied to different political causes and religious creeds. East Beirut, predominantly Christian, was divided from majority-Muslim west Beirut by a \u201cgreen line\u201d that snaked across the centre of the city and was riddled with snipers and armed checkpoints. Depending on the political temperature of the day, or the whims of the young militiamen stationed at them, crossing these borders could be deadly. About 17,000 Lebanese people were forcibly disappeared during the war, many for belonging to the \u201cwrong\u201d faith and crossing the wrong checkpoint at the wrong time. Past Israeli governments have sought to exploit Lebanon\u2019s ruptures. When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, trying to drive out Palestinian militants using the country as a launching pad, it formed alliances with rightwing Christian militias, who saw the opportunity to reassert their primacy over the country. Infamously, in September 1982 the Israeli army fired illumination flares into the sky above two areas of Beirut, Sabra and Shatila, populated by Palestinian families, allowing their Christian collaborators to go house to house slaughtering mostly women and children. By 1989, Israel had long given up on its Christian allies and all sides of the Lebanese civil war were exhausted. They gave up their arms in exchange for a new political deal that distributed power along more equitable lines. Lebanese people who had spent years confined to particular Beirut neighbourhoods or mountain villages started the process of reweaving a diverse society. Just one militia was permitted to keep its weapons: Hezbollah, representing Lebanon\u2019s Shia Muslims, in order to fight a continued Israeli occupation of Lebanon\u2019s south. War gave way in the 1990s to rebuilding and a debt-fuelled economic boom, and though Lebanon\u2019s social divisions are thought to have lessened, they remain unhealed, a toxic legacy passed down the generations. Marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody disputes are still decided according to religious, not civil law. Political offices are still decided along sectarian lines. Too often, Lebanese people meeting each other still ask innocuous-sounding questions (What\u2019s your last name? Where are you from?) that will cast light on their religious affiliation. As another Israeli invasion builds in southern Lebanon, and warplanes bomb primarily Shia areas of Beirut, there are fears these old scars could reopen. At least a million Lebanese people are on the move, many seeking shelter in neighbourhoods and villages largely populated by other sects. Civil society leaders have emphasised that so far Lebanese people have shown each other solidarity. But as the crisis lengthens, the few signs of disharmony \u2013 reports of landlords refusing to house Shia families for fear of becoming targets of Israeli drones, or videos of arguments between displaced Shia and the residents of a predominantly Christian neighbourhood \u2013 threaten to spread. For Hezbollah, it means they must watch their backs even as they fight on the frontline against Israel. For much of the past two decades, the militia group \u2013 the most powerful force in Lebanon \u2013 has shown political savvy, striking an alliance with a powerful Christian party, and working at times with the Sunni party of the former prime minister Rafik Hariri (whom Hezbollah members are accused of having assassinated 19 years ago). \u201cHezbollah has been sensitive to the idea that the Shia community cannot be isolated,\u201d said Michael Young, a senior editor at Carnegie Middle East. But these relationships had grown strained in recent years, he added. When Beirut\u2019s port exploded in 2020, damaging the primarily Christian neighbourhoods surrounding it, Hezbollah blocked any meaningful investigation of the blast. The group\u2019s involvement in the Syrian civil war also alienated many Sunnis. It meant that as tensions with Israel started to soar last October, \u201cthey entered the war without a strong sectarian partner on the other side\u201d, Young said. Over the past days, Hezbollah\u2019s political opponents from across Lebanon\u2019s sectarian spectrum have been muted in their criticism. But many will be considering that Hezbollah may emerge from this war substantially diminished, and if it does, it could provide an opportunity to rebalance power in the country once again. \u201cEveryone must be thinking about \u2013 if Hezbollah is weakened, what are the ways we can not find ourselves in this situation again?\u201d Young said. \u201cThey want to widen their room to manoeuvre.\u201d",

Instead it would be used to boost infrastructure for water, transport and energy systems along with support in housing to alleviate the crisis that has dominated the government\u2019s near five years in office. As the UK and other European economies grapple with financial black holes, Ireland suffers an embarrassment of riches with a record \u20ac25bn surplus, much of it down to the ECJ ruling last month ordering Apple to make good years of unpaid back tax. The windfall is being banked in two tranches \u2013 \u20ac8bn this year and the remaining \u20ac6.1bn next year \u2013 giving the country\u2019s finance department a projected \u20ac105bn in tax revenue for 2024. Even before the Apple judgment last month, the country\u2019s corporate tax take was ahead, with exchequer receipts 28% up year-on-year, according to government figures released before the budget. Combined with the one-off revenue from Apple, the expected corporate tax intake for Ireland is \u20ac38bn, half of which comes from the top 10 companies, including the tech companies Microsoft and Intel, and pharma multinationals, such as Pfizer.

With an election looming, the taoiseach, Simon Harris, said before the budget the government would return some money to voters who had faced a cost of living crisis for years. \u201cI make no apology, none whatsoever, for giving people a little bit of their own money back between now and Christmas, because that\u2019s the buffer we need to provide people to allow the timeline between inflation falling and bills falling.\u201d A general election must be held by March 2025 but most analysts see November as the most likely date, when voters will start to benefit from the latest budget spend. Housing changes included increasing stamp duty, from 10% to 15%, for those bulk-buying houses; a similar increase in tax for homes worth more than \u20ac1.5m and an increase in property tax for those owning vacant homes.

Dale Semper was pulled over in his car by police officers in August 2017 and wrongly accused of involvement in gun crime, something he said had a devastating impact on his job as a bank manager, his finances and his mental health. The force has not admitted liability but said in a statement on Tuesday that \u201csome elements of this case were not handled as well as they could have been\u201d. Semper was handcuffed in front of neighbours while his car and home were searched for firearms. He was later suspended from his \u00a372,000-a-year job at Lloyds Bank. Police also searched the homes of his partner and mother during an investigation that finally ended in 2019.

They have ploughed more than $1tn (\u00a3750bn) into the energy sector since 2010, often buying into old and new fossil fuel projects and, thanks to exemptions from many financial disclosures, operating them outside the public eye, the researchers say. In many cases they are mortgaging workers\u2019 futures by taking the money they have put away for old age and investing it in assets that risk serious damage to the climate, the report claims. \u201cPublic sector workers\u2019 money, through national, state, and retirement pensions, provides much of the capital for private equity firms\u2019 energy investments, but there is limited disclosure to the pension fund managers that the deferred earnings of their beneficiaries have potential climate impacts,\u201d it says. Researchers at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, Global Energy Monitor and Private Equity Stakeholder Project assessed the holdings of 21 private equity firms, overseeing a combined $6tn in assets under management. Together, the analysis found that the 21 firms were funding projects responsible for releasing more than 1.17bn tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) a year. The research, compiled from financial data services, company websites, press releases and news reports, was limited to three categories of investments \u2013 upstream, fossil gas terminals, and coal plants \u2013 and so does not represent firms\u2019 entire emissions footprints from energy investments. They compiled their findings into a scorecard, ranking each firm by its exposure to fossil fuel emissions producing investments, transparency and alignment with the target of limiting the temperature rise to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. EIG ranked last, receiving an F grade. It had 23 fossil fuel companies in its portfolio, the majority in upstream operations, giving it the estimated upstream emissions of more than 255m metric tons of tCO2e a year \u2013 the most of all its peers. The second highest overall emitter was the Carlyle Group, with an estimated 214m tCO2e annually in combined carbon-intensive asset emissions.

      "bodyText": "Several employees at a plastics factory in eastern Tennessee were killed during Hurricane Helene or are missing, amid warnings that the storm\u2019s current death toll of more than 130 is likely to rise substantially as subsiding floodwaters allow rescuers to search through the wreckage. Impact Plastics confirmed there had been fatalities at its plant in Erwin but did not say how many people had been killed. The company said there were missing and deceased employees as well as a contractor. Officials have said at least 130 people across five states in the south-eastern US have been killed as a result of Helene, which thrashed ashore in Florida\u2019s Big Bend region late Thursday. Jacob Ingram, a mold changer at the company, told the Knoxville News Sentinel that as the flooding started, managers instructed employees to move their cars away from the rising water \u2013 but would not let them leave. \u201cThey should\u2019ve evacuated when we got the flash flood warnings, and when they saw the parking lot,\u201d he said to the newspaper. \u201cWhen we moved our cars, we should\u2019ve evacuated then \u2026 we asked them if we should evacuate, and they told us not yet, it wasn\u2019t bad enough. \u201cAnd by the time it was bad enough, it was too late \u2013 unless you had a four-wheel drive.\u201d Ingram told the Knoxville News Sentinel that he and 10 other employees later tried to leave by taking refuge on an open-bed truck. Debris hit the truck, made two people fall into the water and eventually caused the truck to flip. Fernando Ruiz told NBC News he spoke with his mother as she worked while the rain fell.

NBC News reported that several family members of workers had been posting on social media in search of family members and pressing authorities for help. The Tennessee Immigrant &amp; Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC) said in a statement that it had seen people affected struggling to get help from authorities. \u201cTIRRC staff members who deployed to the area witnessed community members struggling to access interpretation services from local and state government agencies, as well as requests by agencies for identification and documentation from immigrant community families that hindered their ability to identify missing loved ones,\u201d the group said in a statement.

A bright red crab sparkles next to slices of seared tuna that glow with almost radioactive intensity, alongside a shimmering slab of intricately marbled wagyu beef. Around the room spreads a gob-smacking buffet of the plumpest grapes, freshest sashimi and silkiest bowls of broth imaginable, as if plucked from a parallel universe where everything looks fresher, brighter and better-tasting than reality.<br><br>The parallel universe in question is the Japanese restaurant window \u2013 a place that has long gleamed with astonishing displays of impossibly realistic replica dishes, or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/03/looks-good-enough-to-eat-inside-the-home-of-japans-fake-food-industry\">shokuhin sanpuru</a></em>, designed to lure customers inside. Honed over the last century, this dazzling art form has now been brought to Britain in the form of a mouthwatering exhibition at the Japan House cultural centre in London, part of a global network led by Japan\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs.</p> <p>Marvels of soft diplomacy in action, every show here seems calibrated to make you want to jump straight on a flight eastwards \u2013 or, in this case, run to the nearest Japanese restaurant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each display looks uncannily exaggerated, with brightness and saturation turned up to the max</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The exhibition programme has so far focused on more conventional notions of regional craft, ranging from the metalwork of <a href=\"https://www.japanhouselondon.uk/whats-on/biology-of-metal-metal-craftsmanship-in-tsubame-sanjo/\">Tsubame-Sanjo</a> to the artefacts of the Indigenous <a href=\"https://www.japanhouselondon.uk/whats-on/ainu-stories-contemporary-lives-by-the-saru-river/\">Ainu</a> people in Hokkaido, but this show tackles a ubiquitous commercial phenomenon head on, with exquisitely appetising results. An exhibition has never made me salivate so much.</p> <p>The curious practice of displaying fake food first <a href=\"https://www.japanhouselondon.uk/read-and-watch/the-hyper-real-artistry-of-japans-food-replicas/\">originated in the 1920s</a>, when department store food halls in Japan\u2019s major cities were beginning to try out western dishes on their curious but cautious customers. You can see why diners might have been apprehensive. A 1950s model of a western-style steak in the exhibition, surrounded by limp boiled vegetables and piped mashed potato, looks distinctly unappetising next to the bright platters of sushi.</p>    <p>But the technique soon spread beyond foreign food, partly as a way of handling crowds \u2013 who could view the model dishes and place their orders before being seated \u2013 but also as a way of managing expectations and showing portion sizes, helping to avoid both food waste and unhappy customers.</p> <p>Across Japan, you can now find replica dishes in all kinds of establishments, from the windows of high-end confectioners to cheap chain restaurants, kissaten tearooms, izakaya grills and ramen bars. Each display looks uncannily exaggerated, like seeing the world on a high definition screen, brightness and saturation turned up to the max.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea isn\u2019t always to make the food look as realistic as possible,\u201d says curator Simon Wright. \u201cBut to evoke people\u2019s haptic memories of the dishes. For example, red bean paste might be made to look grainer than it is in reality, because people remember the grainy texture in their mouths.\u201d The counterfeit craftsperson\u2019s job is to conjure a kind of hyperreality, where everything looks crispier, fresher, and more colourful than its real-world counterpart, creating an intensified, super-glossy state of culinary perfection.</p>    <p>The 200-plus models in the exhibition are all the work of the <a href=\"https://www.iwasaki-bei.com/\">Iwasaki Group</a> , Japan\u2019s largest replica food manufacturer, founded by Takiz\u014d Iwasaki in the 1930s. He had been fascinated by the properties of wax as a child, observing how it created a perfect imprint when it fell on a tatami mat, or how it formed the shape of a flower when dropped into water. Encountering food replicas as an adult, he experimented at home, casting food in agar jelly, then pouring hot wax into the mould. His eureka moment came when he managed to cast an omelette his wife had made. A replica of the legendary \u201ccelebration omelette\u201d is on show in the exhibition, its perfectly wrinkled skin and dollop of ketchup sealed beneath a glossy coat of lacquer.<br><br>You might assume these things are now industrially produced, injection-moulded on a production line, but the process has changed remarkably little since Iwasaki\u2019s kitchen experiments. Durable PVC took over from wax in the 1970s, but the manual process remains the same: each element of a dish is cast in a block of silicone, before PVC is poured into the mould, then each piece individually painted by hand, using air brushes and detailed paintbrushes, with precisely patterned stencils used for things like marbling and veining.</p>    <p>A series of step-by-step models reveals the process in the exhibition, alongside videos from the workshops in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/03/looks-good-enough-to-eat-inside-the-home-of-japans-fake-food-industry\">Guj\u014d Hachiman</a>, Iwasaki\u2019s birthplace, which has since become the country\u2019s capital of fake food. It shows how some elements are still cast in wax, like lettuce, where <a href=\"https://www.japanhouse.jp/en/stories/16-sample.html\">thin sheets of green and white wax are carefully poured out on to water</a>, then rolled and scrunched up into crisply layered balls.<br><br>The skill is breathtaking. A series of models from the company\u2019s annual in-house competition provides a showcase for the craftspeople to flex their model-making muscles and pull out all the stops. One replicates the exact texture of a slice of cheese on toast being pulled apart, one half dangling impossibly in midair, connected with a gooey tangle of melted strings. Another recreates bacon and eggs in a frying pan, complete with crispy white edges and a broken, oozing yolk. A third takes the unreality a step further, with a tableau of a crab drinking a glass of beer, blobs of foam dripping down its thirsty little face.</p>    <p>The show goes beyond history and technique, the main event being a map-shaped constellation of plinths of regional dishes from every one of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures. Behold the fugu of Yamaguchi, delicate slices of translucent pufferfish arranged in the shape of a chrysanthemum flower; or the Jibu-ni of Ishikawa, a dish of duck garnished with gold leaf \u2013 a speciality of this wealthy region, originally reserved for samurai families. Would you brave the zunda-mochi, glutinous rice cakes covered in a vibrant green slop of mashed edamame beans; or the crusty fermented fish of Fukui? The silver-stripe herring sashimi of Kagoshima was apparently the most difficult dish to make, each delicate silver line appearing to float in the transparent fish flesh.<br><br>The educational theme continues in a section on other curious applications for these models, beyond the world of restaurant windows. A carrot in progressive stages of destruction \u2013 from slices to cubes to pur\u00e9e to liquid mush \u2013 turns out to be a kitchen aid for cooks in old people\u2019s homes. Another display (best avoided) shows the fat content of a croissant, the amount of sugar in orange juice, and the volume of salt in instant noodles. Another wall depicts the various components of the recommended daily intake in Japan: a bounty of fresh veg that puts the UK\u2019s \u201cfive a day\u201d to shame.<br><br>When it all gets too healthy, there\u2019s a window display of sweets and treats to boost the calorie count. It features retro classics like lurid green melon soda and sundaes topped with whipped cream (one of the trickiest textures to recreate). Such 1960s diner staples have enjoyed a resurgence as part of the vintage revival of kissaten (particularly <a href=\"https://yokohama-fuzei.com/2024/09/05/discovering-japans-jun-kissa-cafe-a-journey-into-retro-nostalgia/\">jun-kissa</a>, or \u201cpure\u201d coffee and tea houses) among Japan\u2019s gen Z. Their menus of custard pudding, ketchup spaghetti and crustless white sandwiches have remained largely unchanged.<br><br>Some of these rich confections feature on the poster campaign for the exhibition, which raised alarm bells with the advertising authorities, who demanded to know the calorific value of the puddings, given restrictions on advertising junk food. Japan House proudly answered: zero. As tempting as it all looks, this banquet of PVC and resin won\u2019t widen your waistline. Just don\u2019t visit on an empty stomach.</p> <p>\u2022 Looks Delicious! is at <a href=\"https://www.japanhouselondon.uk/whats-on/looks-delicious-exploring-japans-food-replica-culture/\">Japan House, London</a>, until 16 February<br></p>",

Behold the fugu of Yamaguchi, delicate slices of translucent pufferfish arranged in the shape of a chrysanthemum flower; or the Jibu-ni of Ishikawa, a dish of duck garnished with gold leaf \u2013 a speciality of this wealthy region, originally reserved for samurai families. Would you brave the zunda-mochi, glutinous rice cakes covered in a vibrant green slop of mashed edamame beans; or the crusty fermented fish of Fukui? The silver-stripe herring sashimi of Kagoshima was apparently the most difficult dish to make, each delicate silver line appearing to float in the transparent fish flesh. The educational theme continues in a section on other curious applications for these models, beyond the world of restaurant windows. A carrot in progressive stages of destruction \u2013 from slices to cubes to pur\u00e9e to liquid mush \u2013 turns out to be a kitchen aid for cooks in old people\u2019s homes. Another display (best avoided) shows the fat content of a croissant, the amount of sugar in orange juice, and the volume of salt in instant noodles. Another wall depicts the various components of the recommended daily intake in Japan: a bounty of fresh veg that puts the UK\u2019s \u201cfive a day\u201d to shame. When it all gets too healthy, there\u2019s a window display of sweets and treats to boost the calorie count. It features retro classics like lurid green melon soda and sundaes topped with whipped cream (one of the trickiest textures to recreate). Such 1960s diner staples have enjoyed a resurgence as part of the vintage revival of kissaten (particularly jun-kissa, or \u201cpure\u201d coffee and tea houses) among Japan\u2019s gen Z. Their menus of custard pudding, ketchup spaghetti and crustless white sandwiches have remained largely unchanged. Some of these rich confections feature on the poster campaign for the exhibition, which raised alarm bells with the advertising authorities, who demanded to know the calorific value of the puddings, given restrictions on advertising junk food. Japan House proudly answered: zero. As tempting as it all looks, this banquet of PVC and resin won\u2019t widen your waistline. Just don\u2019t visit on an empty stomach. \u2022 Looks Delicious! is at Japan House, London, until 16 February",

      "body": "<p>In 2008, the playwright Matthew L\u00f3pez had a bright idea: to examine the lives of gay male New Yorkers one generation after the advent of Aids by using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1910/feb/26/classics\">Howards End </a>as the scaffolding with which to build a new drama. Perhaps EM Forster himself could even be a character wandering through it. A decade later, the two-part, six-hour-plus epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/29/the-inheritance-review-stephen-daldry\">The Inheritance</a> premiered at the Young Vic in London before transferring to Broadway, vacuuming up prizes along the way including a Tony for best play, which made L\u00f3pez the first Latin\u00e9 writer (<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-09-27/matthew-lopez-tony-awards-latine-latinx\">his preferred non-gendered term</a> for people of Latin American heritage) to win that award. The consensus was that he had written the greatest theatrical account of gay life since Angels in America.</p> <p>When the concept of The Inheritance first occurred to him, however, L\u00f3pez wasn\u2019t equipped to write it. He had already had a play produced: <a href=\"https://www.concordtheatricals.com/p/1977/the-whipping-man\">The Whipping Man</a>, set at the end of the American civil war. Any doubts he harboured about his talent had been partly assuaged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/25/terrence-mcnally-obituary\">Terrence McNally</a> (playwright of Love! Valour! Compassion!), who read one of his early plays and declared: \u201cYou\u2019re a writer.\u201d But L\u00f3pez was struggling with alcoholism in 2008, and was still more than a year shy of getting sober. The Inheritance would have to wait. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I wrote Reverberation instead. It\u2019s the last thing I wrote drinking. My last \u2018using\u2019 play, so to speak.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a queer person of colour in New York, I didn\u2019t feel safe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are sitting on a sofa in the corridor of a London theatre. Upstairs, Reverberation is in rehearsals ahead of its forthcoming European premiere at Bristol Old Vic. The 47-year-old L\u00f3pez, who is petite and summery in a charcoal polo shirt, white trousers and black sockless trainers, is mulling over the problems he is about to cause for the marketing team. \u201cThis is really gonna sell some tickets,\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of my darker plays in terms of my mindset at the time. It was terrifying, and it was not fun to write.\u201d</p>    <p>Indeed, it is unrecognisable as the work of the same man who later co-wrote and directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/13/red-white-royal-blue-review-enemies-become-lovers-in-super-slick-queer-romance-casey-mcquiston\">Red, White &amp; Royal Blue</a>, a glossy, teen-friendly love story about an English prince and the son of the US president. That hit movie is, to use one of L\u00f3pez\u2019s pet phrases, a \u201cjoy-bomb\u201d. For all its prickly humour, Reverberation is more like an A-bomb.</p> <p>Like The Inheritance and L\u00f3pez\u2019s 2011 play <a href=\"https://playbill.com/article/matthew-lopezs-somewhere-starring-tony-winner-priscilla-lopez-opens-at-hartford-stage-april-11-com-217013\">Somewhere </a>\u2013 about a Latin American family in late-1950s New York whose neighbourhood is being bulldozed to make way for the construction of the Lincoln Centre \u2013 Reverberation addresses the fragility of the home. Its action is confined to two apartments. Make that two <em>flats</em>: originally set in New York, it has now been relocated to London, much like L\u00f3pez himself, who moved to the UK three years ago. It has also been subtly updated; there is even a Suella Braverman reference. But it is still a three-hander about two neighbours \u2013 Claire, who works in retail, and Jonathan, an illustrator living in the flat below \u2013 and a much younger man, Wes, whom Jonathan meets on a hookup app.</p> <p>While Wes is irrepressible and largely ignorant of danger, Jonathan, still shaken by a violent attack, is withdrawn to the point of near-agoraphobia. Claire bobs somewhere in between, flinging herself manically into new romantic experiences \u2013 she even chances her arm with Jonathan \u2013 yet still prone to sink into the doldrums. L\u00f3pez has been each of them at various points in his life, he says. \u201cBut I was Jonathan while I was writing it.\u201d</p> <p>He had arrived in the city eight years earlier, having grown up on the Florida panhandle. \u201cAs a queer person of colour in New York, I didn\u2019t feel safe. I had frightening experiences on the subway. I was terribly afraid of the world for the longest time, and I was barricading myself with alcohol. The play comes from wanting to resist that.\u201d He was also in the foothills of a new relationship with the man to whom he is now married. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m in love for the first time.

The joyful-grim.\u201d</p> <p>Bleakly funny it may be, but Reverberation is unavoidably an X-ray of trauma.

What I\u2019ve discovered in dealing with violence against myself is that you sometimes don\u2019t jump automatically to the conclusion that a crime has been committed.

Yet that very impulse not to deal with things is what keeps us from moving past them.\u201d</p> <p>Trauma duly dealt with in Reverberation, L\u00f3pez\u2019s first play after getting clean was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/09/the-legend-of-georgia-mcbride-review-mcc-theater-new-york\">The Legend of Georgia McBride</a>, a riotous comedy about an Elvis impersonator who becomes a drag queen. \u201cI knew I had to write something deeply silly,\u201d he says. This is the way it tends to work with him: each project is a response to, or recovery from, the last. The Inheritance dealt with its own generous helping of trauma, not only from Aids but also the 2016 election. In the play\u2019s most notorious speech, one character observes that Donald Trump is akin to HIV, and that he has \u201cattached himself to American democracy and is now destroying the American immune system \u2026 He\u2019s replicating his genetic material from tweet to tweet, from person to person.\u201d Loath to discuss the forthcoming US election, L\u00f3pez will say only that he is feeling \u201coptimistic but also snake-bit\u201d.</p> <p>The pinballing between drama and comedy continued after The Inheritance.

      "bodyText": "In 2008, the playwright Matthew L\u00f3pez had a bright idea: to examine the lives of gay male New Yorkers one generation after the advent of Aids by using Howards End as the scaffolding with which to build a new drama. Perhaps EM Forster himself could even be a character wandering through it. A decade later, the two-part, six-hour-plus epic The Inheritance premiered at the Young Vic in London before transferring to Broadway, vacuuming up prizes along the way including a Tony for best play, which made L\u00f3pez the first Latin\u00e9 writer (his preferred non-gendered term for people of Latin American heritage) to win that award. The consensus was that he had written the greatest theatrical account of gay life since Angels in America. When the concept of The Inheritance first occurred to him, however, L\u00f3pez wasn\u2019t equipped to write it. He had already had a play produced: The Whipping Man, set at the end of the American civil war. Any doubts he harboured about his talent had been partly assuaged by Terrence McNally (playwright of Love! Valour! Compassion!), who read one of his early plays and declared: \u201cYou\u2019re a writer.\u201d But L\u00f3pez was struggling with alcoholism in 2008, and was still more than a year shy of getting sober. The Inheritance would have to wait. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I wrote Reverberation instead. It\u2019s the last thing I wrote drinking. My last \u2018using\u2019 play, so to speak.\u201d We are sitting on a sofa in the corridor of a London theatre. Upstairs, Reverberation is in rehearsals ahead of its forthcoming European premiere at Bristol Old Vic. The 47-year-old L\u00f3pez, who is petite and summery in a charcoal polo shirt, white trousers and black sockless trainers, is mulling over the problems he is about to cause for the marketing team. \u201cThis is really gonna sell some tickets,\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of my darker plays in terms of my mindset at the time. It was terrifying, and it was not fun to write.\u201d Indeed, it is unrecognisable as the work of the same man who later co-wrote and directed Red, White &amp; Royal Blue, a glossy, teen-friendly love story about an English prince and the son of the US president. That hit movie is, to use one of L\u00f3pez\u2019s pet phrases, a \u201cjoy-bomb\u201d. For all its prickly humour, Reverberation is more like an A-bomb. Like The Inheritance and L\u00f3pez\u2019s 2011 play Somewhere \u2013 about a Latin American family in late-1950s New York whose neighbourhood is being bulldozed to make way for the construction of the Lincoln Centre \u2013 Reverberation addresses the fragility of the home. Its action is confined to two apartments. Make that two flats: originally set in New York, it has now been relocated to London, much like L\u00f3pez himself, who moved to the UK three years ago. It has also been subtly updated; there is even a Suella Braverman reference. But it is still a three-hander about two neighbours \u2013 Claire, who works in retail, and Jonathan, an illustrator living in the flat below \u2013 and a much younger man, Wes, whom Jonathan meets on a hookup app. While Wes is irrepressible and largely ignorant of danger, Jonathan, still shaken by a violent attack, is withdrawn to the point of near-agoraphobia. Claire bobs somewhere in between, flinging herself manically into new romantic experiences \u2013 she even chances her arm with Jonathan \u2013 yet still prone to sink into the doldrums. L\u00f3pez has been each of them at various points in his life, he says. \u201cBut I was Jonathan while I was writing it.\u201d He had arrived in the city eight years earlier, having grown up on the Florida panhandle. \u201cAs a queer person of colour in New York, I didn\u2019t feel safe. I had frightening experiences on the subway. I was terribly afraid of the world for the longest time, and I was barricading myself with alcohol. The play comes from wanting to resist that.\u201d He was also in the foothills of a new relationship with the man to whom he is now married. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m in love for the first time. How would I respond if I lost that?\u2019\u201d Out of this collision of horror and hypothesis emerged Reverberation. The new production will be only the second. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly the play of mine that has broken my heart more than any other,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a long period where I couldn\u2019t get it produced. It scared people.\u201d The laughter from the audience at the US premiere in 2015 could scarcely have been more welcome. \u201cThe actors breathed a sigh of relief.

Not until page 13 of the script, for instance, do Jonathan and Wes exchange names, long after exchanging bodily fluids. \u201cI love an uncomplicated emotion, and I love creating them in an audience,\u201d says L\u00f3pez. \u201cBut the thing that excites me is happy-sad. The joyful-grim.\u201d Bleakly funny it may be, but Reverberation is unavoidably an X-ray of trauma. It captures with stinging accuracy the way that pain can sometimes be downgraded by the people suffering it. \u201cClaire and Jonathan are survivors of violence and aggression from men,\u201d he explains. \u201cSome of those instances are drops in the ocean and others are barely survivable.

The report also said that it demonstrated \u201cdeeply entrenched and persistent dishonesty \u2026 in pursuit of commercial gain\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is understood that the RFU is building a temporary \u201cdemountable\u201d structure and applied for planning permission for an initial five years only because the union is considering basing England\u2019s senior side elsewhere after the next World Cup.</p> \n<p>In what hardly constitutes a ringing endorsement for Steve Borthwick remaining as head coach beyond the 2027 tournament in Australia, a planning submission from the union read: \u201cThe RFU has chosen only temporary demountable structures due to both uncertainty whether they will stay at Pennyhill Park beyond 2028 and the possible change in requirements after the next World Cup in 2027.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Grenfell Tower fire happened in 2017 and resulted in the deaths of 72 people. A small amount of a Kingspan insulation product, which was used on the building, was not found to be the reason for the fire. The main cause was the tower\u2019s cladding, which did not comply with building regulations and enabled the rapid spread of flames.</p> \n<p>The inquiry\u2019s final report does, however, detail a \u201cpath to disaster\u201d stretching back to the 1990s and examines the wider conduct of the construction industry. It found that Kingspan \u201cknowingly created a false market in insulation\u201d from 2005 onwards for use on buildings over 18 metres tall.</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of its publication, the major-winning golfer Shane Lowry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/10/golfer-shane-lowry-cuts-ties-with-kingspan-after-grenfell-inquiry-report\">severed ties with Kingspan</a> after years of urging from campaigners. In 2021 the Mercedes Formula One team had removed its sponsorship from their cars with the inquiry ongoing. Ulster rugby club, for whom Kingspan was the principal sponsor and held naming rights to their stadium, announced earlier this year that the partnership would end in June 2025. The club came under pressure from the government to cut links to Kingspan before the conclusion of the inquiry and was</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68004728\">criticised by the then Levelling Up secretary, Michael Gove</a>, and campaigners for the time taken to make the decision.</p> \n<p>Grenfell United, which represents survivors and bereaved families of those who lost their lives in the fire, said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see that it is business as usual for the Rugby Football Union. They need to read the Grenfell Inquiry executive summary and think again.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe report found that \u2018Kingspan knowingly created a false market in insulation\u2019 and exposed the company\u2019s \u2018calculated\u2019, \u2018cynical\u2019 and \u2018disingenuous\u2019 methods to force their product on to the market. Can you really have a clear conscience using a company under criminal investigation? Seventy-two people died at Grenfell, let their legacy be one of change.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last month Kingspan welcomed the report, stating that: \u201cIt explains clearly and unambiguously that the type of insulation was immaterial, and that the principal reason for the fire spread was the PE ACM cladding, which was not made by Kingspan. Kingspan has long acknowledged the wholly unacceptable historical failings that occurred in part of our UK insulation business. These were in no way reflective of how we conduct ourselves as a group, then or now. While deeply regrettable, they were not found to be causative of the tragedy.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"067fd82c-c8ac-4ebc-baa1-c303d415ad74\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The England fly-half George Ford sustained a torn thigh muscle during Sale's 45-26 Premiership defeat by Saracens.

      "bodyText": "The Rugby Football Union has been urged to reconsider using materials made by an insulation company, found to have behaved with \u201cpersistent dishonesty\u201d by the final report of the Grenfell Tower inquiry, on a new training facility, the Guardian can reveal. The RFU is building a new \u201cflexible multi-purpose space\u201d as well as a storage facility at Pennyhill Park \u2013 England\u2019s Bagshot training base since 2003 \u2013 and, in planning submissions seen by the Guardian, the union demonstrated its intention to use materials made by the Irish company Kingspan. It is understood work began at the end of August and included the delivery of Kingspan materials. According to the final report of the inquiry last month, Kingspan was not found to be directly responsible for the Grenfell fire but showed \u201ccomplete disregard for fire safety\u201d in how it marketed one of its products. The report also said that it demonstrated \u201cdeeply entrenched and persistent dishonesty \u2026 in pursuit of commercial gain\u201d. It is understood that the RFU is building a temporary \u201cdemountable\u201d structure and applied for planning permission for an initial five years only because the union is considering basing England\u2019s senior side elsewhere after the next World Cup. In what hardly constitutes a ringing endorsement for Steve Borthwick remaining as head coach beyond the 2027 tournament in Australia, a planning submission from the union read: \u201cThe RFU has chosen only temporary demountable structures due to both uncertainty whether they will stay at Pennyhill Park beyond 2028 and the possible change in requirements after the next World Cup in 2027.\u201d The Grenfell Tower fire happened in 2017 and resulted in the deaths of 72 people. A small amount of a Kingspan insulation product, which was used on the building, was not found to be the reason for the fire. The main cause was the tower\u2019s cladding, which did not comply with building regulations and enabled the rapid spread of flames. The inquiry\u2019s final report does, however, detail a \u201cpath to disaster\u201d stretching back to the 1990s and examines the wider conduct of the construction industry. It found that Kingspan \u201cknowingly created a false market in insulation\u201d from 2005 onwards for use on buildings over 18 metres tall. In the aftermath of its publication, the major-winning golfer Shane Lowry severed ties with Kingspan after years of urging from campaigners. In 2021 the Mercedes Formula One team had removed its sponsorship from their cars with the inquiry ongoing. Ulster rugby club, for whom Kingspan was the principal sponsor and held naming rights to their stadium, announced earlier this year that the partnership would end in June 2025. The club came under pressure from the government to cut links to Kingspan before the conclusion of the inquiry and was criticised by the then Levelling Up secretary, Michael Gove, and campaigners for the time taken to make the decision. Grenfell United, which represents survivors and bereaved families of those who lost their lives in the fire, said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see that it is business as usual for the Rugby Football Union. They need to read the Grenfell Inquiry executive summary and think again. \u201cThe report found that \u2018Kingspan knowingly created a false market in insulation\u2019 and exposed the company\u2019s \u2018calculated\u2019, \u2018cynical\u2019 and \u2018disingenuous\u2019 methods to force their product on to the market. Can you really have a clear conscience using a company under criminal investigation? Seventy-two people died at Grenfell, let their legacy be one of change.\u201d Last month Kingspan welcomed the report, stating that: \u201cIt explains clearly and unambiguously that the type of insulation was immaterial, and that the principal reason for the fire spread was the PE ACM cladding, which was not made by Kingspan. Kingspan has long acknowledged the wholly unacceptable historical failings that occurred in part of our UK insulation business. These were in no way reflective of how we conduct ourselves as a group, then or now. While deeply regrettable, they were not found to be causative of the tragedy.\u201d It is understood the RFU ordered the Kingspan materials \u2013 different to those used at Grenfell \u2013 in July, while the public inquiry was ongoing but before the final report. The union wants the single-storey facility to be ready in time for England\u2019s internationals in November, with New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Japan due at Twickenham\u2019s Allianz Stadium. The existing training centre in Bagshot was built in 2014 and the RFU has cited a need to modernise its facilities to \u201censure it meets the constantly evolving needs of the coaches and team\u201d. In plans seen by the Guardian, the new \u201cinspirational\u201d facility will come complete with bean bags, card tables and a theatre-style meeting area. It will accommodate various areas required during a training camp, such as team meetings, analysis, medical, refuel, hydration, recovery and relaxation spaces, as well as improved toilet and hygiene facilities. An RFU spokesperson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss individual suppliers or manufacturers [unless they are brand partners]. Our suppliers and those involved in our construction projects are required to comply with established best practices and building control regulations.\u201d",

There are millions of pounds in dispute between postmasters and what is on their records and what is in the Post Office account.\u201d</p> <p>The inquiry has previously heard about \u201cuntouchables\u201d within the organisation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/27/post-office-boss-asked-about-his-pay-more-than-expected-board-member\">a phrase attributed to outgoing chief executive, Nick Read</a>, to refer to a group of Post Office investigators who would never face disciplinary action over the Horizon IT scandal.</p> <p>Saf Ismail, one of two sub-postmasters who sit on the board of the Post Office, has also referred to a \u201cred\u201d list of 23 other employees deemed high-risk given their involvement in the scandal in one way or other, none of whom have even been suspended.</p> <p>\u201cThere are these people called the \u2018untouchables\u2019 in the investigations team, or reds or whatever, involved with all the issues in the past of finding postmasters guilty,\u201d Staunton said.</p> <p>\u201cI am very afraid if [sub-postmasters] are investigated [after the new IT system is implemented] by the so-called untouchables we could have another debacle \u2013 not to the same extent \u2013 but we could have hundreds of sub-postmasters having to pay out monies.

      "bodyText": "The former chair of the Post Office has warned of another Horizon-style scandal if so-called \u201cuntouchable\u201d investigators and executives involved in the prosecution of sub-postmasters are not fired before the organisation rolls out its new IT system. Henry Staunton, who was sacked by the then business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, in January, said there there were still millions of pounds in dispute between what sub-postmasters and the Post Office have recorded. Staunton said that before the replacement for Horizon is rolled out \u2013 a system that itself is full of bugs and whose projected costs have doubled to more than \u00a3800m \u2013 the Post Office must deal with staff involved in the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 sub-postmasters. \u201cThis is not something that relates to the past \u2013 it is something that relates to the future,\u201d he told the inquiry into the scandal on Tuesday. \u201cBefore we implement [the new] Horizon we will be doing a path-clearing exercise. There are millions of pounds in dispute between postmasters and what is on their records and what is in the Post Office account.\u201d The inquiry has previously heard about \u201cuntouchables\u201d within the organisation, a phrase attributed to outgoing chief executive, Nick Read, to refer to a group of Post Office investigators who would never face disciplinary action over the Horizon IT scandal. Saf Ismail, one of two sub-postmasters who sit on the board of the Post Office, has also referred to a \u201cred\u201d list of 23 other employees deemed high-risk given their involvement in the scandal in one way or other, none of whom have even been suspended. \u201cThere are these people called the \u2018untouchables\u2019 in the investigations team, or reds or whatever, involved with all the issues in the past of finding postmasters guilty,\u201d Staunton said. \u201cI am very afraid if [sub-postmasters] are investigated [after the new IT system is implemented] by the so-called untouchables we could have another debacle \u2013 not to the same extent \u2013 but we could have hundreds of sub-postmasters having to pay out monies. This is a big issue going forward, the involvement of the untouchables. It is not some sort of academic exercise. It is really fundamental to what we do next time.\u201d Staunton said that Read, who is expected to appear before the inquiry for three days next week, had used the phrase \u201cuntouchables\u201d with him in a private conversation and in a meeting with all of the Post Office\u2019s non-executive directors. Asked by counsel for the inquiry what exactly he understood an \u201cuntouchable\u201d employee was, Staunton said: \u201cThey are people that were involved in prosecuting postmasters previously and are still in their roles and therefore would be involved in any future investigations \u2026 And that seems utterly wrong.\u201d There are 48 people employed in the investigations team, the inquiry heard, although how many of them are considered \u201cuntouchable\u201d is unknown. Staunton also said his first impression upon taking up the role in late 2022 was that there was not an acceptance among management that the Post Office had been wrong to pursue prosecutions, despite damning high court judgments. \u201cThey didn\u2019t fully accept it, that was my impression, that somehow the case hadn\u2019t been put well or whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a feeling that this was absolutely wrong, [what] had happened. It was a feeling across the piece with the team.\u201d It has emerged that Nick Read, the chief executive of the Post Office, wrote to ministers as recently as January to say it would stand by the prosecution of more than half of the post office operators targeted during the Horizon scandal. The letter, to the then justice secretary, was sent less than a week after the ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office finished airing and raised the profile of the scandal. Staunton, who has accused the last government of wanting to delay payments to post office operators until after the general election, said his second takeaway when he started was that there was \u201cno appetite at all for exoneration. Those were the two things that came through strongly to me.\u201d Staunton described the Post Office\u2019s investigations department as \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cquite brutal\u201d in the way they dealt with post office operators. Staunton said that he was shocked at the attitude of the remediation process designed to evaluate and compensate those prosecuted. He cited examples including a reluctance to \u201cpause\u201d branch owner-operators having to repay money while they were being evaluated in the scheme, as that might result in more coming forward to seek redress. \u201cWhat surprised me was, we shouldn\u2019t not be doing something because it would generate claims,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not the basis the remediation committee should be working on.

The Proms act as a gateway to a love of music of all genres. Cheap to attend and experimental in repertoire, they show how the art will survive. Those who apparently love the classics, but seem to shun anything less than 100 years old as dangerously modern must expect their music to die with them.

      "body": "<p>Iryna Tsilyk is tired. The Ukrainian poet and film-maker apologises for her English, unnecessarily, and for her patchy cognitive ability, also unnecessarily. The whole of Ukraine, you could say, is tired: tired of the missiles, the deaths, the stress, the grief, and of the guilt that seems to afflict everyone from frontline soldiers to those in safer exile abroad for \u201cnot doing enough\u201d. Tsilyk, an author of light-footed, vivid poems and of tender, quietly devastating films, says she has been diagnosed with depression. She shrugs: it\u2019s the same for a bunch of her friends, probably much of the population.</p> <p>It is hardly surprising, given the extreme pressure Ukrainians are living under, more than two and a half years into Russia\u2019s fullscale invasion. Tsilyk\u2019s husband, the novelist Artem Chekh, is in the armed forces. He fought in the war that began in 2014 after the Russian-backed takeovers in the Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk. His 10 months in the trenches back then were intensely difficult for the couple. So was its aftermath after the initial euphoria of his return, Tsilyk tells me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Mykolaiv, 400 people came in the middle of the working day and listened to poems for three hours</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chekh plunged very low, even entertaining suicidal thoughts. What saved him, she says, was \u201cfor the first time starting to work with his hands, not with his head\u201d. He became, for a while, a prop maker on productions such as the TV series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/29/chernobyl-horrifying-masterful-television-that-sears-on-to-your-brain\">Chernobyl</a>. He rejoined the army the day after the full-scale invasion, on 25 February 2022, and has been on the frontline of some deadly battles.</p> <p>Her latest film script, she tells me, began as the story of her feelings on one of the terrifying days when Chekh had disappeared into the vortex of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2023/aug/10/how-bakhmut-became-a-pivot-in-the-ukraine-war\">battle for Bakhmut</a>, out of contact, fate unknown. (He is stationed in Kyiv now, away from the combat zone.) In the end, though, she rejected that idea. \u201cI felt that I trapped myself,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause that day was actually full of stress and pain and nothing else. And I don\u2019t want to make one more film about suffering. I wanted to save some space for jokes, for black humour.\u201d</p>    <p>Tsilyk, in both her films and her literary work, weaves together such seeming incompatibilities: jokes amid horror; or the way \u201cnormal life\u201d (say, sitting on the terrace of a hipster cafe in Kyiv, as we are doing now) jostles up against the unspeakable (nightly air raid alerts, the proximity of death).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07374836.2024.2362565\">One of her poems</a>, translated into English by her as My Day, draws out some of these painful juxtapositions. It starts with the narrator being woken at 4am by an air raid siren, falling back to sleep, making breakfast for her son, going to a soldier\u2019s funeral, hesitating between zinfandel and pinot noir in the supermarket, getting a message from her husband on the frontline to say that he is OK, crying in the shower \u2026 \u201ca typical day overall\u201d, as the poem dryly concludes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Poetry is so cool! The other arts, they are not as powerful by far</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Red Zone, the working title of the film, will be an animated documentary. The form will allow her to exit the outer world of realism and explore the sheer surreality of living through war. She is an admirer of Ari Folman\u2019s 2008 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/21/waltz-with-bashir-folman\">Waltz With Bashir</a>, a pioneering animated documentary that tells a nonfiction story through the memories and dreamscapes of its protagonist.</p> <p>The main character of the film is, like Tsilyk, a poet, and Red Zone will bring these two aspects of her, poet and film-maker, closer than ever, she tells me \u2013 though \u201cfilm critics usually say my films are quite poetic, and literary critics say that my poetry and writing in general is very visual\u201d.</p> <p>She\u2019s so glad to have both disciplines in her life, she says: she feels all the richer for it. In practical terms, it\u2019s good to have poetry when the Ukrainian film industry is \u201cparalysed\u201d she says \u2013 not only by war and an extreme strain on funding, but through the inadequacies of the state film agency, which many Ukrainian film-makers are boycotting at the moment. (Red Zone is so far receiving its funding from France and Luxembourg.)</p> <p>Tsilyk becomes animated when talking about poetry in Ukraine right now. \u201cPoetry is so cool! The other arts, they are not as powerful by far!\u201d She is thinking of its huge popularity in Ukraine now, and how it is perhaps the form that can best capture the fracturing of meaning, even the explosion of language, that the war has brought about.</p> <p>And it brings people together. Last year she and other Ukrainian poets went on tour to give readings in Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv \u2013 cities that were, and are, being daily pounded by Russian missiles. In Zaporizhzhia, the venue had a capacity of 300 but 700 squeezed in. In Mykolaiv, 400 came in the middle of the working day and listened to poems for three hours. Watching people take off flak jackets before listening to poems was profoundly moving, she says. You could think of it as a metaphor: you remove your hard shell and make yourself porous to the art.</p>    <p>She has a new collection out, called Thin Ice, the title a reflection of the anxieties that abound around human relationships right now in Ukraine; the way encounters with friends or strangers are made fragile by people\u2019s often hidden traumatic memories, by the gulf between people\u2019s experiences.</p> <p>Tsilyk\u2019s venture into animated documentary is the latest in a line of artistic reinventions: her films have certainly not repeated themselves. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0015x8s\">The Earth Is Blue as an Orange </a>(2020) is a documentary following a family living near the frontline in Ukraine\u2019s east in the years immediately before the full-scale invasion. She travelled back and forth from the warzone, feeling deeply for her subjects yet little thinking that eventually missiles would start falling on her own Kyiv. Part of her purpose in Red Zone, she says, is to express that sense of shock, and to warn western European audiences that: \u201cwar is much closer than they imagine \u2013 we also couldn\u2019t imagine these rocket and drone attacks on Kyiv.\u201d</p> <p>That was followed in 2022 by a feature, an adaptation of her husband\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4668-rock-paper-grenade?srsltid=AfmBOoqwbKPGKXdaEqHwvXlGHlwc4YbUCWDmoERA5H85piof-6cYpqWx\">latest novel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81EXF4T19N8\">Rock, Paper, Grenade</a>, an autobiographical story about a young boy growing up in the 1990s. (Chekh\u2019s book will be published in English translation next year by Seven Stories.)</p> <p>She was born in 1982, he in 1985: they were both deeply shaped by the chaotic years of economic collapse after the fall of the Soviet Union. For her, there was also a teenage process of discovering her own connections to Ukrainian culture, which had been submerged under the years of Soviet rule. She discovered the richness of Ukrainian literary heritage, and switched from the Russian that had been spoken in her immediate family \u2013 at first gradually, then decisively when she was pregnant with her son, Andriy, who plays the young boy in Rock, Paper, Grenade, making the film truly a family affair. Tsilyk and Chekh together adapted his book while he was still working on it, so that the works are truly intertwined; he was also script supervisor on the set.</p> <p>For her, making the movie meant taking a deep, empathetic look at her parents\u2019 generation. \u201cWe found ourselves in a completely different reality,\u201d she says of the great disruptions of the 1990s. \u201cAnd our parents, and all the adults, felt so confused. They were trying to find some balance in this shaky experience, but they were failing again and again. And we were kids, and it was so difficult to forgive them their mistakes. Most of us had this trauma of poverty. We felt hungry for everything, literally. I mean we really wanted to eat something tasty. But not only that: we wanted nice jeans, some sneakers, and we were dreaming about those other worlds, those European countries and everything we never had.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81EXF4T19N8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/81EXF4T19N8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The Ukrainian title translates literally as \u201cFelix and I\u201d. Felix is a troubled, hard-drinking Afghanistan war veteran, and his relationship with the young protagonist lies at the heart of the film. On it goes, the trauma, needling its way through the generations. Even with chroniclers as empathetic as Tsilyk, its sharpness perhaps cannot be blunted. But at least it can be spoken of, gently and with understanding, and better understood.</p> <p>\u2022 Iryna Tsilyk will appear at <a href=\"https://www.hayfestival.com/lviv-bookforum\">Lviv BookForum</a> on 5 October.

Red Zone, the working title of the film, will be an animated documentary. The form will allow her to exit the outer world of realism and explore the sheer surreality of living through war. She is an admirer of Ari Folman\u2019s 2008 film Waltz With Bashir, a pioneering animated documentary that tells a nonfiction story through the memories and dreamscapes of its protagonist. The main character of the film is, like Tsilyk, a poet, and Red Zone will bring these two aspects of her, poet and film-maker, closer than ever, she tells me \u2013 though \u201cfilm critics usually say my films are quite poetic, and literary critics say that my poetry and writing in general is very visual\u201d.

In practical terms, it\u2019s good to have poetry when the Ukrainian film industry is \u201cparalysed\u201d she says \u2013 not only by war and an extreme strain on funding, but through the inadequacies of the state film agency, which many Ukrainian film-makers are boycotting at the moment. (Red Zone is so far receiving its funding from France and Luxembourg.) Tsilyk becomes animated when talking about poetry in Ukraine right now. \u201cPoetry is so cool! The other arts, they are not as powerful by far!\u201d She is thinking of its huge popularity in Ukraine now, and how it is perhaps the form that can best capture the fracturing of meaning, even the explosion of language, that the war has brought about. And it brings people together. Last year she and other Ukrainian poets went on tour to give readings in Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv \u2013 cities that were, and are, being daily pounded by Russian missiles. In Zaporizhzhia, the venue had a capacity of 300 but 700 squeezed in. In Mykolaiv, 400 came in the middle of the working day and listened to poems for three hours. Watching people take off flak jackets before listening to poems was profoundly moving, she says. You could think of it as a metaphor: you remove your hard shell and make yourself porous to the art. She has a new collection out, called Thin Ice, the title a reflection of the anxieties that abound around human relationships right now in Ukraine; the way encounters with friends or strangers are made fragile by people\u2019s often hidden traumatic memories, by the gulf between people\u2019s experiences. Tsilyk\u2019s venture into animated documentary is the latest in a line of artistic reinventions: her films have certainly not repeated themselves. The Earth Is Blue as an Orange (2020) is a documentary following a family living near the frontline in Ukraine\u2019s east in the years immediately before the full-scale invasion. She travelled back and forth from the warzone, feeling deeply for her subjects yet little thinking that eventually missiles would start falling on her own Kyiv. Part of her purpose in Red Zone, she says, is to express that sense of shock, and to warn western European audiences that: \u201cwar is much closer than they imagine \u2013 we also couldn\u2019t imagine these rocket and drone attacks on Kyiv.\u201d That was followed in 2022 by a feature, an adaptation of her husband\u2019s latest novel, Rock, Paper, Grenade, an autobiographical story about a young boy growing up in the 1990s. (Chekh\u2019s book will be published in English translation next year by Seven Stories.) She was born in 1982, he in 1985: they were both deeply shaped by the chaotic years of economic collapse after the fall of the Soviet Union. For her, there was also a teenage process of discovering her own connections to Ukrainian culture, which had been submerged under the years of Soviet rule. She discovered the richness of Ukrainian literary heritage, and switched from the Russian that had been spoken in her immediate family \u2013 at first gradually, then decisively when she was pregnant with her son, Andriy, who plays the young boy in Rock, Paper, Grenade, making the film truly a family affair. Tsilyk and Chekh together adapted his book while he was still working on it, so that the works are truly intertwined; he was also script supervisor on the set. For her, making the movie meant taking a deep, empathetic look at her parents\u2019 generation. \u201cWe found ourselves in a completely different reality,\u201d she says of the great disruptions of the 1990s. \u201cAnd our parents, and all the adults, felt so confused. They were trying to find some balance in this shaky experience, but they were failing again and again. And we were kids, and it was so difficult to forgive them their mistakes. Most of us had this trauma of poverty. We felt hungry for everything, literally. I mean we really wanted to eat something tasty. But not only that: we wanted nice jeans, some sneakers, and we were dreaming about those other worlds, those European countries and everything we never had.\u201d The Ukrainian title translates literally as \u201cFelix and I\u201d. Felix is a troubled, hard-drinking Afghanistan war veteran, and his relationship with the young protagonist lies at the heart of the film. On it goes, the trauma, needling its way through the generations. Even with chroniclers as empathetic as Tsilyk, its sharpness perhaps cannot be blunted. But at least it can be spoken of, gently and with understanding, and better understood. \u2022 Iryna Tsilyk will appear at Lviv BookForum on 5 October. Along with a selection of others from the festival, which runs from 2 to 6 October, the event will be available online in partnership with Hay festival \u2022 The Earth Is Blue as an Orange is on BBC iPlayer \u2022 Rock, Paper, Grenade is available in many European countries on HBO Max",

      "bodyText": "Israel\u2019s long-threatened ground operation into southern Lebanon appears so far to have been on a far smaller scale and with more modest objectives than had been anticipated from previous statements. The operation, involving formations from one Israeli division in the first instance, appears limited and has largely avoided any direct clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli troops. Israel has said its main objective is to eliminate the threat of a 7 October-style incursion by Hezbollah into Israel\u2019s north \u2013 one of the main fears that drove Israelis out of northern communities in the early stages of the war in Gaza. Whether or not Hezbollah\u2019s Radwan special operations force was seriously planning to attack en masse into Israel is unclear. Although the alleged plan was talked up by Israeli officials before the ground incursion, it would have marked a departure from previous, small-scale attempted incursions. \u201cHezbollah planned to invade Israel, attack Israeli communities and massacre innocent men, women and children,\u201d the senior Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, said on Tuesday. \u201cThey called this plan \u2018Conquer the Galilee\u2019. If the state of Lebanon and the world can\u2019t push Hezbollah away from our border, we have no choice but to do it ourselves.\u201d Hagari\u2019s claim does not explain why Hezbollah has up to now limited itself to firing rockets into Israel \u2013 following rules of engagement that appeared aimed at maintaining the conflict below the threshold of escalation. An incursion of fighters into north Israel would have made more sense when the Israeli military was more heavily distracted by fighting in Gaza, and the IDF\u2019s deployment in the north was spread thinner. It is worth assessing Hagari\u2019s comments in the context of a wider Israeli information and messaging campaign about a ground operation. The campaign\u2019s talking points have sometimes appeared contradictory, as Israeli officials and political leaders try to appeal to different audiences. Politically, the displacement of tens of thousands of Israelis from the country\u2019s north has become increasingly toxic for the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and has fed into the country\u2019s fractious politics. Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition partners, including Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, have tried to the exploit the worsening tensions in the north by demanding that something must be done to return displaced Israelis. Their demands have played on a wide and deeply felt anxiety in Israel\u2019s northern communities that they might face the same fate as the victims of Hamas on 7 October. There is no doubt about the existence of substantial Hezbollah infrastructure on the border, but they are positions that in some cases have existed for several decades. \u201cTo the best of my understanding, this move is designed to target infrastructure that Hezbollah built, and parts of which we were unfamiliar with,\u201d Israel Ziv, a former director of the IDF Operations Directorate, told Israel\u2019s 103 radio station hours after the attack was launched. Ziv said some of that infrastructure had been built by Hezbollah as attack positions for a potential incursion. \u201cThe [Israeli] move here now isn\u2019t some large-scale ground manoeuvre but truly one to remove a threat to the communities near the border, and this is absolutely part of the defensive operation. To perceive this as a wide-scale ground manoeuvre in Lebanon or an operation of conquest or [forming] a security zone \u2013 I think it isn\u2019t.\u201d While in the past Israel has sought through military action and diplomacy to insist \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 on the need for a wider buffer along its northern border, the scope this time so far appears to be limited to Lebanese border villages that Israel says Hezbollah has turned into positions from which it can attack. Ziv, like others, thinks the current scope of the continuing operation will not necessarily mean an end to indirect fire across the border. \u201cUnderneath that envelope [of limited military action], a war of attrition might still continue, with rocket and mortar fire and anything else, which won\u2019t really allow life in the northern communities,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why that reaching a [diplomatic] settlement and isolating the threat at a far greater distance is far more significant.\u201d Writing in Haaretz, the paper\u2019s longtime military correspondent, Amos Harel, alluded to the political imperatives of the campaign, suggesting it was as much \u201cmeant to serve as a tranquiliser for the evacuated residents of northern Israel, who will hesitate to go home even after the bombings of Beirut and Bekaa\u201d. \u201cIn their view,\u201d he added, \u201cthe urgent threat that must be dealt with lies just across the border fence.\u201d Israel also seems determined to communicate \u2013 to the Biden administration in particular \u2013 that the incursion is intended to be limited in terms of reach and duration. As in all conflicts, as the cliche goes, \u201cthe enemy gets a vote\u201d in where the operation will go from here. Whether the ground fighting remains constrained to a few kilometres on the border \u2013 or whether both sides are drawn into a more complicated fight neither had necessarily planned for \u2013 will rely in part on how Hezbollah responds.",

We see that people don\u2019t know if they will be affected or not.\u201d</p> <p>Although there had been problems, generally Northvolt had been a good workplace, Szabo said, but leadership could have been better. And the alleged workplace death in Skellefte\u00e5 was \u201cunacceptable\u201d, he added.</p> <p>The company has said it is in contact with prosecutors and police, and told Swedish broadcaster SVT it was refraining \u201cfrom commenting on the ongoing preliminary investigation\u201d.</p>    <p>The Swedish government has ruled out a bailout for Northvolt, but the company\u2019s fate threatens to be a political problem for Sweden and the EU.</p> <p>The energy and industry minister, Ebba Busch, has said the Swedish government was \u201cworking actively\u201d to help Northvolt continue operations and following developments closely, but it would not be appropriate for the state to step in with taxpayer loans or as a partner.</p> <p>However, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, has said the government was helping to find new backers and ownership models, which he said they had discussed with Germany, which has also ruled out a financial lifeline for the firm.</p> <p>Mats Engstr\u00f6m, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank (ECFR), said the company\u2019s management had \u201coverpromised and underdelivered\u201d, adding that its future was on a knife-edge.</p> <p>\u201cNow it is an open issue if Northvolt will survive,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney is rapidly running out. If owners and lenders can agree on financing for the near future it might still be possible to save the core business.\u201d</p> <p>Engstr\u00f6m warned that if Northvolt were to collapse, the repercussions would be far from a domestic headache. \u201cIt would certainly be a political problem for the Swedish and German governments as well as for the European Commission who all have supported the company\u2019s plans,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said any collapse would not be a failure for green industrial policy, but rather an indication of the difficulty of large-scale battery cell production, which \u2013 unlike iron and steelmining \u2013 Sweden did not have a history of experience in.</p> <p>Nevertheless, critics suggest the crisis at Northvolt is a \u201charsh awakening\u201d for Sweden\u2019s green transition plans and the EU\u2019s green deal.</p> <p>\u201cNorthvolt has more than 60bn kronor (\u00a34bn) in debt, is making huge losses, and can\u2019t ramp up its production,\u201d said Christian Sandstr\u00f6m, an associate professor and a columnist for the business paper Aff\u00e4rsv\u00e4rlden. \u201cAny new funds will only go to creditors at this point. The only way to resolve this is via bankruptcy.\u201d</p> <p>The company, he believes, could file for bankruptcy \u201cany day now\u201d. It did not bode well for the multitude of green businesses that had opened in the north of Sweden in recent years, Sandstr\u00f6m said. \u201cHanding out cheap government money to capitalists who say they will save the world by setting up factories in the rural north where there\u2019s a lack of skilled labour \u2013 maybe it wasn\u2019t such a great idea after all.\u201d</p> <p>The Swedish government recently announced the launch of a \u201cgreen acceleration office\u201d and proposals to shorten the time it took for businesses to get a permit. \u201cSweden has enormous potential in the climate transition,\u201d said Kristersson.</p> <p>But some have accused the government of naivety. Jonas Algers, a PhD student at Lund University\u2019s environmental and energy systems studies department, said: \u201cEveryone likes the idea of a slick startup with a charismatic CEO and fancy PowerPoints revolutionising a sector.</p> <p>\u201cBut at the end of the day, if you want to build a massive, largest-in-Europe plant it will require lots of workers who need to be coordinated, lots of construction that needs to be done in a safe manner, and skills and technology that need to be developed. None of this is a simple task.\u201d</p> <p>H2 Green Steel, in Boden, northern Sweden, had learned from Northvolt\u2019s mistakes, Algers said, but there were issues in the Swedish labour market for large-scale projects like Northvolt.</p> <p>Citing issues with cashflow, workplace accidents, and problems with subcontractors and machines, he said: \u201cWhat policymakers need to understand is that the Swedish labour market model is in a bad state due to loopholes and excessive subcontracting which undermines Sweden\u2019s ability to build large and advanced industrial projects.\u201d</p> <p>Matti Kataja, Northvolt\u2019s communication and public affairs director for the Nordics, said: \u201cWe are focusing all energy and investments into our core business \u2013 large-scale manufacturing of battery cells. Success in the ramp-up of production at our factory Northvolt Ett in northern Sweden is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations. Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path.\u201d</p> <p>But, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that we are involved in a financing round. In the past couple of weeks, we have seen significant progress. We hope we will be able to share more information as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The company, he said, was \u201ctaking what we believe are the necessary measures to maintain our position as the leading homegrown cell manufacturer in Europe\u201d and was \u201ccommitted to its founding intention of establishing a European industrial base for battery production\u201d.</p>",

Nevertheless, critics suggest the crisis at Northvolt is a \u201charsh awakening\u201d for Sweden\u2019s green transition plans and the EU\u2019s green deal. \u201cNorthvolt has more than 60bn kronor (\u00a34bn) in debt, is making huge losses, and can\u2019t ramp up its production,\u201d said Christian Sandstr\u00f6m, an associate professor and a columnist for the business paper Aff\u00e4rsv\u00e4rlden. \u201cAny new funds will only go to creditors at this point. The only way to resolve this is via bankruptcy.\u201d The company, he believes, could file for bankruptcy \u201cany day now\u201d. It did not bode well for the multitude of green businesses that had opened in the north of Sweden in recent years, Sandstr\u00f6m said. \u201cHanding out cheap government money to capitalists who say they will save the world by setting up factories in the rural north where there\u2019s a lack of skilled labour \u2013 maybe it wasn\u2019t such a great idea after all.\u201d The Swedish government recently announced the launch of a \u201cgreen acceleration office\u201d and proposals to shorten the time it took for businesses to get a permit. \u201cSweden has enormous potential in the climate transition,\u201d said Kristersson. But some have accused the government of naivety. Jonas Algers, a PhD student at Lund University\u2019s environmental and energy systems studies department, said: \u201cEveryone likes the idea of a slick startup with a charismatic CEO and fancy PowerPoints revolutionising a sector. \u201cBut at the end of the day, if you want to build a massive, largest-in-Europe plant it will require lots of workers who need to be coordinated, lots of construction that needs to be done in a safe manner, and skills and technology that need to be developed. None of this is a simple task.\u201d H2 Green Steel, in Boden, northern Sweden, had learned from Northvolt\u2019s mistakes, Algers said, but there were issues in the Swedish labour market for large-scale projects like Northvolt. Citing issues with cashflow, workplace accidents, and problems with subcontractors and machines, he said: \u201cWhat policymakers need to understand is that the Swedish labour market model is in a bad state due to loopholes and excessive subcontracting which undermines Sweden\u2019s ability to build large and advanced industrial projects.\u201d Matti Kataja, Northvolt\u2019s communication and public affairs director for the Nordics, said: \u201cWe are focusing all energy and investments into our core business \u2013 large-scale manufacturing of battery cells. Success in the ramp-up of production at our factory Northvolt Ett in northern Sweden is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations. Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path.\u201d But, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that we are involved in a financing round. In the past couple of weeks, we have seen significant progress. We hope we will be able to share more information as soon as possible.\u201d The company, he said, was \u201ctaking what we believe are the necessary measures to maintain our position as the leading homegrown cell manufacturer in Europe\u201d and was \u201ccommitted to its founding intention of establishing a European industrial base for battery production\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Four men have been jailed for taking part in \u201cdystopian\u201d mob violence that engulfed a Leeds suburb after rumours spread about the treatment of four children who were taken into care. A judge said the disorder in Harehills on 18 July was \u201ca chilling example of how a violent, anarchic mob can, with astonishing ease, achieve a situation of complete lawlessness\u201d. Leeds crown court heard on Tuesday that the violence stemmed from rumours that Roma children were being mistreated by the authorities. During the disorder a double-decker bus was stopped by a crowd and set alight, forcing the driver and passengers to flee. Missiles were also thrown and a police car overturned. Three men involved in the bus fire were jailed after pleading guilty to aggravated arson and violent disorder. Iustin Dobre, 37, and Mark Mitchell, 34, were jailed for six years, and Milan Zamostny, 30, was jailed for five years and four months. Celan Palaghia, 21, was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to arson and violent disorder. The prosecutor Richard Holland said the disorder had grown out of a reaction to four children being taken into care. He said police were called to help social services at around 5pm when a group gathered outside a house and started \u201cshouting and growing disorderly\u201d. The crowd continued to grow and police \u201cwere forced to withdraw\u201d after becoming outnumbered and targeted by missiles. Attempts were made to enlist the help of a Roma councillor to calm the rising tension, but by 6.30pm between 300 and 400 people were on the street, the court heard. Holland said the bus was stopped by the crowd and the driver and passengers were forced to flee as the vehicle \u201csuccumbed to the growing mob surrounding it\u201d. The court heard the cost of the damage to the bus was around \u00a3500,000 and the driver had been out of the business since the \u201ctraumatic\u201d incident for mental health reasons. None of the four defendants, who appeared via videolink from prison, were involved in the initial incident, but all joined in the violence that ensued. Paul Addison, representing Dobre, a father of three, said he had been \u201cdrawn into the disorder\u201d after hearing rumours \u201cthat some children from the Roma community had been maltreated by the authorities and the police\u201d. He said Dobre \u201csaw others acting violently and joined in\u201d but that he accepted he had \u201cacted in a deplorable, violent way\u201d and \u201capologises to the community in Harehills, of which he is a member, for bringing deep shame and discredit upon them\u201d. Statements from residents described concerns about the bus exploding, while one person described \u201cseeing women and children outside the mosque wailing with fear in their eyes\u201d. Addressing the defendants, Judge Bayliss said: \u201cWhat happened that summer evening serves as a chilling example of how a violent, anarchic mob can, with astonishing ease, achieve a situation of complete lawlessness. \u201cIt also offers a dystopian vision of what can happen when the rule of law is subverted by mob violence.\u201d After the sentencing Tracy Brabin, the mayor of West Yorkshire, said the \u201cchaos\u201d had been caused by a mindless minority. \u201cI saw first-hand the impact that this violent disorder had on the community, and I am pleased that justice has now been served.\u201d",

Famous old clubs crowd the summit, a handful of points cover the top 10 \u2013 and in this leviathan format, every point and every game matters. Truly, the Championship is the gift that keeps on giving \u2013 and even the division\u2019s stragglers can have hope. This time last year, Russell Martin\u2019s Southampton were 15th in the second tier, and look at them now, eh? Eh? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/30/bournemouth-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Oh</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Bigger Cup continues on Tuesday, with Celtic and Aston Villa among the teams enjoying the dizzying view from atop the new 36-team skyscraper of a league table. Even a 5-1 win couldn\u2019t put poor Brendan Rodgers top of the tree, though, as habitual Big Cup bullies Bayern Munich boosted their goal difference with a 9-2 evisceration of Dinamo Zagreb, who were ruthlessly punished for trying to fight back from 3-0 down at the Allianz Arena. The Croatian champions are experiencing the unique embarrassment of being 36th in a league table (scroll for yourself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague/table\">here</a>), down in the depths below Paul Jewell\u2019s Derby County, the 2024 Chicago White Sox and Jemini.</p> <p>Much like the brutalised henchmen in Austin Powers [there\u2019s a topical reference \u2013 Football Daily Ed], Dinamo\u2019s struggles since Matchday One show there are real consequences to Bigger Cup cartoon beatdowns. Their manager, Sergej Jakirovic, vowed to \u201csolve things myself\u201d in the aftermath, before chief suit Velimir Zajec (once of Portsmouth) solved things for him. Having lost twice before the trip to Bayern, Dinamo were then gubbed 4-1 by the league\u2019s bottom club, Slaven Belupo. With Niko Kovac saying thanks, but no thanks, to taking over, Dinamo have turned to former manager Nenad Bjelica, who oversaw a 4-0 Big Cup win over Atalanta back in 2019.</p> <p>Bjelica begins with a home tie against Monaco \u2013 who beat Barcelona in their first match, for crying out loud \u2013 but the fixture list, and a format that makes pre-Christmas elimination almost impossible, offers hope. Their home tie with Slovan Bratislava on 5 November might be the first-ever Bigger Cup six-pointer. Slovan, somehow allowed to continue in the tournament despite losing 5-1 to Celtic, have scored 12 goals in three domestic games since, but have Manchester City rolling into town in second gear later. As for one-time Big Cup hoisters Feyenoord, down in 35th, they face a trip to Girona that a) must be described by law as \u201ctricky\u201d, and b) is technically the easiest game of their eight-match slate, statistically the toughest in Bigger Cup this season. Young Boys (currently 11th in the Swiss league) have the kindest schedule, which may not be much consolation as they head to Bar\u00e7a. \u201cWe won\u2019t mark Lamine Yamal individually, we will try to control him as a team,\u201d blathered manager Patrick Rahmen.

      "bodyText": "The Australian federal police (AFP) is investigating after prohibited symbols of Hezbollah \u2013 a designated terrorist organisation \u2013 were displayed at the weekend. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, wants parliament urgently recalled to debate new anti-terror laws. \u201cI find it completely unacceptable that the government wouldn\u2019t be arresting people already or cancelling visas of people who are glorifying Hezbollah and Hamas and others,\u201d he told Brisbane radio 4BC. The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, accused him of wanting \u201cto raise the temperature\u201d, and said the visas of anyone who incited discord should be revoked (but no one is sure if anyone involved is here on a visa anyway). What\u2019s going on, and what might happen next? What happened? The crisis in the Middle East has been escalating rapidly. The ongoing rallies in support of Gaza have expanded to include support for Lebanon, where Israeli retaliations for Hezbollah attacks have killed more than 1,000 people and wounded 6,000 more in the past two weeks, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry. On the weekend, a small group joined a Melbourne rally waving Hezbollah flags and carrying pictures of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli attack last week. AAP described the group as \u201cgatecrashing\u201d the existing protest. Victoria police have identified six possible criminal incidents, and referred the incidents involved to the AFP for investigation. NSW police are also investigating incidents from the weekend. What is Hezbollah? Hezbollah is an Islamist movement, founded by Iran, that is part of Lebanon\u2019s political system. Hezbollah and Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, have in common their enmity with Israel, and their positions as proxy forces for Iran. Australia designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation in 2021, meaning the government at the time listed the militant group under Australia\u2019s criminal code. That listing, determined by the attorney general and reviewed by the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, brings into play a range of offences including being a member of, recruiting for, or providing support to the organisation. About one in three Lebanese in Lebanon trust Hezbollah, according to an Arab Barometer survey this year. What laws are protesters with Hezbollah symbols accused of breaking? The states and territories have a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of hate symbol laws, says Keiran Hardy, a counter-terrorism law expert at Griffith University, but most of them are not relevant here. While most states have introduced laws against hate symbols, they are all about Nazi symbolism and gestures. Only Queensland has broader vilification laws that could be used against a wider range of symbols. As Hardy explains, most of these laws \u201caren\u2019t relevant in this case\u201d \u2013 so the focus is on \u201cthe federal offence of displaying a terrorist symbol\u201d. But, he adds, it is not as simple as just arresting someone for waving a symbol in public. There are additional criteria including \u201cwhether the person is inciting hatred against a group or advocating violence against a group or likely to insult, intimidate or humiliate (someone) on the basis of race, religion or ethnicity\u201d. Krissy Barrett, the AFP\u2019s deputy commissioner for national security, told ABC Radio National on Tuesday that \u201cthere are a number of elements in the legislation that need to be met for a successful prosecution\u201d. She said a successful prosecution needs to prove a symbol is a terrorist organisation\u2019s, and that a \u201creasonable person would consider that the conduct \u2026 advocates inciting others to use violence or use force, [or] could incite others to humiliate, intimidate based on race or religion\u201d. What\u2019s driving the conversation now? A lot of Sturm und Drang, accompanied by calls for cooler heads to prevail. Dutton said on Monday that the \u201cglorification of a terrorist leader \u2026 surely must be against the Australian law\u201d. But as discussed, it\u2019s not that easy. To be clear: the government itself cannot arrest people and Australia would be a very different nation if it could. Visa cancellations are another thing, because much can be done under ministerial discretion. Asked on ABC Radio National on Tuesday if any visas had been cancelled since the weekend, Burke said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether people there are actually on visas, or people who end up being of concern to the authorities are on visas. \u201cI was simply asked within my portfolio whether [these were] actions that I would take,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do have a higher standard in Australia if you\u2019re on a visa as to what\u2019s expected. If you\u2019re on a visa in anyone\u2019s country, you\u2019re there as a guest \u2026 inciting discord is a reason for me to refuse visas and a reason for me to cancel visas.\u201d Pro-Palestine rally organisers in Sydney on Tuesday meanwhile urged protesters to avoid bringing \u201cany flags or symbols which support groups which have been proscribed as illegal under Australian law\u201d to this week\u2019s protests. Do we need new laws? Dutton said parliament should be recalled to debate new laws if current laws did not apply. \u201cI believe that there are provisions within the existing law. If there\u2019s not, the prime minister should recall parliament and deal with whatever deficiency there is in the law,\u201d he said. He reportedly wrote to the AFP demanding urgent action and said it was up to the government to direct police. Hardy, however, says this raises a \u201cseparation of powers issue\u201d. \u201cThe legislature makes the laws and it\u2019s up to police to enforce them. It\u2019s not appropriate for a member of parliament to tell police how to do their job,\u201d he says. \u201cThey made these laws and they need to see how it plays out, but that doesn\u2019t mean interfering with or influencing prosecutorial decisions to charge someone.\u201d He warns that even the perception of influence could damage the community\u2019s trust in institutions. Any changes made to the law could not apply retrospectively, he says \u2013 adding that \u201cthe best laws are never going to be made on an urgent timescale\u201d.",

The extension of unprotection orders on private land and adjacent public land within 3km across eastern Victoria was welcomed by the Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF), which called it \u201ca common sense move\u201d. The president of VFF, Emma Germano, said the move provided greater certainty regarding control measures for farmers in eastern Victoria, although those in the north-west were \u201cstill exposed to the horrors inflicted\u201d and hoping to \u201creach a workable solution\u201d. \u201cThe stories I\u2019ve been hearing from local farmers in that area [are] tragic,\u201d she said.

The Taungurung Land and Waters Council, traditional owners for Country covering much of central Victoria, were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the government\u2019s support for the continued killing of dingo, known as yirrangan in Taungurung language. \u201cYirrangan and Taungurung people have coexisted harmoniously for millennia, and share the same story; driven from Country, managed, and at times murdered according to colonial views,\u201d a statement from the council said. Matthew Shanks, Taungurung council\u2019s executive manager of biocultural landscapes, said yirrangan were vital to the health and future of Taungurung Country. The council called on the state government to \u201cimmediately lift the unprotection order across all of Victoria\u201d, a position shared by more than 20 First Nations groups around Australia. A spokesperson for Victoria\u2019s environment department said it was \u201cstriking the right balance\u201d between protecting vulnerable dingo populations and giving farmers the ability to protect livestock, and was providing an additional $2m investment into nonlethal dingo controls and population research. Prof Euan Ritchie, a Deakin University ecologist who has been researching dingoes since 2008, said the decision raised questions about the long-term survival of the culturally and ecologically significant species in Victoria. \u201cAside from people, they\u2019re the only large, land-based predator that we have.

Not only was Victoria\u2019s north-west dingo population \u201churtling towards extinction\u201d, but Ritchie said there was evidence of declining numbers and genetic diversity in the rest of the state.

Documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show how the independent statistics agency scrambled to ditch its plans within a weekend after a delayed final decision by the government.

Despite senior ministers initially defending the decision as necessary to avoid \u201cdivisive\u201d debates and to focus on the cost-of-living crisis, the government agreed to reintroduce two questions on sexual orientation and gender identity a fortnight later.

A trove of documents was tabled in the Senate in September revealing Leigh approved the new census questions in mid-July only to verbally reverse the decision on 13 August \u2013 a move reportedly due to an overruling by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. In a ministerial brief handed to Leigh\u2019s office by the ABS, the assistant minister verbally informed the chief statistician, David Gruen, on 13 August of his change in decision. The brief was signed off by Leigh on Friday 23 August \u2013 two days after it was due to be actioned. In 2023, the ABS issued a statement of regret over the distress felt by the LGBTQ+ community over being left out of censuses, acknowledging a lack of questions about gender identity, sexual characteristics or orientation \u201cmeant that they felt invisible and excluded\u201d. The ABS had warned Leigh in a submission on 16 August there was a risk that dropping the proposed new questions \u201cwill mean those feelings are repeated for the 2026 census\u201d. \u201cThere is a risk to the successful delivery of the census if there is public criticism and campaigning while the census is under way,\u201d the submission said. \u201cThe ABS expects a strong negative reaction from the LGBTIQ+ community and supportive members of the public. This could reduce the census response rate and quality of the data collected, and draw criticism of the ABS and government.\u201d An Albanese government spokesperson told Guardian Australia last month \u201cthe government sets census topics\u201d. \u201cThe ABS came to the government with potential changes it planned to trial, including changes it had not recommended for the 2026 census. The government paused the process to get it right,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAssistant minister Leigh advised on 8 September the government would set a new topic of \u2018sexual orientation and gender\u2019 for the 2026 census.\u201d",

Recent survey data has confirmed slowing selling price expectations from businesses. This is mainly because of weak demand as the same surveys indicate that growth is slowing from an already modest pace in the second quarter. Since the summer, concerns about inflation have made way for concerns about economic growth.</p> <p>As the ECB seems quite convinced that inflation is on track towards 2%, the question is now how fast it wants to move interest rates back to neutral. If it keeps interest rates restrictive for too long with the economy already slowing, it risks pushing inflation below its 2% target. With growth under pressure now, it seems that the door is open for the ECB to move faster. While it does not seem like a done deal, it does bring the October meeting into play for a possible step up in easing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-66fbc3bd8f089f53122993b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-01T09:59:00.051Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oil price falls to three-week low despite rising Middle East tensions</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The oil price is falling today, which could keep European inflation pegged lower.</strong></p> <p>Brent crude has dropped by 1.75% so far today to $70.44 per barrel, the lowest in almost three weeks, despite rising tensions in the Middle East today.</p> <p>Oil appears to be being pulled lower by the prospect of increased supplies, with the Opec+ group set to increase output in December.</p> <p>Fears that slowing economic growth would hit demand for energy have also pushed the oil price lower.</p> <p>This has helped oil traders overlook the news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-ground-operation-war-latest\">Israel has launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-ground-operation-war-latest\">Israeli military says it is carrying out \u2018limited\u2019 ground operation targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Joshua Mahony,</strong> analyst at <strong>Scope</strong> <strong>Markets</strong>, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With OPEC reconvening once again this week, there is a fear that we are set for a fresh reminder of the worsening supply situation in the event that the group raise production in December as planned.</p> <p>Recent rumours have been circulating that Saudi Arabia want to reestablish their position by taking back market share from the US, and thus markets will be watching closely for any indication of future output.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Worries about this month\u2019s budget, and the Middle East crisis, have hit confidence across UK manufacturing last month. The oil price has jumped following a warning from a US official that Iran is \u201cpreparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel\u201d. Inflation across the eurozone has fallen below the official 2% target for the first time in three years, sparking speculation that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates again this month. Some of the busiest ports in the US were braced for crippling disruption after about 45,000 port workers represented by the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA) began walking off the job after their contracts expired at midnight. The Horizon IT scandal inquiry has heard that there could be a repeat unless the so-called \u201cuntouchable\u201d investigators and executives involved in the prosecution of subpostmasters not fired before the organisation rolls out its new IT system. UK domestic energy costs have jumped 10% as the new price cap kicks in. Prices in UK shops are falling at the fastest rate since 2021 despite an increase in fresh food inflation as wet weather hit UK production while the cost of olive oil and sugary snacks continues to be affected by the climate crisis. If it goes ahead, Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on Israel could be as big or potentially bigger than the one in April, a US official has told Reuters. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that Iran appeared to be preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel. In April, Iran launched hundreds of drones as well as cruise missiles towards Israel, in the Islamic Republic\u2019s first ever direct attack on the Jewish state. But the attack, mostly launched from inside Iran, caused only modest damage in Israel as most were shot down with the help of the US, Britain and Jordan. European oil and gas stocks have jumped by more than 1%, following the warning that Iran is preparing to launch an \u201cimminent\u201d ballistic missile attack on Israel. Financial shares are weaker, though, with the European bank stocks index down 2% and on track for its biggest daily drop in eight weeks. The oil price has now firmly shaken off its earlier losses, and pushed higher, following reports that the US believes that Iran is \u201cpreparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel\u201d. Associated Press has reported that a senior U.S. administration official has said Iran is preparing to \u201cimminently\u201d launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel, and warned Tuesday of \u201csevere consequences\u201d should it take place. AP reports: The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the intelligence, said the U.S. is actively supporting Israeli defensive preparations. This comes after the Israeli military on Tuesday warned people to evacuate nearly two dozen Lebanese border communities hours after announcing what it said were limited ground operations against Hezbollah. White House officials did not immediately offer any evidence backing its intelligence finding. The official added that the administration was confident in the determination. Iran\u2019s state media has not suggested any attack is imminent. Iranian officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Iran already launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April, but few of the Iranian projectiles reached their targets. Many were shot down by a U.S.-led coalition, while others apparently failed at launch or crashed while in flight. Even those that reached Israel appeared to miss their marks, experts and an AP analysis in September showed. Our liveblog has full coverage of the crisis: Brent crude, which had been down over 1% earlier, briefly below $70/barrel, is now up over 2.6% at $73.61 per barrel. The US dollar, a classic safe-haven asset, is also rallying, as are government bonds. Airline shares are now falling, while shares in weapons maker BAE Systems are up 2.5%. Sky News are reporting that Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is drawing up plans for a visit to China early next year. They say the trip would include resuming a key financial services trade summit for the first time since 2019. As Sky point out, it would be Reeves\u2019 first trip to China since Labour\u2019s general election victory, at a time when Britain is weighing up whether it should follow the EU and US by also imposing tariffs on electric vehicle imports from China. A government spokesperson said: \u201cLast week, the chancellor spoke with vice premier He Lifeng to discuss enhancing economic and financial cooperation and communication. \u201cThey agreed to take forward discussions on timings and areas that could be covered in future engagement.\u201d UK-China relations have deteriorated in recent years, following Beijing\u2019s crackdown on democratic freedoms in Hong Kong, concerns about human rights abuses against the Uyghur community in Xinjiang and national security worries about Chinese involvement in UK critical infrastructure. The Middle East conflict won\u2019t hit global oil market, one of the world\u2019s biggest oil traders has claimed. Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00f6rnqvist, the CEO of Gunvor Group, has said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that the escalating conflict would not have \u201cany impact at all on oil supply\u201d. T\u00f6rnqvist told the Gulf Intelligence Energy: \u201cI\u2019m very confident that this will not have any impact at all on oil supply. \u201cWe have a situation around the Red Sea, Yemen, but by and large it\u2019s more like a nuisance, but not really disruptive in any way. T\u00f6rnqvist also flagged that the market was more worried about weak demand. Back in the markets, the oil price has now recovered from its earlier losses, with Brent crude now flat at $72.31 per barrel. Despite recent falls in UK business confidence, City firm Columbia Threadneedle has predicted the pound will recover to its highest level since the 2016 Brexit vote. Bloomberg reports that Steven Bell, Columbia Threadneedle\u2019s chief EMEA economist, has predicted that sterling will move toward $1.50 next year. The forecast is based on the prospect that the UK will have comparatively high interest rates, as the Bank of England is more cautious about cutting borrowing costs due to inflation fears. Bloomberg explain: Bell\u2019s prediction implies the pound stands to strengthen almost 13% from its current level around $1.33, already near the highest in two and a half years. The UK currency is the best-performer in the G-10 this year, advancing nearly 5% versus the greenback. Bell shrugged off concerns that the tax hikes and austerity measures expected in the UK budget at the end of the month will derail the pound\u2019s gains. With higher taxes likely centered around capital gains, their impact on demand will be limited and are unlikely to shake consumer confidence, he said. On the night of the EU referendum eight years ago, the pond briefly touched $1.50, before plunging to $1.32, and then to $1.20 by January 2017. After the mini-budget two years ago, it briefly hit an alltime low of $1.038. The former chair of the Post Office has warned of another Horizon-style scandal if the s0-called \u201cuntouchable\u201d investigators and executives involved in the prosecution of subpostmasters are not fired before the organisation rolls out its new IT system. Henry Staunton, who was sacked by the former business secretary Kemi Badenoch in January, told the inquiry into the scandal on Tuesday that there remains millions of pounds still in dispute between what subpostmasters have recorded and what the Post Office has in their records. Staunton said that before the replacement for the Horizon system is implemented in the future, which itself is full of bugs and has seen projected costs double to more than \u00a3800m, the Post Office must deal with staff involved in wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters. \u201cThis is not something that relates to the past, it is something that relates to the future,\u201d he said: \u201cBefore we implement [the new] Horizon we will be doing a path-clearing exercise. There are millions of pounds in dispute between postmasters and what is on their records and what is in the Post Office account.\u201d The inquiry has previously heard about the so-called \u201cuntouchables\u201d within the organisation, a phrase attributed to outgoing chief executive Nick Read, referring to a group of Post Office investigators who would never face disciplinary action relating to the Horizon IT scandal. Saf Ismail, one of two subpostmasters who sit on the current board of the Post Office, has also referred to a \u201cred\u201d list of 23 other employees deemed high-risk given their involvement in the scandal in one way or other, none of whom who have even been suspended. \u201cThere are these people called the \u2018Untouchables\u2019 in the investigations team, or \u2018reds\u2019 or whatever,\u201d said Staunton. He explained: \u201c[They were] Involved with all the issues in the past of finding postmasters guilty. I am very afraid if [subpostmasters] are investigated [after the new IT system is implemented] by the so-called untouchables we could have another debacle - not to the same extent - but we could have hundreds of subpostmasters having to pay out monies. This is a big issue going forward, the involvement of the untouchables.\u201d Staunton said that Read, who is due to appear at the inquiry for three days next week, had used the phrase \u201cUntouchables\u201d to him in a private conversation. He added that Read also used the phrase in a meeting with all of the Post Office\u2019s non-executive directors. Asked by counsel for the inquiry what exactly he understood an \u201cUntouchable\u201d employee was, Staunton said: \u201cThey are people that were involved in prosecuting postmasters previously and are still in their roles,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd therefore would be involved in any future investigations. [They were] classified under various colours, the same as so-called reds, and would be involved in future investigations. And that seems utterly wrong.\u201d There are 48 people employed in the investigations team, the inquiry heard, although how many of them are considered \u201cUntouchables\u201d is unknown. Here\u2019s a list of the 17 Dobbies garden centres that are to close (see earlier post): Larger stores Altrincham, Greater Manchester Antrim, Northern Ireland Gloucester, Gloucestershire Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Harlestone Heath, Northamptonshire Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire Inverness, Scotland King\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk Pennine, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire Reading, Berkshire Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire Little Dobbies Cheltenham, Gloucestershire Chiswick, Greater London Clifton , Bristol Richmond, Greater London Stockbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland Westbourne Grove, Greater London Dawn has broken at ports on the East Coast of the US, where around 45,000 workers began a strike at midnight last night. Dockworkers at 36 ports from Maine to Texas hit picket lines early this morning, in a dispute over wages and automation. Here\u2019s the scene: The pre-market drop in Boeing\u2019s shares today also follows news that more than 40 foreign operators of 737 airplanes may be using planes with rudder components that may pose safety risks. The warning came from the US National Transportation Safety Board, which last week issued urgent safety recommendations about the potential for a jammed rudder control system on some Boeing 737 airplanes after a February incident involving a United flight. The NTSB also disclosed on Monday that it had learned that two foreign operators suffered similar incidents in 2019 involving rollout guidance actuators. \u201cWe are concerned of the possibility that other airlines are unaware of the presence of these actuators on their 737 airplanes,\u201d NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said Monday in a letter to Federal Aviation Administration chief Mike Whitaker. Investment bank Peel Hunt has said finance deals activity has slowed in recent weeks, amid uncertainty around the upcoming autumn Budget and the US election. In a trading statement this morning, Peel Hunt said: Market activity has slowed again in recent weeks ahead of the upcoming Budget and US election. Consequently, despite better first half revenues, we expect full year performance to be in line with market expectations and we remain well positioned across all parts of our business to take advantage of increased activity when market confidence returns. Inflation is no longer of concern in the euro area. So declares analysts at Nomura this morning, after consumer price inflation fell below the ECB\u2019s 2% target. They predict that euro area disinflation will continue in earnest during this and next year. Nomura told clients: Part of the rationale for expecting underlying momentum in inflationary pressures to continue abating is based on our expectation of weak domestic demand. We believe the consumer-led recovery that many forecasters expect is increasingly unlikely to happen (the Bloomberg consensus expects consumer spending growth of 1.4% y-o-y by the end of 2025, we expect half that). Consumers have less available cash than prior to the pandemic, real wage growth is slowing more sharply than expected, and consumption confidence remains notably weak. Garden centre group Dobbies is to shut 17 stores, in a move which will hit 465 jobs, PA Media reports. Dobbies Garden Centres said the proposed closures are part of a restructuring plan to help return the business to profit and reduce its rent bill. The plan, which will need approval by creditors, will see the firm shut 11 larger Dobbies sites and six little Dobbies by the end of the year. Sites will continue to operate as normal until the restructuring process is given the green light. Mothercare has suspended trading in its shares as the maternity and babywear brand has been forced to delay publication of its annual accounts while it attempts to finalise a refinancing package. The group, which no longer has its own stores in the UK \u2013 only outlets in Boots stores \u2013 but trades from more than 500 stores and 50 websites run by franchise partners across 32 countries, said it was unable to publish its annual results by a deadline of 30 September but expected to do so \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d. The company said it was looking to raise funds from the sale of \u201ccertain IP assets\u201d, likely to include some brand names, as well as talking to its lender. Mothercare, which is listed on London\u2019s Aim junior stock market, has been attempting to renegotiate the terms of a lending facility to reduce costs for at least a year. The group, which was once a stalwart of UK high streets before it shut all stores in the country in 2019, has seen its share price has slump more than 50% in the past year to just 3.4p, valuing it at just \u00a320m. In a previous statement issued in May, the company said the loan had reached \u00a319.7m, up from \u00a319.5m last September, on which it was paying 19.2% interest and which would require waivers on lending terms given poor sales in its key middle east market which now accounts for nearly half the group\u2019s sales. The company said in May it was also looking at financing alternatives to including offering lenders a stake in the business. On Tuesday it added: \u201cthe challenges facing our Middle Eastern operations\u201d remained \u201cbroadly unchanged\u201d. Over at the Horizon IT Inquiry, the former chair of the Post Office has said that there was no interest at all in the exoneration of postmasters, and that the organisation and the government \u201cdragged their feet\u201d making compensation payments. Henry Staunton, who was sacked by the former business secretary Kemi Badenoch in January, said that his first impression upon taking up the role in late 2022 was that there wasn\u2019t an acceptance among management of the conclusions of damning High Court judgements that the Post Office had been wrong to pursue prosecutions. \u201cThey didn\u2019t fully accept it, that was my impression, that somehow the case hadn\u2019t been put well or whatever,\u201d said Staunton, giving testimony at the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal on Tuesday. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a feeling that this was absolutely wrong, [what] had happened. It was a feeling across the piece with the team.\u201d He also said that from his first meeting it was obvious that the Horizon IT system was \u201ccompletely and utterly unreliable\u201d. Staunton, who has accused the last government of wanting to delay payments to postmasters until after the general election, said that his second takeaway when he started was that there was \u201cNo appetite at all for exoneration.Those were the two things that came through strongly to me\u201d. He described the Post Office\u2019s investigations department as \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cquite brutal\u201d in the way they dealt with subpostmasters. Staunton said that he was shocked at the attitude of the remediation process designed to evaluate and compensate postmasters. He cited examples including a reluctance to \u201cpause\u201d subpostmasters having to repay money while they were being evaluated in the scheme as that might result in more subpostmasters coming forward to join the scheme. \u201cWhat surprised me was we shouldn\u2019t not be doing something because it would generate claims,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not the basis the remediation committee should be working. I formed a view over a period of months regarding bureaucracy and an unsympathetic and adversarial approach.\u201d This same attitude was taken when a discussion about expanding the scheme relating to a death in the family of a postmaster. He said: \u201cThe view was if we widened the principles we open ourselves up to more claims. That seemed pretty unsympathetic to me. With respect to remediation the government and Post Office were dragging their heels.\u201d Staunton added that one Post Office executive said that the organisation did not owe the same duty of care to subpostmasters as it did to the organisation\u2019s own employees. After all they have been through \u201cwe owed them a greater duty of care compared to our own employees,\u201d Staunton said. Shares in aerospace manufacturer Boeing are down around 0.7% in pre-market trading, following a report that it plans to issue new stock. Bloomberg is reporting that Boeing is considering raising at least $10bn by selling new stock, as the planemaker seeks to replenish cash reserves depleted further by the ongoing strike which began last month. They add: The company is working with advisers to explore its options, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing confidential matters. Raising equity isn\u2019t likely to happen for at least a month, assuming the planemaker can resolve the strike, because Boeing wants a firm grasp of the financial toll from the walkout by 33,000 workers, the people said. Late last week the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said its pay deal talks with Boeing had broken off and that there were no further dates scheduled for negotiations at this time. Over in the US, the White House has said consumers will only feel a limited impact from the port strikes which began at midnight on the East Coast. In a statement, they say: \u201cThe President has directed his team to convey his message directly to both sides that they need to be at the table and negotiating in good faith - fairly and quickly.\u201d The president has also directed his Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to meet every day and prepare to address potential disruptions, the statement added. Recent falls in energy prices could keep eurozone inflation lower than the European Central Bank has forecast, suggests GianLuigi Mandruzzato, senior economist at EFG Asset Management. Following this morning\u2019s drop in eurozone inflation to 1.8%, Mandruzzato says: The fall of inflation below 2% year on year (yoy) for the first time in more than three years opens room for the ECB to cut rates again on October 17. The September flash estimates of 1.8% yoy for the headline and 2.7% yoy for core inflation mean that both of them were lower for the quarter than the ECB projected three weeks ago. Furthermore, the lower starting point for the fourth quarter and developments in energy prices point to a much lower inflation in the next few months than the ECB expected, further supporting the case for cutting rates sooner rather than later. Yet, services inflation at 4% yoy remains too high for comfort and warrants a gradual recalibration of monetary policy in the euro area. The drop in inflation last month could help to shift the European Central Bank\u2019s focus onto the lacklustre growth environment in the eurozone, rather than price pressures. ING economist Bert Colijn says: The ECB knew that this inflation print would come in weak as President Christine Lagarde mentioned at the September press conference but it still came in a tad weaker than most analysts had expected. While a bounce back in the fourth quarter has been expected, the question is to what extent this can materialise as petrol prices have been dropping quickly on the back of falling oil prices. With core inflation slowly dropping at this point, it looks like the 2% target in the medium term is achievable. Recent survey data has confirmed slowing selling price expectations from businesses. This is mainly because of weak demand as the same surveys indicate that growth is slowing from an already modest pace in the second quarter. Since the summer, concerns about inflation have made way for concerns about economic growth. As the ECB seems quite convinced that inflation is on track towards 2%, the question is now how fast it wants to move interest rates back to neutral. If it keeps interest rates restrictive for too long with the economy already slowing, it risks pushing inflation below its 2% target. With growth under pressure now, it seems that the door is open for the ECB to move faster. While it does not seem like a done deal, it does bring the October meeting into play for a possible step up in easing. The oil price is falling today, which could keep European inflation pegged lower. Brent crude has dropped by 1.75% so far today to $70.44 per barrel, the lowest in almost three weeks, despite rising tensions in the Middle East today. Oil appears to be being pulled lower by the prospect of increased supplies, with the Opec+ group set to increase output in December. Fears that slowing economic growth would hit demand for energy have also pushed the oil price lower. This has helped oil traders overlook the news that Israel has launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. Joshua Mahony, analyst at Scope Markets, says: With OPEC reconvening once again this week, there is a fear that we are set for a fresh reminder of the worsening supply situation in the event that the group raise production in December as planned. Recent rumours have been circulating that Saudi Arabia want to reestablish their position by taking back market share from the US, and thus markets will be watching closely for any indication of future output. For markets, the continued weakness seen in energy markets does help depress inflation expectations, although traders will also be wary of the reflection this has on global economic activity. Core inflation is running above the ECB\u2019s 2% inflation target, though. The core CPI rate, which strips out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, dropped to 2.7% in September from 2.8% in August, Eurostat reports today. Michael Field, European market strategist at Morningstar, says: \u201cCore inflation, the measure that strips out volatile components such as fuel and food, also fell by 0.1% to 2.7%. Granted, this number remains materially higher than the 2% targeted inflation level, however, it is at least moving in the right direction. \u201cWith inflation seemingly settling at or around where we need it to be and unemployment stable, the ECB should be reaffirmed in its course of action. Expectations of one more cut before the end of 2024 are very achievable, given the data.\u201d Inflation across the eurozone has fallen below the official 2% target for the first time in three years, which may prompt further cuts to eurozone interest rates later this month. Statistics body Eurostat estimates that annual inflation across the euro area was 1.8% in September 2024, down from 2.2% in August. That\u2019s the lowest reading for eurozone inflation since spring 2021, and the first time since June 2021 that CPI inflation has been below the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target. Price rises eased thanks to a drop in energy costs. Energy inflation was -6% in the year to September (meaning costs were lower than a year ago). Services inflation slowed to 4% from 4.1% in August, while food, alcohol &amp; tobacco inflation rose to 2.4% from 2.3%. Goods price inflation was unchanged at 0.4%. Natasha May, global market analyst at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says today\u2019s data \u201cpaves the way\u201d for another ECB rate cut this month. While a decline in headline inflation was widely expected, the fall was accompanied by early signs of easing price pressures in services. Alongside recently weaker activity data \u2013 which implies weaker longer-term inflation \u2013 this makes the case for speedier policy normalisation. \u201cMore broadly, the eurozone rebound anticipated in early 2024 has turned out to be quite tepid. Consumers were expected to gain confidence from real income gains, driving a pick-up in spending. But confidence remains somewhat depressed and the manufacturing sector still looks very weak, raising the risk of inflation undershooting the ECB\u2019s 2% target in the medium term. Today\u2019s release should give the ECB more confidence that shorter-term price pressures are normalising, and therefore that interest rates should be normalised faster too.\u201d The ECB has cut interest rates twice this year, in June and September; it\u2019s next monetary policy meeting is 17 October. UK manufacturers also reported that their new export orders fell last month. Subdued market conditions in Europe were the main factor weighing on overseas demand, with France and Germany the principal concerns. Lower demand from US clients was also cited. Newsflash: Worries about this month\u2019s budget, and the Middle East crisis, have hit confidence across UK manufacturing last month. Data provider S&amp;P Global has reported that business confidence among factory bosses fell to a nine-month low last month, and at the fastest pace since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the UK four and a half years ago. They say that the autumn budget led to a \u201cwait-and-see approach\u201d to decision making, with production and new business slowing last month. [That fits with this morning\u2019s warning from the Institute of Directors that bosses are gloomier, following the warnings that Rachel Reeves\u2019s first budget will be tough]. Although output and new order growth eased, S&amp;P\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI has remained in growth territory at 51.5, down from August\u2019s 26-month high of 52.5. That suggests there was a \u201csolid expansion\u201d in the UK manufacturing sector last month. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence says: \u201cThe UK manufacturing sector is still expanding at a solid, albeit slightly slower, pace. Output rose for the fifth successive month in September, underpinned by a resilient domestic market. However, manufacturers have become more nervous about the outlook, suggesting that the current spell of impressive growth is fading, with business optimism about the year-ahead slumping to a nine-month low. The extent of the drop in confidence was striking, beaten only by that seen in March 2020 prior to COVID lockdowns. Uncertainty about the direction of government policy ahead of the coming Autumn Budget was a clear cause of the loss of confidence, especially given recent gloomy messaging, though firms are also worried about wider global geopolitical issues and economic growth risks. The PMI survey has also showed that input cost inflation accelerated to a 20-month high last month, which led manufacturers to further push up their selling prices. Dobson explains: Freight cost rises are a big factor underlying the resurgence in the price measures, as supply chains continue to feel the strain of the Red Sea crisis and global conflicts.\u201d More takeover drama, this time in the UK, where handbag maker Mulberry has rejected an \u00a383m takeover proposal from Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group. Mulberry has slapped down Ashley\u2019s offer, insisting instead that it would push on with a planned fundraising to support a turnaround. The luxury brand said it had considered the approach carefully and consulted its 56.1% majority shareholder Challice, controlled by the Singaporean entrepreneur Christina Ong, who had \u201cno interest\u201d in pursuing the possible offer. Frasers, which owns Sports Direct, Evans Cycles, the House of Fraser department stores and multiple other retail brands from Slazenger to Jack Wills, has a 36.8% stake in Mulberry. On Monday, it said it was making an offer for the rest of the company worth 130p a share, pitting itself against its rival large shareholder. The Mulberry board said on Tuesday it believed the recent appointment of Andrea Baldo as chief executive, along with the emergency \u00a310.75m share placing announced late on Friday, \u201cprovides the company with a solid platform to execute a turnaround\u201d. \u201cIn light of this, the board has concluded that the possible offer does not recognise the company\u2019s substantial future potential value. In addition, the board has been informed that Challice is supportive of the company\u2019s strategy.\u201d Frasers has been given a \u201cput up or shut up\u201d deadline of 5pm on 28 October to announce a firm intention to make an offer for Mulberry, or walk away. Factory production across the eurozone has shrunk at the fastest pace so far this year, according to the latest poll of purchasing managers. Production, new orders, employment and procurement activity all fell at a faster rate last month, data firm S&amp;P Global had reported. This pulled its eurozone manufacturing PMI index down to 45.0 in September, from August\u2019s 45.8, but slightly higher than the \u2018flash\u2019 reading last week. That\u2019s a nine-month low, and further below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. The eurozone was dragged down by its two largest members; Germany recorded the worst decline in factory conditions for 12 months, while France\u2019s manufacturing also contracted. Spain, though, recorded its fastest growth in four months. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, says: \u201cIt is a real shame that Spain is only the fourth-largest economy in the eurozone. While handling the global manufacturing downturn surprisingly well, Spain just does not have enough weight to lift the rest of the eurozone with it. The worsening industrial slump in Germany, for example, is too big for Spain\u2019s momentum in September to make much of a difference. According to our nowcast model, eurozone industrial production will likely drop by around 1% in the third quarter compared to the last one. With incoming orders plummeting fast, we can expect another dip in production by year-end. UK business leaders are growing more pessimistic about the prospects for the economy, the Institute of Directors (IoD) has warned. The IoD Directors\u2019 Economic Confidence Index, released this morning, has fallen to -38 points for September, down from -12 in August. That\u2019s the lowest reading since December 2022, when the UK economy was recovering from the shock of the mini-budget. Business leader confidence in their own organisations also fell from to +23 in August to +15 in September, having already dropped from +36 in July. Bosses are reining in their investment plans, the IoD reports, and trimming their recruitment plans. Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cBusiness confidence and investment expectations both took a further and larger dive in September. IoD members cite ongoing concerns over likely tax increases, the cost of workers\u2019 rights, international competitiveness, broader cost pressures and the general outlook for UK economic growth. \u201cThere are a number of policy announcements forthcoming which could help foster a more supportive environment for growth and investment, and underpin an improvement in business confidence. In the next few weeks we expect to see more detail on industrial strategy, the business tax roadmap and a likely update to the fiscal rules to better recognise the contribution of public sector investment to the UK\u2019s asset base. These all have the potential to create a more steady environment for business decision-makers in the UK.\u201d The IoD\u2019s survey follows similar recent polls which have shown a drop in both consumer and business confidence, following warnings that the budget later this month will include tax rises. There\u2019s takeover drama in Germany this morning. Abu Dhabi state oil giant ADNOC has agreed to buy German chemicals producer Covestro in a \u20ac14.7bn deal. It\u2019s one of the biggest foreign takeovers by a Gulf state, as ADNOC tries to transform itself into a fully integrated energy company. Over in the US, dockworkers on the East Coast and Gulf Coast have begun a strike that will disrupt about half the country\u2019s ocean shipping. The port workers\u2019 first large-scale stoppage in nearly 50 years began after negotiations for a new work contract broke down over the issue of wages. The strike blocks everything from food to automobile shipments across dozens of ports from Maine to Texas, in a disruption analysts warned will cost the economy billions of dollars a day, threaten jobs, and stoke inflation. Workers began picketing at the port of Philadelphia shortly after midnight, the Associated Press reported, walking in a circle at a rail crossing outside the port and chanting, \u201cNo work without a fair contract.\u201d The port of Virginia also confirmed the work stoppage. More here. Bakery chain Greggs has revealed that its costs are rising more slowly than it expected. In a trading update today, Greggs says that it now expects the overall level of cost inflation for 2024 to be towards the lower end of the 4-5% range which it had previously expected. Greggs adds that: Whilst acknowledging ongoing economic uncertainty, the Board expects the full year outcome to be in line with its previous expectations. Greggs has reported that total sales rose by 10.6% in the last quarter, to the end of September, a slowdown on the 12.7% sales growth during 2024 so far. Greggs also reports that its autumn menu is now available, including an All-Day Breakfast Baguette and Mexican Bean &amp; Spicy Cheese Flatbread. It adds: We\u2019ve also introduced a Pumpkin Spice Doughnut to our sweet range, complementing the return of our seasonal drinks range including the Pumpkin Spice Latte and Salted Caramel Latte which are both also available as part of our over ice range. There is some relief for households, though \u2013 shop prices are falling at the fastest rate in three years. Despite an increase in food inflation, overall prices in the shops fell by 0.6% in the year to September, twice as fast as the 0.3% deflation recorded in August, according to the British Retail Consortium. Non-food prices were 2.1% cheaper than a year ago, while food inflation rose to 2.3% in September, up from 2.0% in August. Helen Dickinson OBE, chief executive of the BRC, says: \u201cSeptember was a good month for bargain hunters as big discounts and fierce competition pushed shop prices further into deflation. Shop Price inflation is now at its lowest level in over three years, with monthly prices dropping in seven of the last nine months. This was driven by non-food, with Furniture and Clothing showing the biggest drops in inflation as retailers tried to entice shoppers back. Food inflation edged up slightly as poor harvests in key producing regions led to higher prices for cooking oils and sugary products. \u201cEasing price inflation will certainly be welcomed by consumers, but ongoing geopolitical tensions, climate change, and government-imposed regulatory costs could all reverse this trend Deflation means prices are lower than they were a year ago. But, of course, while the rate of price changes is negative, the level of prices is still much higher than before the surge of inflation began in 2021. Today\u2019s energy price cap rise comes as the company responsible for keeping Great Britain\u2019s lights on has returned to public ownership for the first time in over thirty years as it prepares to make the electricity system 95% carbon-free by 2030. Ownership of the electricity system operator has transferred from National Grid to the government to form a new National Energy System Operator (Neso) from today. The new publicly owned organisation, which will be responsible for Great Britain\u2019s electricity and gas systems, is expected to map a route towards the government\u2019s green energy goals. The government hopes that by bringing together gas and electricity under one publicly owned company, the new system operator can adopt a more strategic approach to achieving a clean power system by 2030. Neso\u2019s chief executive, Fintan Slye, told the Observer that its roadmap would stop short of the Labour party\u2019s pre-election pledge to create a \u201czero carbon electricity system\u201d by 2030 in favour of a clean power target which is 95% free of carbon emissions. He said: \u201cThat means that by 2030 95% of the generation in Great Britain over the period of a year will be from clean power sources. And that means that the remaining 5% will come from unabated gas.\u201d. Slye said the \u201chugely ambitious\u201d target to create a clean power system by 2030 would require Britain \u201cto do everything that we can do quicker - but also very, very differently as well\u201d. Its roadmap towards 2030 is expected to include advice on reforming the regulation around planning and consenting and speeding up the grid connections process. Neso is also expected to work alongside GB Energy, a public company set up by the Labour government to invest in low-carbon energy, to help connect new generation projects with the electricity grid. The decision to remove the ESO from National Grid\u2019s ownership was made under the previous Conservative government because of concerns over a conflict of interest relating to the operator\u2019s role providing strategic advice to government officials. Here\u2019s our profile of Slye, from last weekend\u2019s Observer: The boss of Ovo Energy has called for sweeping changes to the UK\u2019s energy bills system so they are subsidised for poorer households, as consumers face another rise in fuel costs this winter. Chief executive David Buttress told the PA news agency the Government should introduce a social tariff, something which is already used in the telecoms industry to help people who receive benefits like Universal Credit pay their broadband bills. The measure, which campaign groups have proposed for several years, would likely take the form of a targeted discount energy deal for poorer customers, and could be below the price of the cheapest available standard energy tariff. Buttress said: \u201cA social tariff would allow us to address the cost of energy for the poorest in our communities in a way that means, collectively, we could give them the protection they need to get through the winter months.\u201d The Resolution Foundation is warning today that 7.7 million households in England \u2013 including the majority of families with children \u2013 are at risk of \u201cfuel stress\u201d this winter. Their analysis of government data found that 37% of all households faced \u201cfuel stress\u201d, defined as families needing to spend more than 10% of their income on heating their homes excluding housing costs. It found that 77% of single-parent households are likely to experience \u201cfuel stress\u201d this winter, highlighting the impact of today\u2019s increase in the energy price cap. Alex Clegg, economist at the Resolution Foundation, says this shows how poorly targeted Winter Fuel Payments are, and why alternative support will be needed this winter. Clegg adds: \u201cCouples with children are more than twice as likely to experience fuel stress as pensioner households, so any new support should not be limited to pensioners. Reforming and expanding Cold Weather Payments offers a viable quick-fix solution to help keep households warm when the mercury drops this winter. \u201cLooking beyond this winter, the Government should prioritise developing a social tariff and investing in energy efficiency for our homes. This would help to ensure that vulnerable families are insulated from future energy shocks, whatever their age or circumstances.\u201d More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It\u2019s October, which means the nights are drawing in, the temperature is dropping, and arguments can begin about when to turn the heating on. But flicking the boiler on has just become more expensive, adding to the burden on millions of households as winter approaches. Average energy bills across Great Britain have just risen by \u00a3149 a year today, as the latest energy price cap kicks in. The cap, set each quarter by regulator Ofgem based on the wholesale price of energy, has just risen by 10% to \u00a31,717 a year for an average dual-fuel household in Great Britain paying by direct debit. That\u2019s an increase of almost \u00a3150 per year compared with the cap in April-June, based on the energy use for a typical household. And while the cap is lower than the \u00a32,500 at which the last government froze maximum bills at the height of the energy crisis, it\u2019s still sharply higher than in autumn 2021, when average bills were capped at \u00a31,277 a year. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation is warning today that poorer families are already struggling to cope. JRF research has found that, back in May, 2.9 million low-income households had been unable to keep their home warm in the previous six months, while 4.3 million had fallen behind with their household bills. Katie Schmuecker, principal policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says: \u201cToday\u2019s energy price cap rise looms over families who are forced to heat their homes less than they should. It is more than three years since energy prices started to rise, creating an unacceptable level of prolonged hardship for millions of families who are still paying well above what they were before the cost-of-living crisis started. This looks like another winter of sleeping in a coat, not showering, and only cooking once a week, to try to keep the bills down. \u201cFamilies who already can\u2019t pay their energy bills can no longer count on cost-of-living payments to provide any relief. We need to see an urgent plan for hardship at the upcoming Budget to stop those with the least going hungry and cold this winter.\u201d Yesterday, a seperate survey warned that almost half of British adults will ration their energy use this winter.

      "bodyText": "Dobbies is planning to shut 17 of its 77 stores, affecting 465 jobs, as its new owners try to return the garden centre group to profitability. The company, which employs 3,600 workers, said it was seeking the approval of creditors for a restructuring plan that would reduce its rent bill. The closures by the end of the year include 11 unprofitable large garden centres and all six of its \u201clittle Dobbies\u201d high street sites, while the company said it was seeking rent reductions at a further nine sites. The changes come amid a difficult year for garden centres with a cold, wet spring affecting trade at what is usually the busiest time of the year. The high cost of essentials, including heating bills, rents and mortgages, has also prompted households to rein in spending on treats and expensive items such as new fences, patios or garden furniture. Garden centres enjoyed a boom during the Covid pandemic when entertaining alfresco helped families and friends stay in touch while socially distancing to avoid infection.

Dobbies was bought last year by the investment firm Ares Management and fell to a \u00a3105.2m pre-tax loss in the year to March 2023, against a \u00a37m loss a year earlier, according to its most recently filed accounts. The company said: \u201cThe restructuring plan, and other strategic initiatives, are expected to return Dobbies to sustainable profitability through site rationalisations, rent reductions and other tangible cost savings, securing its long-term future and allowing access to future investment. \u201cThereafter, Dobbies will operate 60 stores and continue to play a key role in the market, working constructively with stakeholders and suppliers, and having an active and committed role in the communities in which it\u2019s based.\u201d Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said the closures showed \u201cthe stark reality of how difficult it is for retailers at the moment\u201d, adding: \u201cThere is also a strong message for the chancellor as she prepares for the autumn statement on 30 October \u2013 high streets and independent retailers need support now.\u201d The garden centres closing this year Altrincham Antrim Gloucester Gosforth Harlestone Heath Huntingdon Inverness King\u2019s Lynn Pennine Reading Stratford-upon-Avon The Little Dobbies high street stores closing Cheltenham Chiswick Clifton Richmond upon Thames Stockbridge Westbourne Grove, London",

John Gibbs told a public inquiry that doctors received \u201cvery firm pushback\u201d from senior nurses when they raised growing suspicions about Letby in early 2016. Gibbs, the first of Letby\u2019s colleagues to give evidence to the Thirlwall inquiry, said the response from nursing managers made it \u201cmore difficult\u201d for consultants to demand action or contact the police. He told Lady Justice Thirlwall on Tuesday: \u201cI do deeply regret and I am ashamed that I failed to protect the babies from harm by Letby but I do understand that the parents concerned would probably rather have explanations rather than belated apologies.\u201d Letby, 34, was sentenced to 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted across two trials of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others at the Countess of Chester hospital in north-west England.

Another tabletop rat-maze maquette depicts a basement at CalArts, where he studied, a sub-level divided into empty room after empty room. The parts he couldn\u2019t recall are lined with pink crystals. Why pink? \u201cRegardless of meaningless, exterior coloration, it\u2019s all pink inside,\u201d Kelley wrote. Yrrrghhh. There\u2019s a sealed plain metal room built into the plywood model, towering over one end of it, which, we are told, is fitted with shelving units holding various phallic objects \u201cReferencing UFO abduction stories in which aliens probe humans with similar devices\u201d.</p> <p>Kelley plays with popular culture and the abject, his deft, dramatic sense (how much to conceal, how much to reveal) and knowing how far to go \u2013 then going further \u2013 and his painful evocations of his own past add up to something more than the autobiographical. His art may be quintessentially American, but is also about what is shared more generally. He could make bed-sheet ghosts and cotton-wool ectoplasm genuinely frightening, not least because they invoke dark and sinister traits. \u201cA ghost is someone who disappears,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAn empty concept. A spirit is a memory \u2026 is what remains.\u201d It is impossible to read Kelley\u2019s work without sensing the persistence of that spirit.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/mike-kelley-ghost-and-spirit?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=CAMP_mike_kelley&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwu-63BhC9ARIsAMMTLXQ-V6rqO4FfhE2S8C-r3Hq41lk6pmxJOC06fKTaO5D2Aw30WYvx5uoaAiSZEALw_wcB\">At Tate Modern, London from 3 October to 9 March</a></p></li> </ul>",

Another tabletop rat-maze maquette depicts a basement at CalArts, where he studied, a sub-level divided into empty room after empty room. The parts he couldn\u2019t recall are lined with pink crystals. Why pink? \u201cRegardless of meaningless, exterior coloration, it\u2019s all pink inside,\u201d Kelley wrote. Yrrrghhh. There\u2019s a sealed plain metal room built into the plywood model, towering over one end of it, which, we are told, is fitted with shelving units holding various phallic objects \u201cReferencing UFO abduction stories in which aliens probe humans with similar devices\u201d. Kelley plays with popular culture and the abject, his deft, dramatic sense (how much to conceal, how much to reveal) and knowing how far to go \u2013 then going further \u2013 and his painful evocations of his own past add up to something more than the autobiographical. His art may be quintessentially American, but is also about what is shared more generally. He could make bed-sheet ghosts and cotton-wool ectoplasm genuinely frightening, not least because they invoke dark and sinister traits. \u201cA ghost is someone who disappears,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAn empty concept. A spirit is a memory \u2026 is what remains.\u201d It is impossible to read Kelley\u2019s work without sensing the persistence of that spirit. At Tate Modern, London from 3 October to 9 March",

      "body": "<p>I wake up to the sound of rain pummelling my first-floor window. Feeling groggy after some ill-advised weeknight beers, I roll over with a groan \u2013 it\u2019s only 7 am. As I stare at the ceiling, half illuminated by my laptop\u2019s unholy blue hue, I feel my article deadline looming. With a sigh, I half-heartedly shuffle towards the kitchen, begrudgingly pour myself a coffee and begin another day.</p> <p>This is what it\u2019s like to play Apartment Story, a The Sims-esque narrative thriller about a British games journalist called Arthur. It\u2019s not often that a video game makes me feel jarringly seen, but this was <em>exactly</em> my experience as I sat at my real-world desk, peering into a cramped virtual flat, commanding protagonist Arthur to shave, wash his hands, write, and cook himself an uninspiring dinner. It\u2019s the antithesis of your typical gaming power fantasy, an adult-themed, voyeuristic life simulator \u2013 and it\u2019s entrancing.</p> <p>The creation of Glaswegian solo developer, Sean Wenham, this film-length, replayable thriller depicts shut-in Arthur\u2019s lonely life as he becomes entangled in a rapidly escalating situation. The thriller element left me feeling nonplussed. Instead it was watching Arthur dance, go for a piss, and nosily peer into his absent flatmate\u2019s room that made me want to return for a second playthrough.

      "bodyText": "I wake up to the sound of rain pummelling my first-floor window. Feeling groggy after some ill-advised weeknight beers, I roll over with a groan \u2013 it\u2019s only 7 am. As I stare at the ceiling, half illuminated by my laptop\u2019s unholy blue hue, I feel my article deadline looming. With a sigh, I half-heartedly shuffle towards the kitchen, begrudgingly pour myself a coffee and begin another day. This is what it\u2019s like to play Apartment Story, a The Sims-esque narrative thriller about a British games journalist called Arthur. It\u2019s not often that a video game makes me feel jarringly seen, but this was exactly my experience as I sat at my real-world desk, peering into a cramped virtual flat, commanding protagonist Arthur to shave, wash his hands, write, and cook himself an uninspiring dinner. It\u2019s the antithesis of your typical gaming power fantasy, an adult-themed, voyeuristic life simulator \u2013 and it\u2019s entrancing. The creation of Glaswegian solo developer, Sean Wenham, this film-length, replayable thriller depicts shut-in Arthur\u2019s lonely life as he becomes entangled in a rapidly escalating situation. The thriller element left me feeling nonplussed. Instead it was watching Arthur dance, go for a piss, and nosily peer into his absent flatmate\u2019s room that made me want to return for a second playthrough. This is an eerily well-observed, grown-up twist on the idea of the life sim. Meters keep you aware of Arthur\u2019s basic needs \u2013 one for hunger, another for tiredness, another for hygiene, and so on. I found a perverse joy in embracing the monotony of his existence.

Although, they probably weren\u2019t emophiliacs \u2026 Eh? Doesn\u2019t it have something to do with blood not clotting properly? I can see how it could be confusing, particularly for cockneys and other H-droppers. But no, that\u2019s haemophilia. This is emophilia. Does it have to do with 00s alternative rock? Closer. It\u2019s about love. Oh good. It may not be good. You know the people who repeatedly fall in love, and say they\u2019ve found \u201cthe one\u201d, before immediately splitting up and starting the cycle all over again with someone else? That\u2019s emophilia. Says who? Dr Daniel Jones, associate professor of psychology at the University of Nevada. He came up with the term. What would someone who was highly emophiliac be like? They would repeatedly \u201cseek the rush of romantic emotions, immediate romantic connections and the rapid development of romantic love,\u201d says Jones. \u201cDoctor Jones, Jones, calling Doctor Jones \u2026\u201d Oh my God, that awful song by 90s (very un-emo) Scandi dance-pop group Aqua! No, nothing at all to do with that. Though it did begin: \u201cSometimes the feelin\u2019 is right / You fall in love for the first time.\u201d To be fair, I think it was (nominally) about Indiana Jones.

Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected. \u201cClearly this attack will be unsettling for the whole academy and the wider community, and we will be working with police to provide reassurance and whatever support we can. We would urge anyone with information about what has happened to contact the police.\u201d The police said anyone who witnessed the incident, or who had information that could help should call 101 with the ref CAD 4987/30 Sept.

That move means that there are several hundred fewer properties now available to low-income and in-need Springfield residents.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair at all that the Haitian community has been targeted as a reason for rising rents,\u201d says Davis.</p> <p>Conversations with several Haitian workers, legal representatives and community leaders in Springfield found that <a href=\"https://www.firstdiversity.com/\">First Diversity Staffing</a>, a temporary staffing agency, has played a key role in securing employment for Haitian and other immigrant laborers from Central America to work at distribution facilities, warehouses and farms in the Springfield area.</p> <p>All the while, a company called <a href=\"https://www.bizapedia.com/oh/ten-enterprises-llc.html\">Ten Enterprises</a>, whose registered agent is a person named George Ten, has been buying up dozens of properties in and around south Springfield, where the majority of the city\u2019s Haitian population lives. George Ten is also the CEO of First Diversity Staffing.</p> <p>All 48 properties owned by Ten Enterprises \u2013 typically smaller and older residential homes \u2013 were purchased since 2021, coinciding with the height of the Haitian immigration wave to Springfield.

      "bodyText": "For John, living in a room in a shared house without even a door for privacy was what he found himself dealing with when he first arrived in Ohio four years ago. \u201cI was afraid to tell my wife, who was still in Florida at the time,\u201d John says. \u201cWhen I spoke to her on the phone, I closed the video so she wouldn\u2019t see what it was like.\u201d John, who did not want to give his real name out of fear of the consequences, paid $50 a week for a room in a house that was also home to a family of Haitians and others who came and went regularly. Living in substandard conditions, especially for recent arrivals to Springfield, is a common, if little talked about, experience among the Haitian community. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen things like no heat or hot water in winter; issues with leaking roofs and walls collapsing; multiple families renting rooms in a larger home; dangerous water and electrical configurations \u2013 things that could cause a serious fire,\u201d says Ryan Davis, a staff attorney at Advocates for Basic Legal Equality (Able), a non-profit law firm. Even as Haitians in Springfield struggle with poor housing arrangements, the community has been blamed by many longtime residents and sections of the national media alike for causing rents to increase across working-class parts of the city. But reports and research suggest that hard-charging landlords and property companies rather than immigrants may be responsible for the rising cost of housing. Reuters has reported that the number of affordable housing vouchers fell in recent years in Springfield, as landlords moved away from offering their properties to tenants through government support programs and into market-based rents, where greater profits can be made. That move means that there are several hundred fewer properties now available to low-income and in-need Springfield residents. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair at all that the Haitian community has been targeted as a reason for rising rents,\u201d says Davis. Conversations with several Haitian workers, legal representatives and community leaders in Springfield found that First Diversity Staffing, a temporary staffing agency, has played a key role in securing employment for Haitian and other immigrant laborers from Central America to work at distribution facilities, warehouses and farms in the Springfield area. All the while, a company called Ten Enterprises, whose registered agent is a person named George Ten, has been buying up dozens of properties in and around south Springfield, where the majority of the city\u2019s Haitian population lives. George Ten is also the CEO of First Diversity Staffing. All 48 properties owned by Ten Enterprises \u2013 typically smaller and older residential homes \u2013 were purchased since 2021, coinciding with the height of the Haitian immigration wave to Springfield. By March of that year, a USA Today report found that Springfield had the fifth \u201chottest\u201d housing market in the US, despite having a median home price of just $145,000. While owning a large number of properties is perfectly legal, and landlords say renovating and renting out houses contributes to the city\u2019s tax base, many Springfield residents have taken to public forums to ask that property companies help contribute to the increased costs associated with managing an influx of new residents. Emails and phone calls to First Diversity Staffing, asking if it is providing financial or other support to local schools and healthcare centers left to deal with the fallout of a major population increase, were not answered. Ten Enterprises isn\u2019t alone. Garlind Properties owns 324 homes or parcels in Clark county. About 260 of those properties were purchased since 2019 and many of its tenants, according to a New York Times report, are believed to be Haitian immigrants. A member of the Haitian community who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the housing issue says Garlind Properties is infamous for overcharging Haitians for housing. The company also has a number of negative reviews posted online calling out the poor standard of its properties. Voicemails left with a phone number associated with Garlind Properties were not responded to. Aside from housing issues, immigrants are also facing challenging employment conditions. When companies such as Amazon, Dole Fresh Vegetables and Topre, a Japanese auto parts manufacturer, struggled to find labor in the aftermath of the pandemic, temporary staffing agencies found hundreds of Haitian workers to fill the gaps. But that created insecurities for Haitians, too. \u201cThe biggest issue we see with the temp agencies is that \u2013 and it\u2019s not illegal, unfortunately \u2013 workers are not given benefits, they\u2019re not given time off,\u201d says Katie Kersh, a senior attorney at Able. \u201cIt\u2019s just much harder for people who are trying to build lives. It prevents them from having a lot of things they need to get ahead.\u201d A Dole Fresh Vegetables representative didn\u2019t directly answer the Guardian\u2019s questions asking if the company was assisting the Springfield community in handling its growing population, instead saying: \u201cAt Dole we care for and support all of our employees and communities.\u201d Despite the challenges in housing and employment, some changes are taking shape. Last year, the city of Springfield established a rental property registry to keep tabs on negligent landlords and ensure that properties were up to livable standards. What\u2019s more, this year the building of about 1,200 housing units in a west Springfield suburb was announced in a move city authorities believe would ease the pressure on housing supplies. However, single-family homes in the development are expected to start at $300,000, a price that\u2019s out of reach for many Springfield residents, where the median household income is about $45,000. Since the bleak early days of life in Springfield, John\u2019s accommodation status has since taken an upward trajectory. Today, he owns his own home and has become a realtor, though the memory of the first months in Ohio hasn\u2019t left him, especially as he sees so many others demeaned and singled out for being in the same situation today. \u201cThe houses on this side of Springfield were really bad,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are afraid about this situation.\u201d",

The dramatically named Evil Corp group had an unusually close relationship with the Russian state, said the NCA. The UK\u2019s most senior law enforcement agency said in a briefing published on Tuesday: \u201cEvil Corp held a privileged position, and the relationship between the Russian state and this cybercriminal group went far beyond the typical state-criminal relationship of protection, payoffs and racketeering.\u201d The group, which operated out of locations in Moscow including a pair of cafes, carried out cyber-attacks and espionage operations against undisclosed Nato countries before 2019 \u2013 alongside its day-to-day criminal activities such as deploying ransomware. However, when the group was put under sanctions and some of its members indicted by the US in 2019 it turned to the father-in-law of Evil Corp\u2019s founder for protection. The NCA said Eduard Benderskiy, the father-in-law of Evil Corp\u2019s leader, Maksim Yakubets, was a former high-ranking official in a unit of Russia\u2019s domestic spy agency, the FSB, and used his connections to protect the group after the US moved against it. \u201cBenderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by internal Russian authorities,\u201d said the NCA. The NCA briefing describes Evil Corp as a family-centred operation akin to a traditional organised crime gang, with Yakubets joined by his father, brother and cousins in the business. The group\u2019s influence has declined since 2019, when authorities released pictures to illustrate Yakubets\u2019s multimillionaire lifestyle, including a camouflaged Lamborghini and a personalised registration plate that spelled out \u201cthief\u201d. Evil Corp also split with a key member around this time and since then it has developed new strains of ransomware, a malicious form of software that is used to lock up targets\u2019 computer systems \u2013 which can then be decrypted in exchange for a ransom payment, typically demanded in bitcoin. The NCA said Yakubets\u2019s right-hand man, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov \u2013 named by the NCA on Tuesday \u2013 had teamed up with fellow Russian gang LockBit to use its malware in ransomware attacks.

We are committed to improving our services to ensure all passengers have a comfortable and dignified travel experience.\u201d Gardner said the Polish cabin staff on the flight were \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cas helpful as they could be\u201d. In 2017, Gardner was left on an easyJet flight when it landed at Gatwick airport. He was stranded again in 2022 after he had flown back to the UK with Iberia Express.",

      "body": "<p>If you are in need of a modern romcom that makes you bark with laughter and leaves you embarrassingly gooey inside, do yourself a favour: cancel your plans and binge Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/26/nobody-wants-this-review-kristen-bell-and-adam-brodys-joyous-romcom-is-as-funny-as-when-harry-met-sally\">Nobody Wants This</a>.</p> <p>Based on the writer Erin Foster\u2019s experiences, it follows a new relationship between an outspoken sex podcaster, Joanne (Kristen Bell), and a weed-smoking rabbi, Noah (Adam Brody), which is something neither of their families understand or want. Cue 10 moreish episodes that tell a classic will-they-won\u2019t-they tale \u2013 and, trust me, by the end, you really hope that they will.</p> <p>It has all the vital ingredients: Joanne and Noah fancy the pants off each other from the moment they meet, sparking genuine, fun chemistry, but the obstacle in love\u2019s path \u2013 key for any great romcom \u2013 is that, if he wants to be head rabbi, Noah needs to marry a Jewish woman.</p> <p>That is just for starters. The supporting cast is hilarious. Succession\u2019s Justine Lupe is in her best role yet, stealing each scene as Joanne\u2019s razor-tongued taller sister and podcast co-host, Morgan. There are acerbic observations on dating aplenty: \u201cShe broke her wrist for attention. It was a very high-level move. I respect it,\u201d Joanne says of Noah\u2019s ex. And scenes such as the podcast research trip to a sex shop will have you cackling like a witch brewing a love potion: \u201cGrab the biggest butt plug you can find!\u201d Noah calls to Joanne while waving around a vibrator called The Obliterator. \u201cRabbi Roklov?\u201d asks a synagogue donor who has just walked in.</p>    <p>The biggest gift, though, is Brody, in his most lovable role since capturing millennial teen hearts as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/12/revisiting-the-oc-the-glossy-teen-show-had-a-huge-cultural-impact-and-its-still-kind-of-perfect\">Seth Cohen in The OC</a>. Hello, Hot Rabbi!</p> <p>\u201cYou call him Hot Rabbi? Oh my God, that makes me so proud,\u201d Joanne says to a group of teenage girls at a camp. One admits she pretended to choke so that he would perform CPR. \u201cGenius,\u201d nods Joanne.</p> <p>It\u2019s understandable. Hot Rabbi makes great pasta. He calls a hotel to make sure there are two robes in the bathroom, because Joanne really wants them to be matching on their first trip away. He is honest about his emotions. He is funny (even Morgan agrees). He is the right amount of daft (\u201cThe thing about nipples is that when it\u2019s cold, you\u2019d think they\u2019d go in instead of out\u201d). He is rich.

      "bodyText": "If you are in need of a modern romcom that makes you bark with laughter and leaves you embarrassingly gooey inside, do yourself a favour: cancel your plans and binge Netflix\u2019s Nobody Wants This. Based on the writer Erin Foster\u2019s experiences, it follows a new relationship between an outspoken sex podcaster, Joanne (Kristen Bell), and a weed-smoking rabbi, Noah (Adam Brody), which is something neither of their families understand or want. Cue 10 moreish episodes that tell a classic will-they-won\u2019t-they tale \u2013 and, trust me, by the end, you really hope that they will. It has all the vital ingredients: Joanne and Noah fancy the pants off each other from the moment they meet, sparking genuine, fun chemistry, but the obstacle in love\u2019s path \u2013 key for any great romcom \u2013 is that, if he wants to be head rabbi, Noah needs to marry a Jewish woman. That is just for starters. The supporting cast is hilarious. Succession\u2019s Justine Lupe is in her best role yet, stealing each scene as Joanne\u2019s razor-tongued taller sister and podcast co-host, Morgan. There are acerbic observations on dating aplenty: \u201cShe broke her wrist for attention. It was a very high-level move. I respect it,\u201d Joanne says of Noah\u2019s ex. And scenes such as the podcast research trip to a sex shop will have you cackling like a witch brewing a love potion: \u201cGrab the biggest butt plug you can find!\u201d Noah calls to Joanne while waving around a vibrator called The Obliterator. \u201cRabbi Roklov?\u201d asks a synagogue donor who has just walked in. The biggest gift, though, is Brody, in his most lovable role since capturing millennial teen hearts as Seth Cohen in The OC. Hello, Hot Rabbi! \u201cYou call him Hot Rabbi? Oh my God, that makes me so proud,\u201d Joanne says to a group of teenage girls at a camp. One admits she pretended to choke so that he would perform CPR. \u201cGenius,\u201d nods Joanne. It\u2019s understandable. Hot Rabbi makes great pasta. He calls a hotel to make sure there are two robes in the bathroom, because Joanne really wants them to be matching on their first trip away. He is honest about his emotions. He is funny (even Morgan agrees). He is the right amount of daft (\u201cThe thing about nipples is that when it\u2019s cold, you\u2019d think they\u2019d go in instead of out\u201d). He is rich. He has a nice little beard. He isn\u2019t scared of butt plugs. He is nice without being too nice (he is delighted to learn that Mr Goldberg from the sex shop was with a woman who wasn\u2019t his wife). He is in a basketball team he named the Matzah Ballers. He even manages to reverse the ick (\u201cYou can self-sabotage all you want, but I think you should get over it,\u201d he tells Joanne, who is disgusted by his \u201csport coat\u201d). He is basically Seth Cohen, but better. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna have a romcom with a rabbi, you gotta make him hot,\u201d Foster has said. \u201cNo one I\u2019ve ever met has ever known a hot rabbi. I think that there should be more hot rabbis. And so I just wanted to give Jewish girls the thing they deserve, which is a hot rabbi to look up to.\u201d On casting Brody as a character based on her husband, she added: \u201cMy husband is someone who can\u2019t make you feel bad; like, it\u2019s not possible. He just shines this sweetness and goodness and makes people feel seen, and makes you laugh, and I was trying to capture that feeling to pair him with this cynical character \u2026 Adam was the only one who had that purity about him.\u201d Brody\u2019s response to it all? \u201cRabbis have not been sexually objectified enough and I\u2019m trying to do my part,\u201d he deadpanned at a screening. Of course, Hot Rabbi isn\u2019t the first holy man to make TV audiences swoon. Andrew Scott\u2019s Hot Priest walked in Fleabag so that Brody\u2019s Hot Rabbi could run, but special mentions should also go to Sidney Chambers, James Norton\u2019s crime-solving vicar in Grantchester, and Friar Fuck (Costas Mandylor) in Sex and the City.

      "bodyText": "The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has indicated Liam Lawson has an opportunity to make his case to replace Sergio P\u00e9rez and line up alongside Max Verstappen for the team, potentially as early as next season. Horner said they dropped Daniel Ricciardo for Lawson at their sister team RB, because the Australian had failed to prove he was in good enough form to step up, leading the team to give the young New Zealander a chance for the rest of this season. Ricciardo, who had a successful stint with Red Bull between 2014 and 2018, had been placed at RB with a view to proving he was up to speed and ready to replace P\u00e9rez should the Mexican\u2019s poor form continue. However, while P\u00e9rez remains well off the pace, Red Bull did not believe Ricciardo had done enough to warrant replacing him, so Horner opted to look to new young talent to potentially step up. The 22-year-old Lawson was the Red Bull reserve driver and will join RB, alongside Yuki Tsunoda, for the final six rounds of this season, beginning at the US Grand Prix on 20 October. Speaking to the F1 Nation podcast Horner explained why the team chose Lawson, in an indication that P\u00e9rez is now on his last chance with the team. \u201cAll the drivers are under pressure to deliver but the reason why Daniel was in that car was to get himself back into a position to ultimately be there to pick up the pieces if Checo [P\u00e9rez] didn\u2019t deliver,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need answers for the bigger picture in terms of drivers.

      "bodyText": "A coroner has concluded that Gaynor Lord, a 55-year-old woman who went missing after leaving work in Norwich and whose body was recovered from a river a week later, died by misadventure. Lord disappeared after she left her shift at a department store gin counter in Norwich at 2.45pm on 8 December 2023. CCTV footage showed her hurrying through the city before her clothes and belongings were found in a park near the River Wensum. Her body was recovered from the river after a week-long police search during which they consulted officers from Lancashire constabulary who had worked on the search for Nicola Bulley earlier that year. Norfolk\u2019s senior coroner Jacqueline Lake recorded a conclusion of death by misadventure and said she was satisfied Lord had \u201cintended to enter the water but I do find she didn\u2019t intend to die by her actions\u201d. The coroner said Lord\u2019s mental health had been noted as \u201cstable\u201d in January 2023, but \u201cthere was some evidence in the more recent past that she was acting out of character\u201d. Analysis of Lord\u2019s phone showed that on the afternoon of her disappearance, she sent a message saying \u201chelp\u201d to a contact in her phone who had died some time previously. In other messages, Lord wrote that she was \u201cgoing crazy\u201d and \u201ccan feel the fear\u201d, with the coroner saying that in a \u201cstring of messages she said she didn\u2019t know what she was doing\u201d. The coroner said Lord had suffered a large epileptic seizure four days before her disappearance, \u201cher first large seizure for some time\u201d, the inquest heard. She had start hormone replacement therapy for menopause in March 2023. Lord had a previous mental health episode in 2011 when she was taken to hospital after being found in a pub \u201cwaiting for aliens to pick her up or take her away\u201d, her husband, Clive Lord, said. He said that at the time \u201cdoctors were considering sectioning her but they allowed her to come home\u201d, adding: \u201cWe think she screwed up her tablets and had a reaction.\u201d The coroner also cited evidence provided to the inquest that Lord, a mother of three, had recently watched a TV programme about cold water swimming, and talked about it with her husband and a friend. Clive Lord said: \u201cShe\u2019s never done [cold water swimming] herself but I don\u2019t know if in her confused state she may have been thinking about this. I don\u2019t know this for sure \u2013 it\u2019s just me thinking about why she would enter the water.\u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for her to be at Wensum Park.

      "bodyText": "Tim Walz has had a meteoric rise to the national political stage, advancing from state governor to Democratic running mate, bolstering Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential chances, invigorating the party\u2019s base, and re-popularizing the term \u201cweird\u201d along the way. On Tuesday night, the avuncular Minnesota governor will face his next challenge: taking on Ohio senator JD Vance, in a much-anticipated debate in New York. Both men have long sold their experiences of growing up in rural midwest towns as proof that they represent middle America, and both were recruited to augment their parties\u2019 chances in November. With Harris and Trump hailing from large coastal cities, Tuesday\u2019s debate will see which of the small-town vice-presidential candidates can best appeal to the sort of blue-collar workers who could swing the vote in November. So far, Walz seems to be doing the most convincing job. The 60-year-old is more popular among the American public than Harris, Trump or Vance, and has received rousing receptions on the campaign trail, where his rallies and events showcase his ability to act like a regular person. Vance, by contrast, can come across as stiff and awkward, and has managed to alienate large sections of the American public via criticisms of immigrants and women who do not have children. \u201cThe selection of Tim Walz as the vice-presidential nominee was sort of designed to help Kamala Harris reach midwestern voters \u2013 and midwestern white voters in particular.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/how-to-cook-the-perfect----\">Guardian perfectionist Felicity Cloake</a> can often be found scaling recipes when testing for her column: \u201cWhen you\u2019re making six or seven versions of the same thing, sometimes you have to for your own sanity.\u201d Generally speaking, it\u2019s an easy thing to do, too, says Helen Goh, co-author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ottolenghi-comfort-9781785038914/\">Ottolenghi Comfort</a> \u2013 \u201cassuming you didn\u2019t fail maths, or you have a calculator.\u201d But success really depends on what you\u2019re making, of course. \u201cIn baking, for instance, trying to cream a small amount of butter and sugar in a mixer will have the beaters going round and round without making a jot of difference,\u201d Goh says.</p> <p>Pasta sauces, meanwhile, are \u201cfair game\u201d in Cloake\u2019s book, as are most stews and soups. That\u2019s not to say you can simply double the ingredients and be done with it, mind. \u201cSeasoning such as salt, pepper, spices and lemon juice don\u2019t always scale up or down in a neat way,\u201d Goh explains, so her trick is to add them in increments, tasting and adjusting accordingly. </p> <p>Next, consider how the volume of ingredients in the original recipe will impact on the cooking process, Cloake says: \u201cIf you cut down, say, a slow-cooked scrambled egg recipe, unless you have a very small pan, the smaller volume of liquid will get too much exposure to heat, and will dry out and overcook as a result.\u201d</p> <p>Cookware is <em>very</em> important, too. \u201cI found out the hard way recently, when making a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/09/new-york-style-brunch-recipes-dorie-greenspan-salmon-dutch-baby-crostata\">Dutch baby</a> for a bunch of hungry kids,\u201d confesses Goh, who simply doubled the batter but used the same size pan. The result? The batter rose just a quarter of the way up the sides: \u201cIt looked OK initially, but without the surface area to puff up majestically, it pooled in the centre and ended up dense and rubbery.\u201d So if, for example, you want to double a recipe, be sure to double the size of your tray or dish as well, especially if it\u2019s going in the oven. That said, it\u2019s often also best to scale up but cook in batches. Let\u2019s take a stir-fry as an example: \u201cA good one depends on <em>wok hei</em> [literally, \u201cthe breath of the wok\u201d] to impart the essential flavour, aroma and texture,\u201d Goh says, so overcrowding not only lowers the temperature, but also makes ingredients trickier to toss, leading to \u201csteamed rather than al dente vegetables\u201d.</p> <p>Cooking times might also vary, and Cloake\u2019s advice is to trust your instincts: \u201cCheck early, check often.\u201d And if you\u2019re playing around with cakes, it\u2019s going to be trial and error. \u201cA larger amount of batter in the same tin might not cook in the time specified in the original recipe,\u201d Goh says, while a smaller amount will result in overcooked cake. \u201cAdjusting the size of the pan or baking time will help, but there\u2019s no easy formula.\u201d It\u2019s much easier to scale the likes of muffins, says Meliz Berg, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dinner-tonight-9781529924893/\">Dinner Tonight</a>. \u201cIf you\u2019re making six instead of 12, for example, it shouldn\u2019t make a difference, as long as you\u2019re using the same size muffin cases [as in the original recipe].\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, however, leftovers aren\u2019t something to be feared, but embraced. \u201cWe used to live off them when we were children,\u201d Berg says, \u201cand we still do in my house.\u201d Storing made-ahead meals in the fridge or freezer will just make dinners and snacks easier, and can be economical to boot. </p> <ul> <li><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

Cooking times might also vary, and Cloake\u2019s advice is to trust your instincts: \u201cCheck early, check often.\u201d And if you\u2019re playing around with cakes, it\u2019s going to be trial and error. \u201cA larger amount of batter in the same tin might not cook in the time specified in the original recipe,\u201d Goh says, while a smaller amount will result in overcooked cake. \u201cAdjusting the size of the pan or baking time will help, but there\u2019s no easy formula.\u201d It\u2019s much easier to scale the likes of muffins, says Meliz Berg, author of Dinner Tonight. \u201cIf you\u2019re making six instead of 12, for example, it shouldn\u2019t make a difference, as long as you\u2019re using the same size muffin cases [as in the original recipe].\u201d Ultimately, however, leftovers aren\u2019t something to be feared, but embraced. \u201cWe used to live off them when we were children,\u201d Berg says, \u201cand we still do in my house.\u201d Storing made-ahead meals in the fridge or freezer will just make dinners and snacks easier, and can be economical to boot.

Leicester secured a dramatic victory in the match in question \u2013 edging past Exeter with a last-gasp Tommy Reffell try \u2013 but the Tigers are believed to be frustrated at the red card shown to their centre Solomone Kata. The frustration stems from the fact that he will miss five matches after his sending off for a dangerous tackle on Jack Yeandle at Sandy Park despite \u201cshowing obvious signs of concussion\u201d, calling into question whether he should have been on the pitch at the time. Shortly before the tackle, Kata was involved in a collision with his teammate Ollie Chessum as the pair attempted to tackle the Exeter winger Immanuel Feyi-Waboso.

      "body": "<h2>1) Los Angeles Dodgers</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>Shohei Ohtani <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/19/shohei-ohtani-50-50-club-la-dodgers\">became the first player</a> in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a regular season (he finished with 54 home runs and 59 stolen bases) and behind him are former MVPs Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. And behind those hitters is Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, who finished sixth in the National League with 33 home runs. This is an extremely powerful lineup capable of torturing any big league pitching staff.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: The starting rotation, which finished with a 4.57 ERA in the second half of the season and is missing its veteran ace Clayton Kershaw for at least the Division Series. Rookie Japanese hurler Yoshinobu Yamamoto is one of baseball\u2019s most prized young arms, but he missed three months with an injury and has not thrown more than 79 pitches in a game since June.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/pete-rose-dies-mlb-baseball\">Controversial all-time MLB hits leader Pete Rose dies at 83</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Starting pitcher<strong> </strong>Walker Buehler was once expected to succeed Kershaw as the Dodgers\u2019 next great ace. Instead, he had a challenging recovery from Tommy John surgery and struggled to an unsightly 1-6 record with a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts in 2024. If he is unable to rediscover his former self \u2013 the pitcher with two top-10 Cy Young finishes \u2013 then the Dodgers will struggle to make a deep run.</p> <h2>2) New York Yankees</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>Even in a world where the Dodgers lead off a game with three former MVPs, the Yankees\u2019 combination of Aaron Judge and Juan Soto may be the most fearsome one-two punch in all of baseball. Judge just completed a season that evoked prime Barry Bonds (.322/.458/.701 with 58 home runs and 144 RBI) while Soto led the American League in runs scored (128) in his first season in the Bronx.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: After a strong start to the season, outfielder Alex Verdugo had just 12 extra-base hits in the second half of the season. The fans will clamor for hyper-talented youngster Jasson Dom\u00ednguez to replace the veteran, but Dom\u00ednguez has just 100 plate appearances in his MLB career.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Relief pitcher Luke Weaver seized the closer\u2019s job from ground-ball specialist Clay Holmes in September and finished the month with a 1.50 ERA, four saves and 25 strikeouts in 12 innings. Every team wants a dominant relief pitcher entering the postseason, and Weaver has stabilized what was a struggling New York bullpen.</p>    <h2>3) Philadelphia Phillies</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>The Phillies are probably the deepest and most balanced team in MLB. Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper are two of the game\u2019s most powerful and disciplined hitters while $300m shortstop Trea Turner is one of the most dynamic speed-power threats in the game. Starting pitcher Zack Wheeler is an established ace: he was one of four pitchers to throw 200 innings this season, tied for third in baseball with 224 strikeouts and finished second in the National League with a 2.57 ERA.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: There aren\u2019t many. If any of their starting pitchers struggle, then the middle of the bullpen may be one of the weaker units of the playoff teams. But the back end is top-shelf.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Left fielder Brandon Marsh anchors the bottom of this potent lineup with strong defense, an excellent eye and good speed. In a lineup full of sluggers like Schwarber, Harper, Turner and Nick Castellanos, Marsh is a secret weapon who likes to tire out opposing pitchers.</p> <h2>4) Cleveland Guardians</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>Cleveland\u2019s elite bullpen features four pitchers who appeared in at least 74 games and finished the season with an ERA under 2.00. Closer Emmanuel Clase was arguably the most dominant pitcher in baseball all season, finishing with 47 saves and a 0.61 ERA. On offense, Josh Naylor provides a nice power complement to Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez, who will likely finish in the top-five for AL MVP.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Like a couple of other teams in the playoffs (Los Angeles and Detroit), the Guardians are heavily reliant on their bullpen and are inclined to lift their starting pitchers fairly early in games. The bullpen often works as early as the fifth or sixth inning.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Ram\u00edrez was one long ball short of becoming the seventh player in MLB history to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season. At age 31, he remains one of the most electric players in baseball.</p> <h2>5) San Diego Padres</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/27/the-2024-chicago-white-sox-a-team-so-historically-bad-they-stopped-tweeting-results\">The 2024 Chicago White Sox: a team so historically bad they stopped tweeting results</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>The Padres enter the playoffs with a 43-20 record since the All-Star Break and strong final months from starting pitchers Dylan Cease (2.97 ERA in five September starts), Joe Musgrove (2.51 ERA and 38 strikeouts in five September starts) and Michael King (1.57 ERA over four September starts). San Diego\u2019s pitching staff also allowed the fewest home runs of any team in the second half of the season, which is a positive indicator for close playoff games with high pressure. Star hitters Manny Machado and Fernando Tat\u00eds Jr are reliable players with postseason experience.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: The Padres lack a deep bench and they will struggle without every day shortstop Ha-Seong Kim, who will miss the playoffs after shoulder surgery. If Machado and Tat\u00eds don\u2019t hit well, there will be significant pressure on 21-year-old outfielder Jackson Merrill, who had a brilliant season but is entering his first playoff series.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Closer Robert Su\u00e1rez struggled in September after a dominant first five months of the season. Three of the seven home runs he surrendered this season have occurred over his last nine outings. If he can rediscover his All-Star form, then the Padres will be one of the most complete teams in the playoffs. If he can\u2019t, they may struggle to get out of the wildcard round.</p>    <h2>6) Houston Astros</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>The Astros have won a playoff series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Houston_Astros_seasons#Postseason_appearances\">every year since 2017</a>. There are no shortage of stats to demonstrate their dominance: Jose Altuve leads all active players with 27 postseason home runs (his teammate Alex Bregman is third with 19) and he is the only active player with more than 100 career postseason hits. Altuve, Bregman along with sluggers Yordan \u00c1lvarez and Kyle Tucker are unfazed by the big stage and are often at their best when the lights are bright.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Even with dependable bullpen arms like Josh Hader and Bryan Abreu, the Astros have struggled in one-run games this year (18-27). If starting pitchers Framber Valdez and Yusei Kikuchi struggle, Houston may run out of viable starting arms for a deep playoff run.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>The Astros traded three heralded young prospects to acquire Kikuchi from Toronto at the trade deadline so he could start big games in October. He has shown flashes of dominance since joining Houston (76 strikeouts in 60 innings) and is an essential piece if the Astros want to make another deep run.</p> <h2>7) Milwaukee Brewers</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>This is a speedy team who try to steal bases, score early and smother opposing offenses with some of the best relief pitchers in baseball. The Brewers finished second in baseball with 217 stolen bases and, even more impressively, third in stolen base percentage (84%). Five Brewers stole at least 20 bases and second baseman Brice Turang was one of three players in baseball to steal 50 this season.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Without star outfielder Christian Yelich, who had season-ending back surgery in August, the Brewers are missing reliable power besides catcher William Contreras and shortstop Willy Adames. If those two aren\u2019t driving in runs, the Brewers will need to be even more aggressive on the basepaths to try and scratch out enough runs to win games.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/26/work-fight-or-play-ball-when-babe-ruth-paused-his-career-and-headed-to-the-mill\">Work, fight, or play ball: when Babe Ruth paused his career and headed to the mill</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Adames finished second in the National League with 112 RBI and hit a career-high 32 home runs. He is going to be a free agent after the season, meaning this will probably be his one chance to take the Brewers to the World Series.</p> <h2>8) Baltimore Orioles</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>The Orioles feature probably the best collection of young talent in baseball: 23-year-old shortstop Gunnar Henderson will finish top-five in the AL MVP voting after hitting 37 home runs in his sophomore campaign; 24-year-old Colton Cowser is a leading candidate for AL Rookie of the Year after swatting 24 homers in his first full season. And 26-year-old catcher Adley Rutschman regressed after a stellar 2023 campaign, but was still named an All-Star.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Baltimore are 33-33 since the All-Star Break and their bullpen has an ERA of 4.81 in that span, the worst of any playoff team.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Right fielder Anthony Santander smashed 44 home runs this year, including a number of clutch hits late in the season. Since pitching will not be Baltimore\u2019s strength in the postseason, the power will need to sustain the lineup.</p>    <h2>9) Kansas City Royals</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>Bobby Witt Jr would probably win the AL MVP if he wasn\u2019t competing against Judge: the 24-year-old shortstop led all of baseball with 211 hits and a .332 batting average to go along with 32 home runs and 31 stolen bases. Starting pitchers Seth Lugo and Cole Ragans are strong anchors to a solid, if unspectacular pitching staff.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: The Royals have endured two separate seven-game losing streaks since 28 August, somewhat due to a lack of plate discipline (their 7.2% walk rate is the worst of any playoff team) and an injury to first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino, who was the team\u2019s most promising young player after Witt.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Witt is simply too electrifying to ignore and is an utter joy to watch. Since Kansas City don\u2019t get many national broadcasts, it\u2019s a great opportunity to see one of the game\u2019s bright young stars playing in a smaller market.</p> <h2>10) Detroit Tigers</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>Some playoff models had the Tigers with less than a 1% chance of making the postseason when they were eight games under .500 with 44 games remaining. Since then, Detroit are 31-13 thanks to an extremely youthful group (five everyday players age 24 or under) and an unusual strategy that relies heavily on relief pitchers like Tyler Holton, who finished the regular season with a stellar 2.19 ERA over 94 innings.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: It\u2019s not a team that hits for much power or showcases particularly good plate discipline. They Tigers are a young group, meaning they could enjoy the bright lights or be quickly eliminated by the veteran Astros.</p> <p><strong>Key player: </strong>Starting pitcher Tarik Skubal will win the AL Cy Young award after leading MLB in wins (18) and strikeouts (228) to complement a 2.39 ERA.</p>    <h2>11) New York Mets</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>The Mets surged to the playoffs behind a phenomenal campaign from shortstop Francisco Lindor, who finished the season with 33 home runs and 29 stolen bases along with playing elite defense. New York have a deep collection of veteran hitters (Brandon Nimmo, Pete Alonso and JD Martinez) along with Mark Vientos, who finished his first full season with 27 home runs.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: The pitching staff \u2013 both the starters and the relievers \u2013 surrenders too many walks (their 9.6% walk rate is the worst among playoff teams) and the offense lacks consistency despite impressive power.</p> <p><strong>Key player</strong>: Pete Alonso trails only Aaron Judge for the most home runs in baseball since 2019, but he finished this year with a career-low 34 home runs and 88 RBI (excluding the shortened 2020 season). He\u2019s still one of the most fearsome power hitters in baseball and can carry the Mets if he heats up.</p> <h2>12) Atlanta Braves</h2> <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>This year, it is resilience: The team lost defending NL MVP Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr to a season-ending knee injury and two-time Silver Slugger Austin Riley to a broken hand. Even so, they squeezed into the playoffs thanks to a remarkable season from starting pitcher Chris Sale, the favorite to win the NL Cy Young award and an elite power campaign from designated hitter Marcell Ozuna, who finished with 39 home runs and 104 RBI.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: The mounting injuries have them playing aging veterans like Ram\u00f3n Laureano, Gio Urshela and Whit Merrifield in critical spots. All three have been very good big leaguers during their career, but all three were released by other teams earlier in the season. Their presences demonstrate how deeply Atlanta have needed to dig to battle back from terrible injury luck.</p> <p><strong>Key player</strong>: Center fielder Michael Harris II enjoyed a brilliant September and will be expected to provide much of the spark that is missing due to Acu\u00f1a and Riley\u2019s absences.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Cinema is a hell of a drug. For movie lovers, a trip to the pictures is just that, a two (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/03/six-hour-long-movies-james-cameron-cinema\">or, increasingly, six</a>) hour psychoactive escape from the drab outside world. The rushing highs, the crushing lows, the kaleidoscopic lights, the bombastic sounds; and that\u2019s just the Pearl &amp; Dean indent. But while cinema is also full of drugs \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000006/?ref_=tt_mv_close\">1894\u2019s Chinese Opium Den</a> right through to, er, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/26/cocaine-bear-review-larky-horror-comedy-is-roaring-good-fun\">2023\u2019s Cocaine Bear</a> \u2013 film-makers have been coming up with fictional drugs (not available in the real world) to rewire narratives, change characters\u2019 personalities and take audiences to brave new worlds without the need for goofy superpowers, confusing procedures or gimmicky magic.</p> <p>Ironically, though, cinema\u2019s phoney pharmaceuticals are used to highlight what\u2019s happening in the real world, as film-makers are playing on our fears surrounding Big Pharma and synthetic drugs. Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/19/the-substance-review-demi-moore-coralie-fargeat\">The Substance, the new body horror from Coralie Fargeat</a>, revolving around a drug of the same name that draws on recent weight-loss magic formulas and seems to have anticipated the Ozempic craze. Half Dorian Gray, half David Cronenberg, it begins with fading starlet and TV aerobics host Elizabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore) getting fired by sleazy exec Harvey (Dennis Quaid) for being too old. Giving into temptation, she orders a batch of the Substance from a shadowy firm and injects herself with a (suitably Brat green) fluid in her strangely empty bathroom. Suddenly, a nubile clone prises her shoulder blades apart and crawls out of her spine. Meet Sue (Margaret Qualley): Sparkle\u2019s better, prettier half. There\u2019s a catch, of course; she must switch between each body every week; take a \u201cstabiliser\u201d shot every day to stop her from getting sick; and continue feeding her other body. And side effects occur: namely, headaches, tinnitus and, oh, turning into a grotesque ogre with an amorphous amalgamation of flesh that would make Gollum grimace.</p> <p>\u201cI think that fictional drugs speak at the same time to our imagination and to our strong human nature which, from the beginning of ages, [has wanted] to escape reality and live new experiences,\u201d Fargeat tells the Guardian. No wonder, then, the film was peddled with the tagline \u201c#TryTheSubstance\u201d to tempt people to a ticket. \u201cCinema is a kind of drug in itself that allows us to escape from reality,\u201d Fargeat adds. \u201cI remember that when I was younger I\u2019d rather live my life in movies than in reality. So, in a way, fictional drugs in movies give you an escape \u2026 x2!\u201d</p> <p>Stanislas Reydellet, production designer on The Substance, says: \u201cCoralie had a very strong initial desire to associate The Substance with a very addictive hard drug like heroin. Something which, once you start, you can\u2019t stop.\u201d But these new kinds of high aren\u2019t all that new. Harry Shapiro, one of the UK\u2019s leading drug consultants and author of Shooting Stars: Drugs, Hollywood and the Movies, traces the fictional drug film back to the earliest adaptations of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. \u201cHe swallows an unknown potion and it interestingly brings out the demonic side of his nature,\u201d Shapiro says. It demonstrates the duality that drug use catalyses. \u201cIt plays on the guilt trip of addiction,\u201d he adds.</p>    <p>The psychotropic trope really took off, though, in 1972, with Stanley Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange, based on Anthony Burgess\u2019s cult novel. Alex and his droogs indulged in all sorts of drugs, including spiked dairy drink milk-plus. Over a decade later, David Lynch\u2019s Dune brought melange, or \u201cthe Spice\u201d (not the man-made \u201cSpice\u201d ravaging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/06/spice-zombie-drug-devastating-communities\">poorer communities</a>, but a fictional equivalent), an inhalant that promises its user prescience, to life. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/21/dune-part-two-review-denis-villeneuve\">Dune: Part Two</a> continued the story. \u201cSpice is power,\u201d the movie begins. Unfortunately, it\u2019s wildly addictive and can only be harvested on the acrid desert planet Arrakis, guarded by giant sandworms. Godspeed! In the 1990s and 2000s, scores more fictional drugs entered the collective cinematic consciousness, including black meat (a powder taken from the guts of giant Brazilian centipedes in Naked Lunch); Adrenochrome (a human-sourced stimulant in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas); neuroin (an inhaled opioid featured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jun/28/culture.reviews\">Minority</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jun/28/culture.reviews\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jun/28/culture.reviews\">Report</a>); Beijing cocktail (a fatal adrenaline blocker in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/sep/01/actionandadventure\">Crank</a>); and POS-51 (a drug in The 51st State claimed to be 51 times as potent as other drugs but is actually, <strong>spoiler alert</strong>, a placebo).</p> <p>Sometimes, these synthesised substances encountered reality. During the 2010s, mephedrone was sold in some legal high shops as \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d \u2013 with poster-inspired packaging. Adrenochrome has been co-opted by the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2023/07/15/the-adrenochrome-conspiracy-theory-pushed-by-sound-of-freedom-star-explained/\">QAnon conspiracy movement</a>, who claim it\u2019s an actual anti-ageing compound being harvested from children by the global elite.<br><br>With designer drug distribution currently at an all-time high in the real world, expect a new wave of film-makers to explore what\u2019s coming up in the near future. As Naked Lunch\u2019s William Lee darkly notes, there are \u201caddicts of drugs not yet synthesised\u201d waiting to be explored in fiction, taking us on new trips from the comfort of our cinema seat; and leaving us wondering what the hell was in our popcorn.</p>",

And side effects occur: namely, headaches, tinnitus and, oh, turning into a grotesque ogre with an amorphous amalgamation of flesh that would make Gollum grimace. \u201cI think that fictional drugs speak at the same time to our imagination and to our strong human nature which, from the beginning of ages, [has wanted] to escape reality and live new experiences,\u201d Fargeat tells the Guardian. No wonder, then, the film was peddled with the tagline \u201c#TryTheSubstance\u201d to tempt people to a ticket. \u201cCinema is a kind of drug in itself that allows us to escape from reality,\u201d Fargeat adds. \u201cI remember that when I was younger I\u2019d rather live my life in movies than in reality. So, in a way, fictional drugs in movies give you an escape \u2026 x2!\u201d Stanislas Reydellet, production designer on The Substance, says: \u201cCoralie had a very strong initial desire to associate The Substance with a very addictive hard drug like heroin. Something which, once you start, you can\u2019t stop.\u201d But these new kinds of high aren\u2019t all that new. Harry Shapiro, one of the UK\u2019s leading drug consultants and author of Shooting Stars: Drugs, Hollywood and the Movies, traces the fictional drug film back to the earliest adaptations of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. \u201cHe swallows an unknown potion and it interestingly brings out the demonic side of his nature,\u201d Shapiro says. It demonstrates the duality that drug use catalyses. \u201cIt plays on the guilt trip of addiction,\u201d he adds. The psychotropic trope really took off, though, in 1972, with Stanley Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange, based on Anthony Burgess\u2019s cult novel. Alex and his droogs indulged in all sorts of drugs, including spiked dairy drink milk-plus. Over a decade later, David Lynch\u2019s Dune brought melange, or \u201cthe Spice\u201d (not the man-made \u201cSpice\u201d ravaging poorer communities, but a fictional equivalent), an inhalant that promises its user prescience, to life. Earlier this year, Dune: Part Two continued the story. \u201cSpice is power,\u201d the movie begins. Unfortunately, it\u2019s wildly addictive and can only be harvested on the acrid desert planet Arrakis, guarded by giant sandworms. Godspeed! In the 1990s and 2000s, scores more fictional drugs entered the collective cinematic consciousness, including black meat (a powder taken from the guts of giant Brazilian centipedes in Naked Lunch); Adrenochrome (a human-sourced stimulant in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas); neuroin (an inhaled opioid featured in Minority Report); Beijing cocktail (a fatal adrenaline blocker in Crank); and POS-51 (a drug in The 51st State claimed to be 51 times as potent as other drugs but is actually, spoiler alert, a placebo). Sometimes, these synthesised substances encountered reality. During the 2010s, mephedrone was sold in some legal high shops as \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d \u2013 with poster-inspired packaging. Adrenochrome has been co-opted by the QAnon conspiracy movement, who claim it\u2019s an actual anti-ageing compound being harvested from children by the global elite. With designer drug distribution currently at an all-time high in the real world, expect a new wave of film-makers to explore what\u2019s coming up in the near future. As Naked Lunch\u2019s William Lee darkly notes, there are \u201caddicts of drugs not yet synthesised\u201d waiting to be explored in fiction, taking us on new trips from the comfort of our cinema seat; and leaving us wondering what the hell was in our popcorn.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cWe intend on defending our right to protest and are determined to continue standing for justice for Palestine and Lebanon.\u201d In a statement, a police spokesperson said they recognised the \u201crights of individuals and groups\u201d to exercise their free speech, but said they would be fighting to prevent the protests regardless. \u201cThe NSW police force is aware of upcoming planned protest activity in Sydney on Sunday 6 October 2024 and Monday 7 October 2024. \u201cOfficers from Operation Shelter have conducted negotiations with protest organisers, who did submit a form 1 for each proposed public assembly, but are not satisfied that the protest can proceed safely. \u201cAccordingly, the commissioner has decided to apply to the NSW supreme court to prohibit the two assemblies. \u201cThe NSW police force recognises and supports the rights of individuals and groups to exercise their rights of free speech and peaceful assembly; however, the first priority for the NSW police force is the safety of the participants and the wider community.\u201d The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said he \u201cfully supported the decision\u201d. \u201cPolice have made this decision about the form 1 in line with crowd management and safety. \u201cWe fully support the decision. Our priority must be community safety. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to work together to ensure we keep this cohesive, harmonious, safe community that we have in NSW.\u201d The decision comes after weekend protests sparked a war of words between the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and Labor, with the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, accusing the opposition leader of \u201craising the temperature\u201d of public debate over conflict in the Middle East. Dutton had earlier this week suggested parliament should be recalled to enact new anti-terror legislation that would prohibit people from holding the Hezbollah flag, after people were spotted with the group\u2019s imagery at the protest on Sunday. The protest on Sunday focused on Israel\u2019s strikes on Lebanon. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said on Sunday that more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said 1 million people \u2013 a fifth of the population \u2013 have fled their homes. Burke rejected Dutton\u2019s demand, saying federal law supported by both parties was already in force, with police and authorities investigating the rallies. He claimed Dutton wanted to \u201cthrow more kerosene on the fire\u201d of the public mood around the widening Middle East conflict. \u201cI\u2019ve got very strong views against hate speech and hate symbols, very strong views, and I don\u2019t want the anger and hatred from around the world being imported into Australia,\u201d Burke told Radio National on Tuesday. \u201cWith Peter Dutton, it remains the case that no matter how many times our security agencies say we need to lower the temperature in Australia, he wants to raise the temperature every single time.\u201d The Australian federal police confirmed on Monday that it was investigating at least six reports of alleged crimes from their Victorian counterparts involving symbols and chants which are prohibited under federal hate speech law. More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died on 7 October. Of the 250 abducted that day by Hamas, half were released in a short-lived ceasefire in November and half of the remainder are thought to be dead. No one knows how many died in Friday\u2019s massive strike in southern Beirut. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, one in 55 of the pre-war population. More than 700 people have died in Lebanon in the recent wave of Israeli attacks, including the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.",

Assange said his wife, Stella Assange, and then baby son had been victims of US spying and attempted evidence-gathering, including what he said was an attempt to take DNA from his six-month-old child\u2019s nappy. Over nearly 90 minutes, Assange addressed the committee seated next to his wife. He answered questions slowly but firmly, but declined a final question, citing tiredness. He said it had been a \u201cprofound and surreal shift\u201d to go from a Belmarsh cell to Strasbourg. Speaking of his time at Belmarsh, he said: \u201cThe experience of isolation for years in a small cell is difficult to convey. It strips away one\u2019s sense of self, leaving only the raw essence of existence. I am yet not fully equipped to speak about what I have endured.\u201d On Wednesday, assembly members will debate a draft resolution that condemns the \u201cdisproportionately severe charges\u201d brought against Assange by the US government. Drafted by Th\u00f3rhildur Sunna \u04d4varsd\u00f3ttir, an Icelandic MP with the left-leaning Pirate party, the resolution states that \u201cmisuse\u201d of the US 1917 Espionage Act has had a \u201cdangerous chilling effect, dissuading publishers, journalists and whistleblowers from reporting on governmental misconduct\u201d. The text also criticises the UK, a founding member of the Council of Europe, for failing to protect Assange\u2019s freedom of expression and right to liberty. In a dissenting opinion, the British conservative peer Richard Keen said the text was \u201coverly polemic and imprecise on key legal points\u201d. He argued it was \u201cregrettable\u201d to describe Assange as a political prisoner in Belmarsh because, he wrote, the WikiLeaks founder had been detained lawfully having violated earlier bail conditions and was considered a flight risk. \u201cThese proceedings did indeed take unusually long, but Mr Assange and his legal team contributed to prolonging them himself. His detention was therefore in no way politically motivated,\u201d Keen wrote, arguing that the designation \u201cbelittled the fate of true political prisoners\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Debra Ell opened her Trump Shoppe in a dingy Saginaw strip mall back when establishment Republicans and TV pundits were still scoffing at the man who was about to remake US politics.</p> \n<p>Ell latched on to Donald Trump as a winner not long after he declared his run for the presidency in 2015. But she understood that the key to his success in her corner of swing state Michigan was to keep a distance from the local Republican party, which Ell regarded with almost as much hostility as she did the Democrats.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bf30d5e8-4209-4d30-91e8-82f6a9e72604\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In what is expected to be a knife-edge US election decided by a few voters in a handful of key battleground states, the Guardian is exploring Saginaw, Michigan. It is a swing area in a swing state whose voters will bear an outsize influence on the outcome of the fight between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Chris McGreal is on the ground in Saginaw in the run up to November's election examining the issues that voters of all political backgrounds care about.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/26/saginaw-michigan-voters-presidential-election-trump-harris-share\"><b>Saginaw voters: tell us which issues will decide the US election</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So the Trump Shoppe was born, soon drawing in people who had never voted Republican in their lives. Ell recalls the car factory workers struggling after General Motors closed the plants that propped up Saginaw county\u2019s economy.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way union workers were going to go into Republican offices but they came in here because Trump\u2019s name was on the sign and said: \u2018There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton.\u2019 So we had that gift, and then they wanted to know more about Trump,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d educate them in what he was saying and they liked it because he\u2019s a phenomenon. We\u2019ll never ever see anybody like Donald Trump again, ever. It\u2019s not going to be fun anymore when he\u2019s not around. Even if you don\u2019t support him, it\u2019s fun, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> \n<p>Nearly a decade later, the Trump Shoppe is still in business, squeezed between Lovely Nails and an insurance company. These days, it\u2019s busy with people buying \u201cvote Trump\u201d signs sporting slogans tailored to military veterans, bikers, union members, Black people and Latinos. \u201cCats and Dogs for Trump\u201d signs have done well since the former president accused Haitian immigrants of eating people\u2019s pets in Springfield, Ohio.</p> \n<p>A blanket imprinted with a picture of Trump raising his fist in the moments after the July assassination attempt is for sale near the entrance. T-shirts carry the words Trump shouted as he walked away with blood running down his face: fight, fight, fight.</p> \n<p>But besides serving as a shrine to Trump, the office is now also the local Republican headquarters after Ell led a campaign to purge the Saginaw county party of those she derided as \u201cRinos\u201d \u2013 Republicans in name only \u2013 for their lack of total fealty to Trump.</p> \n<p>She led a takeover last year by packing the local party with delegates aligned with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/america-first-trumpism-beyond-trump\">America First movement</a>, a populist political philosophy embraced by Trump that promotes a nationalist agenda of unilateralism and protectionism but has frequently been accused of being underpinned by racism.</p> \n<p>Amid accusations of intimidation that on one occasion resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.abc12.com/news/politics/police-called-to-saginaw-county-gop-convention-as-party-infighting-continues/article_eb6b5078-9e8e-11ed-a858-9b26ec924658.html\">police being called</a> to an official party meeting, Ell\u2019s husband, Gary, who voted for Barack Obama in 2008, was installed as chair of the county Republican party.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Saginaw county Republican party were old guard, traditional establishment people. When Debra started a Trump office here, we grew a following of people that supported Trump strictly as Trump. We built up a continual base to the point where none of the previous executive committee or officers who were not loyal to Trump are now in any leadership capacity,\u201d said Gary Ell.</p> \n<p>But for all her success in taking control of Saginaw\u2019s Republican machinery, Debra Ell now faces a critical question: does any of this help get Trump elected in five weeks?</p> \n<p>Saginaw is a bellwether county. Trump narrowly won it in 2016, and took Michigan by less than 11,000 votes. He lost the county and the state four years later, helping to send him to defeat in the presidential election. Victory for Trump in Saginaw and Michigan in November would be a major blow to Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign.</p> \n<p>But some Republicans have questioned the wisdom of what they see as the Saginaw party leadership\u2019s obsessive focus on conspiracy theories claiming the 2020 election was stolen and denial of Trump\u2019s role in the January 6 storming of the US Capitol.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It\u2019s not going to be fun anymore when he\u2019s not around.

      "bodyText": "Debra Ell opened her Trump Shoppe in a dingy Saginaw strip mall back when establishment Republicans and TV pundits were still scoffing at the man who was about to remake US politics. Ell latched on to Donald Trump as a winner not long after he declared his run for the presidency in 2015. But she understood that the key to his success in her corner of swing state Michigan was to keep a distance from the local Republican party, which Ell regarded with almost as much hostility as she did the Democrats. So the Trump Shoppe was born, soon drawing in people who had never voted Republican in their lives. Ell recalls the car factory workers struggling after General Motors closed the plants that propped up Saginaw county\u2019s economy. \u201cThere\u2019s no way union workers were going to go into Republican offices but they came in here because Trump\u2019s name was on the sign and said: \u2018There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton.\u2019 So we had that gift, and then they wanted to know more about Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d educate them in what he was saying and they liked it because he\u2019s a phenomenon. We\u2019ll never ever see anybody like Donald Trump again, ever. It\u2019s not going to be fun anymore when he\u2019s not around. Even if you don\u2019t support him, it\u2019s fun, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Nearly a decade later, the Trump Shoppe is still in business, squeezed between Lovely Nails and an insurance company. These days, it\u2019s busy with people buying \u201cvote Trump\u201d signs sporting slogans tailored to military veterans, bikers, union members, Black people and Latinos. \u201cCats and Dogs for Trump\u201d signs have done well since the former president accused Haitian immigrants of eating people\u2019s pets in Springfield, Ohio. A blanket imprinted with a picture of Trump raising his fist in the moments after the July assassination attempt is for sale near the entrance. T-shirts carry the words Trump shouted as he walked away with blood running down his face: fight, fight, fight. But besides serving as a shrine to Trump, the office is now also the local Republican headquarters after Ell led a campaign to purge the Saginaw county party of those she derided as \u201cRinos\u201d \u2013 Republicans in name only \u2013 for their lack of total fealty to Trump. She led a takeover last year by packing the local party with delegates aligned with the America First movement, a populist political philosophy embraced by Trump that promotes a nationalist agenda of unilateralism and protectionism but has frequently been accused of being underpinned by racism. Amid accusations of intimidation that on one occasion resulted in the police being called to an official party meeting, Ell\u2019s husband, Gary, who voted for Barack Obama in 2008, was installed as chair of the county Republican party. \u201cThe Saginaw county Republican party were old guard, traditional establishment people. When Debra started a Trump office here, we grew a following of people that supported Trump strictly as Trump. We built up a continual base to the point where none of the previous executive committee or officers who were not loyal to Trump are now in any leadership capacity,\u201d said Gary Ell. But for all her success in taking control of Saginaw\u2019s Republican machinery, Debra Ell now faces a critical question: does any of this help get Trump elected in five weeks? Saginaw is a bellwether county. Trump narrowly won it in 2016, and took Michigan by less than 11,000 votes. He lost the county and the state four years later, helping to send him to defeat in the presidential election. Victory for Trump in Saginaw and Michigan in November would be a major blow to Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign. But some Republicans have questioned the wisdom of what they see as the Saginaw party leadership\u2019s obsessive focus on conspiracy theories claiming the 2020 election was stolen and denial of Trump\u2019s role in the January 6 storming of the US Capitol. Thomas Roy was forced out as vice-chair of the county party by Ell and America First supporters in late 2022. \u201cA lot of us don\u2019t believe the election was stolen in 2020. They basically do, 100%,\u201d he told WJRT television afterward. Roy then founded a Republican \u201cclub\u201d to act as a rival to the local party by fundraising for more reasoned candidates \u2013 some of whom won their primaries against the America First challengers. Ell also led a campaign to unseat the director of the Michigan Republican party, Jason Roe, after just six months in office when it emerged that he had said not long after the 2020 election that Trump was responsible for his own defeat. \u201cThe election wasn\u2019t stolen, he blew it. Up until the final two weeks, he seemingly did everything possible to lose. Given how close it was, there is no one to blame but Trump,\u201d Roe told Politico at the time. Since his unseating, Roe has warned that America Firsters are damaging Trump\u2019s chances for victory this year and has described some of its candidates in Michigan state races as \u201ckooks\u201d. Another former local Republican official, who remains a Trump supporter, said that repeatedly \u201charping on about election fraud and January 6 only reminds people of the most disruptive threat to democracy in modern American history \u2013 with Trump at the heart of it\u201d. He added: \u201cHe lost then because of the chaos. Reminding voters of that chaos is not the way to win this election. We should stick to talking about his strength, the economy.\u201d Ell is having none of it. She said America First politicians are only voicing Trump\u2019s own views. But is that the way for him to win back Saginaw county after his defeat by just a few hundred votes in 2020? \u201cI don\u2019t think he lost it to begin with. I was here. I was on the ground.

Talking about the imposing ceibo trees, he praises the fluffy white kapok fibre that falls from their branches, which his ancestors used for mattresses. From the guasango tree, he highlights the tough wood that people used to make floors and tables for their houses \u2013 and even coffins.</p> <p>The tropical dry forest on Pacific coast, full of bare tree branches and yellowing leaves, is bursting with life and resources, though it may not seem like it. For locals such as Cabrera, it is not only a unique ecosystem but also the repository of ancestral knowledge.</p>    <p>\u201cWe have kept this trail clean for many generations,\u201d he says about the community\u2019s sustainable use of this conservation area.</p> <p>However, just a few metres from the path is a large construction site, where the forest has already been cleared. There, workers are building a new maximum-security prison, one of many election promises made last year by the hardline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/13/we-are-at-war-ecuadors-president-vows-to-crack-down-on-gangs-behind-week-of-violence\">president, Daniel Noboa</a>, to tackle Ecuador\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/09/cocaine-ravaged-countries-ecuador-drug-coup-complicit\">growing security crisis</a>, which has seen <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/984868/homicide-rate-ecuador/\">murder rates rise sixfold</a> in four years.</p> <p>\u201cWe are indignant because they are imposing on us a project that is not ours and doesn\u2019t indicate that it will solve the country\u2019s problems, much less the province\u2019s,\u201d Cabrera says.</p> <p>Like him, most people in the <em>comuna </em>of Bajada de Chanduy and neighbouring Juntas del Pac\u00edfico are outraged about the new prison, saying the authorities never consulted them before <a href=\"https://www.atencionintegral.gob.ec/inicia-la-construccion-del-centro-de-privacion-de-libertad-en-santa-elena/\">construction began in June</a>.</p> <p>There are dozens of comunas, or ancestral community organisations, along the coast of Ecuador, with <a href=\"https://fianecuador.org.ec/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-elites-y-comunas-ancestrales.pdf\">more than 60 just in Santa Elena province</a>, the site of the new maximum-security prison. These comunas have been settled for hundreds of years, with roots in pre-colonial Indigenous populations.</p>    <p>According to the 2008 <a href=\"https://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Ecuador/english08.html\">constitution</a>, these collective lands cannot be seized, divided or sold. They have their own governing body and collective ownership of their ancestral lands, where people harvest their crops and protect the surrounding dry forest.</p> <p>Despite constitutional protection, the comunas <a href=\"https://fianecuador.org.ec/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12-elites-y-comunas-ancestrales.pdf\">historically faced land invasions</a> and evictions, often due to the expansion of large-scale agriculture. There have been cases of companies falsifying land titles and comuna leaders selling land to third parties with officials\u2019 approval, leading to disputes over ownership.</p> <p>Now, once again, the community has been taken by surprise. Cabrera first learned about the location of the prison in March, when official documents were leaked to comuna members, he says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The prison site is just over six miles (10km) north of Bajada de Chanduy, in an area the community has long claimed. The neighbouring Juntas del Pac\u00edfico comuna and the state also claim ownership of the land.</p> <p>F\u00e9lix Ad\u00e1n de la Cruz Rivera, president of Juntas del Pac\u00edfico, says the comunas lost the land in 1995 after a member used it as <a href=\"https://elpais.com/america/2024-07-08/la-construccion-de-la-megacarcel-de-noboa-se-complica-por-la-protesta-de-una-comunidad-indigena.html\">collateral with a bank</a> to obtain a loan \u2013 something that would be illegal today. During a banking crisis in the 1990s, when several financial institutions had to be bailed out, the state acquired the land.</p>    <p>This year, it was handed over to the national prison authorities (SNAI) to construct a maximum-security facility. In late March, <a href=\"https://www.primicias.ec/noticias/seguridad/federacion-comunas-santa-elena-rechaza-construccion-nueva-carcel/\">military and SNAI officials started using drones</a> to scan the area and clear paths in the forest.</p> <p>In response, community leaders organised rallies and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=741097598002627\">press conferences</a> in protest at the construction, while filing requests for access to information on the project. They have also asked a judge to issue an injunction to halt building work. All were denied, and SNAI has since said that all information regarding the project is confidential.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The prison is progressing \u2013 and there is absolutely nothing they promised us</p> <footer> <cite>F\u00e9lix Ad\u00e1n de la Cruz Rivera</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Telmo Jaramillo, a Guayaquil-based lawyer with the <a href=\"https://www.cdh.org.ec/ultimos-pronunciamientos/635-no-a-la-carcel-en-santa-elena.html\">human rights organisation CDH</a> who has been helping Bajada de Chanduy, says it is illegal to keep information back if a public access request has been filed. </p> <p>\u201cThere is a legal infringement here by the SNAI,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Neither SNAI, the presidency nor the environment ministry, in charge of carrying out impact assessments and approving construction permits, replied to requests for a response by the time of publication.</p> <p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rgxWay9nmVW1P_6fuerdJc1lEEajCNnE/view?usp=drive_link\">The $52.2m (\u00a339m) construction project</a> is expected to take 300 days.

The ministry [of environment] should be very concerned about it,\u201d says Jaime Camacho, a biologist and consultant.</p> <p>Experts say the dry forest is rich in wildlife and endemic species \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/ecuadorian-dry-forests/\">more than 75 bird species and 19% of its vegetation</a> are unique to the region.

      "bodyText": "Walking along a path his grandfather once used, Donald Cabrera, a villager from Bajada de Chanduy, on the coast of Ecuador, points out different trees and their uses. Talking about the imposing ceibo trees, he praises the fluffy white kapok fibre that falls from their branches, which his ancestors used for mattresses. From the guasango tree, he highlights the tough wood that people used to make floors and tables for their houses \u2013 and even coffins. The tropical dry forest on Pacific coast, full of bare tree branches and yellowing leaves, is bursting with life and resources, though it may not seem like it. For locals such as Cabrera, it is not only a unique ecosystem but also the repository of ancestral knowledge. \u201cWe have kept this trail clean for many generations,\u201d he says about the community\u2019s sustainable use of this conservation area. However, just a few metres from the path is a large construction site, where the forest has already been cleared. There, workers are building a new maximum-security prison, one of many election promises made last year by the hardline president, Daniel Noboa, to tackle Ecuador\u2019s growing security crisis, which has seen murder rates rise sixfold in four years. \u201cWe are indignant because they are imposing on us a project that is not ours and doesn\u2019t indicate that it will solve the country\u2019s problems, much less the province\u2019s,\u201d Cabrera says. Like him, most people in the comuna of Bajada de Chanduy and neighbouring Juntas del Pac\u00edfico are outraged about the new prison, saying the authorities never consulted them before construction began in June. There are dozens of comunas, or ancestral community organisations, along the coast of Ecuador, with more than 60 just in Santa Elena province, the site of the new maximum-security prison. These comunas have been settled for hundreds of years, with roots in pre-colonial Indigenous populations. According to the 2008 constitution, these collective lands cannot be seized, divided or sold. They have their own governing body and collective ownership of their ancestral lands, where people harvest their crops and protect the surrounding dry forest. Despite constitutional protection, the comunas historically faced land invasions and evictions, often due to the expansion of large-scale agriculture. There have been cases of companies falsifying land titles and comuna leaders selling land to third parties with officials\u2019 approval, leading to disputes over ownership. Now, once again, the community has been taken by surprise. Cabrera first learned about the location of the prison in March, when official documents were leaked to comuna members, he says. *** The prison site is just over six miles (10km) north of Bajada de Chanduy, in an area the community has long claimed. The neighbouring Juntas del Pac\u00edfico comuna and the state also claim ownership of the land. F\u00e9lix Ad\u00e1n de la Cruz Rivera, president of Juntas del Pac\u00edfico, says the comunas lost the land in 1995 after a member used it as collateral with a bank to obtain a loan \u2013 something that would be illegal today. During a banking crisis in the 1990s, when several financial institutions had to be bailed out, the state acquired the land. This year, it was handed over to the national prison authorities (SNAI) to construct a maximum-security facility. In late March, military and SNAI officials started using drones to scan the area and clear paths in the forest. In response, community leaders organised rallies and press conferences in protest at the construction, while filing requests for access to information on the project. They have also asked a judge to issue an injunction to halt building work. All were denied, and SNAI has since said that all information regarding the project is confidential. Telmo Jaramillo, a Guayaquil-based lawyer with the human rights organisation CDH who has been helping Bajada de Chanduy, says it is illegal to keep information back if a public access request has been filed. \u201cThere is a legal infringement here by the SNAI,\u201d he says. Neither SNAI, the presidency nor the environment ministry, in charge of carrying out impact assessments and approving construction permits, replied to requests for a response by the time of publication. The $52.2m (\u00a339m) construction project is expected to take 300 days. Today, a large swath of the area has been completely cleared, with excavators levelling the ground. Ecuador\u2019s environmentalists fear the facility could irreversibly damage the tropical dry forest, one of the country\u2019s most endangered habitats, protected under the constitution as a \u201cfragile and threatened ecosystem\u201d. \u201cAs everyone sees it as dry, they keep destroying it. The ministry [of environment] should be very concerned about it,\u201d says Jaime Camacho, a biologist and consultant. Experts say the dry forest is rich in wildlife and endemic species \u2013 more than 75 bird species and 19% of its vegetation are unique to the region. Dry forests are also important for maintaining moisture in the soil. Without it, the land would deteriorate, forcing local people out of the area, Camacho says. The repercussions of creating the prison infrastructure include building or widening roads to the prison, creating sewage and waste-disposal systems, and constructing the infrastructure to house and service the workers, putting further pressure on the forest. This would also open up the forest to hunters and animal traffickers seeking rare bird species, such as the red-faced parrot or Pacific parakeet, says Camacho. *** However, not everyone in the comunas is against the project. De la Cruz Rivera says he signed an agreement with SNAI and various government ministries in July, agreeing to the project in return for various benefits. These included the construction of two pavilions at the local school \u2013 upgrading it so it can offer a baccalaureate in science \u2013 as well as a new health centre and a football pitch. But even De la Cruz Rivera is starting to regret his decision, saying the government is not complying with their agreements. \u201cThe prison is progressing, and there is absolutely nothing they promised us,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they don\u2019t comply, we will immediately paralyse the project.\u201d Leaders of both comunas agree that they were never consulted about the prison before building began, which is required for any infrastructure project planned on or near comuna territory, according to Ecuador\u2019s constitution. Several comuneros, such as Donald Cabrera, who has been farming his whole life, also fear the prison would bring significant changes to their way of life, limit their harvest and increase security risks. Most expressed concerns about threats to their safety after Noboa announced that the new prison was designed to \u201cisolate the most highly dangerous offenders\u201d. Renato Rivera, director of the non-profit organisation Ecuadorian Organised Crime Observatory (OECO), says it is clear that Ecuador\u2019s prison system needs modernisation and new capacity to meet rising pressure to jail more offenders to combat the crime wave. By the end of last year, Ecuador\u2019s 36 prisons were filled to 13.5% above their capacity of 27,556 places. Arrests have risen since January, when Noboa declared the country in a state of conflict with 22 armed groups. Nearly 5,000 people were arrested in the first month of a crackdown inspired by El Salvador\u2019s hardline policies against gang violence. But Rivera says the country needs more than just new infrastructure, as the prison system lacks public policies. \u201cThe construction requires new guidelines, security protocols, guidelines of international rules [UN-endorsed principles known as the Nelson Mandela Rules], as well as social rehabilitation strategies,\u201d he says.

In his announcement earlier this year, the president promised to build two maximum-security prisons, with the second planned for near the small town of Archidona in Ecuador\u2019s northern Amazon rainforest, another fragile ecosystem. Though construction has not yet begun, local communities have already begun protesting. As Ecuador faces another presidential election next year, with Noboa running for re-election, the president will try to push through both prison projects as quickly as possible, Jaramillo predicts. Meanwhile, Bajada de Changuy is planning to file a lawsuit soon that would force the government to stop construction. \u201cOne feels helpless in the face of state abuses,\u201d Cabrera says. \u201cBut not enough to just cross my arms.\u201d",

Yet Netanyahu clings on, paradoxically by gaming the very mechanisms of Israel\u2019s coalition system that have undone previous governments, including Netanyahu\u2019s own.</p> <p>If the polling shows anything, it is less a resounding vote in his favour and rather a failure of Israel\u2019s opposition to capitalise on his unpopularity. Dahlia Scheindlin,<strong> </strong>a<strong> </strong>political analyst and polling expert, separates the story of Netanyahu\u2019s political survival into several discrete phases.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, he\u2019s still here because there\u2019s no legal mechanism for going into elections \u2013 no matter how badly people feel regarding the government \u2013 if the government doesn\u2019t fall.</p> <p>\u201cIn the early days after 7 October a lot of people didn\u2019t want to have elections in the middle of a severe defensive war.</p> <p>\u201cThen we had a second phase of no serious opposition despite serious levels of distrust. The third phase, around March-April time, saw a return of significant protests but that is also around the time we began to see the regional escalation with Iran kick off. And that\u2019s also when you start to see his revival in surveys.\u201d</p> <p>Even those who wrote off Netanyahu in the weeks after the 7 October attack, including his longtime bitter critic, the former prime minister Ehud Olmert, have been forced to reassess his durability. Speaking to Politico last November, Olmert painted him as fatally diminished.</p> <p>\u201c[Netanyahu] has shrunk. He\u2019s destroyed emotionally \u2026 [He] has been working all his life on the false pretence that he is Mr Security.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Olmert credits the fact that Netanyahu is still in office to his complete investment in his own survival, staking everything \u2013 personal and Israel\u2019s institutions \u2013 on that effort.</p> <p>\u201cNetanyahu has been an exceptional performer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no substance, no depth, no real political vision\u2026 It\u2019s a performance. </p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, because he has nothing else to sell, what he sells to an unlimited degree is incitement and polarisation. He is brilliant at knowing how to manipulate divisions to strengthen his political base.\u201d</p>    <p>However, Olmert says Netanyahu would still struggle in any elections, falling short of the required governing coalition threshold of 61 out of 120 Knesset seats.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout this year there has not been a single poll where his coalition received more than 52 seats as against 64 he has now. The problem is that opposition is also divided. It doesn\u2019t have a single personality who has the kind of presence that could create a difference.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see one person who has a fire burning in chest, threatening to erupt [and] who will sweep it up. They are all decent people. But they are all too restrained to have the language to confront the poison machine\u2019s operations.\u201d</p> <p>For Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow on the Middle East programme at Chatham House, Netanyahu continues to benefit from the fact that Israel is in the midst of a conflict \u2013 even as he is still blamed for its genesis.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a combination of issues from the beginning including the convention in Israel that you don\u2019t replace a prime minister in wartime.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/us-looks-unable-to-talk-netanyahu-out-of-planned-invasion-of-lebanon\">US looks unable to talk Netanyahu out of planned invasion of Lebanon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mekelberg also sees Netanyahu benefiting from a lack of opposition within Likud and more widely.</p> <p>\u201cThe opposition is weak and there is none within Likud. It\u2019s the Bibi party. There is no comparable situation to British politics where someone can say: \u2018Thank you very much but now you are a burden.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The dynamics of Netanyahu\u2019s current coalition, Israel\u2019s most rightwing ever, has made it unusually stable. The position of far-right figures like Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who are opposed to any deal that would lead to a ceasefire in Gaza, has allowed Netanyahu to avoid US pressure for a ceasefire and prolong the war. That in turn has kicked the prospect of elections ever further down the road.</p> <p>And despite noises from the far right that they could quit the coalition, analysts see no real evidence to back the threat.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no alternative for the far right. [They] think this is their time. And Netanyahu legitimised them,\u201d Mekelberg said. </p> <p>Last week, in a long-expected move, Netanyahu brought back into the cabinet his Likud rival Gideon Saar and his faction, expanding the coalition in a move designed to undermine the leverage of the far-right parties and act as a foil to Gallant, his key rival.</p> <p>Scheindlin said that without a government collapse, there are now two potential outcomes: the government goes to a full term or Shas, one of the major ultra-orthodox parties, pulls out of the coalition and forms a new government with the opposition without new elections being called.</p> <p>Militating against that, however, is that Israel is entering a phase of high intensity conflict against Hezbollah.</p> <p>None of which makes the future trajectory of either Israeli politics or Netanyahu any more predictable in the immediate term, not least as Israeli governments have often fallen because of issues away from the main agenda of the day.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only a question [of Netanyahu\u2019s] will to survive,\u201d added Mekelberg. \u201cIt\u2019s about the survival of Israel as we knew it.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not that Israel is going to go away. It\u2019s whether it\u2019s the same Israel, that\u2019s the worry. You see how society is changing, how the values of its democratic system are compromised and values undermined.\u201d</p>",

If the polling shows anything, it is less a resounding vote in his favour and rather a failure of Israel\u2019s opposition to capitalise on his unpopularity. Dahlia Scheindlin, a political analyst and polling expert, separates the story of Netanyahu\u2019s political survival into several discrete phases. \u201cFirst, he\u2019s still here because there\u2019s no legal mechanism for going into elections \u2013 no matter how badly people feel regarding the government \u2013 if the government doesn\u2019t fall. \u201cIn the early days after 7 October a lot of people didn\u2019t want to have elections in the middle of a severe defensive war. \u201cThen we had a second phase of no serious opposition despite serious levels of distrust. The third phase, around March-April time, saw a return of significant protests but that is also around the time we began to see the regional escalation with Iran kick off. And that\u2019s also when you start to see his revival in surveys.\u201d Even those who wrote off Netanyahu in the weeks after the 7 October attack, including his longtime bitter critic, the former prime minister Ehud Olmert, have been forced to reassess his durability. Speaking to Politico last November, Olmert painted him as fatally diminished. \u201c[Netanyahu] has shrunk. He\u2019s destroyed emotionally \u2026 [He] has been working all his life on the false pretence that he is Mr Security.\u201d Today, Olmert credits the fact that Netanyahu is still in office to his complete investment in his own survival, staking everything \u2013 personal and Israel\u2019s institutions \u2013 on that effort. \u201cNetanyahu has been an exceptional performer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no substance, no depth, no real political vision\u2026 It\u2019s a performance. \u201cThe thing is, because he has nothing else to sell, what he sells to an unlimited degree is incitement and polarisation. He is brilliant at knowing how to manipulate divisions to strengthen his political base.\u201d However, Olmert says Netanyahu would still struggle in any elections, falling short of the required governing coalition threshold of 61 out of 120 Knesset seats. \u201cThroughout this year there has not been a single poll where his coalition received more than 52 seats as against 64 he has now. The problem is that opposition is also divided. It doesn\u2019t have a single personality who has the kind of presence that could create a difference. \u201cI don\u2019t see one person who has a fire burning in chest, threatening to erupt [and] who will sweep it up. They are all decent people. But they are all too restrained to have the language to confront the poison machine\u2019s operations.\u201d For Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow on the Middle East programme at Chatham House, Netanyahu continues to benefit from the fact that Israel is in the midst of a conflict \u2013 even as he is still blamed for its genesis. \u201cThere is a combination of issues from the beginning including the convention in Israel that you don\u2019t replace a prime minister in wartime.\u201d Mekelberg also sees Netanyahu benefiting from a lack of opposition within Likud and more widely. \u201cThe opposition is weak and there is none within Likud. It\u2019s the Bibi party. There is no comparable situation to British politics where someone can say: \u2018Thank you very much but now you are a burden.\u2019\u201d The dynamics of Netanyahu\u2019s current coalition, Israel\u2019s most rightwing ever, has made it unusually stable. The position of far-right figures like Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who are opposed to any deal that would lead to a ceasefire in Gaza, has allowed Netanyahu to avoid US pressure for a ceasefire and prolong the war. That in turn has kicked the prospect of elections ever further down the road. And despite noises from the far right that they could quit the coalition, analysts see no real evidence to back the threat. \u201cThere\u2019s no alternative for the far right. [They] think this is their time. And Netanyahu legitimised them,\u201d Mekelberg said. Last week, in a long-expected move, Netanyahu brought back into the cabinet his Likud rival Gideon Saar and his faction, expanding the coalition in a move designed to undermine the leverage of the far-right parties and act as a foil to Gallant, his key rival. Scheindlin said that without a government collapse, there are now two potential outcomes: the government goes to a full term or Shas, one of the major ultra-orthodox parties, pulls out of the coalition and forms a new government with the opposition without new elections being called. Militating against that, however, is that Israel is entering a phase of high intensity conflict against Hezbollah. None of which makes the future trajectory of either Israeli politics or Netanyahu any more predictable in the immediate term, not least as Israeli governments have often fallen because of issues away from the main agenda of the day. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a question [of Netanyahu\u2019s] will to survive,\u201d added Mekelberg. \u201cIt\u2019s about the survival of Israel as we knew it. \u201cIt is not that Israel is going to go away. It\u2019s whether it\u2019s the same Israel, that\u2019s the worry. You see how society is changing, how the values of its democratic system are compromised and values undermined.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a wild world out there online, with dis- and misinformation flying about at pace. I\u2019m part-way through writing a book about the history of fake news, so I\u2019m well aware that people making stuff up is not new. But what is new is the reach that troublemakers have, whether their actions are deliberate or accidental.</p> <p>Social media and the wider web changed the game for mischief-makers, and made it easier for the rest of us to be inadvertently hoodwinked online (see: the odd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/26/goodbye-meta-ai-big-tech-data-facebook\">\u201cGoodbye Meta AI\u201d trend</a> that I wrote about this week for the Guardian). The rise of generative AI since the release of ChatGPT in 2022 has also supercharged the risks. While early research suggests our biggest fears about the impact of AI-generated deepfakes on elections are unfounded, the overall information environment is a puzzling one.</p> <p><strong>Seeing is believing?</strong></p> <p>That much is evident in information gathered by the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) \u2013 a social-purpose organisation spun out of the UK government \u2013 and shared exclusively with me for TechScape. The survey of 2,000 UK adults highlights just how confusing the wild west web is at present.</p> <p>While 59% of those surveyed by BIT think they can spot false information online, BIT researchers found that only 36% of people were confident that <em>others</em> could spot fake news.</p> <p>That\u2019s a problem for two reasons. One is our low confidence in other people\u2019s ability to identify false stories. The other is the gulf in perception between our own abilities and those of the public at large. I suspect that if we actually measured how well people discern disinformation from the truth, it\u2019d be closer to the lower number than the higher one. In short, we tend to think we\u2019re smarter than we are.</p> <p>Don\u2019t believe me? For my first book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/youtubers-9781912454228/\">YouTubers</a>, I commissioned a survey by YouGov to see how well the public recognised major figures on the platform. The team at YouGov recommended that, among the real names, I should add someone who didn\u2019t exist as a kind of sense check to identify the proportion of people who were bluffing. A worrying number of respondents confidently said they knew the person the pollsters had invented \u2013 and knew them well.</p> <p><strong>A morass of misinformation</strong></p> <p>All of this matters because of the scale of the false info problem that\u2019s out there.</p> <p>Three-quarters of respondents to the BIT survey said they\u2019d seen fake news in the last week, with X (which pared back its content moderation teams to the bone in favour of Elon Musk\u2019s free speech absolutism) and TikTok considered the worst offenders. LinkedIn was seen as the least worst (but it\u2019s not entirely clear if that\u2019s because many avoid platform because it has a reputation as being boring).</p> <p>Regardless, the findings sit uneasily with those who conducted it. \u201cOur latest research has added to the growing evidence that social media users are overconfident in their ability to spot false information,\u201d says Eva Kolker, head of consumer and business markets at BIT. \u201cParadoxically, this might actually be making people more susceptible to it.\u201d</p> <p>In short: if you think you\u2019re better than others at spotting fake news, you\u2019re actually more likely to have lower defences \u2013 and fall foul of it when you (inevitably) encounter it online.</p> <p><strong>What should be done?</strong></p>    <p>Well, a start would be empowering users to be more aware of the risks of fake news and the impact it can have when shared with their social circles. Things snowball quickly thanks to the mob mentality mediated by social media algorithms, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/26/will-the-goodbye-meta-ai-message-protect-users-posts-from-being-used-to-train-ai\">that Goodbye Meta AI post</a>. So thinking twice and clicking once is important. (I outlined better ways to combat threats to our data <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/26/goodbye-meta-ai-big-tech-data-facebook\">in this piece</a>.)</p> <p>But Kolker isn\u2019t convinced that\u2019s enough. \u201cMany of our attempts to improve online safety have focused on improving the knowledge and capability of individual users\u201d, she says.\u201cWhile important, our research shows there are inherent limits to the effectiveness of this approach\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just rely on individuals changing their behaviour. To really combat misinformation we also need social media platforms to take action and regulators and government to intervene to level the playing field.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Is it time for an intervention?</strong></p> <p>The BIT came up with a slate of recommendations they\u2019d put to governments and social media platforms to try to combat mis- and disinformation. First among them is to flag posts that contain false information as soon as they\u2019re spotted, to try and make the public aware before they share. To Meta\u2019s credit, that\u2019s something it did with the Goodbye Meta AI trend, adding labels to posts pointing out that the information was not correct.</p> <p>The BIT also recommends that platforms become more stringent in how much legal but harmful content they show. Conspiracy theories fester in a putrid information environment, and the BIT seem to be suggesting that the standard Silicon Valley approach \u2013 that sunlight is the best disinfectant \u2013 doesn\u2019t cut it.</p> <p>Except in one instance. Their third recommendation is regular public rankings of how much false or harmful content is on each platform.</p> <p>Whether any of this will work is tough to say. I\u2019ve been looking at the science alongside studies and surveys like BIT\u2019s lately for a number of reasons, and every positive intervention also appears to have its drawbacks.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a wild world out there online, with dis- and misinformation flying about at pace. I\u2019m part-way through writing a book about the history of fake news, so I\u2019m well aware that people making stuff up is not new. But what is new is the reach that troublemakers have, whether their actions are deliberate or accidental. Social media and the wider web changed the game for mischief-makers, and made it easier for the rest of us to be inadvertently hoodwinked online (see: the odd \u201cGoodbye Meta AI\u201d trend that I wrote about this week for the Guardian). The rise of generative AI since the release of ChatGPT in 2022 has also supercharged the risks. While early research suggests our biggest fears about the impact of AI-generated deepfakes on elections are unfounded, the overall information environment is a puzzling one. Seeing is believing? That much is evident in information gathered by the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) \u2013 a social-purpose organisation spun out of the UK government \u2013 and shared exclusively with me for TechScape. The survey of 2,000 UK adults highlights just how confusing the wild west web is at present. While 59% of those surveyed by BIT think they can spot false information online, BIT researchers found that only 36% of people were confident that others could spot fake news. That\u2019s a problem for two reasons. One is our low confidence in other people\u2019s ability to identify false stories. The other is the gulf in perception between our own abilities and those of the public at large. I suspect that if we actually measured how well people discern disinformation from the truth, it\u2019d be closer to the lower number than the higher one. In short, we tend to think we\u2019re smarter than we are. Don\u2019t believe me? For my first book, YouTubers, I commissioned a survey by YouGov to see how well the public recognised major figures on the platform. The team at YouGov recommended that, among the real names, I should add someone who didn\u2019t exist as a kind of sense check to identify the proportion of people who were bluffing. A worrying number of respondents confidently said they knew the person the pollsters had invented \u2013 and knew them well. A morass of misinformation All of this matters because of the scale of the false info problem that\u2019s out there. Three-quarters of respondents to the BIT survey said they\u2019d seen fake news in the last week, with X (which pared back its content moderation teams to the bone in favour of Elon Musk\u2019s free speech absolutism) and TikTok considered the worst offenders. LinkedIn was seen as the least worst (but it\u2019s not entirely clear if that\u2019s because many avoid platform because it has a reputation as being boring). Regardless, the findings sit uneasily with those who conducted it. \u201cOur latest research has added to the growing evidence that social media users are overconfident in their ability to spot false information,\u201d says Eva Kolker, head of consumer and business markets at BIT. \u201cParadoxically, this might actually be making people more susceptible to it.\u201d In short: if you think you\u2019re better than others at spotting fake news, you\u2019re actually more likely to have lower defences \u2013 and fall foul of it when you (inevitably) encounter it online. What should be done? Well, a start would be empowering users to be more aware of the risks of fake news and the impact it can have when shared with their social circles. Things snowball quickly thanks to the mob mentality mediated by social media algorithms, such as that Goodbye Meta AI post. So thinking twice and clicking once is important. (I outlined better ways to combat threats to our data in this piece.) But Kolker isn\u2019t convinced that\u2019s enough. \u201cMany of our attempts to improve online safety have focused on improving the knowledge and capability of individual users\u201d, she says.\u201cWhile important, our research shows there are inherent limits to the effectiveness of this approach\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t just rely on individuals changing their behaviour. To really combat misinformation we also need social media platforms to take action and regulators and government to intervene to level the playing field.\u201d Is it time for an intervention? The BIT came up with a slate of recommendations they\u2019d put to governments and social media platforms to try to combat mis- and disinformation. First among them is to flag posts that contain false information as soon as they\u2019re spotted, to try and make the public aware before they share. To Meta\u2019s credit, that\u2019s something it did with the Goodbye Meta AI trend, adding labels to posts pointing out that the information was not correct. The BIT also recommends that platforms become more stringent in how much legal but harmful content they show. Conspiracy theories fester in a putrid information environment, and the BIT seem to be suggesting that the standard Silicon Valley approach \u2013 that sunlight is the best disinfectant \u2013 doesn\u2019t cut it. Except in one instance. Their third recommendation is regular public rankings of how much false or harmful content is on each platform. Whether any of this will work is tough to say. I\u2019ve been looking at the science alongside studies and surveys like BIT\u2019s lately for a number of reasons, and every positive intervention also appears to have its drawbacks. But if the Goodbye Meta AI trend going viral shows us anything, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t just assume people are able to distinguish what\u2019s real from what\u2019s not.

      "body": "<p>For the first, rocket-fuelled years of his career, Jake Bugg used to be the youngest person in any room, be it the Mercury prize ceremony or The Graham Norton Show. This summer, it hit home: that was no longer the case.</p> <p>Bugg was backstage at a festival, chatting with another band on the bill, when they informed him, with the casual brutality of youth, that they had listened to his music when they were at primary school. That was when Bugg realised he was now one of the grownups.</p> <p>How did it feel? \u201cWeird,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just changed. I don\u2019t mind,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut when some kids say \u2018primary school\u2019, I\u2019m like, all right, that\u2019s a bit too far now.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a reckoning familiar to anyone who has been praised as a precocious talent \u2013 but for Bugg, his early success has cast a long shadow. He was 17 when he was selected to play the BBC Introducing stage at Glastonbury in 2011, leading him to sign with Mercury Records. His self-titled debut album, released the following year, was nominated for the Mercury prize and sold almost 900,000 copies, driven by the success of the single Lightning Bolt; it was the 57th-bestselling album of the 2010s. Bugg remains the youngest male artist to debut at No 1 in the UK album charts. He only turned 30 in February.</p>    <p>Bugg is on record as disliking interviews, but when we meet at a pub in London I find him shy but game to get stuck in. It\u2019s 2pm and he hasn\u2019t had lunch yet, but Bugg goes straight for a pint. Not long ago, he was at this same pub for a signing, but he waves away my offer to relocate to a less conspicuous table. The only giveaway that this was once \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/10045799/Jake-Bugg-interview-The-best-thing-about-going-to-a-fashion-show-How-short-it-was.html\">Britain\u2019s coolest boy</a>\u201d (Grazia magazine, 2013) is his all-black outfit, from the bomber jacket to the Givenchy trainers.</p> <p>We are speaking three weeks out from Bugg\u2019s sixth album, A Modern Day Distraction. \u201cI can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s the sixth,\u201d he says. He seems apprehensive about how it will be received, after a decade of mixed reviews, and ground down by the machinations of the music industry.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to keep going,\u201d Bugg says. \u201cYes, there\u2019s been times where I feel like I\u2019m banging my head against a brick wall, but you\u2019ve just got to push through it. And I\u2019m happy that I have, in the last few years \u2013 because it\u2019s not always been an upward trajectory for me.\u201d</p> <p>That may be the case, but he couldn\u2019t have wished for a stronger start: Bugg went from playing Glastonbury\u2019s Introducing stage in 2011 to its main Pyramid stage in 2013. His own festival highlight was in 2014, when he headlined the Other stage, clashing with Metallica \u2013 one of his favourite bands growing up.</p>    <p>The sudden promotion \u201cwas definitely crazy\u201d, Bugg says \u2013 but not dizzying. \u201cThey\u2019re the moments you dream of, when you\u2019re in bed and you\u2019re 13 or 14 \u2026 I\u2019d imagined it enough that when I did get to that moment, it was like: oh yep.\u201d</p> <p>Bugg grew up on the Clifton council estate in Nottingham with his mother and younger sister. His parents had separated when he was young, which he says led him to grow up fast: \u201cPick your sister up from school, do the dishes, do the laundry, make sure everything\u2019s ready for when your mum comes back \u2013 I think it\u2019s just something you naturally do. And that you have to do.\u201d</p> <p>Bugg\u2019s own interests were football (he is a lifelong Notts County fan and, in latter years, a sponsor) and music. When he was 12, his uncle gave him a guitar and taught him some chords. By the time he was 14, he was reading articles online about how to make it in music; at 15, he was sharing his own songs on MySpace in the hope of being discovered.</p> <p>Bugg loved learning about obscure 40s blues musicians and \u201cevery Jimi Hendrix story\u201d ever written. But he did not flourish at school, and finished with \u201cnot exactly amazing\u201d GCSEs. He enrolled in a music technology course, but dropped out at 16. He loves Nottingham, \u201cbut I wanted to see more of the world\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sentiment familiar from his first album, in which Bugg yearns for escape from a world of drugs, violence and even (on Ballad of Mr Jones) murder. It is an especially dark picture of working-class life. \u201cThat\u2019s what sometimes growing up in those places can be like,\u201d Bugg says. Many of the songs were written with songwriter (and Snow Patrol collaborator) Iain Archer, who interviewed Bugg about his life and showed him how to set it to music. On Seen It All, he describes a party at a \u201clocal gangster\u2019s house\u201d that ends in a stabbing. That was true to his experience? \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d It is \u201cstrange\u201d to perform it now, with crowds of thousands singing along, he says. \u201cBut the truth is, a lot of people come from similar places, and have experienced similar things.\u201d</p> <p>Had he not been swept up into his dream career, \u201cI don\u2019t know which way life could have gone\u201d, says Bugg. It\u2019s a thought that continues to drive him. \u201cMusic\u2019s given me a whole new life, better than I could have ever imagined, and I just feel a kind of responsibility to pay everything back. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve just never stopped, never really taken a break \u2013 it feels wrong to do so.\u201d </p>    <p>By his own admission, his wasn\u2019t a new sound (\u201cIf you like Bob Dylan, try Jake Bugg,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/booming/if-you-like-bob-dylan-try-jake-bugg.html\">suggested</a> the New York Times) \u2013 but it also wasn\u2019t like much else on the airwaves, with guitar music starting to give way to pop. \u201cTiming is everything,\u201d Bugg says. He describes Lightning Bolt \u2013 still his biggest single, along with Two Fingers \u2013 as a fluke. \u201cIt still blows my mind when I play it on stage every night, like: \u2018This took 10 minutes to write. I can\u2019t believe you all like it \u2026 What about this one, with more chords in it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His songs were widely used in ads, from Greene King to Gatorade, while Trouble Town has become known as the theme for the BBC TV series Happy Valley. But Bugg, too, became a name and even a heartthrob, briefly \u201cromantically linked\u201d to model Cara Delevingne.</p> <p>A few weeks shy of his 19th birthday, Bugg <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/burberrys-new-boy-jake-bugg-5qms6v6mdxz\">was picked up by</a> Burberry, performing at the brand\u2019s flagship store opening and pictured at its catwalk show. The following year, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DKzDWJ6ZrQ\">in 2014</a>, he found himself on Graham Norton\u2019s sofa with Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro.</p> <p>After the show Stallone stuck around, telling stories, Bugg says. \u201cThat was pretty bizarre. Playing on the stage is one thing, but being around A-listers like that \u2026 then it\u2019s just me on the end of the couch, like: what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>It fostered some impostor syndrome, he says. Bugg describes himself as reserved and shy, but says his social anxiety and distrust could come across as \u201ca bit moody\u201d and even rude when he was younger. \u201cThere was a lot of negativity in life, which is why I grew up quite angry and frustrated.\u201d</p>    <p>Having been lauded as an \u201cauthentic\u201d working-class voice, Bugg struggled to express himself in a world he saw as decidedly inauthentic. He recalls being on a red carpet, speaking with an interviewer who kept looking over his shoulder for a bigger star: \u201cIt\u2019s just not very genuine.\u201d</p> <p>His relationship with Delevingne was overstated, Bugg says now (as <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/444706/Jake-Bugg-bonded-with-Cara-Delevingne-over-rise-to-fame\">he said at the time</a>) \u2013 but it provoked paparazzi attention nonetheless. \u201cIt\u2019s funny: people tell you, \u2018Just be grateful for the press, because you might not have it all the time.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Young Bugg also became known as a bit of a stirrer, mouthing off about Mumford &amp; Sons (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/07/jake-bugg-mumford-sons-posh-farmers-banjos\">\u201cposh farmers with banjos\u201d</a>) and One Direction (<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2013/02/28/jake-bugg-reignites-one-direction-feud-they-havent-got-a-clue-about-music-theyre-not-even-a-band-3519873/\">\u201c[they] must know they\u2019re terrible\u201d</a>). His points \u2013 albeit \u201cdelivered in an incredibly poor way\u201d \u2013 were about the music industry, and the superficial direction it was heading, Bugg says now. \u201cI think I had an obsession with being authentic \u2026 I was kind of critical \u2013 but it just made me look like more of a fool than anything.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d grown up an old soul, listening to Donovan and Don McLean, and \u201chating what was on the radio\u201d. These days \u2013 he adds, self-mockingly \u2013 he finds himself wistful for the pop of 2014: \u201cIt was better than it is now.\u201d Likewise, he now says he\u2019d \u201crather do an interview than a TikTok\u201d. (He has refused to sign up to the platform.)</p> <p>He bemoans the myopic focus on metrics, data and internal politics, forcing today\u2019s artists to jostle for promotion. \u201cI think it\u2019s really sad, for up-and-coming acts \u2013 they\u2019re having to spend more time focusing on the content than they are the actual art.\u201d</p> <p>He doubts that he would enjoy the same success with his debut album were it released today. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything like a social media following, and that\u2019s what everything gets based on. It\u2019s even harder now, especially for working-class people, to get on the radio.\u201d Many of the community resources for recording and performing that Bugg benefited from have since been shut down, he says. </p> <p>Equally, none of his subsequent releases have matched the critical or commercial performance of his debut (rereleased, in 2022, for its 10th anniversary) \u2013 perhaps not helped by their inconsistent styles. Having made the follow-up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/14/jake-bugg-shangri-la-review\">Shangri La</a>, with super-producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/rick-rubin-def-jam-founder-producer-debut-book\">Rick Rubin</a> at his Malibu studio, Bugg returned to his roots for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/16/jake-bugg-on-my-one-review\">2016\u2019s On My One</a>, titled for a Nottingham dictum \u2013 and even attempted to rap, on Ain\u2019t No Rhyme. (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after it came out that I was like, \u2018Why did I do that?\u2019\u201d says Bugg, ruefully.) For his fourth album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/31/jake-bugg-hearts-that-strain-review\">Hearts That Strain</a>, he made a \u201cNashville record\u201d with the Black Keys\u2019 Dan Auerbach.</p>    <p>Bugg says that he was searching, driven by the fear of being \u201cput in a box\u201d and held to the sound of his debut. \u201cI could sense that was happening, and sometimes I can be quite contrary,\u201d he says. \u201cI just wanted to shift it all, to give myself that room so that people don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next.\u201d</p> <p>Not all the experiments paid off, Bugg admits. But \u201cyou\u2019re damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t: if you\u2019re not seen to be trying to extend yourself musically, then you can seem a one-trick pony\u201d. </p> <p>The stakes have only got higher with each release. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try and keep people\u2019s attention, and that can be incredibly difficult,\u201d Bugg says. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re not the new artist any more, and it feels more about survival. You\u2019ve always got to prove yourself.\u201d</p> <p>In 2021, Saturday Night, Sunday Morning \u2013 Bugg\u2019s poppier fifth album, and his first on Sony\u2019s RCA label \u2013 was framed as a career reset, and gave rise to his biggest single in years, All I Need. But behind the scenes, Bugg says, \u201cI was probably the most anxious I\u2019ve ever been\u201d.</p> <p>He started having panic attacks before performing. His looming 30th birthday didn\u2019t help quell the existential crisis \u2013 but by the time it came around this February, he\u2019d refocused. \u201cIt\u2019s always very difficult,\u201d he says of managing the peaks and troughs \u2013 of his career, and his mental health. \u201cBut you just try and control the things only you can control.\u201d</p> <p>That was Bugg\u2019s attitude to making his new album, A Modern Day Distraction. While he is inclined to criticise his previous efforts as patchy or rushed, this one was sweated by a single team, in a single studio \u2013 and without any fear of \u201ctoo much guitar \u2013 I think I played to my strengths a bit more\u201d.</p> <p>That extends to subject matter. For many years, Bugg says, he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel comfortable\u201d revisiting the themes of his debut: \u201cI wasn\u2019t living that life any more.\u201d (These days he lives in Kensington, and in 2021 made Heat magazine\u2019s list of Richest Stars 30 &amp; Under, being <a href=\"https://www.bauermedia.co.uk/news/heat-rich-list-2021-reveals-30-richest-stars-30-and-under\">valued at</a> \u00a36.1m.) \u201cI felt like in some way it would have been dishonest, to try and continue with that thread, when I wasn\u2019t actually any part of it.\u201d</p> <p>On this album, Bugg takes a more observational perspective, commenting on ordinary Britons\u2019 struggles without claiming to share them himself. The single Zombieland describes the vicious cycle of poverty, with a man working around the clock to keep afloat. Bugg describes it as a loose concept album about life under austerity, inspired by conversations with friends and family. \u201cIt feels like a lot of people are working to live, pretty much, and it\u2019s hard not to feel guilty when I get to do the thing that I love for a living,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Coming home to his west London pad, amid the \u201cgreenery and nice white buildings\u201d, never gets familiar, he says. His family remains in Nottingham and, in recent years, he has spent more time there. \u201cI never really felt like I belonged where I grew up,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I know I <em>definitely</em> don\u2019t belong where I live now.\u201d</p> <p>He has never had therapy, calling it an \u201cAmerican thing\u201d. (\u201cMusic\u2019s the therapy \u2013 there\u2019s the cliche for you.\u201d) But he has managed to find some peace with himself, and his place in the world. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m quite proud of the record, and I would like it to do well,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if it doesn\u2019t, I think I can still say to myself, I made a good album, and I feel like I\u2019ve found the right track again. I think I can take comfort in that.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Jake Bugg\u2019s new album, A Modern Day Distraction, is out on 4 October on RCA. His UK headline tour starts in Leeds on 8 November</p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That was true to his experience? \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d It is \u201cstrange\u201d to perform it now, with crowds of thousands singing along, he says. \u201cBut the truth is, a lot of people come from similar places, and have experienced similar things.\u201d Had he not been swept up into his dream career, \u201cI don\u2019t know which way life could have gone\u201d, says Bugg. It\u2019s a thought that continues to drive him. \u201cMusic\u2019s given me a whole new life, better than I could have ever imagined, and I just feel a kind of responsibility to pay everything back. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve just never stopped, never really taken a break \u2013 it feels wrong to do so.\u201d By his own admission, his wasn\u2019t a new sound (\u201cIf you like Bob Dylan, try Jake Bugg,\u201d suggested the New York Times) \u2013 but it also wasn\u2019t like much else on the airwaves, with guitar music starting to give way to pop. \u201cTiming is everything,\u201d Bugg says. He describes Lightning Bolt \u2013 still his biggest single, along with Two Fingers \u2013 as a fluke. \u201cIt still blows my mind when I play it on stage every night, like: \u2018This took 10 minutes to write. I can\u2019t believe you all like it \u2026 What about this one, with more chords in it?\u2019\u201d His songs were widely used in ads, from Greene King to Gatorade, while Trouble Town has become known as the theme for the BBC TV series Happy Valley. But Bugg, too, became a name and even a heartthrob, briefly \u201cromantically linked\u201d to model Cara Delevingne. A few weeks shy of his 19th birthday, Bugg was picked up by Burberry, performing at the brand\u2019s flagship store opening and pictured at its catwalk show. The following year, in 2014, he found himself on Graham Norton\u2019s sofa with Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro. After the show Stallone stuck around, telling stories, Bugg says. \u201cThat was pretty bizarre. Playing on the stage is one thing, but being around A-listers like that \u2026 then it\u2019s just me on the end of the couch, like: what\u2019s going on?\u201d It fostered some impostor syndrome, he says. Bugg describes himself as reserved and shy, but says his social anxiety and distrust could come across as \u201ca bit moody\u201d and even rude when he was younger. \u201cThere was a lot of negativity in life, which is why I grew up quite angry and frustrated.\u201d Having been lauded as an \u201cauthentic\u201d working-class voice, Bugg struggled to express himself in a world he saw as decidedly inauthentic. He recalls being on a red carpet, speaking with an interviewer who kept looking over his shoulder for a bigger star: \u201cIt\u2019s just not very genuine.\u201d His relationship with Delevingne was overstated, Bugg says now (as he said at the time) \u2013 but it provoked paparazzi attention nonetheless. \u201cIt\u2019s funny: people tell you, \u2018Just be grateful for the press, because you might not have it all the time.\u2019\u201d Young Bugg also became known as a bit of a stirrer, mouthing off about Mumford &amp; Sons (\u201cposh farmers with banjos\u201d) and One Direction (\u201c[they] must know they\u2019re terrible\u201d). His points \u2013 albeit \u201cdelivered in an incredibly poor way\u201d \u2013 were about the music industry, and the superficial direction it was heading, Bugg says now. \u201cI think I had an obsession with being authentic \u2026 I was kind of critical \u2013 but it just made me look like more of a fool than anything.\u201d He\u2019d grown up an old soul, listening to Donovan and Don McLean, and \u201chating what was on the radio\u201d. These days \u2013 he adds, self-mockingly \u2013 he finds himself wistful for the pop of 2014: \u201cIt was better than it is now.\u201d Likewise, he now says he\u2019d \u201crather do an interview than a TikTok\u201d. (He has refused to sign up to the platform.) He bemoans the myopic focus on metrics, data and internal politics, forcing today\u2019s artists to jostle for promotion. \u201cI think it\u2019s really sad, for up-and-coming acts \u2013 they\u2019re having to spend more time focusing on the content than they are the actual art.\u201d He doubts that he would enjoy the same success with his debut album were it released today. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything like a social media following, and that\u2019s what everything gets based on. It\u2019s even harder now, especially for working-class people, to get on the radio.\u201d Many of the community resources for recording and performing that Bugg benefited from have since been shut down, he says. Equally, none of his subsequent releases have matched the critical or commercial performance of his debut (rereleased, in 2022, for its 10th anniversary) \u2013 perhaps not helped by their inconsistent styles. Having made the follow-up, Shangri La, with super-producer Rick Rubin at his Malibu studio, Bugg returned to his roots for 2016\u2019s On My One, titled for a Nottingham dictum \u2013 and even attempted to rap, on Ain\u2019t No Rhyme. (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after it came out that I was like, \u2018Why did I do that?\u2019\u201d says Bugg, ruefully.) For his fourth album, Hearts That Strain, he made a \u201cNashville record\u201d with the Black Keys\u2019 Dan Auerbach. Bugg says that he was searching, driven by the fear of being \u201cput in a box\u201d and held to the sound of his debut. \u201cI could sense that was happening, and sometimes I can be quite contrary,\u201d he says. \u201cI just wanted to shift it all, to give myself that room so that people don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next.\u201d Not all the experiments paid off, Bugg admits. But \u201cyou\u2019re damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t: if you\u2019re not seen to be trying to extend yourself musically, then you can seem a one-trick pony\u201d. The stakes have only got higher with each release. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try and keep people\u2019s attention, and that can be incredibly difficult,\u201d Bugg says. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re not the new artist any more, and it feels more about survival. You\u2019ve always got to prove yourself.\u201d In 2021, Saturday Night, Sunday Morning \u2013 Bugg\u2019s poppier fifth album, and his first on Sony\u2019s RCA label \u2013 was framed as a career reset, and gave rise to his biggest single in years, All I Need. But behind the scenes, Bugg says, \u201cI was probably the most anxious I\u2019ve ever been\u201d. He started having panic attacks before performing. His looming 30th birthday didn\u2019t help quell the existential crisis \u2013 but by the time it came around this February, he\u2019d refocused. \u201cIt\u2019s always very difficult,\u201d he says of managing the peaks and troughs \u2013 of his career, and his mental health. \u201cBut you just try and control the things only you can control.\u201d That was Bugg\u2019s attitude to making his new album, A Modern Day Distraction. While he is inclined to criticise his previous efforts as patchy or rushed, this one was sweated by a single team, in a single studio \u2013 and without any fear of \u201ctoo much guitar \u2013 I think I played to my strengths a bit more\u201d. That extends to subject matter. For many years, Bugg says, he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel comfortable\u201d revisiting the themes of his debut: \u201cI wasn\u2019t living that life any more.\u201d (These days he lives in Kensington, and in 2021 made Heat magazine\u2019s list of Richest Stars 30 &amp; Under, being valued at \u00a36.1m.) \u201cI felt like in some way it would have been dishonest, to try and continue with that thread, when I wasn\u2019t actually any part of it.\u201d On this album, Bugg takes a more observational perspective, commenting on ordinary Britons\u2019 struggles without claiming to share them himself. The single Zombieland describes the vicious cycle of poverty, with a man working around the clock to keep afloat. Bugg describes it as a loose concept album about life under austerity, inspired by conversations with friends and family. \u201cIt feels like a lot of people are working to live, pretty much, and it\u2019s hard not to feel guilty when I get to do the thing that I love for a living,\u201d he says. Coming home to his west London pad, amid the \u201cgreenery and nice white buildings\u201d, never gets familiar, he says. His family remains in Nottingham and, in recent years, he has spent more time there. \u201cI never really felt like I belonged where I grew up,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I know I definitely don\u2019t belong where I live now.\u201d He has never had therapy, calling it an \u201cAmerican thing\u201d. (\u201cMusic\u2019s the therapy \u2013 there\u2019s the cliche for you.\u201d) But he has managed to find some peace with himself, and his place in the world. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m quite proud of the record, and I would like it to do well,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if it doesn\u2019t, I think I can still say to myself, I made a good album, and I feel like I\u2019ve found the right track again. I think I can take comfort in that.\u201d \u2022 Jake Bugg\u2019s new album, A Modern Day Distraction, is out on 4 October on RCA.

      "body": "<p>Meera Syal and Tanika Gupta\u2019s friendship clearly runs deep. They nod in recognition to each other\u2019s anecdotes and speak about being part of the <a href=\"https://sadaa.co.uk/archive/literature/asian-women-writers-collective\">Asian Women Writers\u2019 Collective</a> in the 1990s, when it was a far smaller world for British south Asian writers and actors. So it is not surprising that just before Syal was due to meet the National Theatre\u2019s outgoing director, Rufus Norris, for an ideas meeting, she called on Gupta for anything she might offer him.</p> <p>\u201cHow about you doing Queen Lear?\u201d suggested Gupta, a playwright with a history of adapting the classics, who had transposed Shakespeare\u2019s drama, putting an imperious mother at its centre. Syal phoned Gupta six hours later to say: \u201cHe\u2019s up for it.\u201d</p> <p>Queen Lear has since morphed into Queenie, the central character of A Tupperware of Ashes, now at the National\u2019s Dorfman theatre, with music by Nitin Sawhney. Syal plays a modern-day British Bengali matriarch who runs a Michelin-starred restaurant and, at 68 years old, is diagnosed with early onset dementia. Her three grown children watch her alarming decline.</p>    <p>Syal and Gupta are sitting in a back room of the National, along with Shobna Gulati, who plays Queenie\u2019s old friend, Indrani. They talk intimately about the resilience of their own mothers \u2013 about getting to know hidden aspects of their immigrant experiences later in life, writing down their recipes, speaking of their difficult sides and watching them slowly, painfully, get ill and die.</p> <p>Syal and Gulati\u2019s mothers died after suffering from dementia; Gupta\u2019s died from cancer and, towards the end, showed signs of confusion, she says. \u201cA lot of our friends of a certain age were going through a similar thing with our parents,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>The play is infused with a depth of lived experience as a result. Even the snippet of a scene I watch in rehearsals is highly charged, voices wobbling with emotion, including that of director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/12/theatre-leader-pooja-ghai-i-couldnt-sit-back-and-complain-about-roles-i-wasnt-getting\">Pooja Ghai</a>, who recently worked with Gupta on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/19/the-empress-review-royal-shakespeare-theatre-stratford-upon-avon-tanika-gupta\">The Empress staged by the RSC.</a></p> <p>Has it hit raw nerves? There has been quite a lot of crying, says Gupta, but for Gulati it has been \u201creassuring and cathartic\u201d. It\u2019s the same for Syal: \u201cMy mum died barely a year ago and I thought when I looked at the play \u2018This is either going to make me or break me\u2019,\u201d she says. Thankfully, it did the former: \u201cI think it might save me years of therapy. And I do feel the authenticity you can bring to it is worth so much. You <em>want </em>to reach out to the people going through it, to say \u2018I\u2019m with you, let\u2019s hold each other\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Gulati speaks of \u201cfinding another family\u201d in these women. And it is not often you get your hands on a script in which its central characters are fierce and formidable women, she says, and in which so much of the company are strong middle-aged women too.</p> <p>A Tupperware of Ashes dramatises a generation that came to Britain to make new lives, and push their children towards greater opportunities and freedoms. \u201cIt was that pioneering generation of women and men who came here and went through so much for us. They were these massive personalities so when they go, what do they leave? It\u2019s like a big hole. The play is a love story to that generation, without it being obviously so.\u201d</p> <p>If they were a pioneering generation, so are these three. Gulati, a stage and screen dancer-actor, has featured in such revered TV series as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/20/victoria-wood-her-shining-genius-never-stopped-unfurling\">Victoria Wood\u2019s sitcom dinnerladies</a> and Coronation Street; Syal broke barriers with her comedy sketch show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/05/how-we-made-goodness-gracious-me-meera-syal-sanjeev-bhaskar\">Goodness Gracious Me</a>, and Gupta\u2019s plays have been staged across the nation, as well as on radio.</p>    <p>As performers, Gulati and Syal felt like they were among the first flowering of a generation on screen and stage. \u201cDefinitely. It felt like a movement,\u201d says Syal. What hasn\u2019t been dramatised as much, or even spoken about, is the<strong> </strong>racism that their parents faced, and that they saw growing up themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we haven\u2019t really spoken about it, or if we have, it\u2019s been [only] amongst ourselves \u2013 all of it, even what happened in the [most recent] riots,\u201d says Gulati. \u201cI don\u2019t think they [the younger generation] realise how much people fought and how much we have laid the ground.\u201d</p> <p>The play reflects a south Asian experience of dementia in some of the judgments that Queenie\u2019s children face among the community. That resonates with Syal. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get that from people?\u201d she asks the other two. \u201cI did, without them even knowing the circumstances \u2026 I\u2019d think \u2018How dare you, do you know the pain that we\u2019re in?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her father went to live in care after being sectioned \u201cso he didn\u2019t have a choice \u2026 He had Capgras syndrome \u2013 he thought my mum had been replaced by a stranger. That was very painful for a couple that spent 60 years together and were so devoted. For my mother it was heartbreaking, she never got over it, really.\u201d</p> <p>But there is a reason why some are circumspect about residential care, suggests Gulati. \u201cI think the fear is because [many] homes are not built for our communities and that they\u2019re going to be isolated and on their own. After having the experience of coming here, then building your families, your memories, your everything, and then suddenly to be pushed into a place where you have to start again \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a stigma of the home. It\u2019s that [an elderly Asian parent] is once again the only brown person in a white space.\u201d</p> <p>Syal agrees: so much of the nostalgia and celebration in these spaces is about Vera Lynn and the first world war rather than Partition and Bollywood singer Mohammed Rafi.</p> <p>The play has sparks of humour and levity but does not steer away from dark territory, including harrowing aspects of dementia, family fracture and bereavement. \u201cThat\u2019s what stage plays should be about,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cIt\u2019s about really trying to go there with emotions. I often feel very happy when I go into the toilets in the interval, listening to people\u2019s conversations, and if they\u2019re vomiting or crying I\u2019ve done my job. Excellent.\u201d</p>    <p>There are glances at a care system that is dangerously over-stretched. \u201cWhat we are going through at the moment in this country is massive turbulence around the NHS, health care and social care,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s happening every day \u2013 people whose parents are getting ill are having to look after them because they can\u2019t afford to put them into care or even get a carer.\u201d</p> <p>Syal recently bumped into her mother\u2019s former carer while on a day off from rehearsals, at a local garden centre. It was lovely to see her over the potted plants, she says. \u201cIn the midst of all the pain, I was just astonished by the amount of human kindness I came across from carers who were being paid nothing and away from their own families a lot of the time. They\u2019re looking after your parents and they\u2019re away from their parents. It\u2019s kind of incredible. They deserve so much more than we give them.\u201d</p> <p>There were discoveries late in the day for all three that shed new light on their mothers.

      "bodyText": "Meera Syal and Tanika Gupta\u2019s friendship clearly runs deep. They nod in recognition to each other\u2019s anecdotes and speak about being part of the Asian Women Writers\u2019 Collective in the 1990s, when it was a far smaller world for British south Asian writers and actors. So it is not surprising that just before Syal was due to meet the National Theatre\u2019s outgoing director, Rufus Norris, for an ideas meeting, she called on Gupta for anything she might offer him. \u201cHow about you doing Queen Lear?\u201d suggested Gupta, a playwright with a history of adapting the classics, who had transposed Shakespeare\u2019s drama, putting an imperious mother at its centre. Syal phoned Gupta six hours later to say: \u201cHe\u2019s up for it.\u201d Queen Lear has since morphed into Queenie, the central character of A Tupperware of Ashes, now at the National\u2019s Dorfman theatre, with music by Nitin Sawhney. Syal plays a modern-day British Bengali matriarch who runs a Michelin-starred restaurant and, at 68 years old, is diagnosed with early onset dementia. Her three grown children watch her alarming decline. Syal and Gupta are sitting in a back room of the National, along with Shobna Gulati, who plays Queenie\u2019s old friend, Indrani. They talk intimately about the resilience of their own mothers \u2013 about getting to know hidden aspects of their immigrant experiences later in life, writing down their recipes, speaking of their difficult sides and watching them slowly, painfully, get ill and die. Syal and Gulati\u2019s mothers died after suffering from dementia; Gupta\u2019s died from cancer and, towards the end, showed signs of confusion, she says. \u201cA lot of our friends of a certain age were going through a similar thing with our parents,\u201d she adds. The play is infused with a depth of lived experience as a result. Even the snippet of a scene I watch in rehearsals is highly charged, voices wobbling with emotion, including that of director Pooja Ghai, who recently worked with Gupta on The Empress staged by the RSC. Has it hit raw nerves? There has been quite a lot of crying, says Gupta, but for Gulati it has been \u201creassuring and cathartic\u201d. It\u2019s the same for Syal: \u201cMy mum died barely a year ago and I thought when I looked at the play \u2018This is either going to make me or break me\u2019,\u201d she says. Thankfully, it did the former: \u201cI think it might save me years of therapy. And I do feel the authenticity you can bring to it is worth so much. You want to reach out to the people going through it, to say \u2018I\u2019m with you, let\u2019s hold each other\u2019.\u201d Gulati speaks of \u201cfinding another family\u201d in these women. And it is not often you get your hands on a script in which its central characters are fierce and formidable women, she says, and in which so much of the company are strong middle-aged women too. A Tupperware of Ashes dramatises a generation that came to Britain to make new lives, and push their children towards greater opportunities and freedoms. \u201cIt was that pioneering generation of women and men who came here and went through so much for us. They were these massive personalities so when they go, what do they leave? It\u2019s like a big hole. The play is a love story to that generation, without it being obviously so.\u201d If they were a pioneering generation, so are these three. Gulati, a stage and screen dancer-actor, has featured in such revered TV series as Victoria Wood\u2019s sitcom dinnerladies and Coronation Street; Syal broke barriers with her comedy sketch show Goodness Gracious Me, and Gupta\u2019s plays have been staged across the nation, as well as on radio. As performers, Gulati and Syal felt like they were among the first flowering of a generation on screen and stage. \u201cDefinitely. It felt like a movement,\u201d says Syal. What hasn\u2019t been dramatised as much, or even spoken about, is the racism that their parents faced, and that they saw growing up themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we haven\u2019t really spoken about it, or if we have, it\u2019s been [only] amongst ourselves \u2013 all of it, even what happened in the [most recent] riots,\u201d says Gulati. \u201cI don\u2019t think they [the younger generation] realise how much people fought and how much we have laid the ground.\u201d The play reflects a south Asian experience of dementia in some of the judgments that Queenie\u2019s children face among the community. That resonates with Syal. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get that from people?\u201d she asks the other two. \u201cI did, without them even knowing the circumstances \u2026 I\u2019d think \u2018How dare you, do you know the pain that we\u2019re in?\u2019\u201d Her father went to live in care after being sectioned \u201cso he didn\u2019t have a choice \u2026 He had Capgras syndrome \u2013 he thought my mum had been replaced by a stranger. That was very painful for a couple that spent 60 years together and were so devoted. For my mother it was heartbreaking, she never got over it, really.\u201d But there is a reason why some are circumspect about residential care, suggests Gulati. \u201cI think the fear is because [many] homes are not built for our communities and that they\u2019re going to be isolated and on their own. After having the experience of coming here, then building your families, your memories, your everything, and then suddenly to be pushed into a place where you have to start again \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a stigma of the home. It\u2019s that [an elderly Asian parent] is once again the only brown person in a white space.\u201d Syal agrees: so much of the nostalgia and celebration in these spaces is about Vera Lynn and the first world war rather than Partition and Bollywood singer Mohammed Rafi. The play has sparks of humour and levity but does not steer away from dark territory, including harrowing aspects of dementia, family fracture and bereavement. \u201cThat\u2019s what stage plays should be about,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cIt\u2019s about really trying to go there with emotions. I often feel very happy when I go into the toilets in the interval, listening to people\u2019s conversations, and if they\u2019re vomiting or crying I\u2019ve done my job. Excellent.\u201d There are glances at a care system that is dangerously over-stretched. \u201cWhat we are going through at the moment in this country is massive turbulence around the NHS, health care and social care,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s happening every day \u2013 people whose parents are getting ill are having to look after them because they can\u2019t afford to put them into care or even get a carer.\u201d Syal recently bumped into her mother\u2019s former carer while on a day off from rehearsals, at a local garden centre. It was lovely to see her over the potted plants, she says. \u201cIn the midst of all the pain, I was just astonished by the amount of human kindness I came across from carers who were being paid nothing and away from their own families a lot of the time. They\u2019re looking after your parents and they\u2019re away from their parents. It\u2019s kind of incredible. They deserve so much more than we give them.\u201d There were discoveries late in the day for all three that shed new light on their mothers. Gulati covered some of this ground in her 2020 book, Remember Me? Discovering My Mother As She Lost Her Memory. She is still looking through her mother\u2019s stuff: \u201cOh my goodness \u2013 there\u2019s so many things I didn\u2019t know \u2026 We only discover our mothers as women when they\u2019re on their journey away from us. We only then recognise \u2013 or I certainly did \u2013 that these women were the linchpin of the whole family,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen she was towards the end of her life,\u201d says Gupta of her own mother, \u201cshe told me stuff that I didn\u2019t even know about. She talked about racism in the 1960s \u2013 of being attacked in the street, having her sari pulled off her, being called [racist names]. I\u2019d never heard any of this. I\u2019m not sure if she had been ashamed of it [before] \u2013 as if it were her shame.

      "bodyText": "The federal government is understood to be financially assisting some Australians in Lebanon to leave the country as part of an escalated bid to expatriate citizens as Israel begins a ground incursion. Guardian Australia understands Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport \u2013 the only operational commercial airport in Lebanon \u2013 remains open and both Australian passport and visa holders were being assisted on to flights by diplomatic staff. An estimated 15,000 Australians are in Lebanon. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) officials declined to comment, but it is consistent with the standard practice of the Australian government when evacuating citizens from danger zones. In a statement, Dfat urged Australians in Lebanon to take the first opportunity to leave. \u201cPlease do not wait for a preferred route. There are flight cancellations and disruptions, and there is a risk Beirut airport may close for an extended period,\u201d the statement said. The statement said Dfat was working with countries such as Canada and the UK. Australians in Lebanon were encouraged to be prepared to leave quickly or shelter in place for an extended period, with the statement urging them to make sure they had enough supplies and knew where their identity documents were. \"If conditions worsen, we may not be able to assist all Australians remaining in Lebanon.

In 2006, 500 Australians stranded in Beirut were evacuated by boats after previous evacuation attempts failed. That operation was dictated by Israeli authorities, who imposed strict conditions on how it could be carried out. Plans for an emergency evacuation have been in the works for months and include the possible involvement of Australian defence force personnel already deployed to the Middle East, but the current advice remains to leave immediately through existing means. The ADF has not specified the detail or location of these personnel on operational security grounds, but the defence minister, Richard Marles, said last October that three aircraft were in the Middle East to help with potential airlifts. Israel claims to be targeting Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon, where more than 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks, 6,000 wounded and, according to the Lebanese government, one million displaced. About 60,000 Israelis have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel by near constant rocket fire from Hezbollah from the direction of Lebanon into Israel since 8 October 2023. The UK chartered a flight out of Lebanon for British citizens on Tuesday, after David Lammy, the foreign secretary, described the situation as \u201cvolatile\u201d, with the \u201cpotential to deteriorate quickly\u201d. Anthony Albanese again advised any Australians in Lebanon to make contact with Dfat and enact plans to leave as soon as possible. \u201cWe repeat the call for Australians who are in Lebanon to come home,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still commercial opportunities available.

From forests to little urban woods, these sites are open year round for all to enjoy free of charge.</p> <p>More than 40% of the Woodland Trust\u2019s workforce are employed in these woods, bringing years of expert knowledge to their care. The work of the trust\u2019s site manager for Cumbria, Heather Swift, gives an insight into the complexity of restoring the fortunes of the UK\u2019s woodlands. Having worked for the trust since 1990, Swift is tasked with blending her knowledge of woodland ecology and practical conservation techniques to improve the 26 woodlands across her beat. And she has quite a task on her hands.</p> <p>Take just one of her sites \u2013 Great Knott Wood on the shores of Windermere. In the past 10 years, Swift has had to contend with <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> in 2021, ash dieback in 2017, the chill of the \u201cBeast from the East\u201d in 2018 and Storm Arwen in 2021. After Storm Arwen, Swift\u2019s immediate assessment was that as many as 7,000 trees (6,000 tonnes of timber) had been blown down in the wood in a single, devastating 24-hour period.</p> <p>Ideally, the restoration process after such disturbance is to carry out the work gradually and sensitively, with minimal disruption. However, after Storm Arwen, catastrophic windblow covered the ground on a massive scale with huge trees swamping plants, young trees, streams, and all ancient woodland features. With virtually no mature trees left, it became difficult and hazardous to tackle the issue with small-scale operations. This is where heavy machinery, such as harvesters \u2013 machines that can pick up and process whole trees, with the operator safe in a cab \u2013 were brought in. Though this wasn\u2019t ideal, it became necessary in order to save the next generation of trees.</p> <p>To give the woodland a boost, Swift also coordinated the planting of 26,000 saplings of a variety of native trees, all sourced from the UK. But with <a href=\"https://www.countryfile.com/wildlife/mammals/deer-culling-in-britain\" rel=\"nofollow\">the UK\u2019s deer population now estimated to be at its highest level for 1,000 years</a>, these young trees needed to be protected \u2013 whether by large exclosures, a new type of biodegradable tree guard or with deer repellent spray.</p>    <p>Darren Moorcroft, chief executive of the Woodland Trust, is determined that the charity\u2019s expertise and influence should reach well beyond its own woodland.

Shortly before it was published, the Taliban recaptured Kabul; over the months that followed, these same women kept in touch with one another on WhatsApp, and a chronological selection of their messages \u2013 despairing, hopeful, fascinatingly detailed and fiercely brave \u2013 has been published as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/13/my-dear-kabul-review-memoir-year-in-life-of-an-afghan-womens-writing-group\">My Dear Kabul</a>. Their experiences diverged sharply; some remained in Afghanistan, grimly learning to adapt to the encroaching restrictions (one ruefully congratulates herself for having kept her expensive, body-concealing chador from the previous Taliban occupation, 20 years before); others managed to leave, settling as refugees in countries as disparate as Iran and Australia, struggling to restart their lives in a new language and without their wider families. But the common thread is their desire to carry on writing, to tell their stories with clarity and precision. It\u2019s a deeply humbling read.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/14/a-memoir-of-my-former-self-by-hilary-mantel-review-b-sides-and-rarities\">A Memoir of My Former Self</a> by Hilary Mantel is a wide-ranging collection of her non-fiction and is pure enjoyment from start to finish. It includes wonderfully incisive film reviews, fervent essays on neglected writers, moving yet witty memoirs, riveting, if slightly random, magazine pieces (who\u2019d have guessed Mantel was such an authority on perfume?) and, best of all, in my opinion, her Reith lectures on the role that history plays in our culture. I wanted to make a note of every line.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/25/small-bomb-at-dimperley-by-lissa-evans-review-a-deeply-pleasurable-postwar-tale\">Small Bomb at Dimperley</a> by Lissa Evans is published by Doubleday (\u00a318.99).

I just looked at him with my mouth open \u2013 I had no words. *** Lissa Evans, author Last year I read an acclaimed collection of new stories by Afghan women writers, entitled My Pen Is the Wing of a Bird. Shortly before it was published, the Taliban recaptured Kabul; over the months that followed, these same women kept in touch with one another on WhatsApp, and a chronological selection of their messages \u2013 despairing, hopeful, fascinatingly detailed and fiercely brave \u2013 has been published as My Dear Kabul. Their experiences diverged sharply; some remained in Afghanistan, grimly learning to adapt to the encroaching restrictions (one ruefully congratulates herself for having kept her expensive, body-concealing chador from the previous Taliban occupation, 20 years before); others managed to leave, settling as refugees in countries as disparate as Iran and Australia, struggling to restart their lives in a new language and without their wider families. But the common thread is their desire to carry on writing, to tell their stories with clarity and precision. It\u2019s a deeply humbling read. A Memoir of My Former Self by Hilary Mantel is a wide-ranging collection of her non-fiction and is pure enjoyment from start to finish. It includes wonderfully incisive film reviews, fervent essays on neglected writers, moving yet witty memoirs, riveting, if slightly random, magazine pieces (who\u2019d have guessed Mantel was such an authority on perfume?) and, best of all, in my opinion, her Reith lectures on the role that history plays in our culture. I wanted to make a note of every line. \u2022 Small Bomb at Dimperley by Lissa Evans is published by Doubleday (\u00a318.99). To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply. *** John, Guardian reader I have been reading Rosarita by Anita Desai, described by the author as \u201ca fragment\u201d. The writing is vivid, unhurried. It is concerned with the unreliability of memory, an ambivalent search for a hidden part of someone\u2019s life. When I finished it I was moved, and wished it hadn\u2019t ended. I\u2019ll certainly read it again.",

One such collection is Peter Gizzi\u2019s Fierce Elegy, which in \u201cits beautiful, fiery insistence \u2026 redeclares the elegy as the undying practice of the living\u201d, wrote Oluwaseun Olayiwola in the Guardian. Among the shortlisted poetry \u201cthere is also humour, intimacy, joy and energy,\u201d said Khalvati. \u201cPoems to make you well up, to inspire you to write, and most of all to invite you to read\u201d. British poet Antrobus made the shortlist for his fourth collection \u2013 Signs, Music \u2013 which is about fatherhood and masculinity. \u201cAntrobus captures ordinary life with an episodic, unconstrained energy,\u201d wrote Kit Fan in the Guardian. McCarthy Woolf, who is of English and Jamaican heritage, was selected for her verse novel Top Doll, while American poet Phillips, who won the Pulitzer prize for poetry in 2023, was shortlisted for Scattered Snows, to the North, which Fan described as a \u201cpitch-perfect\u201d collection about love, death and memory. Odubanjo\u2019s posthumously published first collection takes as its starting point the September 2001 discovery of the remains of an unidentified Black child, \u201cAdam\u201d, in the River Thames. \u201cThe entire book is in part about what it is to be a missing person \u2013 and it seems an unprocessable tragedy to learn that Odubanjo himself at the end of his life went missing and was discovered to have accidentally drowned in a lake,\u201d wrote Kate Kellaway in her Observer review. Odubanjo\u2019s body was found in a lake five days after he was last seen on 26 August 2023. In an inquest, his death was ruled as an accident. More than \u00a380,000 has been raised through a fundraiser organised by his family and friends, part of which will help fund the Gboyega Odubanjo Foundation, aimed at supporting low-income Black writers. Completing the shortlist are Lapwing by Hannah Copley, Eleanor Among the Saints by Rachel Mann, The Penny Dropping by Helen Farish, High Jump as Icarus Story by Gustav Parker Hibbett and Rhizodont by Katrina Porteous. The 10 shortlisted poets will read from their work at an event at the Southbank Centre on 12 January, and the winner will be announced the following day. Joining Khalvati on this year\u2019s judging panel is Anthony Joseph, who won the prize in 2022, and Hannah Sullivan, who won in 2018. Other past winners include Don Paterson (twice), Ted Hughes, Anne Carson, Carol Ann Duffy, Derek Walcott and Ocean Vuong. In 2023, Jason Allen-Paisant won the prize for his 7, Self-Portrait As Othello.",

It is thorough: at 271 pages, it contains a robust and factual accounting of the vice-presidential candidate\u2019s public statements and associations going back years. As such, it offers a unique perspective into how the Trump campaign views the race \u2013 and how they understand the controversial man who is now in their No 2 spot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/27/donald-trump-kamala-harris-men-women-us-election\">It\u2019s not just Trump v Harris: America\u2019s men and women are also locked in battle now | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the document, a litany of everything the Trump camp thinks is wrong with Vance, is maybe most revealing for what it omits: there is almost nothing about his comments on women, and nothing at all about his extensive, repeated and impassioned hatred for childless women, including the \u201ccat ladies\u201d comment that has been Vance\u2019s stickiest scandal and perhaps his greatest contribution to the campaign thus far. The comments that provoked the ire of thousands of women \u2013 including no less influential a figure than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/11/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-president-us-debate-cat-lady\">Taylor Swift</a> \u2013 and turned the race partly into a referendum on the purpose and value of women\u2019s lives were nowhere to be found in the document.</p> <p>Instead, the dossier was largely focused on comments by Vance that make him vulnerable with an audience of one: that is, his past <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/29/jd-vance-trump-comments\">negative statements</a> about Trump.</p> <p>The mainstream news organizations that declined to publish this hacked document justified this decision by saying that much of the information was not newsworthy. If this is their standard, it seems to be a new one: in 2016, when Russian-backed hackers obtained emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign, one of the disclosures included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/election-news-recap-trump-clinton-emails-allegations\">risotto cooking tips</a> from campaign chair John Podesta. (He says that adding the liquid slowly helps the rice become creamier, in case you\u2019re interested.) But the Vance dossier <em>is</em> newsworthy, though not because of what it reveals about Vance. What the document says about Vance himself is largely a matter of public record. What is newsworthy, instead, is what the document exposes about the Trump campaign\u2019s priorities.</p> <p>The dossier concerns many worries that Vance is not conservative <em>enough</em>. It also seems preoccupied with how the Ohio senator has wounded Trump\u2019s ego. The absence of Vance\u2019s extreme gender views from the document suggests that the Trump campaign did not understand his comments on women to even be controversial: they don\u2019t seem to have thought that it would come up.</p> <p>Maybe the Trump campaign is staffed with people, including the apparatchiks who do its vetting, who have so little exposure to feminism (or, perhaps, to women more broadly) that it simply did not occur to them that anyone would find Vance\u2019s ravings about women offensive. Maybe the Trump camp made the calculation \u2013 one certainly not exclusive to the political right \u2013 that women\u2019s investment in their own rights is partial and unserious, and that they would not be moved by gendered insults to their dignity in anything like meaningful numbers. Maybe they assumed that gender politics is now a man\u2019s game, and that appeals to masculine woundedness and grievance now carry much more sway than appeals to women\u2019s rights do. If this is what they think \u2013 that misogyny can be an asset for them but never a liability \u2013 it would certainly explain some of their actions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/23/us-election-harris-campaign-juggles-joy-gravity\">As the election looms, can Harris\u2019s campaign juggle joy with a sense of gravity? | Osita Nwanevu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the salience of the comments also signals something else that has changed this election: Trump no longer solely sets the terms of the conversation. Trump\u2019s ability to command attention and to dictate the news cycle has noticeably waned this term \u2013 think, for instance, of how quickly and decisively each of his not one but two assassination attempts disappeared from the front pages, and how little an impact they seem to have ultimately had on his support.

      "bodyText": "The public got a peek into the inner workings of the Trump campaign last week, when the independent journalist Ken Klippenstein did what major news outlets refused to: he published the opposition research dossier on JD Vance\u2019s electoral vulnerabilities that was written by the Trump campaign in the lead-up to the VP announcement. The dossier, which was obtained in a hack thought to have been perpetrated by Iranian state interests, would have been compiled by Donald Trump\u2019s camp as part of a routine vetting process as the Republican campaign surveilled possible VP picks and assessed their strengths and weaknesses. It is thorough: at 271 pages, it contains a robust and factual accounting of the vice-presidential candidate\u2019s public statements and associations going back years. As such, it offers a unique perspective into how the Trump campaign views the race \u2013 and how they understand the controversial man who is now in their No 2 spot. But the document, a litany of everything the Trump camp thinks is wrong with Vance, is maybe most revealing for what it omits: there is almost nothing about his comments on women, and nothing at all about his extensive, repeated and impassioned hatred for childless women, including the \u201ccat ladies\u201d comment that has been Vance\u2019s stickiest scandal and perhaps his greatest contribution to the campaign thus far. The comments that provoked the ire of thousands of women \u2013 including no less influential a figure than Taylor Swift \u2013 and turned the race partly into a referendum on the purpose and value of women\u2019s lives were nowhere to be found in the document. Instead, the dossier was largely focused on comments by Vance that make him vulnerable with an audience of one: that is, his past negative statements about Trump. The mainstream news organizations that declined to publish this hacked document justified this decision by saying that much of the information was not newsworthy. If this is their standard, it seems to be a new one: in 2016, when Russian-backed hackers obtained emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign, one of the disclosures included risotto cooking tips from campaign chair John Podesta. (He says that adding the liquid slowly helps the rice become creamier, in case you\u2019re interested.) But the Vance dossier is newsworthy, though not because of what it reveals about Vance. What the document says about Vance himself is largely a matter of public record. What is newsworthy, instead, is what the document exposes about the Trump campaign\u2019s priorities. The dossier concerns many worries that Vance is not conservative enough. It also seems preoccupied with how the Ohio senator has wounded Trump\u2019s ego. The absence of Vance\u2019s extreme gender views from the document suggests that the Trump campaign did not understand his comments on women to even be controversial: they don\u2019t seem to have thought that it would come up. Maybe the Trump campaign is staffed with people, including the apparatchiks who do its vetting, who have so little exposure to feminism (or, perhaps, to women more broadly) that it simply did not occur to them that anyone would find Vance\u2019s ravings about women offensive. Maybe the Trump camp made the calculation \u2013 one certainly not exclusive to the political right \u2013 that women\u2019s investment in their own rights is partial and unserious, and that they would not be moved by gendered insults to their dignity in anything like meaningful numbers. Maybe they assumed that gender politics is now a man\u2019s game, and that appeals to masculine woundedness and grievance now carry much more sway than appeals to women\u2019s rights do. If this is what they think \u2013 that misogyny can be an asset for them but never a liability \u2013 it would certainly explain some of their actions. But the salience of the comments also signals something else that has changed this election: Trump no longer solely sets the terms of the conversation. Trump\u2019s ability to command attention and to dictate the news cycle has noticeably waned this term \u2013 think, for instance, of how quickly and decisively each of his not one but two assassination attempts disappeared from the front pages, and how little an impact they seem to have ultimately had on his support. Trump has been unable to get a nickname to stick to Kamala Harris; he has been unsuccessful in his efforts to generate vulgar distractions about her sexual history or the authenticity of her racial identity. So far, all he has managed to do is spread lurid and racist lies that have made life hell for the residents of Springfield, Ohio. Trump\u2019s vulgarity, his hysterics, his domineering indifference to the truth \u2013 all these used to fascinate voters, or at least the national media. But Trump has lost his juice. Which brings us to the other reason why the dossier may not have contained many of Vance\u2019s most potent vulnerabilities: perhaps Trump\u2019s staff overlooked them because they assumed that they would be able to generate the narrative on their own, assuming that it was they, and they alone, who would dictate what the media covered and what the public cared about.

      "body": "<p>Palestinians are used to being unheard. The 1917 Balfour Declaration committed Great Britain to creating a Jewish state in Palestine without mentioning the people who comprised the majority of the people living there. At least four United Nations resolutions of monumental consequence to Palestine \u2013 including the ones that established the borders of Israel in 1948 and expanded those borders after the 1967 war \u2013 were passed by a body that still does not recognize a sovereign Palestinian entity, much less a state, with voting-member status.</p> <p>Numerous <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781627798556/thehundredyearswaronpalestine\">bilateral agreements</a> between Israel and its neighbors spelled out the Palestinians\u2019 fate but did not include them in the negotiations.

The Gazans, he said, \u201cdidn\u2019t ask for this war that Hamas started\u201d. Meanwhile, he evinces impotence to deliver what Gaza is asking for, in the voices of wailing mothers and the images of flattened cities: an end to it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When a definitive 'no' reached the demonstrators camping in wait outside the arena, they were deflated if not surprised.

After months of negotiations with the people who organized 700,000 primary voters to withhold their endorsements of Biden until he vowed to force an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza by stopping arms shipments, the convention denied a five-minute speaking slot to one Palestinian. After welcoming such deplorables as Georgia\u2019s mercilessly anti-abortion <a href=\"https://sbaprolife.org/representative/jeff-duncan\">former Republican lieutenant</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/21/tony-west-dnc-speech-video/74895787007/\">chief legal officer</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/11/uber-funds-new-lobbying-group-to-deny-rights-for-gig-workers\">union-busting Uber</a> to the stage, there was no more room under the big tent.</p> <p>When a definitive \u201cno\u201d reached the demonstrators camping in wait outside the arena, they were deflated if not surprised. For some, enough was enough. Muslim Women for Harris immediately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/22/muslim-women-kamala-harris-disbands\">disbanded</a>. \u201cSomething kind of snapped,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8EWN23GjO0\">said</a> Georgia state representative Ruwa Romman, the slated speaker. Romman was not in Chicago for the convention, by the way. She was at a conference scheduled to coincide with it, on a panel called Voices You Will Not Hear at the Convention.</p> <p>After Chicago, uncommitted movement activists huddled over what to do next. Despite the rebuff, the convention was hardly a bust. The movement sent 30 uncommitted delegates; 300 Harris delegates declared themselves ceasefire delegates. The panel on Palestinian human rights was among the best attended events. Some of the biggest applause followed condemnations of Israel\u2019s assaults and support for Palestinian liberation. People were milling around in anti-war T-shirts and keffiyehs.</p> <p>These activists may have been uncommitted primary voters and delegates, but they were committed enough Democrats to stump before the primary and run as delegates. The movement had \u201cmobilized people of [conscience] previously apathetic to the democratic process to civically engage in this election\u201d, the uncommitted <a href=\"https://www.uncommittedmovement.com/\">website</a> states. \u201cWe cannot afford to have this base permanently disillusioned or alienated in November.\u201d They\u2019re as scared shitless as every other sentient human about a second Trump presidency. The struggle continues.</p> <p>Intense debate produced a plan. Uncommitted primary voters had sent a loud message through what they did not say. The strategy continues: turn around a history of being silenced by deploying the power of silence. To pressure the Harris-Walz campaign to signal that a new Democratic administration would assume a new stance toward Israel, uncommitted declined to endorse the ticket. Instead, it is urging people to vote \u201cagainst Trump\u201d and fascism, and not for a third party, a de facto vote for Trump. This will not be easy; canvassers on the streets are encountering reliable Democratic voters, especially the young, brown or Black, waffling about going to the polls at all. But any experienced anti-war activist knows how hard it is to end a war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/27/israel-lebanon-gaza-war-biden\">The US cannot allow Israel to turn Lebanon into a second Gaza | Mohamad Bazzi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the Democrats, the decision to censor the Palestinian voice was not just morally wrong. It was politically stupid. The Harris campaign must know that of those three-quarters of a million uncommitted ballots, 100,000 came from Michigan, the state that is home to the country\u2019s largest Arab American community and that Biden won by 154,000 votes in 2020.

      "bodyText": "Palestinians are used to being unheard. The 1917 Balfour Declaration committed Great Britain to creating a Jewish state in Palestine without mentioning the people who comprised the majority of the people living there. At least four United Nations resolutions of monumental consequence to Palestine \u2013 including the ones that established the borders of Israel in 1948 and expanded those borders after the 1967 war \u2013 were passed by a body that still does not recognize a sovereign Palestinian entity, much less a state, with voting-member status. Numerous bilateral agreements between Israel and its neighbors spelled out the Palestinians\u2019 fate but did not include them in the negotiations. Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 \u201cdeal of the century\u201d was a Hanukah gift to Benjamin Netanyahu that, among other things, opened the way for Israel\u2019s annexation of the West Bank and canceled the Palestinians\u2019 right of return. Since the assault on Gaza began, Joe Biden has been unable to acknowledge the horrors on the ground without asserting his administration\u2019s \u201crock-solid and unwavering\u201d support of Israel. The US president\u2019s rare expressions of sympathy for the people under the bombs elide cause or solution. A short passage about civilian death and displacement in his 2024 State of the Union address ended with: \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d To the UN general assembly in September he declared: \u201cInnocent civilians in Gaza are also going through hell ... Too many families displaced, crowding in tents, facing a dire humanitarian situation.\u201d He named only one agent of the devastation. The Gazans, he said, \u201cdidn\u2019t ask for this war that Hamas started\u201d. Meanwhile, he evinces impotence to deliver what Gaza is asking for, in the voices of wailing mothers and the images of flattened cities: an end to it. So the 2024 Democratic national convention was neither the first nor the worst time Palestinians had been erased by somebody claiming to be on their side. After months of negotiations with the people who organized 700,000 primary voters to withhold their endorsements of Biden until he vowed to force an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza by stopping arms shipments, the convention denied a five-minute speaking slot to one Palestinian. After welcoming such deplorables as Georgia\u2019s mercilessly anti-abortion former Republican lieutenant and the chief legal officer of the union-busting Uber to the stage, there was no more room under the big tent. When a definitive \u201cno\u201d reached the demonstrators camping in wait outside the arena, they were deflated if not surprised. For some, enough was enough. Muslim Women for Harris immediately disbanded. \u201cSomething kind of snapped,\u201d said Georgia state representative Ruwa Romman, the slated speaker. Romman was not in Chicago for the convention, by the way. She was at a conference scheduled to coincide with it, on a panel called Voices You Will Not Hear at the Convention. After Chicago, uncommitted movement activists huddled over what to do next. Despite the rebuff, the convention was hardly a bust. The movement sent 30 uncommitted delegates; 300 Harris delegates declared themselves ceasefire delegates. The panel on Palestinian human rights was among the best attended events. Some of the biggest applause followed condemnations of Israel\u2019s assaults and support for Palestinian liberation. People were milling around in anti-war T-shirts and keffiyehs. These activists may have been uncommitted primary voters and delegates, but they were committed enough Democrats to stump before the primary and run as delegates. The movement had \u201cmobilized people of [conscience] previously apathetic to the democratic process to civically engage in this election\u201d, the uncommitted website states. \u201cWe cannot afford to have this base permanently disillusioned or alienated in November.\u201d They\u2019re as scared shitless as every other sentient human about a second Trump presidency. The struggle continues. Intense debate produced a plan. Uncommitted primary voters had sent a loud message through what they did not say. The strategy continues: turn around a history of being silenced by deploying the power of silence. To pressure the Harris-Walz campaign to signal that a new Democratic administration would assume a new stance toward Israel, uncommitted declined to endorse the ticket. Instead, it is urging people to vote \u201cagainst Trump\u201d and fascism, and not for a third party, a de facto vote for Trump. This will not be easy; canvassers on the streets are encountering reliable Democratic voters, especially the young, brown or Black, waffling about going to the polls at all. But any experienced anti-war activist knows how hard it is to end a war. For the Democrats, the decision to censor the Palestinian voice was not just morally wrong. It was politically stupid. The Harris campaign must know that of those three-quarters of a million uncommitted ballots, 100,000 came from Michigan, the state that is home to the country\u2019s largest Arab American community and that Biden won by 154,000 votes in 2020. Critical to Harris\u2019s victory, Michigan is considered a toss-up. Aside from stupid, it was unnecessary. In May, Data for Progress found that seven in 10 likely voters, including 83% of Democrats, supported a permanent ceasefire. A majority of Democrats believed Israel is committing genocide. More recently, a poll by the Arab American Institute showed \u201csignificant gain and very little risk for Harris\u201d in demanding Israel agree to an immediate ceasefire or calling for a suspension of US arms shipments. Either stand would increase her support by at least five percentage points, pulling in reluctant and undecided voters, including a plurality of Jewish Democrats, AAI says. As the Israel Defense Forces pummel Beirut and bulldoze shops, schools and sewer pipes in the West Bank \u2013 punishing unnumbered civilians in pursuit of unnamed terrorists \u2013 the US is shocked and confused when the Israeli prime minister raises a middle finger to another temporary truce, this one with Hezbollah. On the front page of Sunday\u2019s New York Times, Paris bureau chief Roger Cohen rehearses the tautology behind this passivity. \u201cThe United States does have enduring leverage over Israel,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut an ironclad alliance \u2026 built around strategic and domestic political considerations \u2026 means Washington will almost certainly never threaten to cut \u2013 let alone cut off \u2013 the flow of arms.\u201d The world\u2019s most powerful nation cannot use its leverage because it won\u2019t use its leverage. A President Kamala Harris could use it. But first she needs to get elected. And to get elected, she\u2019d better open her ears to the silent din \u2013 and speak up fast.

A number of groups have organised a protest in London, the March for Clean Water, over the state of the water industry and the impact of pollution on English rivers, on Sunday November 3. Reed has rejected taking the industry back into public ownership. Instead he is introducing measures to ban bonuses for water chief executives, beef up the regulators and introduce tougher penalties, including prison, for water companies. But Matt Staniek of Save Windermere said: \u201cThe government is trying to distract us from one simple fact: they already have numerous laws and powers at their disposal right now, which they are choosing not to enforce, and special administration is one of them. \u201cThe water industry has consistently breached its statutory obligations, and Labour could place it into special administration on this basis alone. Doing so would halt the extraction of dividends and the servicing of debt at the expense of captive customers.\u201d Ofwat, the industry regulator, has blocked plans by English water companies to raise customers\u2019 bills by more than 40% in some cases to fund record investment of \u00a3100bn. Instead the regulator, in its first assessment of the spending plans for 2025-30, ruled the companies could spend \u00a388bn over the five-year period, \u00a316bn less than they requested, which would be recovered from bills. Special administration can be triggered if a company cannot pay its debts or is not performing its statutory requirements, which include treating sewage. It was updated by the last parliament to bring it into line with modern insolvency legislation. In a joint statement the campaigners said: \u201cWe urge the government to exercise the legislative powers granted under the Water Industry Act 1991 by initiating special administration procedures for Thames Water. This action would serve as a critical measure to halt the diversion of customer payments to shareholder dividends, hold failing company bosses accountable and allow the government to focus on the necessary reforms to address the systemic issues within the water industry more broadly.\u201d A spokesperson for the government said: \u201cThe government is closely monitoring Thames Water\u2019s situation and the company remains stable.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2024 to clarify that it is the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs who has the power to trigger special administration.",

As the first contained adaptation, told in just under two hours rather than spread across multiple episodes, Salem\u2019s Lot can feel a little rushed, failing to flesh out the central town and the people who live in it (made in 2021, it also has the unmistakable feeling of a Covid-19 production with very few highly populated scenes, a problem when you\u2019re trying to focus a film on the importance of community). The central romance is blandly developed with such speed that I kept worrying I\u2019d missed a chunk (I\u2019m sure many more scenes can be found on the cutting room floor) and while Dauberman manages a handful of effective moments (a morgue scramble with a homemade cross and a drive-in movie light trick are particularly good), he\u2019s never able to capture the slow, escalating dread that a story such as this demands. It\u2019s always nice to see actors like Woodard, Hickey and Camp get slightly meatier roles in genre fare like this but the film is hampered by an obsession with shock deaths, which grow less shocking and more frustrating, the stop-start rhythm making it hard for us to invest in anyone or anything. There\u2019s nothing here to root for or care about and so we\u2019re left to focus on the horror over the drama, which is only mildly diverting at best. King, who has a habit of over-praising certain films and shows on social media, posted about the film back in February, saying that it\u2019s not \u201cembarrassing or anything\u201d, the faintest of praise. He\u2019s right, it isn\u2019t embarrassing but it also isn\u2019t really anything either. Salem\u2019s Lot is available on Max in the US on 3 October and in UK cinemas on 11 October",

It has come to this column\u2019s attention that, in recent years, some sections of the global rugby union community have not always given the Springboks sufficient credit.

Let\u2019s just say the evidence is increasingly indisputable: Erasmus and co are showing the aforementioned global rugby community the way forward. Whether their rivals are willing to acknowledge it or not, the Springboks are threatening to become \u2013 if they are not there already \u2013 the professional era\u2019s most consistent winning machine. Yes, the All Blacks hoisted two World Cups in a row, in 2011 and 2015, and won Rugby Championships for fun, but even they never possessed the sheer weight of simultaneous silverware that this Bok squad are amassing.</p> <p>Double World Cup winners, Rugby Championship winners, Lions series winners. It is a deeply impressive list. South Africa\u2019s latest title, clinched on Saturday with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/28/south-africa-argentina-rugby-championship-match-report\">a 48-7 smashing of Argentina in Nelspruit</a>, was all the more admirable because of the logistical hurdles their players now have to overcome. It cannot be remotely easy to gel a squad that play their club rugby all over the world and whose top players are pulled from pillar to goalpost. If they are not flying to Argentina or South Africa&nbsp;with the national team, they are shuttling between hemispheres with their domestic franchises, seeking to carve a niche&nbsp;for themselves in the United Rugby Championship and the Champions&nbsp;Cup.</p> <p>Somehow, despite all those air miles, they are still getting the job done on multiple fronts, driven on by a group of senior players whose strength of character seems inexhaustible. On Saturday Etzebeth became the most capped Springbok of all time and yet still has a tell-tale glint in his eye. Siya Kolisi may not have settled at Racing 92 but he remains a colossus of a captain and an inspiration to millions. Pieter-Steph du Toit, Jesse Kriel, Cheslin Kolbe, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Kwagga Smith: there are some remarkable individuals in this Springbok squad before you even get anywhere near the front row.</p> <p>Erasmus also deserves his fair share of praise. His role has varied over the years, with Jacques Nienaber the official head coach at the last World Cup, but the former\u2019s influence has remained all pervasive. He shows little sign of easing up, either, as he seeks to increase the depth of the Boks\u2019 squad. They may have lost narrowly in Argentina the previous weekend but Erasmus, in choosing to back Manie Libbok despite his crucial late miss from the tee, managed a potentially tricky situation expertly. Again.</p> <p>In Ireland, at this juncture, they will point to last July\u2019s second Test when the Boks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/13/ciaran-frawley-south-africa-ireland-rugby-union-international-match-report\">were beaten 25-24</a> having won the first Test the previous week. It also remains to be seen which of the two squads will finish this calendar year as the world\u2019s officially top-ranked team. But the area in which South Africa are proving truly exceptional is in winning the games that really matter and the odds on them collecting an unprecedented third straight World Cup in 2027 are shortening steadily.</p>    <p>On top of the forward steel and defensive intensity that has underpinned the current Bok squad they are also now grafting on an all-court attacking game. It was always likely the influential Tony Brown would have a positive impact as attack coach but, allied to that, there is now some serious depth. When you consider Erasmus has already picked 49 different players this year in addition to the number of other talented South Africans plying their trade in Japan, France and England, it sums up their growing strength across the board.</p> <p>The only glimmer of hope for their rivals, perhaps, is that one or two of the older warhorses cannot soldier on for ever. Etzebeth, having edged past Victor Matfield with his 128th cap, is about to turn 33 and Damian de Allende will do likewise in November. Willie le Roux is 35 and Bongi Mbonambi, Frans Malherbe and Kolisi will all be turning 34 next year.</p> <p>Then again, you would not currently bet against the durable Etzebeth batting on past 150 caps, such is the evident relish with which he is now playing. Ox Nch\u00e9 is perhaps the most effective prop in the world at the moment and the astonishing Du Toit goes from strength to strength. Damian Willemse will be fit again for the November Tests and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu looks like a young fly-half with the potential to be around for years. As Scotland, England and Wales may well discover this autumn: this is no ordinary Springbok squad.</p> <p><strong><em>This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

If they are not flying to Argentina or South Africa with the national team, they are shuttling between hemispheres with their domestic franchises, seeking to carve a niche for themselves in the United Rugby Championship and the Champions Cup. Somehow, despite all those air miles, they are still getting the job done on multiple fronts, driven on by a group of senior players whose strength of character seems inexhaustible. On Saturday Etzebeth became the most capped Springbok of all time and yet still has a tell-tale glint in his eye. Siya Kolisi may not have settled at Racing 92 but he remains a colossus of a captain and an inspiration to millions. Pieter-Steph du Toit, Jesse Kriel, Cheslin Kolbe, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Kwagga Smith: there are some remarkable individuals in this Springbok squad before you even get anywhere near the front row. Erasmus also deserves his fair share of praise. His role has varied over the years, with Jacques Nienaber the official head coach at the last World Cup, but the former\u2019s influence has remained all pervasive. He shows little sign of easing up, either, as he seeks to increase the depth of the Boks\u2019 squad. They may have lost narrowly in Argentina the previous weekend but Erasmus, in choosing to back Manie Libbok despite his crucial late miss from the tee, managed a potentially tricky situation expertly. Again. In Ireland, at this juncture, they will point to last July\u2019s second Test when the Boks were beaten 25-24 having won the first Test the previous week. It also remains to be seen which of the two squads will finish this calendar year as the world\u2019s officially top-ranked team. But the area in which South Africa are proving truly exceptional is in winning the games that really matter and the odds on them collecting an unprecedented third straight World Cup in 2027 are shortening steadily. On top of the forward steel and defensive intensity that has underpinned the current Bok squad they are also now grafting on an all-court attacking game. It was always likely the influential Tony Brown would have a positive impact as attack coach but, allied to that, there is now some serious depth. When you consider Erasmus has already picked 49 different players this year in addition to the number of other talented South Africans plying their trade in Japan, France and England, it sums up their growing strength across the board. The only glimmer of hope for their rivals, perhaps, is that one or two of the older warhorses cannot soldier on for ever. Etzebeth, having edged past Victor Matfield with his 128th cap, is about to turn 33 and Damian de Allende will do likewise in November. Willie le Roux is 35 and Bongi Mbonambi, Frans Malherbe and Kolisi will all be turning 34 next year. Then again, you would not currently bet against the durable Etzebeth batting on past 150 caps, such is the evident relish with which he is now playing. Ox Nch\u00e9 is perhaps the most effective prop in the world at the moment and the astonishing Du Toit goes from strength to strength. Damian Willemse will be fit again for the November Tests and Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu looks like a young fly-half with the potential to be around for years. As Scotland, England and Wales may well discover this autumn: this is no ordinary Springbok squad. This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

      "bodyText": "The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, has launched an 11th hour bid to stand down controversial north Queensland mayor Troy Thompson as the Labor state government enters caretaker mode and faces an uphill state reelection campaign. Miles\u2019 office confirmed on Tuesday it had sent a show cause to the Townsville mayor. Thompson has three weeks to respond but made his feelings known on social media on Tuesday, sharing his written response to local government minister, Meaghan Scanlon. \u201cPut simply this is a political hit job by this Labor government,\u201d he wrote. The premier issued the show cause to stand down Thompson for 12 months while the corruption watchdog investigates claims he embellished his military service during his local government campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve consistently said that if Mr Thompson cares about Townsville in the way he claims to, the best thing for Townsville would be for him to stand down,\u201d Miles said in a statement. \u201cHe had refused to do so and it is clear to me the situation in Townsville is getting worse, not better.\u201d The letter accuses Thompson of risking the welfare of Townsville council staff and damaging confidence in local government. It also alleges he has hampered the council in performing its responsibilities to local residents efficiently and effectively as well as unreasonably diverting its resources. Thompson rejected the allegations, saying he would seek a supreme court injunction \u201cshould any adverse action be taken\u201d by the government. \u201cThese allegations have not been tested in a court of law, and it appears the Labor government is attempting to subvert natural justice,\u201d he posted on Facebook. Thompson also questioned the legitimacy of the notice, claiming it had been sent \u201cduring the caretaker period\u201d. Thompson\u2019s claims about his military service history are being investigated by the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC), including his time in the SAS. The former One Nation candidate, who won office in March with the backing of conspiracy theory group My Place Townsville (MPT), has admitted to embellishing his military record, and also that he \u201cnever completed\u201d university as he had claimed during the campaign. All 10 of the city\u2019s councillors have publicly called on their mayor to stand down. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email LNP opposition leader, David Crisafulli, told reporters on Monday that he wanted to \u201csee the legal advice\u201d but maintained Thompson\u2019s position as mayor was \u201cuntenable\u201d. \u201cI know the frustration in that city, I\u2019m seeing it, feeling it and about it from hearing from mates,\u201d he said. \u201cI do believe his position is untenable.\u201d Guardian Australia understands that Miles would seek further legal advice after receiving Thompson\u2019s response. He will need a bipartisan agreement with Crisafulli to stand down the mayor from caretaker government, or wait until after the next administration is sworn in following the 26 October election. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Miles said he anticipated Thompson would seek a supreme court injunction to fight his being stood down. \u201cThat is something that would be open to him and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he does pursue those avenues,\u201d Miles said. \u201cI think that would be a shame for Townsville.\u201d Despite months of pressure on Thompson, Miles said he had not previously sought to force the mayor from office out of consideration of the legal principle of innocence until proven guilty. But Miles chose to launch the last-ditch bid to give Thompson the boot after receiving advice from the CCC last week that its investigation could take \u201cmany, many more months\u201d. The premier said his hand was forced after he consulted with local MPs \u2013 including Katter\u2019s Australian party\u2019s Nick Dametto \u2013 who told him the situation at council was becoming \u201ceven more dysfunctional\u201d. \u201cThey all thought that if there was action that could be taken it should be taken,\u201d he said. On Sunday, Thompson responded to Miles\u2019 plans to issue show cause on social media. \u201cLet me be unequivocal: there is no justifiable cause for such an action,\u201d Thompson wrote on social media. \u201cThis would not only be an attack on a political rival but also an affront to the democratic rights of the residents of Townsville. -With reporting by Australian Associated Press",

      "body": "<h2>Me and Bobby McGee (1970)</h2> <p>One of the great American songs \u2013 evident from those who have covered it, including Janis Joplin, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and the Grateful Dead \u2013 was written by Kris Kristofferson and first a hit for Roger Miller. It\u2019s a perfect road song, inspired by Fellini\u2019s La Strada, and encapsulates Kristofferson\u2019s voice: bruised and desolate, but romantic and hopeful, with a markedly masculine streak. (Kristofferson neither looked nor sounded metrosexual; his sensitivity was not uncomplicated.) It\u2019s hard to imagine a song with such a perfect opening verse (\u201cBusted flat in Baton Rouge \u2026 feelin\u2019 near as faded as my jeans\u201d) could deliver on its setup, but Me and Bobby McGee does, with its single devastating line: \u201cFreedom\u2019s just another word for nothin\u2019 left to lose.\u201d</p> <h2>Sunday Mornin\u2019 Comin\u2019 Down (1970)</h2> <p>Kristofferson called this the song that enabled him to stop working for a living and he was shocked by how many of his heroes admired it. It\u2019s very simple: a man recounts his hangover. But as the verses accumulate, it becomes evident that the singer\u2019s pain isn\u2019t just a crushing headache, it\u2019s a deep sense of loneliness. The details he notices are the things he doesn\u2019t have \u2013 playing children, a sense of joy \u2013 and when he pleads, \u201cOn the Sunday morning sidewalks / Wishing, Lord, that I was stoned,\u201d he\u2019s not looking for relief from his hangover, but for something to stop him having to enter his own void. No wonder Johnny Cash had a No 1 hit with it.</p> <h2>To Beat the Devil (1970)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwuoFt0c1VM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vwuoFt0c1VM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>In the spoken intro to To Beat the Devil, Kristofferson made his debt to Cash clear: \u201cI\u2019d like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil.\u201d Like Cash, Kristofferson sang country but was also part of the counterculture. To Beat the Devil took one of music\u2019s great myths \u2013 the singer who sells his soul for the song \u2013 and upended it: \u201cI ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothin\u2019 / Then I stole his song.\u201d It\u2019s not the literal devil, of course: this is Kristofferson saying he managed to better the music industry and his own demons.</p> <h2>Help Me Make It Through the Night (1970)</h2> <p>The story goes that an Esquire interviewer asked Frank Sinatra what he believed in. \u201cBooze, broads, or a Bible \u2013 whatever helps me make it through the night,\u201d he replied. And from that line Kristofferson conjured his most enduring hit. It\u2019s a love song that isn\u2019t a love song \u2013 the singer doesn\u2019t want to give, only take (even if they say \u201cAll I\u2019m taking is your time\u201d). They do not care about right or wrong, they do not want to understand. They want only to be held. It\u2019s surprisingly complex, about dependency more than commitment.</p> <h2>The Pilgrim, Chapter 33 (1971)</h2> <p>Another song for his heroes \u2013 named in the intro and including Cash, naturally \u2013 which portrayed a mythical country singer in all his contradictions. The Pilgrim, Chapter 33 makes the life of a travelling musician sound less like a job than a calling that will torture all those who answer. One line captured the complexities of being a songwriter, for what is a songwriter but a maker of promises to their audience? \u201cNever knowin\u2019 if believin\u2019 is a blessin\u2019 or a curse / Or if the goin\u2019 up was worth the comin\u2019 down.\u201d Bruce Springsteen would later get an awful lot of mileage out of exploring that precise notion.</p> <h2>Jesus Was a Capricorn (Owed to John Prine) (1972)</h2> <p>Much lusher than his earlier recordings \u2013 perhaps inevitable, given Kristofferson\u2019s technical weaknesses as a singer \u2013 Jesus Was a Capricorn notes that if Jesus was resurrected, he\u2019d promptly be nailed back on the cross. And so it goes across society: \u201cEggheads cursin\u2019, rednecks cussin\u2019 hippies for their hair / Others laugh at straights who laugh at freaks who laugh at squares.\u201d</p> <h2>Nobody Wins (1972)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2cH4qhzLes\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z2cH4qhzLes?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A simple and stark heartbreak ballad, performed by Kristofferson as a sleepy country blues \u2013 the organ that sustains it is a deep, deep blue \u2013 but it\u2019s sufficiently malleable that it didn\u2019t have to stay that way. The king of the heartbreak ballad, Sinatra, recorded it in 1973 on Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes Is Back. It\u2019s not an insult to Kristofferson to say that when you hear one of the greatest voices in pop history sing his words \u2013 even when they are draped in saccharine strings \u2013 you hear the absolute resignation in the lyric: \u201cThe loving was easy / It\u2019s the living that\u2019s hard.\u201d</p> <h2>From the Bottle to the Bottom (with Rita Coolidge) (1973)</h2> <p>Kristofferson married the country singer Rita Coolidge shortly before they released their first album together, Full Moon. From the Bottle to the Bottom has a glorious Cajun swing beneath the honky-tonk, and one of the classic country storylines: She\u2019s gone, I\u2019m drinking. The sharpness of Kristofferson\u2019s writing makes it more than just another cliche: \u201cDid you ever see a down and outer waking up alone / Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew / When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper / He\u2019s been puttin\u2019 in his shoes to keep the ground from comin\u2019 through.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/30/kris-kristofferson-us-country-singer-and-actor-dies-aged-88\">Kris Kristofferson, US country singer and actor, dies aged 88</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Here Comes That Rainbow Again (1982)</h2> <p>Just as he span a song out of a line in someone else\u2019s interview, so he conjured Here Comes That Rainbow Again from a short scene in The Grapes of Wrath. The doominess of the waltz undercuts the message, which is about showing kindness: a truck stop waitress undercharges kids for sweets, and then is overtipped in turn by a pair of truck drivers. So why the doominess? Perhaps because even simple kindness raises suspicions: \u201cSo what\u2019s it to you?\u201d the benefactors point out when asked about their generosity.</p> <h2>Closer to the Bone (2009)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlJb6v-9qtw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wlJb6v-9qtw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This may not actually be one of the 10 best Kristoffersons, but it\u2019s worth remembering that singers and writers grow old and their preoccupations change. Closer to the Bone is the sound of a man making peace with his past as the end approaches, looking back and feeling no shame, because \u201cEverything is sweeter, closer to the bone.\u201d It\u2019s nice, too, to hear his voice \u2013 now a growl \u2013 backed by raw instrumentation: acoustic guitar, banjo, fiddle, harmonica. Here is Kristofferson in raw form.</p>",

They do not care about right or wrong, they do not want to understand. They want only to be held. It\u2019s surprisingly complex, about dependency more than commitment. The Pilgrim, Chapter 33 (1971) Another song for his heroes \u2013 named in the intro and including Cash, naturally \u2013 which portrayed a mythical country singer in all his contradictions. The Pilgrim, Chapter 33 makes the life of a travelling musician sound less like a job than a calling that will torture all those who answer. One line captured the complexities of being a songwriter, for what is a songwriter but a maker of promises to their audience? \u201cNever knowin\u2019 if believin\u2019 is a blessin\u2019 or a curse / Or if the goin\u2019 up was worth the comin\u2019 down.\u201d Bruce Springsteen would later get an awful lot of mileage out of exploring that precise notion. Jesus Was a Capricorn (Owed to John Prine) (1972) Much lusher than his earlier recordings \u2013 perhaps inevitable, given Kristofferson\u2019s technical weaknesses as a singer \u2013 Jesus Was a Capricorn notes that if Jesus was resurrected, he\u2019d promptly be nailed back on the cross. And so it goes across society: \u201cEggheads cursin\u2019, rednecks cussin\u2019 hippies for their hair / Others laugh at straights who laugh at freaks who laugh at squares.\u201d Nobody Wins (1972) A simple and stark heartbreak ballad, performed by Kristofferson as a sleepy country blues \u2013 the organ that sustains it is a deep, deep blue \u2013 but it\u2019s sufficiently malleable that it didn\u2019t have to stay that way. The king of the heartbreak ballad, Sinatra, recorded it in 1973 on Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes Is Back. It\u2019s not an insult to Kristofferson to say that when you hear one of the greatest voices in pop history sing his words \u2013 even when they are draped in saccharine strings \u2013 you hear the absolute resignation in the lyric: \u201cThe loving was easy / It\u2019s the living that\u2019s hard.\u201d From the Bottle to the Bottom (with Rita Coolidge) (1973) Kristofferson married the country singer Rita Coolidge shortly before they released their first album together, Full Moon. From the Bottle to the Bottom has a glorious Cajun swing beneath the honky-tonk, and one of the classic country storylines: She\u2019s gone, I\u2019m drinking. The sharpness of Kristofferson\u2019s writing makes it more than just another cliche: \u201cDid you ever see a down and outer waking up alone / Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew / When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper / He\u2019s been puttin\u2019 in his shoes to keep the ground from comin\u2019 through.\u201d Here Comes That Rainbow Again (1982) Just as he span a song out of a line in someone else\u2019s interview, so he conjured Here Comes That Rainbow Again from a short scene in The Grapes of Wrath. The doominess of the waltz undercuts the message, which is about showing kindness: a truck stop waitress undercharges kids for sweets, and then is overtipped in turn by a pair of truck drivers. So why the doominess? Perhaps because even simple kindness raises suspicions: \u201cSo what\u2019s it to you?\u201d the benefactors point out when asked about their generosity. Closer to the Bone (2009) This may not actually be one of the 10 best Kristoffersons, but it\u2019s worth remembering that singers and writers grow old and their preoccupations change. Closer to the Bone is the sound of a man making peace with his past as the end approaches, looking back and feeling no shame, because \u201cEverything is sweeter, closer to the bone.\u201d It\u2019s nice, too, to hear his voice \u2013 now a growl \u2013 backed by raw instrumentation: acoustic guitar, banjo, fiddle, harmonica. Here is Kristofferson in raw form.",

It was the death of his brother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/mar/22/cricket.matthewcunningham\">Ben</a>, in a car accident in 2002 that ultimately led him to walk away from cricket and return to his native Australia at the age of 33.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of net practice, getting used to it,\u201d he says now, talking from his place in London, where he has resided all summer. \u201cIt\u2019s getting those phone calls, when someone rings and the moment between realising this isn\u2019t a good phone call and then getting the news seems to take for ever. As soon as I had the phone call, I knew it was one of those. It does bring back memories of others, my brother and [the former Surrey&nbsp;wicketkeeper] Graham Kersey and people that we\u2019ve lost along the way.</p> <p>\u201cI was very close to Graham [Thorpe]. We were close when we played, but I got very close with him in the last five or six years and when we were coaching together. One thing that kind of distracts you from your own sadness or emotion is trying to take care of others. So I\u2019ve been trying to help out his wife and kids and take responsibility for them. I know that\u2019s what Graham would want.\u201d</p> <p>With his doctorate in grief, Hollioake has become, he says, \u201ca master\u201d at picking out the happy moments. \u201cThe fun guy that [Thorpe] was, very silly, with a playful sense of humour. The other one is the fierce competitor who really locked on when the game got close. When the pressure\u2019s on and the game\u2019s in the balance, some people haven\u2019t got it, and he was definitely one who did.\u201d</p>    <p>He recalls that Thorpe could at times be quite distracted if you were talking to him off the field. \u201cHe\u2019d be playing with his bat handle, or be a little bit fidgety.\u201d But when they were together in the middle, mid-pitch, mid-battle, Thorpe was a different man. \u201cHe\u2019d be locked on. He\u2019d be staring you straight in the eyes, quietly spoken but confident, urging me to stay with him and be there at the end of the game. He was one of my favourite people to bat with.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years after abandoning his playing career, Hollioake has spent the summer as an assistant coach at Surrey, brought back into the fold by Alec Stewart, who is due to stand down as the club\u2019s director of cricket after the club secured their<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/20/cricket-county-championship-surrey-title-somerset-lancashire\"> third straight County Championship title</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt really does feel like coming home,\u201d he says. Hollioake\u2019s early years in Australia were a blur of constant travel, multiple schools, an unsettled, peripatetic upbringing. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a family home growing up, because we moved so much.\u201d</p> <p>Arriving at Surrey as a brash young all-rounder in the early &nbsp;1990s, Hollioake discovered the joys of stability. \u201cI had the 15 years at Surrey, and that was the one consistent that I had. And then, since finishing at Surrey, I changed where I live a couple of times, and had many different roles and jobs. I walk into the Oval and it\u2019s probably the place I\u2019ve spent the most time in my life. Just the respect I get when I go there, and how good the people are. It does feel like a big family there, so it definitely feels like a homecoming.\u201d</p> <p>After leaving Surrey to be with his parents in Australia, the former England international embarked on a string of alternative careers. A real estate venture collapsed during the global financial crisis of 2007, sending Hollioake bankrupt. He created a television show, Australia\u2019s Greatest Athlete, which ran for three seasons. A stint as a professional boxer and in Mixed Martial Arts followed. Cricket had faded into the background.</p> <p>\u201cI was trying to work out, \u2018Hey, what am I going to do now? What am I? What do I want?\u2019 Have you heard of that show Through The Keyhole? They came to my house and they couldn\u2019t find anything to do with cricket. They said: \u2018We have to plant some stuff, because the viewers aren\u2019t gonna guess whose house this is if we don\u2019t have something.\u2019 I didn\u2019t have any memorabilia in my house. And then I realised it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to live in the past. I want to achieve more, because those memories are pretty powerful, and if you start living on what you\u2019ve achieved, you can quite quickly become a prisoner of your past.\u201d</p> <p>He feels that cricket was \u201ctaken away\u201d from him by Ben\u2019s death. \u201cWhen my brother died, I felt I needed to go back and be with my family and look after them. And then I ostracised myself a bit from the game and during that time I lost my connection with cricket. I\u2019m still building that back, like a&nbsp;relationship.</p>    <p>\u201cI walked out on cricket 20 years ago and I guess I\u2019m building my confidence back with it. I love cricket. It\u2019s given me everything, all the start in life that I needed. So I want to be back involved, and I want to see what I can achieve in it again.\u201d</p> <p>Coaching jobs provided a way back into the game, with Queensland, Pakistan, and with the England and Wales Cricket Board, with both England Lions and the Test side during the ill-fated 2021-22 Ashes tour, when he was reunited with Thorpe, who was England\u2019s batting coach.</p> <p>Another of his previous coaching roles involved working in the now defunct Afghanistan Premier League, when he came terrifyingly close to a suicide bombing in Kabul.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a backpack terrorist and it blew up nine people. I was between 50 and 100 metres away. It was brutal. But the people were amazing and it was such a big thing to have cricket in their country. When it happened, my first instinct was, I can\u2019t wait to get the hell out of here. And a lot of the guys did leave. But then I thought, \u2018no\u2019. My dad always said to me growing up, stay until the job\u2019s done. I wanted to make sure I was safe and they increased security. But it was pretty full on.\u201d</p> <p>Hollioake tries to bring the same philosophy to coaching that he brought to captaincy and to life in general. In 1995, as a young star with leadership potential at Surrey, Dave Gilbert, then the club\u2019s head coach, gave him the book How to Win Friends and Influence People. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018I read it once a year.\u2019 So I read that book, and I became fascinated with psychology. I\u2019m a bit of a deep thinker myself and the difference between myself when I\u2019m confident and when I\u2019m lacking confidence is vast. We spend all this time as players trying to improve 1% but the difference between yourself when you\u2019re confident and when you\u2019re not confident is more like 20%. If you took 11 people that were confident and played them against their clones who were not confident, it\u2019d be a whitewash, because confidence is such an integral part of sport.\u201d</p> <p>He references the effect of Bazball. \u201cIt removes the fear of failure, and that happens when you\u2019re confident. As a captain, I understood that from a pretty early age, and I\u2019ve definitely taken that into my coaching.\u201d</p>    <p>We return to the question of how and why Surrey\u2019s culture of success continues to flow, from his playing days to the here and now.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s struck me is how organised and professional they are. Everyone\u2019s so informed, and knows what everyone\u2019s doing. That\u2019s a mixture of Alec Stewart and his organisational skills and professionalism and having a settled squad, which is also down to Alec. If I look at the one common denominator, in the last 30 or 40 years, I would say Alec Stewart\u2019s been pivotal. The communication\u2019s outstanding, and it just seems to be a well-oiled unit.\u201d</p> <p>At the beginning of his career, he says, there was \u201calmost zero\u201d professionalism. \u201cBy 2004 there was the beginning of a bit more science, bit more professionalism, bit more support off the field. Now you\u2019ve got a couple of physios, strength and conditioning coaches, psychologists, statistician, batting coach, five or six assistant coaches and Alec, so the support staff\u2019s probably at least double figures. We\u2019ve got a great system, we produce a Test cricketer every year. A constant flow of Test cricketers come through our youth system, and good ones as well. We\u2019ve got a big ground, we\u2019re attractive for people to come and play. So when we do sign a player, we sign a big player.\u201d This season, Surrey have fielded 14 full England internationals.</p> <p>Hollioake\u2019s current role is temporary, but he would be open to returning. With Stewart\u2019s imminent departure at the end of the campaign to care for his wife, who has cancer, Hollioake says he would be \u201chonoured\u201d to fulfil a similar role.</p>    <p>\u201cI\u2019m beholden to Surrey. I\u2019ve been away for so long, but I do have that bond with the club. But I\u2019ve got to be the right person for the job, because there are a lot of people who want to do that job, and there will be many good candidates for it as well. I want the best for the job before what\u2019s best for me.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully Alec chooses to stay involved in some advisory role. I know he\u2019s not doing his full director of cricket role, but hopefully he stays and helps mentor the next person who comes on to take it and passes down some of the wisdom that he\u2019s got, because he\u2019s definitely Surrey\u2019s greatest son.\u201d</p> <p>Most important to Hollioake is that, after years of grief and a search for purpose, cricket is a joy once more. \u201cI lost the love of the game after my brother died, I wasn\u2019t enjoying it any more, but having had a bit of a time away from it, I\u2019m loving it again. It\u2019s hard for it not to be a lot of fun.\u201d</p> <p><em>This is an article from </em><em><a href=\"https://www.thenightwatchman.net/buy/wisden-cricket-monthly-issue-81\">Wisden Cricket Monthly</a></em><em>.

The communication\u2019s outstanding, and it just seems to be a well-oiled unit.\u201d At the beginning of his career, he says, there was \u201calmost zero\u201d professionalism. \u201cBy 2004 there was the beginning of a bit more science, bit more professionalism, bit more support off the field. Now you\u2019ve got a couple of physios, strength and conditioning coaches, psychologists, statistician, batting coach, five or six assistant coaches and Alec, so the support staff\u2019s probably at least double figures. We\u2019ve got a great system, we produce a Test cricketer every year. A constant flow of Test cricketers come through our youth system, and good ones as well. We\u2019ve got a big ground, we\u2019re attractive for people to come and play. So when we do sign a player, we sign a big player.\u201d This season, Surrey have fielded 14 full England internationals. Hollioake\u2019s current role is temporary, but he would be open to returning. With Stewart\u2019s imminent departure at the end of the campaign to care for his wife, who has cancer, Hollioake says he would be \u201chonoured\u201d to fulfil a similar role. \u201cI\u2019m beholden to Surrey. I\u2019ve been away for so long, but I do have that bond with the club. But I\u2019ve got to be the right person for the job, because there are a lot of people who want to do that job, and there will be many good candidates for it as well. I want the best for the job before what\u2019s best for me. \u201cHopefully Alec chooses to stay involved in some advisory role. I know he\u2019s not doing his full director of cricket role, but hopefully he stays and helps mentor the next person who comes on to take it and passes down some of the wisdom that he\u2019s got, because he\u2019s definitely Surrey\u2019s greatest son.\u201d Most important to Hollioake is that, after years of grief and a search for purpose, cricket is a joy once more. \u201cI lost the love of the game after my brother died, I wasn\u2019t enjoying it any more, but having had a bit of a time away from it, I\u2019m loving it again. It\u2019s hard for it not to be a lot of fun.\u201d This is an article from Wisden Cricket Monthly. Click here to get over 25% off an annual Wisden Cricket Monthly digital subscription.",

There must be competition between states to be good places for people to live and to work.</p> \n   <p>The assault on asylum through means of transnational repression is another matter. In my case, it was difficult to find a state that would give asylum that I was able to get to.</p> \n   <p>There is a big gap in the asylum system for people who are not fleeing their own state, but fleeing an ally of that state or any third state.

So Europeans in Europe must obey us secrecy law with no defenses at all. As far as the US government is concerned. Americans in Paris can talk about what the US government is up to, perhaps, but for a French man in Paris to do so is a crime with no defense, and he may be extradited just like me.</p> \n   <p>The criminalisation of news-gathering activities is a threat to investigative journalism everywhere. I was formally convicted by a foreign power for asking for, receiving and publishing truthful information about that power while I was in Europe.</p> \n   <p>The fundamental issue is simple: journalists should not be prosecuted for doing their jobs.

telling politicians on Tuesday the move would cause greater harm to children and give parents a false sense of security.</p> \n  <p>Their testimony comes a day after parent groups appeared before the<a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Social_Media\"> Social Media and Australian Society inquiry</a> and urged the government to impose a ban on all children accessing social media.</p> \n  <p>ReachOut government relations director <strong>Ben Bartlett</strong> said he recognised parents were struggling to find ways to approach the technology and protect their children, but a blanket ban would not address the risks.</p> \n  <p>\u201cA ban would expose young people to new harms,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt may leave some young people without any mental health support options, it may make them less likely to seek help when they need it and be less likely to tell an adult when things go wrong online.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A survey conducted by ReachOut found almost three in four young people turned to social media platforms including TikTok, YouTube and Instagram to access information and support for mental health issues.</p> \n

endangering the goal of building 1.2m extra homes by July 2029.</p> \n  <p>The monthly decline reversed a bullish 11% increase in July, while approvals were up 3.6% when compared to August 2023.</p> \n  <p>NSW and South Australia recorded the biggest declines with an 11.5% monthly fall in approvals in both states, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data released on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>All states experienced a decrease of at least 3% in dwelling approvals month-on-month.</p> \n  <p>Approvals for detached houses rose by a slim 0.5% nationally, but other private-sector dwellings pulled down the overall tally with a 16.5% fall.</p> \n  <p>In September, Master Builders Australia forecast just 1.03m of the target homes would be built, finding every state was behind on meeting their individual targets.</p> \n  <p>ABS construction statistics head <strong>Daniel Rossi</strong> said weak apartment approvals had fuelled the overall drop in the figures.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe movements in dwellings excluding houses continue to be the result of volatility in apartment approvals, with the broad environment around apartments remaining subdued,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Sluggish planning systems \u2013 which the NSW premier, <strong>Chris Minns</strong>, has routinely blamed for lacklustre progress in his state \u2013 along with \u201capartment-killer taxes\u201d

Julian Assange made his first public statement since release, where he claimed he was freed because he \u201cpled guilty to journalism.\u201d Queensland premier Steven Miles has launched a last-gasp bid to stand down the controversial Townsville mayor during his final hours in office before embarking upon an uphill re-election campaign. Opposition leader Peter Dutton was \u2018more like a thug\u2019 than an aspiring PM in his stoush with an ABC reporter about protests, Sarah Hanson-Young said. Katy Gallager said it was \u2018absolutely appropriate\u2019 for police to investigate alleged raising of Hezbollah flags. Every ABC staff member should read \u2018disturbing\u2019 review on racism at broadcaster, said David Anderson after the report revealed a huge majority of those interviewed revealed cultural issues in the ABC which allowed racism to thrive. The New South Wales opposition is urging the Minns Labor government to strengthen the ban on the display of symbols of proscribed terrorist groups in the state if the federal parliament does not do so. The government has temporarily approved an overseas supplier of PrEP to ensure the thousands of Australians, with or at risk of contracting HIV, are protected amid a shortage of the medication. The ABS revealed mixed results on retail spending and housing approvals for August. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, said he would prolong the operation of a coal-fired power station beyond its planned closure date, if it couldn\u2019t be replaced with renewables. Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said banks should loosen credit laws to help first home buyers. Treasurer Jim Chalmers told journalists that private briefings by senior RBA staff should \u201cbe kept confidential\u201d. Kyle and Jackie O\u2019s expansion into Melbourne radio has flopped, according to the latest radio ratings covering July to September. Australians looking for love will have more protection with dating apps captured by a safety code aimed at improving users\u2019 experiences. That\u2019s all for now. Thank you for joining us \u2013 we\u2019ll be back bright and early tomorrow. So, what\u2019s in and what\u2019s out of the NDIS lists? For example, the following are considered NDIS supports: Accommodation assistance Assistance animals Prostheses Home and vehicle modifications Personal mobility equipment (such as wheelchairs) Daily life and travel assistance Those not considered NDIS supports include: Daily living lifestyle costs (such as rent, holidays, groceries and cigarettes) Alternative therapies (such as tarot card reading, cuddle and crystal therapy) Mental health treatment (such as medicines and therapy) School and higher education fees Unlawful goods and services (such as weapons) Sexual services, drugs and alcohol List of NDIS items and services released A finalised list of what items and services can be funded by the National Disability Insurance Scheme has been released today as part of the Albanese government\u2019s plans to overhaul the scheme. The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, released the list on Tuesday after a month-long negotiation with disability organisations and peak bodies. Shorten said: This will now provide clarity. It will return the scheme to its true purpose, which makes sure that the NDIS isn\u2019t paying for things that other care systems in Australia should be paying for, or indeed, it\u2019s just not paying for things which have no evidentiary basis. The list outlines what services and items participants can access under the scheme from Thursday 3 October. Shorten said there would be a 12-month transition period for any participants currently receiving items or supports that will no longer be covered. There will be limited circumstances where a participant will be able to claim a household appliance or certain technologies, like smartwatches or phones, under the NDIS. The changes will mean a participant will have to show the item is necessary for their impairment, increases their independence and can reduce or eliminate the need for a support worker or disability specific assistive technology. Finally, before receiving a standing ovation, Assange says his final words, urging journalists to \u201ccontinue the fight\u201d: In 2010 I was living in Paris. I went to the United Kingdom and never came back. Until now, it\u2019s good to be back. It\u2019s good to be amongst people who, as we say, it\u2019s good to be amongst friends. I would just like to thank all the people who have fought for my liberation and who have understood, importantly, that my liberation was coupled to their own liberation, and that when one of us falls through the cracks, soon enough, those cracks will widen and take the rest of us down. So thank you for your thought courage in this and other settings, and keep up the fight. Asked if he would do anything differently, Julian Assange was philosophical: This is a very deep question about free will. People do things when they do them; looking back, we were often constrained by our resources, the number of staff, by secrecy that was necessary to protect our sources, and if I could go back and have a lot of extra resources, of course, political approaches, media approaches could have maximised even further the impact, the revelations that we made. But I suppose your question is trying to say, well, were there any knobs that could be turned in hindsight? I was not from the United Kingdom. I had a good friend in the United Kingdom, Gavin McFadyen, who\u2019s an American journalist, a very good man. But it took me time to \u2026 once I was trapped in the United Kingdom, it took me time to understand what UK society was about. Who I could trust, who I couldn\u2019t trust, the different types of manoeuvres that are made in that society. There are different media partners that perhaps we could have chosen. \u2018I was a political prisoner\u2019: Assange Next Assange is asked if he saw himself as a political prisoner: Yes, I was a political prisoner. The political basis for the US government\u2019s retributive acts against me was in relation to publishing the truth about what the US government had done. Then, in a formal legal sense, once the US proceeded with its legal retribution, it used the Espionage Act, a classic political offence. Seeking asylum \u2018an absolutely essential relief valve\u2019 that puts pressure on states\u2019 behaviour: Assange Julian Assange has been taking questions, including one on political asylum. He says: Political asylum is an absolutely essential relief valve for human rights abuses within states. That people can leave a state that is persecuting them not only saves individual lives \u2013 it provides a mechanism where journalists can continue to report on their societies after they have been hounded out. Ultimately, the threat of people leaving a state is what, the final analysis, controls its behaviour. We have seen examples in history of states that made it difficult or impossible for people to leave, and we can see how the situation for people living there lapsed. There must be competition between states to be good places for people to live and to work. The assault on asylum through means of transnational repression is another matter. In my case, it was difficult to find a state that would give asylum that I was able to get to. There is a big gap in the asylum system for people who are not fleeing their own state, but fleeing an ally of that state or any third state. That was my case. Asylum law does not easily cover the case where, say, an Australian is fleeing persecution by the United States. Julian Assange finishes by saying freedom of expression is at a \u201cdark crossroads\u201d: It\u2019s heartening to know that in a world often divided by ideology and interests, there remains a shared commitment to the protection of essential human liberties, freedom of expression and all that flows from it is at a dark crossroad. I fear that unless institutions like [the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe] wake up to the gravity of the situation, it will be too late. Let us all commit to doing our part to ensure that the light of freedom never dims, that the pursuit of truth will live on, and the voices of the many are not silenced by the interests of the few. \u2018Journalists should not be prosecuted for doing their jobs. Journalism is not a crime\u2019: Assange He goes on to say that in his case, the US government took a \u201cdangerous, dangerous new global legal position\u201d which is that only US citizen have free speech rights. In my case, the US government asserted a dangerous, dangerous new global legal position. Only US citizens have free speech rights. Europeans and other nationalities do not have free speech rights, but the US claims its Espionage Act still applies to them, regardless of where they are. So Europeans in Europe must obey us secrecy law with no defenses at all. As far as the US government is concerned. Americans in Paris can talk about what the US government is up to, perhaps, but for a French man in Paris to do so is a crime with no defense, and he may be extradited just like me. The criminalisation of news-gathering activities is a threat to investigative journalism everywhere. I was formally convicted by a foreign power for asking for, receiving and publishing truthful information about that power while I was in Europe. The fundamental issue is simple: journalists should not be prosecuted for doing their jobs. Journalism is not a crime, it is a pillar of a free and informed society. Julian Assange says Pompeo was influential in the move to try to have him arrested and extradited: In Michael Pompeo\u2019s memoirs, which I read in my prison cell, the former CIA director bragged about how he pressured the US attorney general to bring an extradition case against me, in response to our publications about the CIA. Indeed, acceding to Pompeo requests, the US attorney general reopened the investigation against me that Obama had closed, and rearrested Manning, this time as a witness. Manning was held in a prison for over a year, fined $1,000 a day in a formal attempt to coerce her into providing secret testimony against me. She ended up attempting to take her own life. We usually think of attempts to force journalists to testify against their sources, but Manning was now a source [being forced] to testify against the journalist. By December 2017, CIA director Pompeo had got his way, and the US government issued a warrant to the UK for my extradition. The UK government kept the warrant secret from the public for two more years while it, the US government and the new president of Ecuador moved to shape the political, the legal and the diplomatic grounds for my arrest. He goes on to outline the investigation into his work: My wife and my infant son were also targeted, a CIA asset was permanently assigned to track my wife, and instructions were given to obtain DNA from my six-month-old son\u2019s nappy. This is the testimony of more than 30 current and former US intelligence officials speaking to the US press, which has been additionally corroborated by record seized in a prosecution fought against some of the CIA agents involved. T he CIA\u2019s targeting of myself, my family and my associates through aggressive, extrajudicial and extraterritorial means, provides a rare insight into how powerful intelligence organizations engage in transnational repression such repressions are not unique. What is unique is that we know so much about this one due to numerous whistleblowers and to judicial investigations in Spain. CIA \u2018drew up plans to kidnap and to assassinate me\u2019 under Mike Pompeo\u2019s direction, Assange says Next, Julian Assange has addressed the change in US government, from the Obama to the Trump administration: In February 2017 the landscape changed dramatically. President Trump had been elected. He appointed two wolves in Maga hats, Mike Pompeo, a Kansas congressman and former arms industry executive as CIA director and William Barr, a former CIA officer, as US attorney general. By March 2017 WikiLeaks had exposed the CIA\u2019s infiltration of French political parties. Its spying on French and German leaders. Its spying on the European Central Bank, European economics ministries, and its standing orders to spy on French industry as a whole. [We] revealed the CIA\u2019s vast production of malware and viruses, its subversion of supply chains, its subversion of antivirus software cars, smart TVs and iPhones. CIA director Pompeo launched a campaign of retribution. It is now a matter of public record that under Pompeo\u2019s explicit direction, the CIA drew up plans to kidnap and to assassinate me within the Ecuadorian embassy in London and authorised going after my European colleagues, subjecting us to theft, hacking attacks and the planting of false information. US government\u2019s investigation of WikiLeaks was ultimately \u2018legally groundless\u2019: Assange Julian Assange has continued, saying the leaked footage of the Iraq war published by WikiLeaks \u201cshocked the world\u201d. When we published Collateral Murder, the infamous gun camera footage of a US Apache helicopter crew eagerly blowing to pieces Iraqi journalists and their rescuers, the visual reality of modern warfare shocked the world, but we also used interest in this video to direct people to the classified policies for when the US military could deploy lethal force in Iraq \u2026 and how many civilians could be killed before gaining higher approval. In fact, 40 years of my potential 175-year sentence was for obtaining and releasing those policies. Let us stop gagging, torturing and killing each other for a change. Get these fundamentals right, and other political, economic and scientific processes will have space to pay, will have space to take care of the rest. He has gone on to address Chelsea Manning and the beginnings of the US government\u2019s alleged investigation into him and WikiLeaks: Fourteen years ago, the United States military arrested one of our alleged whistleblowers, Private First Class Manning, a US intelligence analyst based in Iraq. The US government concurrently launched investigation against me and my colleagues. The US government illicitly sent planes of agents to Iceland, paid bribes to an informer to steal our legal and journalistic work product, and without formal process, pressured banks and financial services to block our subscriptions and to freeze our accounts. The UK government took part in some of this retribution. Ultimately, this harassment was legally groundless. President Obama\u2019s justice department chose not to indict me, recognising that no crime had been committed. The United States had never before prosecuted a publisher for publishing or obtaining government information. To do so would require a radical and ominous reinterpretation of the US constitution. Assange says press freedom has been \u2018undermined, attacked, weakened\u2019 since he was first incarcerated Julian Assange has reflected on the changes during his time incarcerated, saying the state of press freedom and journalism is in a worse place: I regret how much ground has been lost during that time period, how expressing the truth has been undermined, attacked, weakened and diminished. I see more impunity, more secrecy, more retaliation for telling the truth and more self censorship. It is hard not to draw a line from the US government\u2019s prosecution of me, its crossing the Rubicon by internationally criminalising journalism to the chilled climate for freedom expression that exists now. He goes on to speak about what inspired him to establish WikiLeaks, and his interpretation of what they were able to do: When I founded WikiLeaks, it was driven by a simple dream to educate people about how the world works, so that through understanding we might bring about something better, having a map of where we are lets us understand where we might go. Knowledge empowers us to hold power to account and to demand justice where there is none. We obtained and published truths about tens of thousands of hidden casualties of war and other unseen horrors about programs of assassination, rendition, torture and mass surveillance, we revealed not just when and where these things happened, but frequently, the policies, the agreements and the structures behind them. Assange has continued, saying that he was incarcerated because he \u201cpled guilty to journalism\u201d: Justice for me is now precluded, as the US government insisted, in writing into its plea agreement that I cannot file a case at the European court of human rights or even a Freedom of Information Act request over what it did to me as a result of its expedition request. I want to be totally clear: I am not free today because the system worked. I am free today [after] years of incarceration because I pled guilty to journalism. I pled guilty to seeking information from a source. I pled guilty to obtaining information from a source, and I pled guilty to informing the public what that information was. I did not plead guilty to anything else. I hope my testimony today can serve to highlight the weakness, the weaknesses of the existing safeguards, and to help those whose cases are less visible, but who are equally vulnerable. We have embedded a feed of Julian Assange speaking at the Council of Europe at the top of this blog. \u2018I never would have seen the light of day\u2019 without all of the advocacy: Julian Assange He continues, thanking the many people who advocated on his behalf, but adds that those efforts \u201cshouldn\u2019t have been necessary\u201d: I commend the legal affairs and Human Rights Committee for commissioning a renowned rapporteur, sooner\u2019s daughter to investigate the circumstances surrounding my detention and conviction and the consequent implications for human rights. However, like so many of the efforts made in my case, whether they were from parliamentarians, presidents, prime ministers, the pope, UN officials and diplomats, unions, legal and medical professionals, academics, activists or citizens. None of them should have been necessary. None of the statements, resolutions, reports, films, articles, events, fundraisers, protests and letters over the last 14 years should have been necessary, but all of them were necessary, because without them, I never would have seen the light of day. Assange has begun by reflecting on the \u201csurreal shift\u201d from prison to speaking at the committee: The transition from years of confinement in a maximum security prison to being here before the representatives of 46 nations and 700 million people is a profound and a surreal shift. The experience of isolation for years in a small cell is difficult to convey. It strips away one\u2019s sense of self, leaving only the raw essence of existence. I am yet not fully equipped to speak about what I have endured, the relentless struggle to stay alive, both physically and mentally. Isolation has taken its toll, which I am trying to unwind and expressing myself in this setting is a challenge. However, the gravity of this occasion and the weight of the issues at hand compel me to set aside my reservations and speak to you directly. Julian Assange is due to appear shortly at a council of Europe committee, where he is due to address the committee on his detention and conviction and their effects on human rights. You can watch below: Labor MP and assistant minister for citizenship and multicultural affairs, Julian Hill, is on Afternoon Briefing on the ABC, and was asked about opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s comments earlier about protesters over the weekend. And while Hill refused to confirm if any of the protesters carrying Hezbollah imager over the weekend were actually foreigners here on visas, Hill slammed Dutton for being \u201cobsessed\u201d with the Middle East. At every turn, Peter Dutton is obsessed with the Middle East, not middle Australia. On any day that he can pour petrol on the fire and disrupt community harmony and profit from international conflicts. He doesn\u2019t want to talk about cost of living, doesn\u2019t want to recall parliament to deal with the housing bill stuck in the Senate. It\u2019s all about the Middle East. Tony Burke is the cabinet minister who I work for and has made clear if Peter Dutton or anyone has evidence of people on visas inciting discord or breaking the you law, we\u2019ll consider cancelling those visas. If people have that evidence, they should present it to us. Mental health experts say social media ban could cause greater harm to children Banning children from social media wouldn\u2019t remove risks to their mental health and could rob them of an important social and emotional lifeline, experts have told a federal inquiry. Representatives from six health organisations including ReachOut, Headspace and Beyond Blue rejected proposals to raise age limits for social networks, telling politicians on Tuesday the move would cause greater harm to children and give parents a false sense of security. Their testimony comes a day after parent groups appeared before the Social Media and Australian Society inquiry and urged the government to impose a ban on all children accessing social media. ReachOut government relations director Ben Bartlett said he recognised parents were struggling to find ways to approach the technology and protect their children, but a blanket ban would not address the risks. \u201cA ban would expose young people to new harms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may leave some young people without any mental health support options, it may make them less likely to seek help when they need it and be less likely to tell an adult when things go wrong online.\u201d A survey conducted by ReachOut found almost three in four young people turned to social media platforms including TikTok, YouTube and Instagram to access information and support for mental health issues. Removing teens\u2019 access to this information, Bartlett said, would leave them worse off. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to end up after this moment in time when everyone is focused on making social media safer with a policy response that potentially just gives parents a false sense of security that something\u2019s been done and all the harms have been addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would say it\u2019s much better to \u2026 do what we can quickly on quick wins and then work through to make the platforms fundamentally safer over time for everyone.\u201d \u2013 via AAP Every state behind on national housing targets as dwelling approval rates slide The chance of Australia meeting nationally agreed housing targets has taken another hit, with approval numbers suffering a steep decline. Dwelling approvals dropped by 6.1% in August, further endangering the goal of building 1.2m extra homes by July 2029. The monthly decline reversed a bullish 11% increase in July, while approvals were up 3.6% when compared to August 2023. NSW and South Australia recorded the biggest declines with an 11.5% monthly fall in approvals in both states, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data released on Tuesday. All states experienced a decrease of at least 3% in dwelling approvals month-on-month. Approvals for detached houses rose by a slim 0.5% nationally, but other private-sector dwellings pulled down the overall tally with a 16.5% fall. In September, Master Builders Australia forecast just 1.03m of the target homes would be built, finding every state was behind on meeting their individual targets. ABS construction statistics head Daniel Rossi said weak apartment approvals had fuelled the overall drop in the figures. \u201cThe movements in dwellings excluding houses continue to be the result of volatility in apartment approvals, with the broad environment around apartments remaining subdued,\u201d he said. Sluggish planning systems \u2013 which the NSW premier, Chris Minns, has routinely blamed for lacklustre progress in his state \u2013 along with \u201capartment-killer taxes\u201d was driving the decline, according to the Property Council of Australia. Only 1,200 apartments in blocks with nine or more storeys were approved in August, compared with 2,500 in July. \u201cWe need to increase the number of homes approved and ensure a strong pipeline of apartment supply to drive towards our housing targets at scale,\u201d the industry lobby\u2019s group executive, Matthew Kandelaars, said. \u201cBut the reality is it has never been more difficult and costly to get apartments out of the ground.\u201d \u2013 via AAP Greens\u2019 Faruqi \u2018disappointed\u2019 but \u2018not surprised\u2019 by results of review into racism at ABC The deputy leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, has said she is \u201cdisappointed\u201d to hear the results of the Janke review into the ABC. The review spoke to 120 current and former staff, with all but one saying they had personally experienced racism at the national broadcaster. Faruqi said she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d: I\u2019m not surprised, but it doesn\u2019t lessen the disappointment. People of colour working at the ABC have been suffering racism for far too long. They deserve so much better from our public broadcaster. The Janke review recommended the ABC \u2018improve diverse representation in management and leadership\u2019, which is what I have long been calling for. The Board must reflect the diversity in the community if it is to be considered a true national broadcaster. The time for platitudes and hollow apologies is over. Strong action must be taken starting from the top. Anti-racism training must be mandatory and progress on change monitored and publicly reported. People of colour deserve a respectful and safe workplace and to be treated as equals to white people working at the ABC. Many thanks for joining me on today\u2019s blog \u2013 I\u2019ll pass over to Mostafa Rachwani to take you through the rest of today\u2019s news. Take care. No official response yet on whether Australian passport and visa holders will be evacuated by Dfat from Lebanon We know there are thousands of Australians who are worried about family and loved ones in Lebanon. We have put in questions to the department of foreign affairs and Penny Wong\u2019s office about whether Australia is moving to help evacuate Australian passport and visa holders from Lebanon in the wake of Canada and the United Kingdom stepping up their own procedures. So far there has been no official response. Anthony Albanese was asked about evacuations at his press conference a little earlier today and said: What we\u2019re doing is looking at all the measures that are available at our disposal. But we say this as well \u2013 we repeat the call for Australians who are in Lebanon to come home. There are still commercial opportunities available. We\u2019ve been saying for months that it is time to leave. It is certainly time to leave now when those opportunities are available, and at the moment, there are some commercial opportunities available, and we want Australians to take up that opportunity to come home to safety. We will keep you updated. Anderson: \u2018I am sincerely sorry\u2019 to anyone who has experienced racism at the ABC Wrapping up the interview, David Anderson was asked about the recommendation about providing an apology. He said he had written to all staff and \u201cexpressed that I am deeply sorry to anybody who has experienced racism at the ABC\u201d. For whenever that is and whenever that\u2019s happened, it shouldn\u2019t have happened, it shouldn\u2019t happen and I am sincerely sorry for that experience. And I think that the conviction here is certainly looking at the what we are putting in place is to the greatest possible extent, it is not just what we say today, but what we do in the future. And I think what it will take is everybody working together to ensure that all of these things are in place over a longer period of time. And yes, I am truly sorry for what has happened to people in the past. David Anderson said that amid this report, there is a \u201cbroader question here for the broader media industry about what they do.\u201d We are focusing on us at the moment. We are focusing on these recommendations and it is a path, it is a a discernible action on what we are doing now to move this forward, to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen again. This racism cannot occur in any workplace and I\u2019ve called it out today in my communication in staff, that if people believe that it\u2019s OK to behave like this, this is not the place for them. We will find them and we will make sure they leave the ABC. It cannot happen. It must stop. It must stop in society and it must stop for the ABC. ABC managing director says \u2018it is important\u2019 to him to begin implementing changes before he leaves role David Anderson has already indicated he would be leaving the ABC. He was asked what confidence he had that this would be carried out \u2013 as he wouldn\u2019t be here to oversee a portion of the response. Anderson replied that it was important to him to put things in motion before he departed: It is important to me, it is important to the leadership, it\u2019s important to the board of the ABC. So we\u2019ve all committed to doing this. There are a number of months that I\u2019ve got to oversee the implementation of this, such that whoever replaces me already has a framework in place \u2026 And, if anything, it is a reason for me to stay longer, not a reason for me to leave earlier. So it is very important to me that we do this. David Anderson again stressed the important of reading the testimony of the 120 people included in the report \u2013 including 21 former and 99 current employees. I think it is important that we all read them. In unlocking those stories, that helps you understand what sits behind the recommendations themselves. It also goes to the implementation of the responses that we\u2019ve listed out there, and they will happen over time. It is a multi-year approach to this, but it doesn\u2019t mean you wait to do it. There are things we are putting into place as of today and there\u2019s those we are committing to certainly in the shorter term developing very quickly, so we have them adopted and in effect as fast as possible. Anti-racism campaign and training to be implemented at ABC in response to review, managing director says Asked where the responsibility for those failings lay, ABC managing director David Anderson responded: It resides with all of us, it resides with me as managing director and certainly anybody within the organisation who has not acted at times to the extent that they should have. He said the testimony in the report includes examples of both covert and overt racism. They are the responsibility of everybody, everybody who sees it to call it out, not just the responsibility of those that it happens to. Anderson said some measures that are being implemented will include an anti-racism campaign and anti-racism training at all levels of the ABC. As we bring you the rest of David Anderson\u2019s interview, you can read our separate article on the ABC review below: Every ABC staff member should read \u2018disturbing\u2019 review on racism at broadcaster, says David Anderson David Anderson, the managing director, is speaking with ABC TV after an independent review found there are cultural issues in the ABC which allows racism to exist. The ABC reported on the review, which was led by Indigenous lawyer Terri Janke, here. Journalist and senior cultural adviser for ABC News, Miriam Corowa, is conducting the interview and asked Anderson what he is reflecting on today as he works through the testimony of 120 ABC staff. Anderson said it is a \u201cdisturbing report\u201d filled with testimony that every staff member should read: They are a difficult read, but it shows the perspective of people who have been at the other end of experienced racism \u2013 either internally at the ABC or externally from other external individuals, or what has been reported elsewhere. What the report says is that \u2013 for all that we\u2019ve done and all the measures that we\u2019ve put in place \u2013 that we need to do more. And what that report does is calls for us as an organisation \u2013 and I call for that, too \u2013 to come together around listening to the voices that are in the report, to really understanding the effect that this has had, to work together on a better future, and I think that happens through discussion \u2026 The act of some people has been completely unacceptable \u2026 and there is a commitment from me and \u2026 from the leadership team and \u2026 from the board \u2026 to do better for the future. Father and son charged over alleged attempt to possess 50kg of cocaine with estimated street value of $16.25m The Australian Federal Police have charged a father and son from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches for allegedly attempting to possess 50kg of cocaine concealed in machinery. The two men, aged 48 and 23, are expected to appear before Downing Centre local court today. An investigation was launched in August after Border Force officers at Port Botany identified anomalies in an industrial generator, during a routine inspection of sea cargo from Vietnam. AFP forensics allegedly found 50kg worth of cocaine concealed inside the machine. This consignment could have been sold as 250,000 individual street deals, with an estimated street value of $16,250,000, the AFP said. It removed the illegal drugs and monitored the consignment as it was transported to Sydney\u2019s Northern Beaches. The AFP allegedly identified the 48-year-old who had leased the industrial complex \u2013 and allegedly found evidence the man made overseas cash transfers to a known criminal facilitator, and recently travelled to Vietnam. Yesterday officers allegedly observed the 48-year-old and his 23-year-old son attempt to access a compartment in the generator where the drugs had been hidden. It will be alleged the men went to purchase separate angle grinders and associated materials from a local hardware store on two occasions. The AFP arrested and charged both men with jointly attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a unlawfully imported border controlled drug. The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. QFS issues \u2018prepare to leave\u2019 warning for Innot Hot Springs fire The Queensland Fire Department has issued a \u201cprepare to leave\u201d warning for the rural town of Innot Hot Springs, near Ravenshoe, amid a fast-moving fire. The fire is burning near Herbert River Road and conditions could get worse quickly, the department said. The warning area is between Kennedy Highway, Herbert River Road and Uramo Road. Some properties are at risk and the fire is likely to affect the community in the coming hours, the warning says. The Greens senator said comments from Peter Dutton earlier this morning made him sound \u201cmore like a thug than someone who ought to be prime minister\u201d. Sarah Hanson-Young told reporters: It is just abhorrent to have someone who wants to be the prime minister actively whipping up fear and division, rather than calling for calm and bringing people together at a time when so many people are hurting. Asked if the Greens condemn supporters of Hezbollah and those who allegedly held Hezbollah flags at rallies at the weekend, Hanson-Young said it is \u201cappropriate\u201d those alleged actions were reported to police. Hezbollah is a registered terrorist organisation, we don\u2019t have a concern with that. What Peter Dutton is trying to do is use this for his own political gain, rather than uttering a concern about the human life and loss in Lebanon or Gaza or the anguish that Lebanese Australians are feeling right now about their loved ones or their colleagues, their family members who might be caught up in this. Hanson-Young accuses Dutton of \u2018wanting to stoke fear in the community\u2019 over Hezbollah flags at protests Sarah Hanson-Young said it was an \u201cabsurd suggestion\u201d from Peter Dutton that parliament should be recalled earlier than next week. Dutton wants to recall the parliament and give the AFP powers to arrest people who allegedly held Hezbollah flags at protests at the weekend. Hanson-Young told reporters: All Peter Dutton is doing is wanting to stoke fear in the community, fear and division at a time when so many Australians have loved ones or family members, friends and colleagues caught up in the escalated conflict in the Middle East \u2026 A million people have been displaced in Lebanon over the last few days because of the impending and now invasion from Israel, and 60,000 children have fled the border into Syria in the last few days. This is a human catastrophe, a humanitarian catastrophe, a human-made humanitarian catastrophe. Australia needs to be part of the world\u2019s moral compass, say that this is not OK, stand up to it \u2013 enough is enough. All Peter Dutton wants to do is use this for his own political purposes, fearmongering division and whipping up community division. Sarah Hanson-Young to introduce bill next week to ban gambling ads Sarah Hanson-Young also responded to comments from the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, earlier today about gambling reform. As we covered earlier in the blog here and here, Rowland said the government was consulting on a model addressing the three key areas \u2013 protecting children, breaking \u201cthat nexus between sport and online wagering\u201d and dealing with the saturation of ads \u2013 but did not comment on an outright ban. Hanson-Young said this was \u201cnot good enough\u201d. We need a total ban on gambling advertising, just like we do on tobacco, and that\u2019s what the experts have called for. That\u2019s what Labor\u2019s own chaired committee called for. It\u2019s time they acted. The Greens senator said that when parliament returns next week, her bill to ban gambling ads from broadcast and online would be introduced: The government has to stop dragging its feet, bending over backwards for the gambling lobby, and do something that is desperately needed to protect families. That bill will be before the parliament next week, it will be introduced, and the government should give it time for debate and a vote. Here\u2019s more from August on this issue: Dismantling tech companies\u2019 business models will make young people safer online, Greens senator says The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young spoke with reporters earlier, amid the joint inquiry into social media. She said it has become \u201cabsolutely clear from all of the experts\u201d that simply banning young people from accessing social media won\u2019t make the online space safe for young people. I challenge both the Labor and the Liberal parties to have the courage to hit big tech where it hurts, and that\u2019s their business model. It\u2019s time for this parliament to have the courage to ban the use of targeted advertising online to kids and young people. It\u2019s time for young people to be protected from the harvesting of their data by big tech, that\u2019s then sold off to make huge profits at the expense of young people vulnerabilities and their privacy and their safety. This is how we dismantle the business model of these big tech companies \u2013 who are using business models that are predatory, that are harmful and that are making huge, massive profits off the back of our kids and young Australians. Hit them where it hurts, hit them where they make their money and they make their profit, and it will make these platforms much, much safer. Dutton and ABC reporter clash over Hezbollah question Earlier, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, took aim at an ABC reporter during a press conference in Sydney. The reporter had asked what determines the fact that Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation. Dutton asked where the reporter was from, and there was a back-and-forth between the two over what the exact wording of the question was she was asking. The reporter then asked Dutton: What determines something as a terrorist organisation? Dutton responded: I had presumed, up until this point at least, that the ABC supported the government\u2019s laws. And the government has passed laws, supported on a bipartisan basis \u2013 but not by the ABC, it seems \u2013 in relation to the proscribing or the listing of a terrorist organisation. Hezbollah under Australian law is a listed terrorist organisation. Now if the ABC doesn\u2019t support that, they should be very clear about it \u2026 The journalist interjected and said that that wasn\u2019t what she was saying, but Dutton continued: You asked me why our country has listed Hezbollah. They\u2019re a terrorist organisation, they organise terrorist attacks. Case-by-case humanitarian visas for Palestinians \u2018just a first step\u2019: Asylum Seekers Centre CEO Earlier today, we brought you comments from the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, that he had helped a dozen Palestinian families in Australia move on to humanitarian visas, on a case-by-case basis. The CEO of the Asylum Seekers Centre, Frances Rush, said this was welcome news \u2013 but is \u201cjust a first step\u201d. Rush called for a special humanitarian visa for all arrivals from Gaza, \u201cas offered to those fleeing Afghanistan in 2021 and Ukraine in 2022\u201d: People fleeing this humanitarian crisis deserve a fair go, not a \u2018case-by-case basis\u2019. Those arriving from Gaza cannot be expected to survive in our community on visitor visas without the opportunity to work, study, or access Medicare. We\u2019re calling on the Australian government to be consistent in its granting of visas for arrivals from Gaza. The government must also ensure people fleeing Gaza have the right to work, and can access healthcare and necessary support services once they have arrived in Australia. Mining sector leading Aussie shares lower at midday The Australian share market has fallen, pulling back from record high levels, AAP reports. At midday AEST, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 42.5 points, or 0.51%, to 8,227.3, while the broader All Ordinaries had fallen 39.1 points, or 0.46%, to 8,499.3. While the ASX200 was in the red this morning, CMC Markets head of sales trading Ashley Glover said the index still looked technically bullish with a move to 8,400 in traders\u2019 sights. Four of the ASX\u2019s 11 sectors were lower at midday and six were higher, with energy basically flat. Materials/mining was the biggest loser, dropping 2.2% after five days of gains. All of the big four banks were lower, with CBA down 1.3%, Westpac retreating 1.2%, ANZ dropping 1.0% and NAB falling 0.6%. The Australian dollar was buying 69.30 US cents, from 69.33 US cents at Monday\u2019s ASX close. Bushfire alert issued in WA near Bunbury A bushfire alert has been issued for an area of Dalyellup in Western Australia due to bushfire smoke, with people urged to avoid the area. The advice warning covers an area bounded by Harewoods Road and Dalyellup Boulevard to the north, Maidment Parade and Minninup Road to the east, Lakes Road to the south and the ocean to the west. Although there is no immediate danger, the community is urged to remain aware and keep up to date in case the situation changes. The alert is expected to remain in place until the area receives persistent and heavy rainfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services said. Members of the public are reminded to stay away from the fireground as fire continues to burn underground in some areas. See the greenhouse gas impact of Labor\u2019s decision to expand three NSW coalmines The expansion of three Australian coalmines, approved by the Labor government last week, could generate more than 1.3bn tonnes of damaging greenhouse gas over the next 24 years. For an interactive view on the impacts of these decisions, you can have a read below, thanks to Josh Nicholas: Postal voting applications open for NSW byelections Postal voting applications have now opened for the Epping, Hornsby and Pittwater NSW byelections on 19 October. Applications close at 6pm on 14 October, and late applications cannot be accepted, the NSW Electoral Commission said in a statement. Postal vote packs will be sent out to successful applicants from 8 October. Queensland opposition leader vows not to form a minority government Continuing from our last post: The Queensland opposition leader spent his second day on the campaign trail in Bundaberg, the most marginal electorate in the state. David Crisafulli made his second announcement on youth crime in as many days, a $40m fund for businesses to pay for CCTV and other security measures. He confirmed the party would recommend preferencing Labor over the Greens on its how to vote cards, after yesterday leaving open the possibility of recommending the minor party. He also vowed not to form a minority government: I cannot be any more direct. Queenslanders need confidence and they need certainty. They need change. They need a fresh start. They don\u2019t need horse trading. The answer is categorically, no. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, says he would prolong the operation of a coal-fired power station beyond its planned closure date, if it couldn\u2019t be replaced with renewables. The Callide unit B, which is still operational, is due to close by 2028 at the end of the next term of parliament. The Callide unit C, which blew up in 2021, reopened last month. Crisafulli told media on Tuesday it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to close unit B: It would be absurd to close down baseload power at a time when Queenslanders are struggling to eat. But we do have a vision to make sure that there\u2019s a renewable future, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve spoken about the need to have a long term plan, and we intend to deliver that. Continuing from our last post via AAP: The magistrate also referred to testimony from Hannah McGuire\u2019s mother, Debbie, who said Lachlan Morganti\u2019s offending had forced her family to relive the details of her case through media coverage. Magistrate Michelle Mykytowycz told the court: She also spoke of your audacity in attending her daughter\u2019s funeral, where you were amongst the very people who had contributed to the GoFundMe, knowing that you had spent the money. Your act has infringed on the McGuire family\u2019s ability to grieve in private and with dignity given the unwarranted attention that has flowed from your actions. Morganti\u2019s struggles with alcohol abuse and mental health issues were taken into account in sentencing, but any therapeutic conditions of the order would not go towards his community service. Mykytowycz said: This must be viewed through the lens of the Ballarat community, which has had to deal with the loss of three female members of the community, allegedly by murder, including Hannah in the first six months of this year. GoFundMe has refunded all donors to Hannah\u2019s family fundraiser. Lachlan Young is expected to face the supreme court for a directions hearing on 3 October. Lifeline: 13 11 14 No jail for theft from dead woman\u2019s family fundraiser A man who gambled more than $64,000 from a fundraiser he organised for an alleged murder victim\u2019s family has avoided jail time, AAP reports. Lachlan Morganti, 26, was sentenced to 400 hours of community service in Ballarat magistrates court today after earlier pleading guilty to the April theft from the online fundraiser. Morganti launched a GoFundMe page for the family of 23-year-old Hannah McGuire, whose body was found in a burnt-out car in Scarsdale, about 25km south of Ballarat, on 5 April. Her former partner Lachlan Young has pleaded not guilty to her murder. Magistrate Michelle Mykytowycz noted that if Morganti had not pleaded guilty, she would have sentenced him to six months in prison. The maximum sentence for the offending would have been 10 years. Mykytowycz accepted Morganti \u2013 who knew the McGuires through the local cricket club and the family\u2019s pub \u2013 started the fundraiser as an altruistic act. However, once the money was transferred to your account, the temptation to use this money to recover significant debts from previous losses became overwhelming and self-indulgent to that extent. It was unplanned, unsophisticated, and with the loss of the funds occurring over the space of five days, the impact of your offending cannot be overestimated. First the good news: retail spending picked up in August, rising 0.7% from July, as the burst of early season warmth prompted more spending, the ABS said. Economists had been expecting a 0.4% increase for the month so that is a bit of an uptick, while July spending was revised slightly higher from an initial reading of 0% to a 0.1% rise. (These numbers are \u201cseasonally adjusted\u201d but not for the actual weather, it seems. If you may recall \u2013 and people\u2019s memory about weather is typically short \u2013 August was Australia\u2019s hottest on record for that month.) From a year earlier, spending was up 3.1%. Given that inflation was about 2.7%, with CPI easing to a three-year low, we can mark August down as showing a \u201creal\u201d increase in retail outlays. (Without checking, it\u2019s probably been about three years that spending has been growing, although on a per-capita basis we probably aren\u2019t there yet.) The other data out was building approvals and there the news isn\u2019t so rosy. These fell 6.1% in August, or more than the 4.3% decline expected by economists. The drop erased much of the 11% increase posted in July (a tally revised higher from an initial reading of a 10.4% gain). These approvals data is subject to apartment approvals, which can swing quite a bit. Private sector house approvals were up 0.5% in a sector that the ABS said was \u201csubdued\u201d. Indigenous women in NSW advised to have breast screenings every two years from 40 Indigenous women in NSW are advised to have breast screenings every two years from age 40 instead of 50. The age was initially lowered from 50 as part of the Putuwa project led by the Cancer Institute NSW, as Indigenous women are diagnosed with breast cancer on average four years younger than the overall female population, and have more advanced cancer at diagnosis and poorer survival rates. Since the project began in 2023, breast screening participation rates have more than doubled for women aged 40 to 49 (from 7.8% to 16.7%). The project has been implemented at all NSW BreastScreen sites, where women can receive breast screenings for free without a doctor\u2019s referral. NSW health minister Ryan Park said: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Aboriginal women in NSW but the good news is that breast cancer screening can detect cancers before they can be seen or felt, and when found early, almost all breast cancers can be successfully treated. Early detection is key to saving lives and reducing the impact of breast cancer in the Aboriginal community. As noted in an earlier post, treasurer Jim Chalmers has told journalists that private briefings by senior RBA staff should \u201cbe kept confidential\u201d. This comment was in relation to the AFR reporting this morning that RBC Capital Markets had been sin-binned for a year and won\u2019t be receiving RBA briefings. One of those present at the February gathering apparently tipped off someone else who complained about not getting an invite (and RBC then told the RBA). Senior RBA officials, of course, might seem like gnomes at times but they aren\u2019t supposed to be hermits. It makes sense they \u201cliaise\u201d with outsiders to get feedback (apparently one former deputy governor was known to ring people up directly to avoid the palaver of formal gatherings). Philip Lowe, the previous RBA governor, got into strife in early 2023 when he met people at a Barrenjoey event two days after the central bank hiked the cash rate. Part of the angst was the leaking of news about the February event but he was also criticised for managing to make time for a private meeting when he hadn\u2019t yet fronted the public, as had been customary after the summer break. (The RBA board doesn\u2019t meet in January.) New governor Michele Bullock, of course, now holds a media briefing after every board meeting. What to do, though, about those confidential briefings? We understand the RBA will consider disclosing any such meetings and who attended them shortly after they take place. Let\u2019s see how soon that change is implemented \u2013 or not. Here\u2019s the full story from Josh Butler, looking at those earlier comments from Tony Burke accusing Peter Dutton of seeking to \u201craise the temperature\u201d of public debate about the conflict in the Middle East: Call for human rights-based approach to protecting coral reefs A new study suggests that a human rights-based approach to coral reef protection could ensure governments are held to account for safeguarding marine ecosystems. Lead author Dr Emma Camp from UTS said the window of opportunity to conserve coral reefs was rapidly closing: 2024 marks the fourth global coral bleaching event impacting more than 50% of the world\u2019s coral reefs, as well as other stressors such as pollution. This is an urgent reminder that the loss of coral ecosystems negatively impacts both humans and nonhumans. Implementing coral reef conservation through a human rights-based approach will provide a practical path towards a much-needed transformation of local, national, and international governance, while also highlighting the human side of coral loss. In 2022 the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment was affirmed by the UN general assembly. Co-author Dr Genevieve Wilkinson said a rights-based approach to this issue \u201cembeds non-discrimination, empowerment and participation so that litigation is not the only available avenue for participation and empowerment of vulnerable rightsholders\u201d: States must be accountable to obligations to protect human rights and find just solutions. Children\u2019s commissioner to address National Press Club tomorrow The children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, is due to address the National Press Club tomorrow on a new report calling for an overhaul of Australia\u2019s approach to child justice. The report has been developed over 12 months and contains 24 recommendations, focusing on elevating child wellbeing to a national priority, coordinating action on child justice reform across Australia\u2019s federation, and ensuring reform is based on evidence and human rights. There were hundreds of submissions, interviews and consultations, including with more than 150 children and young people who have been or are at risk of being in contact with police and criminal justice systems, or in youth detention. Hollonds will tomorrow detail the findings of the report, unpack key recommendations and address the barriers to action \u2013 including the role of the media and how \u201cpolitics gets in the way of prevention\u201d. Kyle and Jackie O have risen to the top spot in Sydney radio but the pair\u2019s expansion into Melbourne radio has flopped, according to the latest radio ratings covering July to September. Ratings agency GfK has reported that their KIIS FM breakfast show is down from 6.1% to 5.2% in the Melbourne market, which appears not to have embraced their vulgar style of broadcasting. The top radio station in Melbourne is Nine\u2019s 3AW with a share of 14.9%. The leading breakfast show, 3AW\u2019s Russel and Ross, has a 22.5% share. But the duo has taken over from 2GB\u2019s Ben Fordham in Sydney as the leading breakfast show, despite losing 0.6% of their audience this survey. In good news for ABC local radio, breakfast presenter Craig Reucassel has grown his share by 1.2% while Fordham has lost 3.1 share points. The most popular radio station in Adelaide is Mix 102.3. Grave warning for Australians as Israel invades Lebanon AAP has more details about Australia\u2019s work to get its citizens out of Lebanon as Israel launches a ground invasion. Those in Lebanon are being assisted by Dfat to secure commercial airline tickets as the risk of the international airport shutting heightens. It follows months of repeated warnings to Australians in Lebanon that they needed to leave as the security situation deteriorated and any repatriation effort in a crisis would be severely strained and unable to evacuate everyone. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong has reiterated calls for Australians to take the first opportunity to leave: There is a risk Beirut airport may close for an extended period \u2026 We continue to urge Australians in Lebanon to take the first opportunity they can to depart. Please do not wait for a preferred route. Canada has secured 800 seats on commercial flights across three days to evacuate its citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families. Treasurer Jim Chalmers urged restraint, saying Australia was \u201cgravely concerned for the human cost of an escalation of this conflict\u201d. You can read more of his comments earlier in the blog here. Queensland needs a fresh start, Crisafulli says The Queensland opposition leader, David Crisafulli, spoke to ABC News Breakfast this morning from Cairns, as the Miles\u2019 Labor government goes into caretaker mode before the 26 October election. He was asked about his use of the term \u201cunderdog\u201d for himself, given the promising numbers in the polls. Crisafulli responded: Since 1986, the last 12 elections, the LNP have won one. So you can forgive me for not buying any of that hype at all \u2026 Ultimately, the battle lines for this election is \u2013 after 10 years of this government, are things better or worse when it comes to youth crime, health, housing, cost of living? And who\u2019s got the right plans to do something about it? And that\u2019s our focus. And the state does need a fresh start. Crisafulli also spoke about his stance on youth crime: I am proposing a 12-month plan \u2013 six months intensive \u2013 where young kids are given the structure to turn their life around \u2026 Yes, there will be people who disagree with one part of that plan. I respect that. But what\u2019s happening in Queensland at the moment is broken, and we intend to make sure that, at every single level of the youth crime crisis, we deal with it and do something about it \u2013 and change does need to occur. Manufacturing gauge sinks to record lows outside the height of Covid The Reserve Bank has made it clear that it\u2019s mostly worried about bringing inflation to heel before it starts cutting interest rates. Data out today, though, might provide a couple of other data points for it to ponder. First up, Judo Bank has released its monthly manufacturing purchasing manager\u2019s index, with all the arrows pointing lower. New orders and production are sinking at the fastest pace since May 2020 and export orders are declining \u201csolidly\u201d (that\u2019s a new descriptor). The price factories are asking for their widgets (etc) are increasing but at a slower rate in line with input costs. The index also noted firms were cutting staff and workloads. All up, the index is down for an eight month in a row, with the slide in September the steepest since May 2000 when Covid disruptions were near their worst. Separately, the weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan Australian Consumer Confidence survey also retreated a bit, with households\u2019 confidence about financial conditions wilting at the fastest pace in more than a year, ANZ said. More to the RBA\u2019s liking, though, was a notable slide of 0.3 percentage points in inflation expectations to 4.6%. That\u2019s a level last reached in September 2021. Later this morning ABS will release August data on retail sales and building approvals, so the RBA \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 can learn a bit more about how the economy is faring. More than 80% of people in Lebanon are living in poverty, Caritas Australia chief says The interim CEO of aid agency Caritas Australia, Kirsten Sayers, says more than 80% of people in Lebanon are now living in poverty. This comes amid news Israel has launched what it is calling a \u201climited\u201d ground invasion. Economically, Sayers said, the situation was already dire in Lebanon before this conflict, with \u201cwith the cost of purchasing essentials having skyrocketed by percentages in the hundreds\u201d after the explosion in the Port of Beirut. She said the increase in costs has been \u201cincomprehensible\u201d \u2013 comparing it to Australians spending $160 a week on average for food, and having this increased to $560 in just one year: Most previously self-sufficient families are now facing a similar level of need to the nation\u2019s sizeable refugee population and this conflict, bringing damage to resources and infrastructure, will only make things worse. She said the conflict could result in \u201cthe destruction of critical infrastructure such as roads, and potentially make it hard for commercial companies and even aid organisations to get goods across borders\u201d. The New South Wales opposition is urging the Minns Labor government to strengthen the ban on the display of symbols of proscribed terrorist groups in the state if the federal parliament does not do so. The NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, issued a statement this morning calling on the premier, Chris Minns, to step in if the federal government didn\u2019t remedy \u201cpossible gaps\u201d in national criminal laws. It comes after some people who took part in rallies in Sydney and Melbourne at the weekend to protest against Israel\u2019s attacks on Lebanon displayed Hezbollah flags. More than 6,000 Lebanese people have been wounded and more than 1,000 killed in the past two weeks, including 100 people who died in Israeli strikes on Sunday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. The Australian government has recognised Hezbollah \u2013 a Lebanese Shia Islamist political party and militant group backed by Iran \u2013 as a terrorist organisation since September 2021. Speakman said the commonwealth criminal code made it an offence to display the symbols of terrorist organisations, but only if another matter \u2013 such as disseminating ideas based on racial hatred or intimidation \u2013 could be proved: Tough legislation will ensure that NSW is no safe haven for those who support or sympathise with terrorist organisations. I urge the Minns Labor government to show their commitment to public safety by being prepared to introduce such legislation. In 2022 the NSW parliament passed laws banning Nazi symbols, which meant anyone intentionally waving a Nazi flag or displaying memorabilia bearing swastikas could be jailed for up to a year or fined $100,000. Qatar Airways\u2019 plan to buy stake in Virgin pitched as \u2018great news for Australians\u2019 Jayne Hrdlicka, the CEO of Virgin, was on ABC News Breakfast earlier amid news Qatar Airways intends to buy a 25% stake in Virgin. Speaking on what this would mean for Virgin, she said: It means that we\u2019ve got an important shareholder who has scale that we don\u2019t have, who has expertise that we don\u2019t have, that can help us \u2026 to do things that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to do as quickly and give us the chance to compete better domestically. We think that this is great news for Australians. It means a very strong competitor domestically to stand the best of time. And also the ability to put our toe in the water and add services between Australia and Doha, which opens up 107 new destinations for Australians with one stop over Doha. Homemade pipe bombs allegedly discovered inside car during random breath test A man has been charged after two homemade pipe bombs were allegedly found inside his car during a random breath test. Midday yesterday, officers stopped a vehicle along the Sturt Highway near Hay, in the NSW Riverina, for random breath testing. During a search of the car police allegedly located cannabis leaf, methylamphetamine, a large knife and two explosive devices \u2013 alleged to be homemade pipe bombs. Police closed the Sturt Highway and an exclusion zone was established. The rescue bomb disposal unit allegedly confirmed that the devices were explosives before they were dismantled. Two men, aged 33 and 30, were arrested and taken to Hay police station while police established an investigation. The 33-year-old man was charged with two counts of possessing an explosive in a public place, two counts of possessing a prohibited drug and custody of a knife in a public place. He was refused bail to appear before Griffith local court today. The 30-year-old was released without charge, pending further investigations. The government has temporarily approved an overseas supplier of PrEP to ensure the thousands of Australians, with or at risk of contracting HIV, are protected amid a shortage of the medication. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is an antiretroviral drug taken by people at high risk of HIV infection, which lowers their chance of catching HIV, but has been in short supply for over a month. For the more than 27,000 Australians that use PrEP the government says the supply situation will improve from today, with the Laurus Labs USA registered brand will be listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, allowing supply at a subsidised cost for the period of the shortage. The supply of tens of thousands of units will resolve the shortage by early November, according to the government, with approximately four months\u2019 supply in the country by then, and future planned deliveries meeting normal ongoing demand. The health minister Mark Butler said: PrEP is highly important for Australians living with or at risk of HIV and we have taken swift action to ensure they are protected from current shortages. We are committed to supporting those with HIV and to the once thought impossible goal of eliminating transmission of HIV in Australia by 2030. Man dies after quad bike crash A man has died after a quad bike crash in the north-west of NSW. Emergency services were called to reports of a vehicle crash yesterday afternoon, about 25km south of Moree. Police found a quad bike that had rolled over on the levee bank of the Tycannach Creek, and a man \u2013 aged 82 \u2013 was pronounced dead at the scene. The scene was examined by forensic investigators, and a report will be prepared for the coroner. Steven Miles catches public transport to officially launch election campaign Forget Harris\u2019s limo or Trump\u2019s private jet, Queensland\u2019s premier caught public transport this morning to travel to the governor and ask her to dissolve parliament, officially launching the state\u2019s election campaign. Steven Miles and his wife Kim caught the train from their home in Mango Hill to Roma Street in the city before hailing a 61 bus to Paddington and walking the last leg to Government House. Miles\u2019 50c fare is his signature policy from 10 months as premier after Annastacia Palaszczuk stood down and her former deputy ascended to the peak of Queensland politics. It looks likely to be his lasting legacy, given that the opposition leader LNP David Crisafulli \u2013 widely tipped to win the election \u2013 has said he will continue the policy. Along with his decision to abandon plans to demolish and rebuild the Gabba for 2032 Olympics, making public transport cheap was key to what Miles has sought to characterise as his own vision for the sunshine state. Miles\u2019 choice of transport on Tuesday was perhaps reminiscent of former Uruguayan president Jose Mujica, who used to get around in a 1987 Volkswagen Beetle. Vape-selling training for pharmacists Continuing from our last post: The government says its has worked with the peak professional body for pharmacists, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia to develop updated guidelines, education and training for pharmacists to support the tobacco and vaping reforms. More than 2,000 pharmacists attended a national webinar training and further face-to-face workshops and online educational products and information for pharmacists will be available, according to the government. Pharmacists will also have automatic insurance coverage when supplying vaping products for smoking and nicotine dependence. From today, people 18 years or older will no longer need a prescription to buy vapes from a pharmacy for the purpose of helping to quit smoking or manage nicotine dependence. Vapes will have similar restrictions to other pharmacist-only products including allergy and asthma medications, with pharmacists required to sight photo ID for age verification purposes and have a conversation about the health harms of vaping. If you need a quick recap of why the government \u2013 which has wanted to crack down on vaping \u2013 is easing the laws around access, let me take you back to June. The government had been pushing for world-first reforms that would have meant vapes would only be available at pharmacies with a prescription from a GP or nurse practitioner, a move backed by more than 50 public health organisations, peak doctor groups, and groups across social work and education. But to get the support in the Senate needed to pass the reforms into law, the government reached a last-minute deal with the Greens under which the prescription model was abandoned. Then, to give pharmacists enough time to prepare for the last-minute change in the legislation, the original prescription model was put in place for the first three months \u2013 which brings us to today, when the deal agreed with the Greens kicks in and there no prescription needed for vapes with a nicotine concentration of 20 mg/mL or less. Those aged under 18 will need a prescription, no matter what. Labor taking \u2018comprehensive approach\u2019 to gambling ads Q: Will there be an outright ban on gambling advertising? That\u2019s what the report recommended. It was very comprehensive. Michelle Rowland said the government was consulting on a model addressing the three key areas she had outlined (see previous post): This is an area in which the government is taking a comprehensive approach. We\u2019ll continue to work through this because we know that Australians want change in this area, and the government\u2019s made it clear that the status quo is unsustainable. Communications minister discusses prospect of gambling ad ban Michelle Rowland was on ABC News Breakfast earlier and was asked about the prospect of an outright ban on gambling advertising. She responded that the government is pursuing \u201ca very comprehensive suite of reforms\u201d in response to the late Peta Murphy\u2019s report. The minister said three key areas needed addressing \u2013 protecting children, breaking \u201cthat nexus between sport and online wagering\u201d and dealing with the saturation of ads: Particularly that targeting of ads towards one of the most vulnerable cohorts, which is young men aged 18 to around 35. So we\u2019re working through that comprehensively. Rowland said a large number of the recommendations deal with state and commonwealth relations, \u201cso we need to work through those carefully\u201d: We\u2019re doing this as expeditiously as possible, but I can obviously appreciate that your viewers would have wanted action in this area some 10 years ago. We know that Australia, unfortunately, suffers some $25bn a year from gambling losses. Of course, the vast majority of that comprises land-based gambling \u2013 both pokies and casinos \u2013 for which there is little or no advertising. But we do know that online wagering is an area of growing harms. We want our response to be forward-looking, we want it to be effective, and we want it to ensure that there are limited unintended consequences, that they can be dealt with, and that it is an effective approach. Confidential RBA briefings should stay confidential, Chalmers says If you pay any attention to political news, you have probably heard the term \u201ca wide-ranging press conference/interview\u201d. That is usually code for a politician trying to address several fires at once. This is a \u201cwide-ranging\u201d press conference. Jim Chalmers turns to reports in the AFR that the Reserve Bank has banned a global investment bank from private briefings, after leaks. (The RBA, like all central banks, offers private off-the-record briefings to a range of stakeholders, where it explains some of the thinking behind its actions. It also does this publicly now, with the press conference after each of its board meetings.) The background briefings though, are supposed to stay in the background. On the AFR report, Chalmers says: If the commercial banks are going to receive confidential briefings from the Reserve Bank, they should be kept confidential. And I have some sympathy for the Reserve Bank in when it comes to the issue reported today in your newspaper. People should respect the process and the agreements, and where that hasn\u2019t happened, there will be consequences, and I will leave them in the capable hands of the independent Reserve Bank. It\u2019s not for the treasurer to manage or police agreements between the Reserve Bank and the commercial banks when it comes to private briefings, but I do share the concern reported today in your paper that some elements of confidentiality may have been breached, and I\u2019m sure that our colleagues at the bank are working through what that means for the way that they conduct those briefings and who\u2019s involved. Chalmers \u2018gravely concerned\u2019 about human cost of conflict in Middle East Jim Chalmers has also spoken on the situation in Lebanon after the news Israel has launched what it is calling a \u201climited\u201d ground invasion. The treasurer said the \u201csituation in Lebanon has escalated overnight\u201d and this is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d: We are gravely concerned for the human cost of an escalation of this conflict. We continue to urge restraint and de-escalation, because further hostilities put the lives of tens of thousands of civilians at risk. The global community has been really clear that the destructive cycle in this part of the world must stop. We call again on parties to agree to the comprehensive ceasefire deal brokered by the US, Qatar and Egypt, and endorsed by the UN security council. Delays in agreeing ceasefires are costing lives, and Lebanon, as Penny Wong said, cannot become the next Gaza. Chalmers added that \u201cwe do not mourn the death of a terrorist leader responsible for all of that destruction in the Middle East\u201d: We do mourn the loss of so many innocent lives in the Middle East. Too many lives have already been lost to this conflict. An escalation of this conflict risks even more innocent lives, too many families, too many children have already been lost to the conflict in the Middle East, and the escalation risks making that worse. Treasurer holds press conference in Canberra Treasurer Jim Chalmers is holding an early-morning press conference in Canberra, where he has pre-empted questions about the proposed Qatar stake in Virgin. Qatar Air is proposing to buy a 25% stake in Virgin Australia, which would allow it broader access to the Australian domestic market. Chalmers says it is a matter for the ACCC: It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me to pre-empt that process or comment further. We expect that components of the deal related to international flights will also be subject to ACCC merger authorisation consideration. As I understand it, the ACCC hasn\u2019t yet received an application \u2026 My role in it is on the Foreign Investment Review Board. And when I get that advice, I will consider it in the usual methodical way. I will say, more broadly, we do want to see a strong, competitive airline industry that delivers for consumers. \u2018These people should be locked up,\u2019 Littleproud says Continuing from our last post: Nationals leader David Littleproud spoke to Brisbane radio 4BC where he expressed a different view: Unfortunately, I think many Australians are just blindly getting on with their day and not understanding the gravity of exactly what is happening on the streets in our cities. These people should be locked up if they want to support a terrorist organisation, they are importing hate to this country and we should be alive to that and we should do something about that. The core responsibility of any government is to keep its people safe. And shortly after that, Liberal leader Peter Dutton appeared on Sky with what he thought should happen: Enforcement of the law is required. And if there are laws that need to be passed to make sure that our values are upheld, the prime minister should be doing that. Mass arrests won\u2019t help fight extremism, Canavan says Hello and good morning from Canberra. The political attention is split today, with Queensland premier Steven Miles about to officially ask for an election to be called, but the federal MPs are still doing what they can to claim a bit of space. One of those MPs is Queensland LNP senator Matt Canavan, who appeared on Sky News early this morning where he took a slightly different view to handling protesters, compared with his party leadership. Canavan, who has previously said he flirted with communism while at university, said he wasn\u2019t sure if threats to \u201cmass arrest\u201d people were winning hearts and minds: I don\u2019t know if just mass arresting people is going to help here. I mean, we\u2019ve obviously got a huge problem in our society over extremism. These are abominable displays we\u2019ve seen on our streets. But this is ultimately a battle of ideas, and ideas that include an end-of-days extreme ideology. And I just don\u2019t know if just mass arresting people is going to defeat that. I mean, I\u2019ll draw the comparison to communism. Katy Gallagher was also asked about calls from Peter Dutton to recall the parliament and give the AFP powers to arrest people who allegedly held Hezbollah flags at protests at the weekend. Is this something the government would consider? Gallagher said: I think that the leader of the opposition knows that the police are and have indicated that they are investigating the matters on the weekend, including the [alleged] raising of those flags of a listed terrorist organisation. It is appropriate, and in this country, we do have law enforcement agencies that actually undertake the investigation. The investigation is not undertaken by the leader of the opposition. Parliament is sitting next week. I think the leader of the opposition understands what he\u2019s doing here, which is trying to raise and create further division at a moment where people are feeling extremely concerned about what\u2019s happening in the Middle East. Gallagher said the alleged raising of Hezbollah flags \u201cis absolutely inappropriate, and it is absolutely appropriate that the police investigate that matter\u201d. Gallagher reiterates call for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, spoke to ABC News Breakfast just earlier to discuss the crisis unfolding in Lebanon. Asked if there is a plan to evacuate citizens if it comes to it, she said Dfat and the government have been \u201cworking hard over the last few months around contingency planning [and] people should be assured that that work is being done\u201d. She was asked what message Australia is sending to Israel at the moment, with the Israeli government not appearing to be heeding international calls for it to pull back from a ground offensive and agree to a ceasefire. Gallagher responded: Last week you saw that Australia \u2013 along with a number of other nations like the US, the UK and the European Union \u2013 had issued a statement which called for a ceasefire, for further humanitarian assistance, which Australia is providing to Lebanon. And certainly, calling for de-escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. So that remains our message. That remains our message to Israel. We don\u2019t want to see loss of life that we have been seeing in the Middle East over the past year, particularly in Gaza, about now in Lebanon as well. You can follow the latest developments on our separate live blog below: Liberal senator speaks up for negative gearing Andrew Bragg was also asked about reports that the Treasury is looking at options on negative gearing reform. What\u2019s wrong with looking at it, he was asked? Bragg said: We don\u2019t think that increasing taxes on houses is going to result in more \u2026 houses. That\u2019s pretty simply our view. And as you know, about half the cost of a new house in NSW already goes in taxes and regulatory charges. So, increasing the tax burden on housing is not a very good approach and, unfortunately, it\u2019s been held out by some like the Greens as a silver bullet to the housing crisis when, unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a silver bullet other than building more houses and finding ways to tilt the scales in favour of first home buyers. But why shouldn\u2019t it be on the table to explore? Bragg said, \u201cbecause even if you changed it, you still have a massive housing problem.\u201d And asked if there should be any limits on how many negatively geared properties people can have, Bragg responded: The deduction of rental losses is a pretty standard tax principle that applies across the economy. And at the end of the day, I think this is a massive distraction from the core issue, which is that the government have not built enough houses, and they haven\u2019t been creative in ways to help first home buyers. Liberal senator Andrew Bragg was on ABC RN earlier to discuss an idea being pushed by some Liberals \u2013 to loosen credit laws to help first home buyers. He made the case for the changes and said: [At] the moment, you have basically [a] very low level of delinquencies in Australia, and so the banks aren\u2019t able to take on any risk \u2013 and frankly, we want banks to take on some risk, particularly in relation to first home buyers. And a lot of people who are listening today, who may be older Australians, would probably have never received a loan under the current arrangements if they were in place 20 or 30 years ago. So we need to balance risk management against our objective of growing first home ownership in Australia. And in other countries like Singapore, the equivalent regulator has to consider the impact on the economy and on people, whereas [the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority] only has one very narrow objective. Asked if this could push house prices up further, Bragg said this was \u201ca conversation about getting more first home buyers into the market\u201d. Queensland premier Steven Miles has launched a last-gasp bid to stand down the controversial Townsville mayor during his final hours in office before embarking upon an uphill re-election campaign. This morning, Miles\u2019 office confirmed it had sent a late-night show cause to Troy Thompson while the corruption watchdog investigates claims he embellished his military service during his mayoral campaign. Thompson will have three weeks to respond. He has been contacted for comment. Miles\u2019 Labor government goes into caretaker mode today. Dutton calls for cancelling of visas if \u2018people are acting outside of Australian law\u2019 Continuing his interview on Today, Peter Dutton said there should be \u201cconsequences\u201d for people in Australia on a visa if they \u201caren\u2019t abiding by our laws or they aren\u2019t adhering to the values that they\u2019ve signed up to\u201d: And I know Tony Burke talks about the prospect \u2013 \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll cancel visas.\u201d No, we have to be very definite about this. If people are acting outside of Australian law, if they\u2019re acting in a way that\u2019s inconsistent with the obligations that they\u2019ve signed up to under their visa \u2013 that is to come here and to be peaceful \u2013 then their visas should be must be cancelled ahead of Monday [7 October], which is a significant day. Dutton wants parliament recalled to debate anti-terrorism laws The former deputy police commissioner for NSW, Mick Willing, spoke with Sunrise earlier amid news the AFP would investigate at least six people who allegedly waved Hezbollah flags at rallies over the weekend. Willing described the alleged actions as \u201catrocious \u2026 [and] unacceptable in this country\u201d but said police have to work within the confines of the legislation: So, the simple display of some of those symbols on itself is not enough to charge. There are a range of thresholds that have to be met. I am glad the investigation has kicked off both by the Australian Federal Police, Victoria and NSW too. It is going to take some time to pull that investigation together, but they have to work within the confines of that legislation. At the same time, the opposition leader Peter Dutton spoke with the Today show and said \u201cI believe that there are provisions within the existing law\u201d, but if there\u2019s not, the PM should \u201crecall Parliament and deal with whatever deficiency there is in the law\u201d. The glorification of a man who is a leader of a terrorist organisation \u2013 It\u2019d be like people out there glorifying Adolf Hitler or glorifying Osama bin Laden. It\u2019s completely unacceptable. Finding the right envoy on Islamophobia \u2018has taken a while\u2019, minister says Tony Burke was also asked about the special envoy on Islamophobia, and said \u201cfinding the right person has taken a while\u201d: Rather than starting with a name, I started talking to people about what sort of person should fill the role. And it was through those conversations that Aftab Malik emerged \u2026 This is a very targeted job for them, to talk about Islamophobia, and it\u2019s important that they have the support of the community, and Aftab does, but it\u2019s also important their job is to help to combat Islamophobia throughout the country. Burke said he would \u201cgo through my whole life without experiencing hate speech and bigotry in this country, but my neighbours won\u2019t\u201d. He said Australia has legal protection against hate speech on a range of issues such as race, sex, gender and disability, but not faith: So that\u2019s why these envoy positions are particularly important to help make the case and to help to lower the temperature in Australia. We always need to remember, while it hasn\u2019t happened here in Australia, the Christchurch massacre was conducted by an Australian. Islamophobia can lead to forms of terror and violent extremism that are absolutely horrific. If you go to who is the person most likely to be targeted for abuse in Australia right now, it\u2019s an Islamic woman wearing a hijab. I don\u2019t want that to be the case. I want everyone to be able to live peacefully and live safely. Burke says he has met \u2018extraordinary\u2019 Palestinians and transferred them on to humanitarian visas Tony Burke was also asked about Palestinians who are in Australia on visitor visas and what will happen to them in the long term. He said he had been dealing with them \u201ccase-by-case\u201d over the past few weeks: For some of the people who I\u2019ve been meeting with, I\u2019ve been transferring them on to humanitarian visas. That\u2019s the same humanitarian visa that the Ukrainians have been on\u2026 We\u2019re doing all the full checks that you\u2019d expect in terms of security checks and everything that gets done. Burke said he had helped 12 families with this process so far, moving them to humanitarian visas: They don\u2019t all have to be personal meetings with me, but so far, they have been \u2026 I\u2019ve met with some extraordinary people, some people with skills like some accountants who are desperate to be able to work here in Australia. One man who has a son with cerebral palsy \u2026 [and he] carried his adult son for 5km to try to get into safety [in Gaza]. When he met with me, he was still carrying his son because they didn\u2019t have a wheelchair yet. These are some extraordinary, good people who I\u2019ve met with, and I\u2019m hoping with those individual decisions that we\u2019ve been making, that they\u2019re finding a bit more safety here in Australia. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has called for parliament to be recalled to pass laws addressing the alleged waving of Hezbollah flags at rallies at the weekend. Tony Burke told ABC RN: He didn\u2019t say we should recall the parliament so that we could get our housing legislation through. He didn\u2019t say we should move quickly in the parliament to get cheaper childcare, cheaper medicines or anything done \u2026 If you were going to recall the parliament, you\u2019d be doing it to do something on cost of living, and we\u2019ve got the legislation in front of parliament right now to try to get more people into houses, and Peter Dutton and the Greens are voting together to prevent that from happening. But is there a case for strengthening the laws? Burke responded: These are laws that Peter Dutton supported when they were passed a year ago. He argued that Dutton wanted to recall the parliament for two reasons: because \u201cany chance he gets to not talk about cost of living, he wants to take it\u201d, and second: With Peter Dutton, it remains the case that no matter how many times our security agencies say we need to lower the temperature in Australia, he wants to raise the temperature every single time. He doesn\u2019t want to recall parliament because he wants to change laws that he supported a year ago, he wants to recall parliament because he wants to throw more kerosene on the fire and get people angrier with each other and say more outrageous things in the parliament. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s nothing to do with Australia. We mourn the civilians \u2013 not the Hezbollah leader, Burke says Tony Burke was asked about reports of people mourning Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and said: Well, the government doesn\u2019t mourn him for one minute, not for one minute, but I\u2019ll tell you \u2013 there are civilians who have been killed who we mourn. There are people who have nothing to do with terrorism, who were alive a week ago and are dead now, and we certainly, certainly mourn them. For people claiming that they mourn someone like that, they can explain that for themselves, but from the government\u2019s perspective, there are plenty of people to mourn, and he\u2019s not one of them \u2026 The number of civilians killed is just intolerable, and that\u2019s why the government\u2019s calls for a ceasefire are so important. Anti-hate speech laws \u2018supported by both sides of politics\u2019 Is waving a Hezbollah flag in Australia against the law? Tony Burke said that there are \u201ccertainly laws that speak to it\u201d. From December last year in the commonwealth criminal code, it became an offence to display the symbols of a listed terrorist organisation, which Hezbollah has been designated as since 2021. Burke said of the legislation: When those laws were passed through the parliament, they were the strongest statement on hate speech that the parliament has ever taken. They were supported by both sides of politics. They\u2019re yet to be tested in the courts for the first time \u2026 The first cases that are brought will be the first cases that are tested, and they may well be from what happened over the course of the weekend. \u2018I\u2019ve got very strong views against hate speech and hate symbols\u2019 Tony Burke was asked what the bar would be for a visa cancellation, and whether holding a Hezbollah flag would be enough for a visa to be cancelled. He didn\u2019t answer directly because of the court process but said: I\u2019ve got very strong views against hate speech and hate symbols, very strong views, and I don\u2019t want the anger and hatred from around the world being imported into Australia. And so as far as I\u2019m concerned, it doesn\u2019t matter which side of a conflict you\u2019re on, if you\u2019re involved in inciting discord and hatred in Australia, then I want to have a look. And I asked the department to prepare a brief for me so I can consider whether the visa should be cancelled. Inciting discord a reason for me to cancel visas, Tony Burke says The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, is speaking with ABC RN amid news the AFP will investigate at least six people who allegedly waved Hezbollah flags at rallies at the weekend. Asked if any visas had been cancelled since the weekend, Burke said no: We don\u2019t know whether people there are actually on visas, or people who end up being of concern to the authorities are on visas. He added: I was simply asked within my portfolio whether actions that I would take, and it\u2019s very clear that if someone\u2019s inciting discord, they fail the character tests, [then] I\u2019d be willing to cancel those visas \u2026 We do have a higher standard in Australia if you\u2019re on a visa as to what\u2019s expected. If you\u2019re on a visa in anyone\u2019s country, you\u2019re there as a guest \u2026 Where people will have arguments about freedom of speech, when you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s country, you\u2019re there as a guest, and inciting discord is a reason for me to refuse visas and a reason for me to cancel visas. Age discrimination commissioner urges more accurate reporting about older people The age discrimination commissioner, Robert Fitzgerald, is urging the media to improve how it reports on older people. A study commissioned by the Australian Human Rights Commission and titled Shaping perceptions: How Australian media reports on ageing found that negative stereotypes of older people are widely prevalent in mainstream media, as well as the under-reporting or misrepresentation of the matters affecting them. Fitzgerald said positive and accurate portrayals of ageing in the media were found to be in the minority: A key reason cited for these poor representations is the current state of Australian media. With many newsrooms shrinking and understaffed, specialist reporters being phased out, and overworked journalists facing tighter deadlines with fewer resources, the study found it is increasingly difficult for journalists to adequately research or report on age and ageing. This is resulting in the misreporting of older people, or unconscious biases seeping into news coverage. The study also found the commercial drive to mainly target younger audiences was \u201ceither minimising older Australians or overstating their issues in line with the \u2018click-bait\u2019 culture\u201d. National weather forecasts Sticking with the weather, here\u2019s a look at the forecasts across Australia\u2019s capital cities today: Of note, Darwin is forecast to reach a top of 35C. There\u2019s a heatwave warning for central and northern parts of the Daly district, and over the Tiwi district. Maximum temperatures in the high 30s to low 40s, with overnight minimum temperatures in the low to mid 20s, are forecast during the heatwave period \u2013 expected to last until at least Thursday. 2024-25 bushfire season begins Today marks the official start of the 2024-25 bushfire season. The NSW Rural Fire Service says the bushfire danger period has now begun for most local government areas in the state. This means a fire permit is needed for all burning activities and at all times. Australians looking for love will have more protection with dating apps captured by a safety code aimed at improving users\u2019 experiences, AAP reports. Almost three in four people experienced online sexual harassment, aggression or violence by someone they had met through an online dating platform in the past five years, according to one study. One in five reported being threatened and about one in eight people had images or video taken of them without consent. A voluntary code to which all the major dating app providers have signed aims to stamp out this behaviour when it comes into force on 1 October. The most popular apps including Bumble and Grindr as well as Tinder and Hinge, which are both operated by Match Group, have signed up to the code. It means they need to put in place measures to detect potential online harm, take actions against perpetrators to make sure they can\u2019t create new accounts or jump across to another app and have a clear reporting mechanism to help victims. The companies are further required to better engage with law enforcement and provide resources promoting support. Communications minister Michelle Rowland said the largely unregulated space had resulted in harms, including death, from online abuse on top of it facilitating violence against women and girls: We expect these safety improvements to be rapidly realised. The eSafety commissioner will assess the code\u2019s effectiveness over nine months. Majority of Australian charities say demand for non-food aid at all-time high Good360 Australia surveyed 500 charities across the country and found 82% said demand for essential non-food aid was at an all-time high. The research revealed personal hygiene products were the most in-demand (76%), followed by clothing (72%) and educational supplies (69%). Managing director Alison Covington said the cost-of-living crisis was pushing \u201cmore Australians to the brink, and we are seeing a significant increase in the number of people turning to charities for help\u201d: It\u2019s not just the volume of need that\u2019s concerning, but the fact that 58% of charities are reporting a rise in people seeking help for the first time. The reality is that our communities need more than just food; they need everyday essentials that contribute to a dignified life. We need to do more to ensure that all Australians, regardless of their circumstances, have access to the essentials. This includes items to support personal hygiene, for education, for living comfortably at home, and for play. And hello! Thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. I\u2019m Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be with you most of today on the live blog. As always, you can reach out via X, @emilywindwrites, or email, emily.wind@theguardian.com, with any thoughts, questions and tips. Let\u2019s go. More on Qatar Airways\u2019 plans to buy a stake in Virgin Virgin Australia says its partnership with Qatar would bring benefits to flyers through increased competition. The press release says: The expanded codeshare and collaboration arrangement will provide access to a greater range of international destinations with improved schedules and frequencies, increased earn and redemption opportunities for members of Velocity and Qatar Airways\u2019 Privilege Club, and broader access to great value fares for leisure travellers, small and medium-sized enterprises, and corporate customers. Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said: We believe competition in aviation is a good thing and it helps raise the bar, ultimately benefiting customers. This agreement will also help support Australian jobs, businesses and the wider economy. Qatar Airways has announced it intends to buy a 25% stake in Virgin Australia from its current owner Bain Capital. Subject to regulator approval, the deal will launch Virgin launch flights to Doha from Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, Virgin said in a press release this morning. These flights will open up new connecting flights to destinations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The company said: The proposed wet lease services will begin in mid-2025, allowing Virgin Australia to assess the longer-term merits and viability of wide-body aircraft flying while providing Australians with greater local competition for their long-haul travel needs in the near-term. Virgin said the minority stake also \u201cserves as a cornerstone investment ahead of an anticipated return of Virgin Australia into public ownership\u201d. Virgin CEO Jayne Jrdlicka said: This partnership brings the missing piece to Virgin Australia\u2019s longer-term strategy and is a huge vote of confidence in Australian aviation. Importantly, it will further strengthen Virgin Australia\u2019s ability to compete over the long term, which will inevitably translate into more choice and even better value airfares for consumers as well as additional Australian aviation jobs. I am delighted that our closer relationship [with Qatar Airways] allows us to put our \u2018toe in the water\u2019 regarding long-haul international. $30m boost for ACCC to crack down on supermarkets Australia\u2019s consumer watchdog will be given a $30m boost to crack down on \u201cunfair\u201d practices by supermarkets and retailers. Anthony Albanese will put the supermarket giants on notice today over their \u201cdodgy practices\u201d. He said: We don\u2019t want to see ordinary Australians, families and pensioners being taken for a ride by the supermarkets, and we\u2019re taking steps to make sure they get a fair go at the checkout. Here\u2019s our full story: And our business correspondent Jonathan Barrett has this analysis piece and some charts to explain how the big two leapfrogged their rivals on profitability. Everything to know about the Queensland election Queenslanders will go to the polls on 26 October and we\u2019ve assembled the five key things you need to know about the vote. And here\u2019s our video explainer: Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer bringing you the best of the overnight news before Emily Wind takes the reins. The federal government has tasked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with cracking down on misleading and deceptive pricing in supermarkets, tipping an extra $30m into the competition regulator after damning allegations against Coles and Woolworths. And we also have an analysis coming up to show how Coles and Woolworths have leapfrogged their peers in profitability. Gambling reform campaigners have accused wagering companies of \u201cshowering\u201d federal politicians with hospitality as the government considers advertising restrictions, with new data showing betting groups have given numerous free tickets to MPs. New analysis from the Alliance for Gambling Reform, informed by a new database collecting all federal politicians\u2019 updates to their parliamentary register of interests, shows at least 19 have accepted hospitality from wagering companies to attend major events including the Melbourne Cup, Australian Open, AFL matches and cricket games. A former Royal Australian Navy officer who alleges a colleague\u2019s bullying led to them feeling suicidal was further traumatised \u2013 and pushed to the brink of suicide again \u2013 after appearing as a special \u201ckey witness\u201d in the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide. In a Guardian Australia exclusive they tell Paul Daley how the process itself retraumatised them. The Queensland government will go into caretaker mode today when premier Steven Miles visits governor Jeannette Young, officially starting the countdown to the 26 October poll. We have a run down of the five things you need to know about the election, which is expected to be won by the Liberal National party under the leadership of David Crisafulli. More coming up. And a new safety code for dating apps comes into force today \u2013 more soon on what that means.",

      "bodyText": "The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, has accused Peter Dutton of seeking to \u201craise the temperature\u201d of public debate over conflict in the Middle East, after protests on the weekend included some people holding the Hezbollah flag. The opposition leader on Monday suggested parliament should be recalled to enact new anti-terror laws that would cover such actions, if it was not already illegal. But Burke rejected Dutton\u2019s demand, saying federal law supported by both parties was already in force, with police and authorities investigating the rallies. He claimed Dutton wanted to \u201cthrow more kerosene on the fire\u201d of the public mood around the widening Middle East conflict. Politicians have been critical of protesters who waved the flag of Hezbollah, which is proscribed as a listed terrorist organisation under federal law. It is illegal to provide support, to be a member of, or associate with a listed terrorist organisation. But experts said some protesters likely viewed Hezbollah as a group that freed their communities from Israeli occupation. On Tuesday, Burke again raised concern about civilian deaths in Lebanon, repeating government calls for a ceasefire as Israel escalated its military operation in the country\u2019s south. He said the government would not hesitate to cancel visas if those responsible for waving Hezbollah flags at rallies were found not to be Australian citizens. But the minister also said he \u201cpresumed\u201d most of those holding flags were Australian citizens. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cI\u2019ve got no presumption that anyone\u2019s on a visa,\u201d Burke told Radio National on Tuesday. \u201c[But] I\u2019ve got very strong views against hate speech and hate symbols, very strong views, and I don\u2019t want the anger and hatred from around the world being imported into Australia. \u201cWith Peter Dutton, it remains the case that no matter how many times our security agencies say we need to lower the temperature in Australia, he wants to raise the temperature every single time.\u201d The Australian federal police confirmed on Monday that it was expecting at least six reports of alleged crimes from their Victorian counterparts involving symbols and chants which are prohibited under federal hate speech law relating to weekend protests in Melbourne against Israel\u2019s attacks on Lebanon. Some marchers at capital-city protests over the weekend carried Hezbollah flags and portraits of leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli attack. Dutton and the Coalition opposition had demanded visas be cancelled for any non-citizens involved in those actions. Burke on Monday said \u201cany indication of support for a terrorist organisation is unequivocally condemned\u201d. But the opposition leader claimed the government had not acted swiftly enough. \u201cTo be out there waving a Nazi flag, or a Hezbollah flag, to be out there glorifying a terrorist leader or somebody like Osama bin Laden, it\u2019s completely and utterly unacceptable, and it\u2019s unacceptable that the government isn\u2019t demonstrating the leadership that Australia needs at the moment,\u201d Dutton told Sky News on Tuesday. \u201cIf it continues to compound, if these people know no boundaries, then it will end in tragedy in our country, and that\u2019s something that the prime minister really should be very cognisant of. \u201cThe police and the government need to apply every resource to speak with the leaders in the community, with the imams, etc, to say that these celebrations should not proceed, and there should be very significant pressure applied to the leadership group within the communities to make sure that these celebrations are called off.\u201d Burke said he was unable to comment directly on the incident, citing potential legal processes, but said he was strongly against \u201cinciting discord and hatred in Australia\u201d, and had asked his department to prepare briefs on whether visas would be cancelled.

Majed Kheir, a Sydney lawyer and community volunteer, said there were likely a number of people who attended the protests that would have held negative views of Hezbollah and Nasrallah. But for others \u2013 particularly those from south Lebanon \u2013 Hezbollah was viewed as a group that freed their communities from Israeli occupation, Kheir said on Tuesday. Hezbollah has ministers in the Lebanese government and has become a political and social powerhouse in the country \u2013 running medical clinics, schools and a regional television network. Kheir was part of a community group that was consulted on the legislation prohibiting the display of terror symbols. He said the \u201cintent\u201d part of the laws was crucial to the Muslim community given some symbols adopted by terrorist organisations had long carried holy significance. \u201cWe understood why this legislation was important but we also didn\u2019t want the government to inadvertently criminalise things that were holy to our faith,\u201d he said. On Monday, the Australian federal police released a statement highlighting the legislation outlawed prohibited symbols when carried with intent to incite hatred or violence. \u201cThe AFP seemingly came out themselves in an effort to quell this silly back and forth which in my opinion was laced with undertones of racism and bigotry to confirm those intent part of the laws,\u201d Kheir said. Associate Prof Jumana Bayeh, a Middle East expert at Macquarie University, argued people at the protests were \u201cdemonstrating their mourning\u201d for a leader who helped end past Israeli occupations. Though not universally loved across the diaspora, for some, Hezbollah under the leadership of Nasrallah represented the \u201cforce which can guarantee Lebanon its security on its sovereign border with Israel\u201d, Bayeh said. \u201cWhat Hezbollah represents is a moment within which the Lebanese were able to have a sense that they would no longer be subject to Israeli aggression.

      "body": "<p>The former UK security minister Tom Tugendhat has criticised the claim by one of his Conservative leadership rivals that UK special forces are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/30/jenrick-faces-scrutiny-over-claim-uk-special-forces-kill-rather-than-capture-terrorists\">killing rather than capturing</a>\u201d terrorism suspects, saying the comment showed a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d of the law of war.</p> <p>Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, defended his claim on Tuesday, and said it echoed comments by the former defence secretary Ben Wallace expressing fears that European laws would free any detained assailants. </p> <p>In a campaign video posted on X on Monday, Jenrick said: \u201cOur special forces are killing rather than capturing terrorists, because our lawyers tell us that if they are caught, the European court will set them free.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobertJenrick/status/1840659469727916246\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Do you want to deport foreign criminals, get terrorists off our streets, and end illegal migration?<br><br>Then we must leave the ECHR. <a href=\"https://t.co/8Z4V8NwbkO\">pic.twitter.com/8Z4V8NwbkO</a></p>&mdash; Robert Jenrick (@RobertJenrick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertJenrick/status/1840659469727916246?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Tugendhat told Sky News he did not agree that was the case: \u201cI think what he said is wrong and I\u2019m afraid it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of military operations and the law of armed conflict.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned that such words should not be seen in any way to encourage people to take any action other than surrender to British forces when asked to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Jenrick told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he stood by the comments. \u201cThe point that Ben Wallace was making [in a Telegraph interview] was that there are instances where the [European convention on human rights] is forcing or leading the decision makers \u2026 to take lethal action.</p> <p>\u201cDecision makers are being asked to make decisions which they might not ordinarily make. For example, to call in a drone strike and take lethal action in that way, rather than a surgical action where special forces might go on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to see is our human rights apparatus impacting the ability of our armed forces to take the most sensible decisions for their own safety. The point I was making was absolutely correct, and it\u2019s backed up by the interview.\u201d</p> <p>Jenrick was also criticised by another Tory leadership rival, the shadow home secretary, James Cleverly, who told Sky News: \u201cThe British military always abide by international humanitarian law \u2013 the law of armed conflict. We have \u2026 the most professional military in the world. Our military do not murder people.\u201d</p> <p>The former defence secretary Grant Shapps also said it was wrong for Jenrick to make the assertion. \u201cIt\u2019s not true in the terms of special forces. I have seen no evidence of that at all,\u201d he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p> <p>He said Jenrick was trying to \u201creflect on a broader concern \u2026 perhaps in the back of people\u2019s minds it will create a problem. But to be absolutely clear about this as defence secretary I have seen no evidence at all of that happening.\u201d</p> <p>Jenrick has been criticised by a number of legal and military experts, as well as Labour sources. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general for England and Wales, wrote on X that the claims were \u201cone of the most astonishing videos I have ever seen posted by a Conservative MP, let alone a candidate for the leadership\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMost of it is twaddle, a series of promises of change that leaving the ECHR will do nothing to take forward.\u201d</p> <p>A former senior army officer said: \u201cThis is a cheap claim and comes at a time when the armed forces continue to face scrutiny over claims of killings overseas and in Northern Ireland. He needs to correct the record.\u201d</p> <p>A Labour source called for Jenrick to apologise. \u201cRobert Jenrick\u2019s ludicrous attempt to politicise our special forces shows you how far the Tories have fallen. He should apologise. Our brave service men and women deserve better than this.\u201d</p> <p>Jenrick, a former ally of Rishi Sunak, is the frontrunner of four candidates in the race to lead the Conservatives.</p> <p>All four will address the party conference in Birmingham on Wednesday morning before MPs pick the final two candidates on 10 October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former UK security minister Tom Tugendhat has criticised the claim by one of his Conservative leadership rivals that UK special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorism suspects, saying the comment showed a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d of the law of war. Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, defended his claim on Tuesday, and said it echoed comments by the former defence secretary Ben Wallace expressing fears that European laws would free any detained assailants. In a campaign video posted on X on Monday, Jenrick said: \u201cOur special forces are killing rather than capturing terrorists, because our lawyers tell us that if they are caught, the European court will set them free.\u201d Tugendhat told Sky News he did not agree that was the case: \u201cI think what he said is wrong and I\u2019m afraid it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of military operations and the law of armed conflict. \u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned that such words should not be seen in any way to encourage people to take any action other than surrender to British forces when asked to do so.\u201d Jenrick told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he stood by the comments. \u201cThe point that Ben Wallace was making [in a Telegraph interview] was that there are instances where the [European convention on human rights] is forcing or leading the decision makers \u2026 to take lethal action. \u201cDecision makers are being asked to make decisions which they might not ordinarily make. For example, to call in a drone strike and take lethal action in that way, rather than a surgical action where special forces might go on the ground. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to see is our human rights apparatus impacting the ability of our armed forces to take the most sensible decisions for their own safety. The point I was making was absolutely correct, and it\u2019s backed up by the interview.\u201d Jenrick was also criticised by another Tory leadership rival, the shadow home secretary, James Cleverly, who told Sky News: \u201cThe British military always abide by international humanitarian law \u2013 the law of armed conflict. We have \u2026 the most professional military in the world. Our military do not murder people.\u201d The former defence secretary Grant Shapps also said it was wrong for Jenrick to make the assertion. \u201cIt\u2019s not true in the terms of special forces. I have seen no evidence of that at all,\u201d he told BBC Radio 5 Live. He said Jenrick was trying to \u201creflect on a broader concern \u2026 perhaps in the back of people\u2019s minds it will create a problem. But to be absolutely clear about this as defence secretary I have seen no evidence at all of that happening.\u201d Jenrick has been criticised by a number of legal and military experts, as well as Labour sources. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general for England and Wales, wrote on X that the claims were \u201cone of the most astonishing videos I have ever seen posted by a Conservative MP, let alone a candidate for the leadership\u201d. He added: \u201cMost of it is twaddle, a series of promises of change that leaving the ECHR will do nothing to take forward.\u201d A former senior army officer said: \u201cThis is a cheap claim and comes at a time when the armed forces continue to face scrutiny over claims of killings overseas and in Northern Ireland. He needs to correct the record.\u201d A Labour source called for Jenrick to apologise. \u201cRobert Jenrick\u2019s ludicrous attempt to politicise our special forces shows you how far the Tories have fallen. He should apologise. Our brave service men and women deserve better than this.\u201d Jenrick, a former ally of Rishi Sunak, is the frontrunner of four candidates in the race to lead the Conservatives. All four will address the party conference in Birmingham on Wednesday morning before MPs pick the final two candidates on 10 October.",

      "bodyText": "Tim Walz and JD Vance, the US Democratic and Republican candidates for vice-president, will face off on Tuesday in what is likely to be the last debate showdown between the two parties\u2019 tickets before election day in exactly five weeks\u2019 time. The pair \u2013 who have had sharp words for each other at a distance \u2013 will engage in verbal combat in close quarters at a CBS-hosted event in New York, with the stakes raised by polling evidence that shows the contest between the two presidential nominees, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, poised on a knife edge. With Trump, the Republican nominee, continuing to refuse demands from Harris, his Democratic opponent, for a second presidential debate, much may ride on how the clash between Walz and Vance unfolds. The 90-minute duel will have added piquancy after Walz, the 60-year-old governor of Minnesota, memorably described Vance as \u201cweird\u201d while casting him as a key architect of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for a radical shake-up of American government and society that would crack down intensely on immigration, vanquish LGBTQ+ and abortion rights, diminish environmental protections, overhaul financial policy and take aggressive action against China. Vance, 40, a senator for Ohio who has reinvented himself as a political attack dog for Trump despite disparaging him before entering politics, has hit back by depicting his opponent as a far-left liberal and accusing him of serially misrepresenting aspects of his military service in the national guard. He has also thrown the \u201cweird\u201d jibe back at Walz after the Democratic vice-presidential nominee said his children had been born with the help of IVF \u2013 which Vance once voted as a senator to oppose \u2013 before it emerged that he and his wife had used a different form of fertility treatment. A new poll released on Monday found that US voters specifically want the duo to debate immigration and economic policies \u2013 two of the top election issues this year. American voters may also be looking to hear from both sides on handling the unfolding devastation and aftermath of Hurricane Helene, with Trump and Harris visiting affected states this week. The potential for fireworks could be further raised by the fact that CBS\u2019s rules of engagement preclude its moderators, Norah O\u2019Donnell and Margaret Brennan, from factchecking the candidates in real time \u2013 as happened at last month\u2019s ABC debate between Harris and Trump in Philadelphia. Instead, the two men will be expected to fact-check each other. Vance enters the debate with arguably more to gain. Since his selection as Trump\u2019s running mate, his approval figures have been consistently in the negatives amid a string of disclosures over derogatory comments about childless women, whom he branded \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. He has also drawn fire for his role in promoting a debunked rumour about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating pets, before later telling CNN \u2013 unapologetically \u2013 that he\u2019s willing to \u201ccreate\u201d stories for the purpose of calling attention to \u201cthe suffering of the American people\u201d. Amid the opprobrium, the Yale-educated Vance \u2013 who has prepared for the debate by holding rehearsals with a small team that includes the House Republican whip, Tom Emmer, playing the role of Walz, and his wife, Usha, as an adviser \u2013 has gained a high profile by embracing the role of articulator of Trump\u2019s fiercely anti-immigrant America-first populism. Walz, by contrast, has achieved more encouraging polling numbers yet has adopted a low-key posture since Harris chose him as her running mate after being promoted to the top of the Democratic ticket following Joe Biden\u2019s decision to step aside in July. He has given few media interviews and had settled for a lower profile following the acerbic attacks on Vance and other Maga Republicans that were first brought to national attention in the summer \u2013 and prompted Harris to select him. Walz, who projects an image of folksiness, has admitted to nervousness about Tuesday\u2019s debate while preparing with the help of Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary. He has voiced fears to associates that he may let Harris down and reportedly warned her when she chose him that he was a poor debater. While there is little evidence historically of vice-presidential debates affecting the outcome of presidential elections, past encounters have been notable for producing memorable moments and soundbites. In 2020, Harris herself was the source of one when she told Mike Pence \u2013 Vance\u2019s predecessor as Trump\u2019s running mate and, at the time, the vice president \u2013 after he interrupted her. She said: \u201cMr Vice-President, I\u2019m speaking.\u201d In the 1988 vice-presidential debate, Lloyd Bentsen, running mate to the Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, had a ready rejoinder when Dan Quayle, the Republican nominee behind George HW Bush, when quizzed, at age 41 \u2013 a year older than Vance \u2013 about his relative youth, responded by invoking John F Kennedy. \u201cSenator, I served with Jack Kennedy,\u201d replied Bentsen. \u201cI knew Jack Kennedy.

Shiner\u2019s actions resulted in untold pressure and anxiety on members of the British armed forces, pursuing legal challenges funded through dishonest actions.\u201d The Al-Sweady inquiry was named after a 19-year-old Iraqi killed by British troops on 14 May 2004 during the battle of Danny Boy, a checkpoint on the main Amara-Basra road in south-east Iraq. The inquiry was opened after senior judges condemned the Ministry of Defence\u2019s \u201clamentable\u201d failure to disclose information about the battle, in particular about the handling of dead and captured Iraqi insurgents. Public hearings began in 2013 when lawyers began questioning Iraqi and British army witnesses. The inquiry heard from young, inexperienced British soldiers, unprepared for violent clashes including close-quarter fighting with insurgents. British lawyers for the Iraqis conceded a year into the hearings there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to establish that Iraqis were unlawfully killed in the British camp. However, they did not withdraw the allegations of ill-treatment of Iraqis.

      "body": "<p>Structural racism is leading to stark health inequalities among people from some ethnic backgrounds in London, according to a review by one of the UK\u2019s top public health experts.</p> <p>More than half (52%) of black children and almost three-quarters (70%) of Bangladeshi and Pakistani children are growing up in relative poverty after housing costs in London, compared with a quarter (26%) of white children.</p> <p>And unemployment among young black people aged between 16 and 24 is more than double that of white people the same age, the paper states. Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller young people have the highest rate, at 40%.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/resources-reports/structural-racism-ethnicity-and-health-inequalities\">review</a>, conducted by the UCL Institute of Health Equity (IHE) led by Prof Sir Michael Marmot, found that people who are repeatedly exposed to structural racism during their daily lives experience worse physical and mental health as a direct consequence. It also says the ethnic inequalities in poverty, housing and employment result in poorer health outcomes for these ethnic groups.</p> <p>It concluded that these economic inequalities, which can be attributed to structural racism, lead to poorer health outcomes for minority groups in London, as they are less likely to have access to decent housing, nutritious meals and other factors that affect a person\u2019s health outcomes.</p> <p>Marmot, the director of the IHE and author of a seminal review into health inequalities in the UK in 2010, said structural racism \u201cis a scar on society\u201d and public health institutions are failing by not directly addressing the effects racism has on a person\u2019s health.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/28/facing-the-uncomfortable-possibility-that-healthcare-is-discriminatory\">Facing the uncomfortable possibility that healthcare is discriminatory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSocial justice requires that we take the action necessary to deal with it. It is a profound injustice if the conditions for good health are unequally distributed, depending on ethnicity,\u201d Marmot said. \u201cEspecially so, where that unequal distribution results from the evils of racism. Inequalities in the social determinants of health are storing up health problems for the future.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cFocusing on disease and healthcare services fails to address three impacts of racism on health.

      "bodyText": "Structural racism is leading to stark health inequalities among people from some ethnic backgrounds in London, according to a review by one of the UK\u2019s top public health experts. More than half (52%) of black children and almost three-quarters (70%) of Bangladeshi and Pakistani children are growing up in relative poverty after housing costs in London, compared with a quarter (26%) of white children. And unemployment among young black people aged between 16 and 24 is more than double that of white people the same age, the paper states. Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller young people have the highest rate, at 40%. The review, conducted by the UCL Institute of Health Equity (IHE) led by Prof Sir Michael Marmot, found that people who are repeatedly exposed to structural racism during their daily lives experience worse physical and mental health as a direct consequence. It also says the ethnic inequalities in poverty, housing and employment result in poorer health outcomes for these ethnic groups. It concluded that these economic inequalities, which can be attributed to structural racism, lead to poorer health outcomes for minority groups in London, as they are less likely to have access to decent housing, nutritious meals and other factors that affect a person\u2019s health outcomes. Marmot, the director of the IHE and author of a seminal review into health inequalities in the UK in 2010, said structural racism \u201cis a scar on society\u201d and public health institutions are failing by not directly addressing the effects racism has on a person\u2019s health. \u201cSocial justice requires that we take the action necessary to deal with it. It is a profound injustice if the conditions for good health are unequally distributed, depending on ethnicity,\u201d Marmot said. \u201cEspecially so, where that unequal distribution results from the evils of racism. Inequalities in the social determinants of health are storing up health problems for the future.\u201d He added: \u201cFocusing on disease and healthcare services fails to address three impacts of racism on health. First, how racism directly damages health and wellbeing. Second, the reasons why some ethnic groups are more likely to be in poverty, experience poor housing, suffer in the educational and criminal justice system, be low paid and experience racism and poor employment prospects \u2013 all of which harm health. Third, it does not deal with racism that leads to worse experiences of healthcare and other services and worse outcomes as a result.\u201d Prof Kevin Fenton, a public health director for London and president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: \u201cThis new report shows clearly the devastating impact that structural racism continues to have on the health and wellbeing of Londoners in 2024. \u201cIt adds to the growing body of work providing evidence on the persistent, pervasive and harmful impacts of structural racism, and why tackling these issues must be taken forward as a key public health issue.\u201d Fenton added: \u201cIt is time for us to learn the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the recent race riots across the UK \u2013 that ingrained, structural racism continues to be a scourge on our society, directly impacting the lives of Britons even in a global city like London. \u201cThe data on these racial inequalities in London \u2013 a multicultural urban centre \u2013 are stark, and we must learn lessons for other parts of the UK and carry forward recommendations to protect and improve the health of minority ethnic communities and ensure that everyone in our society is able to realise their full potential.\u201d Prof Habib Naqvi, the chief executive of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, said: \u201cWe know that racism is a challenge that transcends boundaries and borders, and whilst this report is for London, we hope it will have wider impact across the UK. \u201cRacism has deep historical roots.

      "body": "<p><em>H</em><em>e\u2019s going</em>. And for the first few seconds after Tadej Pogacar launches the solo attack that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/29/tadej-pogacar-lands-world-road-race-championship-to-complete-triple-crown\">win him the world championship</a>, nobody can quite believe it. <em>He\u2019s going.</em> \u201cSuicide move,\u201d Remco Evenepoel mutters to Mathieu van der Poel alongside him. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d gone, to be honest,\u201d Britain\u2019s Oscar Onley would later recall. \u201cEveryone\u2019s thinking it\u2019s too much,\u201d said Ireland\u2019s Ben Healy. There are more than 100km remaining in Zurich and the rational consensus in the peloton is that the world\u2019s greatest cyclist has just blown his chance at the rainbow jersey.</p> <p><em>He\u2019s gone.</em> And for all the puzzled faces he leaves in his wake, the shock and disbelief that will materialise when he rolls over the finish line in first place several hours later, perhaps the first thing to say about Pogacar\u2019s gamechanging move was that it wasn\u2019t quite planned, but it wasn\u2019t quite unplanned either. For one thing, he had been corralling his remaining Slovenian teammates on the front for some time. Afterwards, his UAE Team Emirates colleague Tim Wellens revealed that the pair were recently on a training ride in Monaco where Pogacar confided his intention to attack early. \u201cI&nbsp;thought he was joking,\u201d Wellens admitted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/29/tadej-pogacar-lands-world-road-race-championship-to-complete-triple-crown\">Tadej Pogacar lands world road race championship to complete triple crown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course Pogacar has form in this regard. This year, ahead of Strade Bianche, he announced that he planned to attack on Monte Sante Marie \u2013 81km from the finish \u2013 and he smiled as he said it, and so nobody really took him that seriously, because Pogacar very often says things he barely means, and in any case who attacks from 81km? Fast forward 24 hours and in teeming rain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/02/strade-bianche-cycling-races-report\">Pogacar accelerates away on Monte Sante Marie</a>, pulling out an unassailable gap and winning by almost three minutes. Was it spontaneous? Was it premeditated? Is there even a meaningful distinction between the two?</p> <p>So first you have the tactical mind games, the theatre, the thespian flourish. But the moment itself: that comes from pure racing instinct. A little shift in the energy, the spidey sense that tells you your rivals are napping a little, and the breakaway group are beginning to cement their advantage, and now is the time, so go, just go. And the legs feel good, and the gap opens a little more easily than you were expecting, so you just keep going. Pogacar called his attack on Sunday \u201cstupid\u201d, but perhaps a better term for it is \u201cmindless\u201d: the state of flow that great athletes occasionally achieve in which their decisions are no longer entirely conscious or deliberate, where their body simply takes over.</p> <p>So ends \u2013 with just Il Lombardia and a few other bits to come \u2013 one of the most remarkable seasons in the history of professional cycling. The great Eddy Merckx now believes Pogacar has surpassed him. Evenepoel puts it in even starker terms. \u201cTadej this year,\u201d he said, \u201cis not normal.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/26/tadej-pogacar-giro-d-italia-cycling\">Giro d\u2019Italia</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/21/tadej-pogacar-wraps-up-tour-de-france-victory-to-seal-historic-double\">Tour de France</a>, the rainbow jersey, Li\u00e8ge\u2011Bastogne\u2011Li\u00e8ge, Strade Bianche, 23 race wins in total. Beyond the bare statistics, that sense of sheer impregnability, the helplessness he engenders in his rivals, the conviction that he can win whenever he wants, however he wants.</p>    <p>There is of course a natural tendency to interpret the Pogacar supremacy in purely physical terms, to pore over the data, to fixate on wattages and outputs. And yet given the history of this sport, terms such as \u201cnot normal\u201d and \u201cfrom another world\u201d \u2013 the headline on the homepage of L\u2019\u00c9quipe on Sunday \u2013 are not neutral or weightless phrases. The story of cycling is a book that burns its believers on a serial scale, and so most dedicated followers exist in a kind of conditional incredulity: the more unbelievable it becomes, the more desperately we need to believe in it.</p> <p>This is not quite the incredulity of fiction or art or pro wrestling, where the audience willingly submits to the artifice at the outset. Instead, the artifice is almost assembled piecemeal, part of a parallel process in which the viewer\u2019s faith is simultaneously strengthened and tested. The more you watch, the more unreal the spectacle feels, and yet \u2013 by the same token \u2013 the more seductive it becomes.</p> <p>And so in many ways this is not really about Pogacar himself, a rider who has never failed a doping test, who vigorously denies ever having taken a controlled substance, who has never really come under any credible suspicion of illegality beyond simply being really, really good. Doubtless there will be accusations and aspersions flung at him, as there have been all year, as they were at the last guy, and the next guy.</p> <p>And rest assured, I\u2019ve read the blogs. I\u2019ve read the forum posts. I\u2019ve stared at graphs and gone down Twitter rabbit holes and buried myself in haematocrit levels and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/15/tadej-pogacar-describes-stage-win-as-one-of-best-performances-on-climb-ever\">watts per kilo up the Plateau de Beille</a> and listened to a podcast in which Pogacar explains in frankly unwelcome levels of detail how many liquid carbs he can take on per racing hour before he has to shit himself. And fair play if this is what gets you off, if this is the level of commitment deemed necessary to be a Good Cycling Citizen.</p> <p>But frankly, none of it has ever remotely interested me, and not out of an indifference to science or sporting morality but because to reduce Pogacar to a soup of numbers and chemicals is really the narrowest and most boring way of appreciating him; the most boring way of appreciating sport. Not to mention the fact that much of the cynicism relies on constructing a kind of alternative reality of his career, based on a bare minimum of hard facts and letting nudges and winks do the rest.</p> <p>Perhaps the reality is that around every great athlete grow two fictions: an elegant and an inelegant version. And which we prefer, which version makes more sense to us, says something about how we process our world. Are we fated to be profane and fearful, to live in suspicion and mutual vigilance, wary of one another?

      "bodyText": "He\u2019s going. And for the first few seconds after Tadej Pogacar launches the solo attack that will win him the world championship, nobody can quite believe it. He\u2019s going. \u201cSuicide move,\u201d Remco Evenepoel mutters to Mathieu van der Poel alongside him. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d gone, to be honest,\u201d Britain\u2019s Oscar Onley would later recall. \u201cEveryone\u2019s thinking it\u2019s too much,\u201d said Ireland\u2019s Ben Healy. There are more than 100km remaining in Zurich and the rational consensus in the peloton is that the world\u2019s greatest cyclist has just blown his chance at the rainbow jersey. He\u2019s gone. And for all the puzzled faces he leaves in his wake, the shock and disbelief that will materialise when he rolls over the finish line in first place several hours later, perhaps the first thing to say about Pogacar\u2019s gamechanging move was that it wasn\u2019t quite planned, but it wasn\u2019t quite unplanned either. For one thing, he had been corralling his remaining Slovenian teammates on the front for some time. Afterwards, his UAE Team Emirates colleague Tim Wellens revealed that the pair were recently on a training ride in Monaco where Pogacar confided his intention to attack early. \u201cI thought he was joking,\u201d Wellens admitted. Of course Pogacar has form in this regard. This year, ahead of Strade Bianche, he announced that he planned to attack on Monte Sante Marie \u2013 81km from the finish \u2013 and he smiled as he said it, and so nobody really took him that seriously, because Pogacar very often says things he barely means, and in any case who attacks from 81km? Fast forward 24 hours and in teeming rain, Pogacar accelerates away on Monte Sante Marie, pulling out an unassailable gap and winning by almost three minutes. Was it spontaneous? Was it premeditated? Is there even a meaningful distinction between the two? So first you have the tactical mind games, the theatre, the thespian flourish. But the moment itself: that comes from pure racing instinct. A little shift in the energy, the spidey sense that tells you your rivals are napping a little, and the breakaway group are beginning to cement their advantage, and now is the time, so go, just go. And the legs feel good, and the gap opens a little more easily than you were expecting, so you just keep going. Pogacar called his attack on Sunday \u201cstupid\u201d, but perhaps a better term for it is \u201cmindless\u201d: the state of flow that great athletes occasionally achieve in which their decisions are no longer entirely conscious or deliberate, where their body simply takes over. So ends \u2013 with just Il Lombardia and a few other bits to come \u2013 one of the most remarkable seasons in the history of professional cycling. The great Eddy Merckx now believes Pogacar has surpassed him. Evenepoel puts it in even starker terms. \u201cTadej this year,\u201d he said, \u201cis not normal.\u201d The Giro d\u2019Italia, the Tour de France, the rainbow jersey, Li\u00e8ge\u2011Bastogne\u2011Li\u00e8ge, Strade Bianche, 23 race wins in total. Beyond the bare statistics, that sense of sheer impregnability, the helplessness he engenders in his rivals, the conviction that he can win whenever he wants, however he wants. There is of course a natural tendency to interpret the Pogacar supremacy in purely physical terms, to pore over the data, to fixate on wattages and outputs. And yet given the history of this sport, terms such as \u201cnot normal\u201d and \u201cfrom another world\u201d \u2013 the headline on the homepage of L\u2019\u00c9quipe on Sunday \u2013 are not neutral or weightless phrases. The story of cycling is a book that burns its believers on a serial scale, and so most dedicated followers exist in a kind of conditional incredulity: the more unbelievable it becomes, the more desperately we need to believe in it. This is not quite the incredulity of fiction or art or pro wrestling, where the audience willingly submits to the artifice at the outset. Instead, the artifice is almost assembled piecemeal, part of a parallel process in which the viewer\u2019s faith is simultaneously strengthened and tested. The more you watch, the more unreal the spectacle feels, and yet \u2013 by the same token \u2013 the more seductive it becomes. And so in many ways this is not really about Pogacar himself, a rider who has never failed a doping test, who vigorously denies ever having taken a controlled substance, who has never really come under any credible suspicion of illegality beyond simply being really, really good. Doubtless there will be accusations and aspersions flung at him, as there have been all year, as they were at the last guy, and the next guy. And rest assured, I\u2019ve read the blogs. I\u2019ve read the forum posts. I\u2019ve stared at graphs and gone down Twitter rabbit holes and buried myself in haematocrit levels and watts per kilo up the Plateau de Beille and listened to a podcast in which Pogacar explains in frankly unwelcome levels of detail how many liquid carbs he can take on per racing hour before he has to shit himself. And fair play if this is what gets you off, if this is the level of commitment deemed necessary to be a Good Cycling Citizen. But frankly, none of it has ever remotely interested me, and not out of an indifference to science or sporting morality but because to reduce Pogacar to a soup of numbers and chemicals is really the narrowest and most boring way of appreciating him; the most boring way of appreciating sport. Not to mention the fact that much of the cynicism relies on constructing a kind of alternative reality of his career, based on a bare minimum of hard facts and letting nudges and winks do the rest. Perhaps the reality is that around every great athlete grow two fictions: an elegant and an inelegant version. And which we prefer, which version makes more sense to us, says something about how we process our world. Are we fated to be profane and fearful, to live in suspicion and mutual vigilance, wary of one another? Or is there still a beauty beyond corruption, a hope beyond futility, a wonder beyond cynicism, a clean break to win the world championship from 100km out? I don\u2019t have the answers, and nor do you. But I know what fiction I\u2019d rather live in. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "Tim Walz and JD Vance will go head to head in a vice-presidential debate on Wednesday AEST that follows the political sledges and seemingly endless memes of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris\u2019s televised match last month. It\u2019s an important moment for Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, and Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, as two lower-profile politicians who will probably stay on the national scene for years to come. Abortion, Project 2025, climate crisis, military service and that claim about cats and dogs are among the questions likely to come up in the debate, which will not be held in front of a live audience. Here\u2019s what Australians can expect. How can I watch the VP debate and what time is it? The vice-presidential debate will begin at 11am AEST on Wednesday 2 October and run for 90 minutes. You can watch the debate on the Guardian or follow along on our live blog, where staff will be providing updates and scrutinising claims made by both vice-presidential candidates. Broadcaster CBS, which is hosting the debate, will be streaming the debate on its website and YouTube channel. Who have Harris and Trump chosen as their VP picks? Vance, Trump\u2019s proposed second-in charge, is the author of Hillbilly Elegy, a former Silicon Valley investor and a never-Trumper turned Maga superstar. Walz, Harris\u2019s pick, is a former geography teacher and Amerian football coach, whose foray into politics in 2006 saw him rise the ranks to chair of the Democratic Governors Association. Some Australians say the \u201cOz-coded\u201d Walz bears a striking resemblance to the current and several former Australian PMs at once, including Anthony Albanese, Kevin Rudd and Scott Morrison. Have Australian leaders shown a preference for Vance or Walz? Not openly. In July, Peter Dutton, sent his congratulations to JD Vance when Trump announced the VP pick. But the opposition leader stressed the Australian government would continue to work closely with its US counterpart \u201cregardless of whether it\u2019s a Democrat or a Republican administration\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Overnight, Israel began what it called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-ground-operation-war-latest\">a \u201climited, localised and targeted\u201d ground operation</a> against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. After launching what is (according to the UNHCR) the most intense attack on the country since 2006, the question arises: how much bigger does this conflict need to get before it is officially designated a \u201cfull-blown\u201d regional war? </p> <p>Since last October, when Hamas killed around 1,200 civilians and took 250 more hostages, the international community has been using diplomatic pressure to prevent a larger regional conflict breaking out from the war in Gaza. For now, those efforts have seemingly failed \u2013 at least 95 people were killed on Monday alone in Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon.</p> <p>Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader, Naim Qassem, said on Monday night that \u201cresistance forces are ready for a ground engagement\u201d. \u201cWe know that the battle may be long. We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006,\u201d he said, referring to the 2006 war. US president Joe Biden and the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, have called for a political solution to the ongoing crisis.</p> <p>For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke with the Guardian\u2019s international security correspondent, Jason Burke, about the latest developments in the region.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Conservatives </strong></em>| Leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick is facing condemnation for claiming that UK special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists because of fears that European laws would free any detained assailants. His claim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/30/jenrick-faces-scrutiny-over-claim-uk-special-forces-kill-rather-than-capture-terrorists\">has drawn criticism</a> from Labour, a former Tory attorney general and a former army officer.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Aviation </strong></em>| The US National Transportation Safety Board on Monday said more than 40 foreign operators of Boeing 737 airplanes may be using planes with rudder components <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/30/boeing-737-max-planes\">that may pose safety risks</a>.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Police</strong></em> | Four police officers and a civilian employee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/30/four-officers-face-disciplinary-action-over-david-carrick-investigation\">are to face disciplinary action</a> for alleged errors that helped leave the serial rapist David Carrick free to attack a string of women.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>South Korea </strong></em>| Three police officers prison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/south-korea-itaewon-disaster-seoul-crowd-crush-police-jailed\">have been convicted</a> over their handling of a 2022 Halloween crush in a Seoul nightlife district that killed 159 people. The crush, one of the biggest peacetime disasters in South Korea, caused a nationwide outpouring of grief. The victims, who were mostly in their 20s and 30s, had gathered in Itaewon for Halloween celebrations.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Culture </strong></em>| A painting that was found by a junk dealer while he was clearing out the cellar of a home in Capri, and was regularly decried by his wife as \u201chorrible\u201d, is an original portrait by Pablo Picasso, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/01/painting-found-by-junk-dealer-in-cellar-is-original-picasso-experts-claim\">Italian experts have claimed</a>.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018Lebanon is fragile \u2013 it is not in a state to sustain another round of violence\u2019</h2>    <p>More than 1,000 people in Lebanon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/israel-strikes-yemen-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-middle-east-war-latest\">have been killed in the past two weeks,</a> 6,000 wounded and, according to the Lebanese government, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/video/lebanon-displaced-people-hit-one-million-says-lebanese-government-13224469\">one million</a> displaced.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Gaza, the humanitarian situation has eroded further. With little to no infrastructure available to support the displaced population, disease is rampant and civilians are living in the most catastrophic conditions. The principals of the UN-NGO inter-agency standing committee (IASC) have said <a href=\"https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/inter-agency-standing-committee/statement-principals-inter-agency-standing-committee-situation-occupied-palestinian-territory-these\">they are still unable to carry out anywhere near enough humanitarian work</a> in the territory, as Palestinians continue to live \u201cwithout protection, food, water, sanitation, shelter, health care, education, electricity and fuel \u2013 the basic necessities to survive\u201d.</p> <p>There is little political incentive for Benjamin Netanyahu to let up, as the assassination of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has given the embattled Israeli prime minister a political boost. The mood among many of Israel\u2019s citizens is one of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/nx-s1-5132098/hezbollah-nasrallah-world-reaction-israel-us-lebanon\">jubilation</a>: there have been singalongs and celebratory toasts as the government\u2019s standing recovers from months of protests and low morale.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Destabilising Hezbollah</strong></p> <p>At this point, there is too much uncertainty to predict the long term impact of the assassination of Nasrallah on Hezbollah but in the short term \u201cit\u2019s a really devastating blow\u201d, Jason says. \u201cNot only have they lost a charismatic and popular leader \u2013 among his supporters at least \u2013 [but] Nasrallah was also competent and effective. You don\u2019t get to stay at the top of a group like that for 32 years without being good at what you do.\u201d</p> <p>It is not just the loss of its leader that has hit Hezbollah hard. Israel has intercepted and sabotaged its communication and eliminated many of the militia group\u2019s most senior military commanders \u2013 so far 19 Hezbollah officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/which-hezbollah-leaders-have-been-killed-and-who-will-succeed-hassan-nasrallah\">have been killed</a>. The assassinations and targeted bombing show just how deeply penetrated Hezbollah, a notoriously secretive group, has become by Israeli intelligence.</p> <p>As expected, the Shia militia group has sworn to enact revenge attacks but, as of yet, it appears to have been unable to retaliate in any serious way. \u201cEven though Israeli air defences are very effective, it\u2019s been said for a long time that Hezbollah, which has massive stocks of rockets and missiles, would be able to overwhelm those defences and cause significant casualties and destruction in much of northern and central Israel but so far, they\u2019ve not been able to do anything much,\u201d Jason says.</p> <p>This hesitation perhaps is borne of an awareness that Israel\u2019s response to such an attack is likely to be equally if not more devastating. \u201cHezbollah is a state within a state and primarily acts in its own interests, or those of its sponsor, Iran. But whatever happens the consequences for Lebanon are going to be very tough indeed. The country is already fragile and it is really not in a state to sustain another round of deeply destabilising violence and destruction,\u201d Jason says. In just a week, more than 1,000 civilians have been killed \u2013 almost the number killed in 36 days of war 18 years ago.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Ground invasion</strong></p> <p>Israel had been threatening boots on the ground in south Lebanon for several weeks, and this came to pass on Monday night. The IDF has said it will be targeting a number of villages near the border \u201cwhich pose an immediate and real threat to Israeli settlements on the northern border\u201d. It has also declared areas of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel a closed military zone.</p> <p>A ground invasion, as risky and costly as it is, theoretically can do more damage to Hezbollah. Tanks and infantry may allow Israel to \u201cdestroy tunnels, military positions and physically push back Hezbollah fighters who are still on the contested border\u201d, he adds. They could create a buffer zone on the other side of the border to allow the 65,000 displaced Israeli\u2019s to return to their communities in northern Israel, one of Netanyahu\u2019s stated objectives.</p> <p>But although Hezbollah has been weakened, the incursion into south Lebanon may not prove simple for Israel\u2019s military. The militia group still has a large arsenal including sophisticated anti-tank weapons and, crucially, tens of thousands of troops. A buffer zone could mean that Israel would have to keep troops there indefinitely, leaving them vulnerable against Hezbollah fighters who know the region like the back of their hand.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Iran\u2019s strategy</strong></p>    <p>Iran is currently in a weak strategic position. For months, Tehran has been trying to respond strongly to Israel\u2019s aggression without pushing the conflict over the brink and becoming directly involved in a conflict that would inevitably rope in the US.</p> <p>\u201cIran has a variety of ways it could respond, none of which is particularly effective, but that would at least display a willingness to retaliate,\u201d Jason says. Historically, Tehran has used proxies to attack Israeli embassies, diplomats and other Israeli targets around the world. The most recent retaliatory act saw Iran launch 300 projectiles at Israel, though most were intercepted. \u201cThey know they can\u2019t risk an all out war with Israel, so these moves did not act as a deterrent. Instead it likely emboldened Israel,\u201d Jason says.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The ongoing war in Gaza</strong></p> <p>Hezbollah has made it clear that the only way it will willingly end the current round of attacks on Israel is a ceasefire in Gaza \u2013 but that still looks a long way off. The months-long peace deal and hostage release negotiations brokered by the US and Qatar have been stuck in limbo as neither Netanyahu nor the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, seems interested in coming to an agreement. US diplomatic efforts have done little else than show how<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/us-looks-unable-to-talk-netanyahu-out-of-planned-invasion-of-lebanon\"> ineffectual Washington is at even moderating Israel\u2019s military actions</a>.</p> <p>While all eyes seem focused on the border between Israel and Lebanon, the IDF <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/21/gaza-safe-zone-overcrowding-israel-attack-risk\">has continued to launch deadly airstrikes</a> on designated safe zones across the Gaza Strip. Earlier this month<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/10/khan-younis-israel-strike-al-mawasi-tent-camp-gaza-deaths-humanitarian-safe-zone\"> at least 19 people were killed</a> as Israeli missiles hit an overcrowded humanitarian zone in Khan Younis. Eleven schools being used as shelters were hit in Israeli strikes last month, with nearly 100 deaths reported. Israel has blamed Hamas for using civilian as human shields \u2013 although recent reports have found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/14/israeli-forces-in-gaza-use-civilians-as-human-shields-against-possible-booby-traps\">Israeli forces </a>are using Palestinian civilians as human shields in Gaza to enter and clear tunnels and buildings they suspect may have been booby-trapped.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Overnight, Israel began what it called a \u201climited, localised and targeted\u201d ground operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. After launching what is (according to the UNHCR) the most intense attack on the country since 2006, the question arises: how much bigger does this conflict need to get before it is officially designated a \u201cfull-blown\u201d regional war? Since last October, when Hamas killed around 1,200 civilians and took 250 more hostages, the international community has been using diplomatic pressure to prevent a larger regional conflict breaking out from the war in Gaza. For now, those efforts have seemingly failed \u2013 at least 95 people were killed on Monday alone in Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon. Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader, Naim Qassem, said on Monday night that \u201cresistance forces are ready for a ground engagement\u201d. \u201cWe know that the battle may be long. We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006,\u201d he said, referring to the 2006 war. US president Joe Biden and the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, have called for a political solution to the ongoing crisis. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke with the Guardian\u2019s international security correspondent, Jason Burke, about the latest developments in the region. Five big stories Conservatives | Leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick is facing condemnation for claiming that UK special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists because of fears that European laws would free any detained assailants. His claim has drawn criticism from Labour, a former Tory attorney general and a former army officer. Aviation | The US National Transportation Safety Board on Monday said more than 40 foreign operators of Boeing 737 airplanes may be using planes with rudder components that may pose safety risks. Police | Four police officers and a civilian employee are to face disciplinary action for alleged errors that helped leave the serial rapist David Carrick free to attack a string of women. South Korea | Three police officers prison have been convicted over their handling of a 2022 Halloween crush in a Seoul nightlife district that killed 159 people. The crush, one of the biggest peacetime disasters in South Korea, caused a nationwide outpouring of grief. The victims, who were mostly in their 20s and 30s, had gathered in Itaewon for Halloween celebrations. Culture | A painting that was found by a junk dealer while he was clearing out the cellar of a home in Capri, and was regularly decried by his wife as \u201chorrible\u201d, is an original portrait by Pablo Picasso, Italian experts have claimed. In depth: \u2018Lebanon is fragile \u2013 it is not in a state to sustain another round of violence\u2019 More than 1,000 people in Lebanon have been killed in the past two weeks, 6,000 wounded and, according to the Lebanese government, one million displaced. Meanwhile in Gaza, the humanitarian situation has eroded further. With little to no infrastructure available to support the displaced population, disease is rampant and civilians are living in the most catastrophic conditions. The principals of the UN-NGO inter-agency standing committee (IASC) have said they are still unable to carry out anywhere near enough humanitarian work in the territory, as Palestinians continue to live \u201cwithout protection, food, water, sanitation, shelter, health care, education, electricity and fuel \u2013 the basic necessities to survive\u201d. There is little political incentive for Benjamin Netanyahu to let up, as the assassination of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has given the embattled Israeli prime minister a political boost. The mood among many of Israel\u2019s citizens is one of jubilation: there have been singalongs and celebratory toasts as the government\u2019s standing recovers from months of protests and low morale. *** Destabilising Hezbollah At this point, there is too much uncertainty to predict the long term impact of the assassination of Nasrallah on Hezbollah but in the short term \u201cit\u2019s a really devastating blow\u201d, Jason says. \u201cNot only have they lost a charismatic and popular leader \u2013 among his supporters at least \u2013 [but] Nasrallah was also competent and effective. You don\u2019t get to stay at the top of a group like that for 32 years without being good at what you do.\u201d It is not just the loss of its leader that has hit Hezbollah hard. Israel has intercepted and sabotaged its communication and eliminated many of the militia group\u2019s most senior military commanders \u2013 so far 19 Hezbollah officials have been killed. The assassinations and targeted bombing show just how deeply penetrated Hezbollah, a notoriously secretive group, has become by Israeli intelligence. As expected, the Shia militia group has sworn to enact revenge attacks but, as of yet, it appears to have been unable to retaliate in any serious way. \u201cEven though Israeli air defences are very effective, it\u2019s been said for a long time that Hezbollah, which has massive stocks of rockets and missiles, would be able to overwhelm those defences and cause significant casualties and destruction in much of northern and central Israel but so far, they\u2019ve not been able to do anything much,\u201d Jason says. This hesitation perhaps is borne of an awareness that Israel\u2019s response to such an attack is likely to be equally if not more devastating. \u201cHezbollah is a state within a state and primarily acts in its own interests, or those of its sponsor, Iran. But whatever happens the consequences for Lebanon are going to be very tough indeed. The country is already fragile and it is really not in a state to sustain another round of deeply destabilising violence and destruction,\u201d Jason says. In just a week, more than 1,000 civilians have been killed \u2013 almost the number killed in 36 days of war 18 years ago. *** Ground invasion Israel had been threatening boots on the ground in south Lebanon for several weeks, and this came to pass on Monday night. The IDF has said it will be targeting a number of villages near the border \u201cwhich pose an immediate and real threat to Israeli settlements on the northern border\u201d. It has also declared areas of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel a closed military zone. A ground invasion, as risky and costly as it is, theoretically can do more damage to Hezbollah. Tanks and infantry may allow Israel to \u201cdestroy tunnels, military positions and physically push back Hezbollah fighters who are still on the contested border\u201d, he adds. They could create a buffer zone on the other side of the border to allow the 65,000 displaced Israeli\u2019s to return to their communities in northern Israel, one of Netanyahu\u2019s stated objectives. But although Hezbollah has been weakened, the incursion into south Lebanon may not prove simple for Israel\u2019s military. The militia group still has a large arsenal including sophisticated anti-tank weapons and, crucially, tens of thousands of troops. A buffer zone could mean that Israel would have to keep troops there indefinitely, leaving them vulnerable against Hezbollah fighters who know the region like the back of their hand. *** Iran\u2019s strategy Iran is currently in a weak strategic position. For months, Tehran has been trying to respond strongly to Israel\u2019s aggression without pushing the conflict over the brink and becoming directly involved in a conflict that would inevitably rope in the US. \u201cIran has a variety of ways it could respond, none of which is particularly effective, but that would at least display a willingness to retaliate,\u201d Jason says. Historically, Tehran has used proxies to attack Israeli embassies, diplomats and other Israeli targets around the world. The most recent retaliatory act saw Iran launch 300 projectiles at Israel, though most were intercepted. \u201cThey know they can\u2019t risk an all out war with Israel, so these moves did not act as a deterrent. Instead it likely emboldened Israel,\u201d Jason says. *** The ongoing war in Gaza Hezbollah has made it clear that the only way it will willingly end the current round of attacks on Israel is a ceasefire in Gaza \u2013 but that still looks a long way off. The months-long peace deal and hostage release negotiations brokered by the US and Qatar have been stuck in limbo as neither Netanyahu nor the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, seems interested in coming to an agreement. US diplomatic efforts have done little else than show how ineffectual Washington is at even moderating Israel\u2019s military actions. While all eyes seem focused on the border between Israel and Lebanon, the IDF has continued to launch deadly airstrikes on designated safe zones across the Gaza Strip. Earlier this month at least 19 people were killed as Israeli missiles hit an overcrowded humanitarian zone in Khan Younis. Eleven schools being used as shelters were hit in Israeli strikes last month, with nearly 100 deaths reported. Israel has blamed Hamas for using civilian as human shields \u2013 although recent reports have found that Israeli forces are using Palestinian civilians as human shields in Gaza to enter and clear tunnels and buildings they suspect may have been booby-trapped. The practice was so widespread it was considered \u201cprotocol\u201d. The most recent figures show that at least 41,534 Palestinians have been killed since the war began and 96,092 have been injured. As the winter months approach, displaced Palestinians are living in battered tents surrounded by decaying rubbish face floods and cold weather, increasing the already high risk of disease. Beyond reaching its goals, of returning its displaced citizens to the north and destroying Hezbollah, the only other real way of stopping Israel from further expanding its scope is \u201cif the US leans on them so heavily that Netanyahu felt there was no alternative but to hold back\u201d, Jason says. But as Netanyahu\u2019s polls rebound and the US remains focused on its own upcoming election, there seems to be no obvious mechanism to de-escalate the situation. What else we\u2019ve been reading Anna Moore\u2019s piece on abusive parents granted contact with their children is an important read but a difficult one, too, not least her interview with Claire Throssell, whose two young sons were murdered by their father (says Throssell, \u201cI don\u2019t live now, I exist\u201d). Hannah J Davies, deputy editor, newsletters The far right\u2019s victory in Austria was expected and, crucially, not sweeping but it is still a frightening reminder of the foothold that extremist populist politics is gaining in many countries.

      "bodyText": "This summer I set off on what I had hoped would be the holiday of a lifetime to Greenland. Sadly, just two days into the trip, my mother died. I cut short the holiday and went on to make a claim on my Big Cat Travel Insurance policy for \u00a36,000 and supplied the death certificate, as well as the other evidence it asked for. This is when the problems started. The company is asking for information I cannot provide. My mother lived in the US and it asked for a medical certificate from her doctor certifying the \u201csole reason for curtailment was due only to my mother\u2019s death\u201d, plus details about her health in the preceding months. I have never met her doctor. He was unaware of my trip and could not possibly certify what I knew at the time of buying the insurance, or that my mother\u2019s death was the \u201csole reason for curtailment\u201d. The law also prohibits him sharing her medical information with me anyway. I bought the annual policy nearly six months before travelling and paid the premium in good faith. When I took it out, my mother was 87 and suffered from dementia, but had been stable for many years, and I was unaware of her detailed medical condition. I have provided a death certificate. No other information appears relevant. I feel like the company is suggesting that I shouldn\u2019t have gone on holiday because my mother was elderly, or I had other reasons for cutting the trip short. PH, Sevenoaks Most travel insurance policies include curtailment cover, which enables you to claw back the money spent on things such as hotels and pre-booked excursions up to a certain sum. Generally, you are usually only covered to cut a trip short for a funeral if the death is unexpected. Your policy is underwritten by Allianz Partners, and I asked it to look at your case. The good news is that, after conducting a review, and considering the additional information you shared with me, it is satisfied that you have a valid claim. It had not actually rejected it, the company says \u2013 the claim was \u201congoing while we worked to find an appropriate solution to the complexities involved\u201d. It adds: \u201cWe are happy to confirm we will honour the claim in full.\u201d We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Consumer Champions, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU. Please include a daytime phone number.

Historical fiction has the upper hand in its ability to render the complex yet plausible emotions and motivations of historical figures. Categorised by the publisher as creative nonfiction, Ekow Eshun\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-strangers-9780241472026/\">The Strangers</a></em> is foremost a work of imagination that sits somewhere between history and fiction. In lyrical prose, it presents the lives of five Black men: Ira Aldridge, 19th-century actor and playwright; Matthew Henson, polar explorer; Frantz Fanon, psychiatrist and political philosopher; footballer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/01/john-fashanu-on-his-brother-justin-he-was-my-shining-light-he-became-my-arch-enemy\">Justin Fashanu</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/07/malcolm-x-man-behind-myth\">Malcolm X</a>. Through them, the book moves from the early-19th century to the late-20th. More connects these men than race. Eshun selects moments when each one is in an exile of some kind, geographically and emotionally far away from what they once knew, questioning their place in the world, estranged in some way from their previous life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The historical record provides an all too limited view of Black life, especially before the 20th century</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For all five, there is a long chapter that imagines how they experienced some of the most significant moments of their lives. These chapters are written mostly in the second person. As Eshun mentions in an author\u2019s note, he wants to inhabit each man\u2019s perspective \u2013 and allow us to. And it is effective. Each chapter is absorbing, no matter how much you already know. Captivated by New York theatre productions, Aldridge becomes an actor, only to be ridiculed in London by critics who believe that only white actors (in blackface) can truly perform the role of Othello. Outside the capital, though, Aldridge is hailed. From 1891, Henson travels with US naval officer Robert Peary for nearly two decades in a long quest to reach the north pole. The relationship between Henson and Peary, both similar in their refusal to let the Arctic climate defeat them, takes on the qualities of a psychodrama. In Eshun\u2019s telling, Peary can never accept what Henson knows: the commander only survived these trips because of Henson\u2019s skilled support and the formidable knowledge of their Inuit guides.</p>    <p>For Fanon, we get a glimpse of his tenure as a doctor in a psychiatric hospital in Blida, Algeria. As he develops more culturally sensitive therapies, he also comes to understand that, contrary to what he had been taught in Martinique, Frenchmen would never see him as one of them. Soon he is helping National Liberation Front fighters who are smuggled into his wards. We encounter Malcolm X in his final months, on his trip to Ghana months after his break with the Nation of Islam. Finally, Fashanu\u2019s promising football career fizzles out under Brian Clough\u2019s indifference toward him at Nottingham Forest and the stifling homophobia of Britain in the late-20th century.</p>    <p>Those accustomed to more traditional history writing may be tempted to check how closely Eshun hews to the biographies and memoirs he cites in the acknowledgments. But to fixate on the question of \u201ctruth\u201d too much is to miss his point entirely. The historical record provides an all too limited view of Black life, especially before the 20th century. Barring enslaved people and some of their descendants from literacy kept people from cataloguing their lives in writing. When a state did not recognise Black people as entirely human, it also did not track them all that closely by name, nor did societies comfortable with excluding Black people from public life preserve their effects all that carefully. To insist, as Eshun does, that Black men\u2019s inner lives demand our full attention requires going beyond the profound limits of the archive. The author may go further than many in his willingness to speculate, but many Black scholars and writers have long understood that creative imagining, whether in novels or in history, is an essential way to combat centuries of writing Black people out of European and American societies.</p> <p>After each long chapter comes a shorter essay, where Eshun combines his own personal history with an eclectic exploration of Black history. In the essay that follows Aldridge\u2019s chapter, for example, the author considers the Hereford Mappa Mundi, a medieval map that describes African and Asian groups as \u201cmonstrous races\u201d, sketches out the final 20 years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/david-oluwale-blue-plaque-for-victim-of-police-racism-stolen-hours-after-unveiling\">David Oluwale</a>\u2019s life before he was found dead in Leeds\u2019s River Aire, and recounts the time a journalist mistook him for a different Black man. Exploratory in nature, these essays at first seem like free association, and, for that alone, they are thrilling. Yet their cumulative effect is even greater. By the end, it is clear that Eshun has granted us temporary access into his own inner thoughts, in keeping with his encouragement for us to honour, through each man\u2019s story, \u201cthe black interior\u201d, a phrase he pulls from the Black American poet Elizabeth Alexander.

As Eshun mentions in an author\u2019s note, he wants to inhabit each man\u2019s perspective \u2013 and allow us to. And it is effective. Each chapter is absorbing, no matter how much you already know. Captivated by New York theatre productions, Aldridge becomes an actor, only to be ridiculed in London by critics who believe that only white actors (in blackface) can truly perform the role of Othello. Outside the capital, though, Aldridge is hailed. From 1891, Henson travels with US naval officer Robert Peary for nearly two decades in a long quest to reach the north pole. The relationship between Henson and Peary, both similar in their refusal to let the Arctic climate defeat them, takes on the qualities of a psychodrama. In Eshun\u2019s telling, Peary can never accept what Henson knows: the commander only survived these trips because of Henson\u2019s skilled support and the formidable knowledge of their Inuit guides. For Fanon, we get a glimpse of his tenure as a doctor in a psychiatric hospital in Blida, Algeria. As he develops more culturally sensitive therapies, he also comes to understand that, contrary to what he had been taught in Martinique, Frenchmen would never see him as one of them. Soon he is helping National Liberation Front fighters who are smuggled into his wards. We encounter Malcolm X in his final months, on his trip to Ghana months after his break with the Nation of Islam. Finally, Fashanu\u2019s promising football career fizzles out under Brian Clough\u2019s indifference toward him at Nottingham Forest and the stifling homophobia of Britain in the late-20th century. Those accustomed to more traditional history writing may be tempted to check how closely Eshun hews to the biographies and memoirs he cites in the acknowledgments. But to fixate on the question of \u201ctruth\u201d too much is to miss his point entirely. The historical record provides an all too limited view of Black life, especially before the 20th century. Barring enslaved people and some of their descendants from literacy kept people from cataloguing their lives in writing. When a state did not recognise Black people as entirely human, it also did not track them all that closely by name, nor did societies comfortable with excluding Black people from public life preserve their effects all that carefully. To insist, as Eshun does, that Black men\u2019s inner lives demand our full attention requires going beyond the profound limits of the archive. The author may go further than many in his willingness to speculate, but many Black scholars and writers have long understood that creative imagining, whether in novels or in history, is an essential way to combat centuries of writing Black people out of European and American societies. After each long chapter comes a shorter essay, where Eshun combines his own personal history with an eclectic exploration of Black history. In the essay that follows Aldridge\u2019s chapter, for example, the author considers the Hereford Mappa Mundi, a medieval map that describes African and Asian groups as \u201cmonstrous races\u201d, sketches out the final 20 years of David Oluwale\u2019s life before he was found dead in Leeds\u2019s River Aire, and recounts the time a journalist mistook him for a different Black man. Exploratory in nature, these essays at first seem like free association, and, for that alone, they are thrilling. Yet their cumulative effect is even greater. By the end, it is clear that Eshun has granted us temporary access into his own inner thoughts, in keeping with his encouragement for us to honour, through each man\u2019s story, \u201cthe black interior\u201d, a phrase he pulls from the Black American poet Elizabeth Alexander.

Standing in the Wokingham control room, Fintan Slye scans the screens: power plants are firing, turbines are spinning, and electricity is flowing through Britain\u2019s subsea cables.</p> <p>A small corner of one screen shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/21/end-times-for-the-uks-final-coal-fired-power-station\">Britain\u2019s last remaining coal plant</a>, Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, quietly generating a tiny fraction of the grid\u2019s electricity. \u201cWe won\u2019t see that for long,\u201d Slye says. On Monday<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/30/the-deep-history-of-british-coal-from-the-romans-to-the-ratcliffe-shutdown\"> the power station shut down for good</a>.</p> <p>Slye has borne responsibility for running Britain\u2019s power grids since he took up the role of executive director of the electricity system operator in 2018 from the equivalent role in his native Ireland. He still misses being near the sea in Dublin, he says. But the chance to steer Britain to a low-carbon future will take priority for now.</p> <p>The first task facing Neso will be setting a plan to decarbonise Britain\u2019s electricity. In its first weeks in power, the government charged Slye and his team with drawing up the roadmap that will take Britain to an era of clean power by 2030, including the difficult changes that will be required to the UK\u2019s planning and regulation regimes.</p> <p>This plan will be used to inform a wider strategy for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/25/race-to-get-uk-electricity-grid-ready-for-net-zero\">Britain\u2019s creaking energy infrastructure</a> as part of an effort to break down the fragmented thinking that has hindered progress to date, and chart a holistic future for British energy. For the first time, the system operator will be co-creating the landscape it controls.</p> <p>This is \u201cabsolutely\u201d the biggest challenge facing the new organisation, Slye says. \u201cWe have a new government coming in with a really clear mission around what it wants to achieve in energy. It was one of the main planks of their election manifesto, and it\u2019s one of their<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/17/ed-miliband-wind-solar-pylons-energy-uk-fossil-fuels\"> key missions</a> now that they are in power. But it is undoubtedly hugely ambitious to get to clean power by 2030. It requires not only for us to do everything that we can do quicker, but also very, very differently as well.\u201d</p>    <p>Many within the industry would more readily describe the task as unachievable. If Slye is to meet this challenge, in the timescale set by the government, it will require an unprecedented effort, they say. Slye admits that there is a \u201chuge degree of scepticism\u201d, which has already led many to believe that the plans are \u201cfantastical, undoable\u201d. But he is adamant that they can be delivered.</p> <p>\u201cIs it at the outer limit of what\u2019s achievable? Yes. But if you\u2019re prepared to do things differently and to take difficult decisions early on, then yes, absolutely it is doable,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThat would include, in all likelihood, things like a complete reform of the planning and consenting regime, a streamlining of the regulatory approval process, changes to the grid connections process \u2026\u201d The list goes on.</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re not saying that the target is achievable with the current energy industry processes and systems and ways of working. In fact, it\u2019s not achievable in those circumstances. But if you can make the required changes, then it can be delivered,\u201d Slye says.</p> <p>When he moved to Britain in 2018, gas was the single largest source of electricity in the UK, at nearly 40% of all power generation. Five years on, it still makes up almost a third of the total. But in the five years ahead, Slye will need to relegate it to a peripheral role.</p> <p>The power system will need to be clean, of course, but it must also reliably keep the lights on while remaining affordable and resilient to shocks. The forthcoming roadmap will probably set out two or three routes which offer different strategies, with different costs and challenges, to reach the same destination. Ultimately, it will be up to government ministers to decide which path to take.</p> <p>One thing these routes will not deliver is the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/24/labour-uk-clean-energy-superpower-fuel-poverty\">zero carbon electricity system</a>\u201d promised by the Labour party before the election \u2013 at least, not all of the time. Since coming to power, ministers have made subtle tweaks to the rhetoric, choosing to talk about \u201cclean power\u201d by the end of the decade. This is arguably a more flexible target.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no established definition of clean power,\u201d says Slye. \u201cSo what does it realistically mean? One of the key pieces of work from the Committee on Climate Change found that the cost [of decarbonisation] really begins to escalate when you reach those last percentage points towards 100% clean power.</p> <p>\u201cSo at the moment, the working definition that we\u2019re using for this analysis is to reach 95% clean power. That means that, by 2030, 95% of the generation in Great Britain over the period of a year will be from clean power sources. And that means that the remaining 5% will come from unabated gas. That\u2019s our definition.\u201d</p> <p>There will continue to be \u201ca significant amount\u201d of gas power plants in reserve for the cold, dull, windless weeks of winter, but they will run for only limited periods, Slye says. Conversely, there will be days when Great Britain generates far more electricity from renewable energy sources than it can use or store, so there are likely to be greater exports to neighbouring countries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve shifted from needing to send five instructions an hour to 500 instructions an hour.

      "body": "<p>For the last few years the radical right Freedom party of Austria (FP\u00d6) has dominated opinion polls, outpacing historically mainstream parties such as the People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) and Social Democratic party (SP\u00d6).

However, the recent national elections have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/victory-austria-another-step-far-right-march-europe-eu\">yielded results</a> that even the most pessimistic observers might not have anticipated.</p> <p>In a historic first, the FP\u00d6 under the leadership of Herbert Kickl won the national elections with 28.8% of the vote, surpassing the previous record held by his mentor J\u00f6rg Haider in 1999.

About 443,000 votes out of a total of 1.4m supporting the FP\u00d6 <a href=\"https://orf.at/stories/3371443/\">came from</a> the \u00d6VP alone. In contrast, urban centres continue to support the SP\u00d6, which managed to maintain and even increase its foothold in these regions. The FP\u00d6 attempted to appeal to Turkish-origin voters by framing them as well-integrated in juxtaposition to more recent immigrants with origins in Syria, Afghanistan, and Chechnya, but this strategy was ineffective, as <a href=\"https://www.wien.gv.at/wahlergebnis/de/NR241/910.html\">election results</a> in districts with a high Muslim population show.</p> <p>The rise of the FP\u00d6 reflects a broader trend of disillusionment with traditional political parties across Europe. In 1945, the centrist \u00d6VP and SP\u00d6 collectively garnered an impressive 94.4% of the vote; today, their combined share has dropped to just 47.4%. Meanwhile, other emerging parties struggle to gain ground, with only the Liberals making minor gains.</p> <p>What does this unprecedented victory mean for Austria\u2019s political future? While the FP\u00d6 has bolstered its presence in parliament, winning a projected 56 seats out of 183, the prospects for coalition-building remain murky. The current chancellor, Karl Nehammer, has ruled out a partnership with Kickl, even though the FP\u00d6 shares many ideological similarities with the \u00d6VP, particularly on immigration and economic policies. The FP\u00d6 could only form a coalition with the \u00d6VP if its current leader resigned. Similarly, any coalition with the SP\u00d6 would require the leftist leader, Andreas Babler, to step aside for the more right-leaning Hans Peter Doskozil. Both scenarios seem extremely unlikely.</p> <p>In this situation, the second strongest, the \u00d6VP, has the potential to negotiate alliances that could sideline the FP\u00d6. If the \u00d6VP were to engage with the SP\u00d6, possibly with the New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS) as a third party, it could not only become the leader of the government with its own chancellor on top; it could also increase its hold on additional key ministries, given its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/austria-election-talks-forming-government-far-right-freedom-party-win\">numerical strength</a> (29%) versus the SP\u00d6 (21%) and NEOS (9%).</p> <p>The role of federal president Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leader of the Green party, adds another layer of complexity.

Israeli media is reporting that Mounir Maqdah, who is reportedly a commander in the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the purported target of the strike, was injured in the attack.

The government said a million people \u2013 a fifth of the population \u2013 have fled their homes.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel said it bombed Houthi targets in Yemen on Sunday</strong>. The airstrikes on Yemen\u2019s port of Hodeidah were a response to Houthi missile attacks on Israel in recent days, Israel said.

The group also confirmed that Ali Karaki, another senior commander, died in the airstrike on Friday strike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s where things stand in the hours since Israel\u2019s military confirmed it had started a \u201climited\u201d ground operation inside Lebanon. This blog is closing now but you can continue to follow live coverage on our new liveblog. The Israeli military has begun a \u201climited, localised and targeted\u201d ground operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, it has said, as it continued shelling areas close to the border and carrying out airstrikes on the capital, Beirut. The targets are \u201clocated in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel,\u201d the IDF said. Heavy shelling into Lebanon was taking place along the border in the area north of Kiryat Shimona. The towns of Marjayoun, Wazzani and Khiam were being shelled on Monday night. There were also reports of a heavy presence of Israeli aircraft over southern Lebanon. Israel launched a strike on a building in the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian camp near southern Lebanon\u2019s city of Sidon, a Palestinian source told the Reuters news agency. Israeli media is reporting that Mounir Maqdah, who is reportedly a commander in the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the purported target of the strike, was injured in the attack. Al Jazeera has reported multiple casualties in the strike. Ain al-Hilweh is Lebanon\u2019s largest camp for Palestinian refugees. If confirmed it would be the first strike on the overcrowded camp since cross-border hostilities broke out nearly a year ago. Syrian state media reported early on Tuesday that three civilians had been killed in Israeli strikes on the capital Damascus. State television had earlier said one of its presenters had been killed; it was not immediately clear whether they were among the three mentioned by state media. The reports could not be verified independently. Israel carried out more airstrikes in Dahieh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, after the Israeli military issued new instructions ordering residents of three buildings in the neighbourhood to evacuate immediately. Huge explosions were heard in the Lebanese capital late on Monday night. Israel\u2019s military spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued maps of three locations in Dahieh, instructing residents to evacuate more than 500 metres away, marking the second time Israel instructed residents of Dahieh to evacuate prior to strikes. At least 95 people were killed in Israeli strikes across Lebanon on Monday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. An airstrike early on Monday hit an apartment building in central Beirut \u2013 the first to hit in the heart of the Lebanese capital since 2006. The Lebanese army said it was \u201crepositioning and regrouping forces\u201d amid reports it had withdrawn three miles from the country\u2019s southern border. The Lebanese army has evacuated observation posts at Lebanon\u2019s southern border with Israel and moved to barracks in the border villages, according to reports. UN peacekeepers in Lebanon can no longer patrol border areas in the south due to heavy artillery fire from Israeli forces and Hezbollah, a UN spokesperson said. The peacekeeping force of more than 10,000 personnel \u201cremain in position\u201d but cannot carry out road patrols due to \u201cthe intensity of the rockets going back and forth\u201d, a spokesperson for the UN secretary general said on Monday. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said he had spoken to his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant and that the pair had \u201cagreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border\u201d with Lebanon. He also said he had \u201cmade clear that the United States is well-postured to defend US personnel, partners, and allies in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations\u201d. A US state department spokesperson said Israel had informed the US that it was conducting \u201climited ground operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border\u201d. The US president, Joe Biden, said he was aware of Israel\u2019s plans to launch an operation into Lebanon as he urged against such a move. \u201cI\u2019m more aware than you might know and I\u2019m comfortable with them stopping,\u201d he told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe should have a ceasefire now.\u201d The US is sending a \u201cfew thousand\u201d troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel if necessary, the Pentagon said on Monday. The increased presence will involve multiple fighter jet and attack aircraft squadrons, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters. The additional forces would raise the total number of troops in the region to as many as 43,000. The UK government announced it has chartered a commercial flight out of Lebanon for Britons wanting to leave amid escalating violence. The flight is due to leave Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport on Wednesday, the Foreign Office said, with priority given to vulnerable British nationals and their spouses, partners and children under 18. Canada has announced it has reserved 800 seats on commercial flights to evacuate its citizens from Lebanon. \u201cThe security situation in Lebanon is becoming increasingly dangerous and volatile,\u201d Canadian foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly wrote on X. The United Arab Emirates has reaffirmed its \u201cunwavering position towards the unity of Lebanon, its national sovereignty, and its territorial integrity\u201d, the country\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement early on Tuesday. It\u2019s expected that more countries across the Middle East will start to issue statements on the situation which has unfolded in Lebanon overnight. It\u2019s 8.30am in Beirut. Overnight Israel launched what it calls a \u201climited\u201d ground operation in southern Lebanon, while also launching strikes on the Lebanese capital, the country\u2019s south and \u2013 reportedly \u2013 in Damascus. Here are some of the images that have come into the newsroom in the past few hours. Air raid alerts are sounding across section of northern Israel, Israeli media is reporting. The Times of Israel is reporting that rocket alerts sounded a short while ago in the northern town of Metula, near the border with Lebanon. There are no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency has reported that overnight raids were launched on the towns of Bint Jbeil, Tayri, Kounine and Blida in Northern Lebanon. All four are towns that sit just north of the border with Israel. In its announcement that the ground operation had begun, the IDF said it would target a \u201cnumber of villages near the border, which pose an immediate and real threat to Israeli settlements on the northern border\u201d. With just a month left until the US presidential elections, the Biden administration launched a tepid effort at a ceasefire that Netanyahu appears to have chosen to ignore \u2013 or simply to wait out until US elections that could bring in a Trump administration that would do even less to restrain him than the current one has. \u201cNetanyahu made a calculation, and the calculation was that there was no way that the Democrats between now and November 5th [election day] could do anything that would criticise, let alone restrain him from that,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who focuses on US foreign policy and the Middle East. \u201cYou saw [vice-president Kamala] Harris\u2019s statement, you saw the White House statement, you saw the Democrat and Republican consensus on the killing of Nasrallah and what the Israelis have done there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd since Iran is involved in this, unlike in Gaza, the toxicity of animus against Iran in this town is so intense that the Republican party, which is now the \u2018Israel can do no wrong\u2019 party, is just winging for the administration.\u201d Until recently, prominent US officials have thought they still had a chance to conclude a ceasefire and prevent the war from escalating further. Last week, US and French officials along with dozens of other countries called for a ceasefire in Lebanon. US officials briefed on the matter said they believed the \u201ctime was right\u201d and that Israel would sign up. A western official last week told the Guardian that the Israeli threat to invade northern Lebanon was probably \u201cpsyops\u201d largely designed to force Hezbollah and Iran to the negotiating table. One day later, a massive airstrike launched by the Israeli air force killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, upending security calculations in the region and potentially emboldening Israeli officials to believe they could fundamentally change the security dynamics in the region. The IDF has said that three \u201claunches\u201d were detected in northern Israel. Two were intercepted by Israeli air defence and another fell into an open area, according to the Israeli army. Earlier we reported that air raid alerts had been issued in Israel\u2019s northern city of Safed which lies just kilometres from the Lebanese border. The number of displaced people in Lebanon is continuing to rise and now exceeds one million people, local media is reporting. \u201cBetween yesterday and today, the number of those inside shelters (schools) has increased by about 40,000, from 120,000 to 160,000,\u201d Al-Akhbar news reported. Out of 850 schools used for shelter, more than 600 have reached their capacity. They are mainly concentrated in Beirut, Mount Lebanon, and Sidon. The media reports not that there is a challenge in delivering enough humanitarian aid \u2013 including food \u2013 to them. A US defence official has disputed reports that US forces were targeted in a rocket attack on a base near Baghdad International Airport. All military personnel are accounted for and military forces were not targeted as had been reported.\u201d Two Iraqi security sources told Reuters that an initial investigation showed three rockets were fired, including one that landed near buildings used by Iraqi counter-terrorism forces, causing damages and fire to some vehicles but no casualties. The sources had previously said at least two Katyusha rockets were also fired at a military base hosting US forces and that air defences intercepted the rockets. The US defence official said Washington was aware of reports of an attack instead on the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Complex, which is a Department of State facility. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agencyhas said that it received a report of an incident 64 nautical miles northwest of Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah, adding that the authorities are investigating. For almost a year, the Iran-backed Houthis have been launching aerial drone and missile strikes on Red Sea shipping in what they says is solidarity with Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. It\u2019s unclear if they UKMTO warning relates to those attacks. Air raid alerts have been issued in Israel\u2019s northern city of Safed which lies just kilometres from the Lebanese border. Some media reported alerts were issue for other border towns as well. Air alerts have been active across sections of the country\u2019s north throughout the night. Earlier in the evening, the Israeli military said about \u201cten launches were detected that crossed the territory of Lebanon\u201d. The IDF says some of them were intercepted by air defence and others dropped into \u201can open area.\u201d Earlier on Monday, Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader, Naim Qassem, in his first public speech since Hassan Nasrallah\u2019s death, said that \u201cthe resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement\u201d. \u201cWe know that the battle may be long. We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006,\u201d he said, referring to the 2006 war. Heavy shelling into Lebanon was taking place along the boundary in the area north of Kiryat Shmona, in an area where Israeli armour and infantry advanced into Lebanon during the 2006 war. Airstrikes continued in Beirut and in at least 10 locations across the south of the country, according to Lebanon\u2019s state news agency. The Israeli military declared areas of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel a closed military zone. The towns of Marjayoun, Wazzani and Khiam \u2013 which sit in a series of interlocking valleys overlooked by steep slopes \u2013 were being shelled on Monday night. One resident in Marjayoun said that a local official had received a phone call ordering residents to evacuate but shelling had started before people could leave the town. \u201cThey called the mukhtar of Marjayoun, and told us we needed to evacuate. But we can\u2019t move, the roads are filled with shelling and airstrikes,\u201d the resident said. An hour later, the road leading out of Marjayoun was hit by an Israeli airstrike and rendered inoperable, Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reported. The area, with its scattered villages, and scrubby landscape hiding bunkers and combat tunnels, has long been a base for Hezbollah fighters and was heavily fought over during the last war between Israel and Hezbollah 18 years ago. Hezbollah said in a statement that it had targeted a group of Israeli soldiers who were in the \u201corchard\u201d near the Lebanese border towns of Odaisseh and Kafr Kila, \u201cachieving confirmed casualties\u201d. Kafr Kila is one of the towns that borders the area that Israel declared a closed military zone on Monday. Meanwhile, the Lebanese army said it was \u201crepositioning and regrouping forces\u201d amid reports it had withdrawn three miles from the country\u2019s southern border. Lebanon\u2019s army has historically stayed on the sidelines of major conflicts with Israel, and in the past year of hostilities has not fired on the Israeli military. Earlier today, the US announced it was sending a \u201cfew thousand\u201d troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel if necessary. The announcement came hours before Israel announced its operation in Lebanon. The increased presence will involve multiple fighter jet and attack aircraft squadrons, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters. US officials said the total includes small numbers of other troops to augment the presence as well. The additional forces will raise the total number of troops in the region to as many as 43,000. On Sunday, defense secretary Lloyd Austin announced that he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its embarked air wing in the region. US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin has spoken with Israel\u2019s defence minister, telling him that the US supports Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. I spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant today to discuss security developments and Israeli operations \u2026 We agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hizballah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel\u2019s northern communities.\u201d Austin also addressed any potential threat from Iran, saying the \u201cUnited States is well-postured to defend U.S. personnel, partners, and allies in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations and determined to prevent any actor from exploiting tensions or expanding the conflict.\u201d I reiterated the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel.\u201d Austin said he reaffirmed that a \u201cdiplomatic resolution is required\u201d to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border. Earlier we reported that while the US has expressed support for Israel\u2019s operaiton in Lebanon, the Biden administration has privately told the Israeli government that they are concerned that the operation could slide \u201cinto something larger and longer\u201d. According to reports in Israeli media, the White House is concerned that the \u201cIDF will get bogged down in the country or be drawn to expand the mission once it\u2019s already in motion.\u201d Canada has announced it has reserved 800 seats on commercial flights to evacuate its citizens from Lebanon, where the Israeli military has begun a \u201climited\u201d ground operation. \u201cThe security situation in Lebanon is becoming increasingly dangerous and volatile,\u201d Canadian foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly wrote on X. She added: \u201cIf you are a Canadian citizen in Lebanon, you must leave now.\u201d About 45,000 Canadians are currently in Lebanon and the next flight is scheduled for Tuesday. Many airlines have suspended flights to and from Beirut. The UK government has also announced it has chartered a commercial flight out of Lebanon for Britons wanting to leave amid escalating violence. The flight is due to leave Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport on Wednesday, the foreign office said. Al Jazeera is reporting that there are multiple casualties in the strike on the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp. According the media network, rescue workers are struggling to access the site of the attack in the densely packed camp. Israel is yet to comment on the attack. Israeli media is reporting that Mounir Maqdah, the purported target of the strike, who is reportedly a commander in the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, was injured in the attack. Reuters is reporting that a strike on the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp was targeting a Palestinian militant commander. According to two Palestinian security officials speaking to Reuters, an \u201cIsraeli strike in Lebanon early on Tuesday targeted Mounir Maqdah, commander of the Lebanese branch of the Palestinian Fatah movement\u2019s military wing, the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade.\u201d AFP is also reporting that an Israeli strike targeted the camp. Maqdah\u2019s fate was unknown. As we reported earlier, if confirmed the strike would mark the first Israeli attack on the camp, the largest of several Palestinian camps in Lebanon, since cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel broke out nearly a year ago. A Palestinian camp official told AFP that an Israeli strike targeted a top Palestinian militant on Tuesday in the community in the south Lebanon city of Sidon. Images taken from northern Israel of the raids into southern Lebanon show a number of fires and explosions an several built up areas. Syrian media is reporting that a fourth wave of strikes has hit Damascus. According to reports, three people have been killed and a further nine injured in strikes that local media have said were carried out by Israel. The Israeli army has not so far made any comment on the Syria attacks. The official Sana news agency said: The Israeli enemy launched an air aggression with warplanes and drones from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting several points in Damascus \u2026 three civilians were killed and nine others injured\u201d. Earlier we reported that Syrian state television said a news anchor had been killed in a strike on Damascus. Israel launched a strike on a building in the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian camp near southern Lebanon\u2019s city of Sidon, a Palestinian source told the Reuters news agency. Lebanese media also reported the strike. The Guardian was unable to verify it. Ain al-Hilweh is Lebanon\u2019s largest camp for Palestinian refugees. If confirmed it would be the first strike on the overcrowded camp since cross-border hostilities broke out nearly a year ago. There have so far been no reports of direct clashes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants. Israeli artillery units have continued to pound targets in southern Lebanon while airstrikes have been hitting Beirut. Earlier in the evening, Israel declared three small border communities to be a \u201cclosed military zone,\u201d restricting access only to army personnel. Later on the Israeli military made its announcement that it had begun \u201climited, localized and targeted ground raids\u201d against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency (NNA) is reporting continued shelling on the border town of Aita al-Shaab. According to the NNA a number of building have been destroyed in \u201ccross-border raids\u201d. The news agency lists at least eight locations that have been reportedly targeted by Israeli troops. Local residents in the Lebanese border town of Aita al-Shaab have reported heavy shelling and the sound of helicopters and drones overhead. Israeli shelling has been reported in villages close to the border in southern Lebanon throughout the night. In its statement announcing the ground operation, Israel\u2019s military said that its targets were located in villages close to the border that posed \u201can immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel.\u201d It said the air force and artillery were supporting ground forces with \u201cprecise strikes.\u201d It\u2019s currently unclear where Israel\u2019s purported ground incursion is taking place. Syrian state television says a news anchor has been killed in a strike on Damascus. State-run media has reported three rounds of strikes in the capital in one night, blaming Israel. State television said in a statement that it \u201cmourns anchor Safaa Ahmad who was martyred in the Israeli aggression on the capital Damascus\u201d. The official SANA news agency earlier said \u201cair defence systems are intercepting hostile targets for the third time tonight in the Damascus area\u201d, using a phrase that usually refers to Israeli strikes. The Israeli air force has intercepted an \u201cunmanned aircraft\u201d over the Mediterranean Sea, the IDF has said. In its statement, the IDF said the aircraft was \u201cdozens of kilometers west of the coast of Israel\u201d. Earlier we reported that the Israeli cabinet approved this next stage of the military operation after a meeting on Monday evening chaired by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Officials speaking to Axios reporter Barak Ravid said that the cabinet decision \u201cemphasized that the operation is targeted and limited in time and scope and is not intended to occupy southern Lebanon.\u201d Speaking off the record, US officials have stated there concern that Israel becomes caught in an protracted conflict in Lebanon. Jacob Magid, the Times of Israel US bureau chief, has reported concerns from the White House that the \u201cIDF will get bogged down in the country or be drawn to expand the mission once it\u2019s already in motion.\u201d As the IDF ground operation in southern Lebanon began, Israeli warplanes were launching strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The Guardian\u2019s reporter in Beirut, Will Christou, has posted this video that purportedly shows the moment that an Israeli strike hit Lailakeh, in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Late on Monday, at least two rockets were fired at a military base hosting US forces near Baghdad International Airport. \u201cThe Victory Base at Baghdad Airport was targeted with three rockets, two of which were shot down by the base\u2019s special defences, while the third fell near the headquarters of the Counter Terrorism Service Command,\u201d a security source told AFP. A second security source confirmed the report, noting that there were no casualties and that the rockets did not affect air traffic. We have a bit more on the British efforts to evacuate citizens from Lebanon. Speaking to broadcasters earlier on Monday evening, foreign secretary David Lammy said: \u201cWe will do all that we can to assist people to get out and we have secured places on commercial flights that are flying tomorrow so that UK nationals can get out. I urge them to leave because the situation on the ground is fast moving \u2026 And of course, whilst we will do everything we can to protect British nationals \u2013 and those plans are in place to do so \u2013 we cannot anticipate the circumstances and the speed with which we could do that if things escalate in a major way over the coming hours and days.\u201d Mr Lammy chaired a ministerial meeting of the Cobra emergency committee on Monday to discuss the crisis. There are an estimated 5,000 British citizens in Lebanon and the government says it is working on \u201call contingency options\u201d. British military assets have been deployed to Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean in case an evacuation is required, although ministers and officials have stressed that Britons should leave immediately. Israeli media have noted that it is exactly 18 years to the days since the IDF withdrew from southern Lebanon after the Second Lebanon war. On 1 October 2006, most Israeli troops withdrew from Lebanon after a months-long war against Hezbollah. The IDF has reported rockets from southern Lebanon have continued to be fired into Israel. Air alerts have been active across sections of the country\u2019s north over the last hour. The Israeli military said about \u201cten launches were detected that crossed the territory of Lebanon\u201d. The IDF says some of them were intercepted by air defence and others dropped into \u201can open area.\u201d As the Israeli military made its announcement that a \u201climited\u201d ground operation had begun in southern Lebanon, Syrian state media reported that \u201chostile targets\u201d had been intercepted over Damascus. Local media reported that explosions could be heard over the Syrian capital. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari has said Israeli forces \u201ctrained and prepared in recent months\u201d for the ground operation which began in southern Lebanon in the last few hours. The ground forces are accompanied in an attack effort by the Air Force and artillery forces, which attack military targets in the area in a coordinated effort with the fighters of the ground forces \u2026 Operation \u201cNorthern Arrows\u201d continues according to the assessment of the situation at the same time as the fighting in Gaza and other arenas. Israel has begun limited raids against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, the military has said in a statement. The IDF began a few hours ago a targeted and demarcated ground operation in southern Lebanon against terrorist targets and infrastructures of the terrorist organization Hezbollah.\u201d The IDF said that the targets were villages close to the border that pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in the country\u2019s north. The statement follows a similar proclamation from the US earlier, in which White House officials that Israeli forces appeared to have launched \u201climited ground operations\u201d targeting Hezbollah. Heavy shelling into Lebanon has been taking place along the border in the area north of Kiryat Shimona. The towns of Marjayoun, Wazzani and Khiam were being shelled on Monday night. The Biden administration has reportedly told the Israeli government that they are concerned that an \u201coperation limited in time and limited in geographic scope slides into something larger and longer\u201d, Axios reporter Barak Ravid has said. Ravid reports that the White House believes that they have reached an understanding with Israel on the scope of the ground operation in southern Lebanon, but \u201cfear that it will expand and take longer.\u201d Jacob Magid, the Times of Israel US bureau chief, has also reported concern from the White House that the \u201cIDF will get bogged down in the country or be drawn to expand the mission once it\u2019s already in motion.\u201d Magid reports that a US official pointed to Israel\u2019s 1982 invasion of Lebanon which was characterised as a \u201climited incursion, but it turned into an 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon\u201d. More on that statement from Hezbollah; the militant group has said it \u201ctargeted\u201d Israeli troops carrying out \u201cmovements\u201d near the Lebanese border. A source close to the group told the AFP news agency that Israeli soldiers were \u201cright on the border\u201d. The group said it targeted \u201cenemy soldiers\u2019 movements in the orchards opposite Adaisseh and Kfarkila\u201d near the border. A Lebanese security official told AFP there were \u201cIsraeli army movements on the southern Lebanese border\u201d. Hezbollah media reported \u201cartillery shelling\u201d near seperate border areas. Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency also reported \u201ccontinued artillery shelling\u201d on border areas. Lebanon\u2019s army has moved troops away from its southern border, a Lebanese military official told AFP. As Israeli strikes on Beirut appear to intensify, a former Israeli diplomat has criticised the IDF\u2019s ground incursion into Lebanon, saying that it could lead to the kind of deadly mission creep that had characterised the past failed operations of 1982 and 2006. \u201cWhat the hell does Israel mean by a limited [incursion],\u201d Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat and critic of Benjamin Netanyahu, told the Guardian. \u201cIs it limited in firepower? Is it limited in time? Is it limited in the employment of forces?\u201d Asked what could make this incursion different from the wars of 1982 or 2006, which resulted in a high numbrer of casualties among Israeli soldiers, he said: \u201cNothing. That\u2019s what worries me. Yeah, nothing. I see no thinking here.\u201d More broadly, Pinkas doubted Israel\u2019s reported goals of establishing a buffer zone in southern Lebanon that would allow Israeli residents to return to the border region. \u201cGoing into Lebanon and establishing some kind of a buffer zone from the Israeli border to say, the Litani River \u2026 it\u2019s very, very difficult to maintain that, that this is a very hostile area,\u201d he said, adding that it had been hostile during the 1982 and 2006 wars. \u201cBut the important thing is, by doing so, you\u2019re not eliminating Hezbollah\u2019s ability to launch long range missiles.\u201d He also warned that the Israelis, as in previous incursions into southern Lebanon, would face the lure of mission creep. \u201cOnce it begins to roll, things change, and all of the sudden, we got to take that village too. What about that hill? What about that little valley?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you have an \u201882 all over again.\u201d Pinkas said he wasn\u2019t denouncing all military actions, just those that would lead to a protracted occupation of Lebanese territory. \u201cI stress the military importance of going in, doing what you got to do, and going out, right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if this evolves into some kind of a protracted presence in southern Lebanon, then what the hell did you achieve by that?\u201d Late on Monday night, Israeli media reported that government sources had said the country\u2019s cabinet had approved the next stage of the military operation targeting Hezbollah after a meeting earlier in the evening chaired by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It remains unclear quite what the situation on the border is. Hezbollah has said that they targeted Israeli troops near the border. Meanwhile, strikes across Beirut have intensified over the last hour. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Israeli forces appeared to have launched what sources called \u201climited ground operations\u201d targeting Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon, US and other officials said late on Monday. Heavy shelling into Lebanon was taking place along the border in the area north of Kiryat Shimona. The towns of Marjayoun, Wazzani and Khiam were being shelled on Monday night. There were also reports of a heavy presence of Israeli aircraft over southern Lebanon. Israel carried out more airstrikes in Dahieh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, after the Israeli military issued new instructions ordering residents of three buildings in the neighbourhood to evacuate immediately. Huge explosions were heard in the Lebanese capital late on Monday night. Israel\u2019s military spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued maps of three locations in Dahieh, instructing residents to evacuate more than 500 metres away, marking the second time Israel instructed residents of Dahieh to evacuate prior to strikes. At least 95 people were killed in Israeli strikes across Lebanon on Monday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. An airstrike early on Monday hit an apartment building in central Beirut \u2013 the first to hit in the heart of the Lebanese capital since 2006. The strike killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small, leftist Palestinian faction. Families of people who went missing in the strikes on the country have been urged to take DNA tests to identify the remains of loved ones. The Lebanese army said it was \u201crepositioning and regrouping forces\u201d amid reports it had withdrawn three miles from the country\u2019s southern border. The Lebanese army has evacuated observation posts at Lebanon\u2019s southern border with Israel and moved to barracks in the border villages, according to reports. UN peacekeepers in Lebanon can no longer patrol border areas in the south due to heavy artillery fire from Israeli forces and Hezbollah, a UN spokesperson said. The peacekeeping force of more than 10,000 personnel \u201cremain in position\u201d but cannot carry out road patrols due to \u201cthe intensity of the rockets going back and forth\u201d, a spokesperson for the UN secretary general said on Monday. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, told community leaders that the \u201cnext phase of the war against Hezbollah will begin soon\u201d. Gallant had earlier told troops in northern Israel: \u201cWe will use all of our capabilities \u2013 including you.\u201d The Israeli military later declared areas of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel a closed military zone. Israel\u2019s security cabinet approved the next phase of the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon following a meeting on Monday night, according to Israeli media reports. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, warned Iran it could strike anywhere in the region at will. \u201cThere is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach,\u201d he said in a video addressed to the Iranian people. In a three-minute video clip in English, Netanyahu accused Iran of subjugating its citizens and directly threatened its leaders. There was no official comment from Israeli officials on the ground operations in Lebanon, but Aryeh Deri, an Israeli minister who has been involved in wartime decision-making, tweeted the text of a Jewish prayer for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) mentioning Lebanon. An IDF spokesperson warned Israelis not to publish information on troop movements and not to \u201cspread irresponsible rumours\u201d. A US state department spokesperson said Israel had informed the US that it was conducting \u201climited ground operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border\u201d. The US president, Joe Biden, said he was aware of Israel\u2019s plans to launch an operation into Lebanon as he urged against such a move. \u201cI\u2019m more aware than you might know and I\u2019m comfortable with them stopping,\u201d he told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe should have a ceasefire now.\u201d Hezbollah vowed to keep fighting even after its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah and other senior officials had been killed by Israeli strikes. Friday\u2019s assassination of Nasrallah \u2013 the most powerful leader in Tehran\u2019s \u201caxis of resistance\u201d against Israeli and US interests in the Middle East \u2013 was one of the heaviest blows in decades to Hezbollah and Iran. The group\u2019s acting leader, Naim Qassem, said in a televised statement that if Israel launched a ground offensive, Hezbollah was ready. He said the commanders killed in recent weeks had already been replaced. Hamas said its leader in Lebanon was killed on Monday in an Israeli strike on the country\u2019s south. Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amine, \u201ca member of the movement\u2019s leadership abroad\u201d was killed in an airstrike on his home in the al-Bass camp in south Lebanon, a Hamas statement said. The head of the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, told reporters that Abu al-Amine was placed under investigation and suspended from his job at Unrwa in March. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said on Sunday that more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said a million people \u2013 a fifth of the population \u2013 have fled their homes. At least 11 Palestinians were killed, including women and children, in an Israeli strike on a house in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, according to Gaza medics on Monday. Palestinian health officials said the Palestinian journalist, Wafa Al-Udaini, was killed by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza on Monday. Yemen\u2019s Houthis said they would escalate military operations against Israel in response to its attacks on the country on Sunday. On Sunday, a major Israeli raid hit ports in Yemen run by the Houthi militia group, which is also backed by Iran, fuelling fears of a slide towards a devastating regional conflict on multiple fronts. A spokesperson for the Houthis said after Sunday\u2019s strikes would not cause the Iran-backed group to \u201cabandon Gaza and Lebanon\u201d. The US is ending a \u201cfew thousand\u201d troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel if necessary, the Pentagon said on Monday. The increased presence will involve multiple fighter jet and attack aircraft squadrons, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters. The additional forces would raise the total number of troops in the region to as many as 43,000. The UK government announced it has chartered a commercial flight out of Lebanon for Britons wanting to leave amid escalating violence. The flight is due to leave Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport on Wednesday, the Foreign Office said, with priority given to vulnerable British nationals and their spouses, partners and children under 18. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, repeated calls for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, after a call with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken. The French foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, visited Lebanon where he urged Israel against any ground incursion into the country. Barrot said the 21-day ceasefire proposal submitted by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Biden was \u201cstill there on the table to be discussed\u201d, adding: \u201cThere is hope, but time is very limited.\u201d Germany evacuated some non-essential staff out of Lebanon, as well as families of embassy workers and German nationals who are medically vulnerable, a statement by the German foreign ministry said on Monday. The US embassy in Beirut said it was working with airlines \u201cto address US citizens request to depart Lebanon\u201d. A Lebanese security official told AFP that Israel conducted at least six strikes on south Beirut late on Monday and early Tuesday. \u201cSix or seven Israeli strikes hit the southern Beirut suburbs,\u201d the official told the news agency. Videos posted on social media show huge blasts in the Lebanese capital. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 95 people had been killed in Israeli strikes across the country on Monday. An additional 172 people were injured in the past 24 hours, the ministry said. The UK government has announced it has chartered a commercial flight out of Lebanon for Britons wanting to leave amid escalating violence. The flight is due to leave Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport on Wednesday, the foreign office said. Priority will be given to vulnerable British nationals and their spouses, partners and children under 18, it said. A statement by Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, reads: The situation in Lebanon is volatile and has potential to deteriorate quickly. The safety of British nationals in Lebanon continues to be our utmost priority. That\u2019s why the UK Government is chartering a flight to help those wanting to leave. It is vital that you leave now as further evacuation may not be guaranteed. Israel\u2019s security cabinet has approved the next phase of the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, according to Israeli media reports. Members of the cabinet gave their approval during a meeting of the Israeli security cabinet this evening, the Jerusalem Post reported. Israel carried out two more airstrikes in Dahieh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, the second pair of strikes producing explosions that rattled windowpanes in the capital city and were heard as far as Bhamdoun, a town in the mountains surrounding Lebanon. Israel conducted at least four airstrikes in Dahieh on Monday night. Israel has carried out airstrikes on at least 10 different locations across south Lebanon over the past two hours, in addition to shelling towns along the border with artillery, Lebanon\u2019s state news agency reported. Hezbollah said in a statement at midnight on Tuesday that it targeted a group of Israeli soldiers who were in the \u201corchard [trees]\u201d facing the Lebanese border towns of Adaisseh and Kafr Kila, \u201cachieving confirmed casualties\u201d. Kafr Kila is one of the towns that borders the area that Israel declared a closed military zone on Monday night, before a potential incursion over the Lebanese border. Even as the Israeli ground operation appeared to be beginning, Israeli commentators were quick to recall that previous Israeli incursions into Lebanon over the past four plus decades had ended without achieving their objectives, with the occupation of southern Lebanon (1985-2000) prompting the formation of Hezbollah. Among them was Netanyahu biographer Anshel Pfeffer, who remarked: Israel always knows how it goes into Lebanon. It\u2019s the exit-strategy it seems to struggle with. This government certainly doesn\u2019t have one. Israeli journalist Amichai Stein has posted a video that he said showed Israeli strikes hitting the Dahieh suburb of southern Beirut. At least two explosions have been reported over the area, after the Israeli military issued new instructions ordering residents of three buildings in Dahieh to evacuate immediately. Israel carried out two airstrikes in Dahieh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, just a little over 30 minutes after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for residents close to what it said were buildings housing Hezbollah installations. The sounds of explosions were heard by a Guardian correspondent in Lebanon\u2019s capital city. At least two Israeli strikes have been reported in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, Reuters is reporting. The BBC\u2019s Nafiseh Kohnavard says she heard a loud explosion and that her apartment shook. It comes after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered residents to evacuate three areas in southern Beirut \u201cimmediately\u201d. While bombing in Lebanon\u2019s south continued, Israel\u2019s military spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued maps of three locations in the southern suburbs of Beirut, instructing residents to evacuate more than 500 metres away. Adraee said in a video posted on Twitter/X: To those present in the buildings specified in the map and those around them ... You are near [installations] which belong to Hezbollah, for your and your family\u2019s safety, you must evacuate these buildings immediately. This was at least the second time that Israel instructed residents of Dahieh to evacuate prior to strikes. On Friday, after carrying out sudden airstrikes which killed former secretary general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, Israel\u2019s military issued similar warnings to residents of the southern Beirut suburbs to leave, bombing the area soon after. The warnings, and subsequent bombings, almost entirely depopulated Dahieh and caused a wave of displacement within Lebanon\u2019s capital city. Many displaced residents have been sleeping rough since, unable to find accommodation or spaces in government-run shelters. A resident in Marjayoun, a town facing the Israel-Lebanon border that was being shelled on Monday night, said that a municipal official had received a phone call ordering the town\u2019s residents to evacuate \u2013 similar to phone calls residents Lebanon had been receiving over the last two weeks. However, before they could evacuate, Israeli shelling of the roads surrounding Marjayoun had already begun. The Marjayoun resident said: They called the Mukhtar of Marjayoun, and told us we needed to evacuate. But we can\u2019t move, the roads are filled with shelling and airstrikes. In Rmeish, a Christian border town that has been mostly spared from fighting over the past year, a first responder said that there had been shelling on Ayta al-Shaab, immediately to its west. \u201cThe army moved away from the border back to their barracks,\u201d the first responder said, echoing earlier reports that Lebanese soldiers had pulled back from their posts on the border. Footage posted by Israel\u2019s Channel 12 filmed in northern Israel showed a series of powerful detonations lighting up the sky on the Lebanese side of the border. An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson has warned Israelis not to publish information on troop movements following remarks by some rightwing Israeli politicians that indicated a significant military operation may be taking place in southern Lebanon. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari cited security concerns in a post on Twitter/X. He said: In recent hours there have been many reports and rumors about IDF activity on the Lebanese border. We ask that no reports be circulated about the activities of the forces. \u201cStick to the official reports only and do not spread irresponsible rumors,\u201d he added. Earlier, Aryeh Deri, leader of the conservative Shas party, published a prayer asking God to protect Israeli troops operating \u201cfrom the border of Lebanon to the desert of Egypt\u201d. A meeting of Israel\u2019s security cabinet convened by Benjamin Netanyahu has ended, the Times of Israel is reporting. The Israeli prime minister is now consulting with a smaller group of ministers in his office, the outlet reports. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued evacuation orders for several areas in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Civilians near several buildings in the Dahieh neighbourhood of southern Beirut should evacuate immediately, the IDF said in a statement. Israel\u2019s Arabic-language military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted a map alongside the announcement, showing the buildings in Dahieh. The head of the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) has denied knowing that one of its employees, Fateh Sherif Abu el-Amin, was a Hamas commander in Lebanon. Hamas announced on Monday that the head of its Lebanon branch, Abu el-Amin, was killed along with family members in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon. Abu el-Amin was placed under investigation and suspended from his job at Unrwa in March following allegations concerning his politics, the agency\u2019s chief Philippe Lazzarini said. He told reporters: The specific allegation at the time was that (he was) a part of the local leadership...I never heard the word commander before. What\u2019s obvious for you today, was not obvious yesterday. Lazzarini, at a news conference in Geneva, called on UN members states to push back against Israeli attacks on the agency. The Israeli parliament has been working to declare the UN agency a \u201cterrorist body\u201d, a move that Lazzarini described as \u201cabsolutely unconscionable\u201d. The Unrwa chief accused Israel\u2019s government earlier this month of driving a campaign to drive the agency out of existence. Unrwa, one of the UN\u2019s largest agencies, has 13,000 staff working in Gaza and more than 30,000 in the region providing health and educational facilities to Palestinian refugees. Families of people who went missing in Israeli strikes on Lebanon have been urged to take DNA tests to identify the remains of loved ones. A statement by the Lebanese police, reported by AFP, urged families to head fo specialised centres \u201cto conduct DNA tests\u201d, adding that it was: To help families of those who went missing following the Israeli aggression on Lebanon and to make the process of identifying victims and their remains smoother. For the past week, Israel has heavily bombed the country\u2019s east, south and southern Beirut suburbs, killing hundreds of people and displacing up to one million. An AFP correspondent in southern Lebanon reported hospital morgues were filled with unidentified remains. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, has repeated calls for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, after he held a call with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken. \u201cWe\u2019ve both seen the reports in the media about a next phase for Israel in Lebanon,\u201d Lammy told Sky News. He added: We both agreed the position that we had at the UN last week that the best way forward is an immediate ceasefire and to get back to a political solution \u2026 We both are urging de-escalation at this time. Lammy urged Britons in Lebanon to leave the country, warning that \u201cthe situation on the ground is fast moving\u201d. He added: Whilst we will do everything we can to protect British nationals - and those plans are in place to do so \u2013 we cannot anticipate the circumstances and the speed with which we could do that if things escalate in a major way over the coming hours and days. The Lebanese army has evacuated observation posts at Lebanon\u2019s southern border with Israel and moved to barracks in the border villages, CNN is reporting, citing a Lebanese security source. It comes after the Israeli military declared a closed military zone around three towns in the far north on its border with Lebanon. A Lebanese military official told AFP that the Lebanese army is repositioning troops stationed on its southern border. The Lebanese army is \u201crepositioning and regrouping forces\u201d at the southern border following threats of an Israeli incursion, the official told the new agency. As my colleague William Christou wrote earlier, Lebanese media is reporting Israeli shelling and firing tanks at border villages adjacent from the area it announced was a closed military border. Calls for a tougher response from Iran\u2019s reformist-led government redoubled after news that Brig Gen Abbas Nilforushan, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) deputy commander for Lebanon and Syria, had been killed in Beirut alongside the Hezbollah chief, Hassan Nasrallah. The dominant line in Iranian government circles remains that a direct war between Israel and Iran should be avoided as it would play into Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s hands and draw in the US \u2013 but that Hezbollah should not be left to fight alone. The atmosphere in Iran appeared to have been affected by Netanyahu\u2019s statement that Nasrallah\u2019s death was essential to \u201cchange the balance of power in the region\u201d. On Monday, the Israeli prime minister made an explicit call for regime change in Tehran, saying Iran will be \u201cfree \u2026 a lot sooner than people think\u201d. Read the full analysis here: The decapitation of Hezbollah leaves Iran weighing its options Lebanese media has reported that Israel has been shelling and firing tanks at border villages adjacent from the area it announced was a closed military border a few hours before, ahead of a reported Israeli land incursion of south Lebanon. The area around Khiam and Wizani, both facing the Lebanon-Israel border, have been shelled for at least two hours. They are both directly east of the closed military area specified by Israel\u2019s military spokesperson late on Monday night. If Israel did intend to conduct a land invasion across the Lebanese border, shelling and tank fire would likely precede their entry. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has declared the areas around the communities of Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon as a closed military zone. Entry to those areas around the communities was prohibited, the IDF said. It said the decision was taken following a situational assessment and signed off by the chief of Israel\u2019s northern command, Ori Gordin. Lebanese troops have pulled back from positions along Lebanon\u2019s southern border with Israel, Reuters is reporting, citing local residents and several security sources. A Lebanese security source told the news agency that Lebanese troops have pulled back to at least five kilometres north of the border. Another security source said the troops pulled back to larger army bases in the area. Reports are coming in that the Lebanese army is in the process of withdrawing from the border area close to Israel, Lebanon\u2019s southern neighbour. The news agency Reuters has said sources have told them the country\u2019s military is pulling back from \u201cseveral positions on the southern border with Israel\u201d, while adding that a Lebanese army spokesperson has neither confirmed nor denied such reports. Separately, Iran-backed Hezbollah has been launching rockets into Israel from the border area and has been the target of heavy attacks from Israel in recent days. The Lebanese army is part of the official national military of Lebanon, under the control of the central government, and has not been waging a military offensive against Israel since last October, unlike Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a separate entity with its own military wing that is known to be more powerful than the Lebanese army. The United Nations peacekeepers mission in Lebanon, under Security Council Resolution 1701, is to \u201ccontrol the area\u201d and help the Lebanese government and armed forces establish control south of the Litani River, which is around 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel. The resolution ended a war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, the AFP writes. It called for all armed personnel to pull back north of the Litani, except for Lebanese state security forces and United Nations peacekeepers. While Hezbollah has not had a visible military presence in the border area since then, the group still holds sway over large parts of the south. Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the peacekeepers: Are able to observe what they can from where they are but they are not doing any road patrols.\u201d Dujarric said some civilian staff \u201chave been moved north\u201d as a precaution. We have a contingency plan and we\u2019re looking at the situation hour by hour,\u201d he added. United Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon have been unable to conduct patrols because of the intensity of Israeli strikes and Hezbollah\u2019s rockets targeting Israel, a UN spokesman said earlier today. With more than 10,000 personnel, the peacekeeping force, Unifil (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon), has been stationed in Lebanon since 1978, with its role strengthened after a 33-day conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Our Unifil Blue Helmets remain in position in the mission\u2019s area of responsibility, while the intensity of fighting is preventing their movements and ability to undertake their mandated tasks. Given the intensity of the rockets going back and forth, they are not able to do patrolling,\u201d Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, told a media briefing. Even before the dramatic escalation in fighting seen in recent weeks, several Blue Helmets had been wounded in the crossfire between Israel and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah movement. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Israel has launched small, precision raids across the border in Lebanon and a larger ground operation is being planned, AP is reporting, citing two officials. It was not clear if Israel had made a final decision on a broader operation, the news agency reported. Israel has told the US it is planning a \u201climited\u201d ground operation in Lebanon that could start \u201cimminently\u201d, according to multiple US media reports. A US official said it had looked like Israel was planning a major ground invasion but the plan now appears to have been \u201csignificantly scaled down\u201d. Israel\u2019s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said that \u201cnext phase of the war against Hezbollah will begin soon\u201d, in comments that further indicate that Israel plants to mount a ground invasion of Lebanon. Gallant earlier on Monday told troops in the north of the country that \u201cwe will use all of our capabilities \u2013 including you\u201d. Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader Naim Qassem said the group would shortly appoint a replacement for assassinated leader Hassan Nasrallah, and claimed Hezbollah was still only using a fraction of the group\u2019s capabilities to attack Israel. In a defiant address, he boasted of the range of Hezbollah\u2019s weaponry, and said that the group would continue to fight. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson said Israel \u201cwill not go unpunished for the crimes it has committed\u201d. Nasser Kanaani said \u201cWe do not make empty promises. Iran will not leave any aggressive actions of the Zionist regime, which target Iran\u2019s interests, unanswered\u201d. Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a fresh warning to Iran on Monday, saying \u201cthere is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach\u201d. A Lebanese solider has been killed by an Israeli drone strike, Lebanon\u2019s army announced. Since Israel stepped up its air attacks, which it says are targeting Hezbollah, in Lebanon 1,000 people are reported to have been killed, with 6,000 more wounded, and one million people displaced from their homes by Israeli strikes Throughout the day Israel\u2019s military continued to report projectiles being fired into northern Israel from the direction of Lebanon. There have been no reports of any casualties. Earlier Israel reported intercepting a UAV out at sea, believed to be targeting infrastructure at the Karish gas field. Yemen\u2019s Houthis said they will escalate military operations against Israel in response to its attacks on the country on Sunday. Germany has evacuated some non-essential staff out of Lebanon, as well as families of embassy workers and German nationals who are medically vulnerable, a statement by the German foreign ministry said on Monday. The UK government has said it is doing \u201ceverything we can\u201d to secure seats on commercial flights as it reiterated calls for British nationals to leave Lebanon. The US embassy in Beirut said it is working with airlines \u201cto address US citizens request to depart Lebanon\u201d. The embassy said it will provide additional flights \u201cwith seats for personal purchase\u201d. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell convened an extraordinary informal meeting of EU foreign ministers to discuss the EU\u2019s response to the latest escalation While Israel continues airstrikes on Lebanon, its assault on the Gaza Strip also continues, with at least 12 people including journalist Wafa Al-Udaini reported dead in strikes on Monday Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli security forces have detained 45 people in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in the past 24 hours US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller says Washington wants to ultimately see a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. Miller says the US \u201cof course\u201d continues to support a ceasefire but, he says sometimes people \u201ceither misinterpret or have their own version of what a ceasefire is.\u201d A ceasefire is not one side in a conflict unilaterally putting down its arms and stopping the conflict. It is an agreement for both sides to stop the conflict. In this case, what we have proposed is a 21 day ceasefire where both sides would stop attacking the other and we would reach a diplomatic resolution. He says the US will continue to engage with Israeli and Lebanese counterparts to reach that objective. Miller adds: Military pressure can, at times, enable diplomacy. Of course, military pressure can also lead to miscalculation. It can lead to unintended consequences, and we\u2019re in conversations with Israel about all these factors now. The US state department\u2019s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, is holding a briefing with reporters. Miller says the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and other senior US officials have been monitoring and responding to \u201cunfolding events in the Middle East\u201d over the weekend. He says he will let Israel \u201cspeak to its own military operations\u201d, including the \u201ctiming, purpose, tempo of those\u201d operations\u201d. He adds that the US has been engaged in conversations with Israel about those operations. About reports about Israeli ground operations in Lebanon, Miller says: We\u2019ve had some conversations with them about that. They have told us that those are limited operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border, but we\u2019re in continuous conversations with them about it. The Israeli military said it is \u201cpreparing for the next steps in the fighting\u201d in a statement on Monday. In the statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) added that the chief of Israel\u2019s northern command, Maj Gen Ori Gordin, recently approved tactical battle plans with officers who would potentially be involved in a ground offensive in Lebanon, the Times of Israel reports. Israel has launched small, precision raids across the border in Lebanon and a larger ground operation is being planned, AP is reporting, citing two officials. It was not clear if Israel had made a final decision on a broader operation, the news agency reported. Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning to Iran on Monday that there was nowhere in the Middle East beyond Israel\u2019s reach, two days after Israel\u2019s military killed the leader of the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. In a video address, Netanyahu said Israel\u2019s enemy was the Iranian government, not the Iranian people, and that when the government fell, its people would be better off. Yemen\u2019s Houthis said they will escalate military operations against Israel in response to its attacks on the country on Sunday. On Sunday, Israel bombed Houthi targets in Yemen in strikes that killed at least four people and wounded 29 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. Israel\u2019s military said dozens of aircraft, including fighter jets, had attacked power plants and a seaport in the port city of Hodeidah and the port of Ras Issa. It was the second such Israeli attack on Yemen in just over two months. In July, Israeli planes struck Houthi military targets near Hodeidah after a Yemeni drone hit Tel Aviv and killed one man. A spokesperson for the Houthis said after Sunday\u2019s strikes would not cause the Iran-backed group to \u201cabandon Gaza and Lebanon\u201d. The Pentagon said an unspecified number of American troops have been put on prepare to deploy orders. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters on Monday: [US secretary of state Lloyd] Austin increased the readiness of additional US forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies. I\u2019m just not going to get into specifics for [operational security] reasons, but these forces cover a wide range of capabilities and missions. The US and Israel are still in discussions \u201cabout the best way forward\u201d, Singh said in response to questions about whether Israel was planning a ground invasion in Lebanon. She said: We\u2019re continuing to engage with them, trying to learn more. We continue discussions on the best way forward. Syria\u2019s foreign minister, Bassam Sabbagh, has warned that Israel\u2019s strikes in Lebanon, Gaza, the occupied Golan Heights and his own country are propelling the region to the edge of perilous \u201cescalation and confrontation\u201d. Sabbagh was addressing the UN general assembly on Monday, where he urged all countries to work toward ending \u201cIsraeli aggression\u201d and to hold Israel accountable, AP reported. The Syrian minister accused the US and other, unnamed nations of giving Israel \u201cimmunity, impunity, and unlimited support\u201d. Sabbagh said: This large-scale Israeli aggression, which is unfettered by any restrictions and limitations, is pushing the region to the brink of a dangerous escalation and confrontation whose consequences cannot be predicted. The US has observed positioning of Israeli troops that suggests that a ground incursion into Lebanon could be imminent, a US official has told Reuters. The official declined to offer further details on the posture of Israeli forces and declined further comment, according to Reuters. Benjamin Netanyahu will convene ministers from Israel\u2019s security cabinet this evening, according to his office. After the meeting, the Israeli leader will hold consultations with several ministers, Amichai Stein of Israel\u2019s Kan news reports, amid increasing speculation that Israel could imminently launch a ground incursion into Lebanon. Israel appears ready to mount a limited ground invasion of southern Lebanon, the Washington Post is reporting, citing a US official. According to the paper, the US official said it had looked like Israel was planning a major ground invasion. But the plan now appears to have been \u201csignificantly scaled down\u201d, the paper writes. The Israeli plan in southern Lebanon will be focused on \u201cclearing out Hezbollah infrastructure near Israeli border communities\u201d, including \u201cdestroying Hezbollah tunnels, rocket launchers, weapons caches and other infrastructure\u201d, the US official said. Israel has indicated that they would conduct \u201climited raids in a number of villages along the border\u201d, the US official said, citing discussions within the Biden administration over the weekend. Israel will then pull its forces back, the US official said. The Israeli strategic purpose is to \u201censure that Hezbollah cannot sustain its capacity to attack Israeli communities on the other side of the border\u201d, the paper wrote. The paper quoted an Israeli familiar with military deliberations who corroborated the US official\u2019s account. The Israeli source said: Israel has plans for a limited operation that will be imminent. They are in line with the Americans. The understanding is that they are not going to do another Gaza. As we reported earlier, Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, appeared to hint on Monday at a possible ground operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Gallant, in a video statement, told armoured corps near the border with Lebanon that Israel will do whatever it takes to return its citizens to evacuated communities on its northern border safely. Here\u2019s a clip of Gallant\u2019s statement: Air France is suspending flights between Paris and Tel Aviv, and between Paris and Beirut, until 8 October due to concerns over the regional security situation, according to the airline. Hezbollah said it fired a \u201cNour Missile\u201d at Israel, which sources familiar with the Shia militant group told Reuters is a ballistic missile. It was the first time they have used the missile, the statement said. The missile hit the village of Kafr Giladi in northern Israel, the Hezbollah statement said, adding that it had fired it in response to \u201cIsraeli violations of cities, villages, and civilians.\u201d US president Joe Biden called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, as he indicated he was opposed to a potential Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon. Asked if he was comfortable with Israel\u2019s plan for a limited ground invasion of Lebanon, Biden replied: I\u2019m more aware than you might know and I\u2019m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a ceasefire now. The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said that \u201cnext phase of the war against Hezbollah will begin soon\u201d, in comments that further indicate that Israel plants to mount a ground invasion of Lebanon. Gallant, in a meeting of local council heads in northern Israel on Monday, reported by the Times of Israel, said: The next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon \u2026 We will do this. And as I said here a month ago [that] we will shift the center of gravity [to the north], this is what I say now: We will change the situation and return the residents home. As we reported earlier, Gallant hinted of an Israeli ground incursion of Lebanon as he addressed troops on Monday. CBS is also now reporting that Israel has notified the US that it intends to launch a limited ground incursion into Lebanon, according to a US official, after a report by the Washington Post. That operation could start as soon as today, the US official told CBS, the BBC reported. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, saud he had spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, about \u201crecent developments in West Asia\u201d. India is \u201ccommitted to supporting efforts for an early restoration of peace and stability,\u201d Modi wrote in a post on X. Terrorism has no place in our world. It is crucial to prevent regional escalation and ensure the safe release of all hostages. Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a fresh warning to Iran on Monday, saying \u201cthere is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach\u201d. Netanyahu, in a video statement in English, addressed the people of Iran and warned that their government was bringing them \u201ccloser to the abyss\u201d. Netanyahu said: There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country. He said Iran and Israel would be at peace when Iran is \u201cfinally free\u201d, which he said would \u201ccome a lot sooner than people think\u201d. \u201cEverything will be different,\u201d he said. Our two countries, Israel and Iran, will be at peace. Iran will thrive as never before. French foreign minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said Lebanon must elect a president as soon as possible. \u201cThe Lebanese must look solid,\u201d Barrot told reporters at a news conference in Lebanon. We will support the army of Lebanon \u2026 In these painful circumstances, France will stay for the side of Lebanon and the Lebanese. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, met with Barrot in Beirut earlier on Monday. According to a statement from his office, Mikati said: The key to the solution is to put an end to the Israeli aggression against Lebanon and to revive the appeal launched by the United States and France... in favour of a ceasefire. The French foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, has been holding a news conference during a visit to Lebanon. Barrot urged all parties to accept the 21-day ceasefire proposal submitted by his president, Emmanuel Macron, and the US president, Joe Biden. The proposal was \u201cstill there on the table to be discussed\u201d, he told reporters. \u201cThere is hope, but time is very limited.\u201d He added: I urge Israel to stop any ground incursion and to stop firing, and I urge Hezbollah to not make any step that will lead to the destabilisation of the security in the region. Filippo Grandi, the UN\u2019s high commissioner for refugees, said the number of people crossing into Syria from Lebanon had reached 100,000. Israel has told the US it is planning a \u201climited\u201d ground operation in Lebanon that could start \u201cimminently\u201d, the Washington Post has reported, citing a US official. The US official told the paper that Israel\u2019s planned campaign would be \u201csmaller than its last war against Hezbollah in 2006\u201d and would focus on \u201cclearing out militant infrastructure along the border to remove the threat to Israeli border communities\u201d. The US embassy in Beirut said it is working with airlines \u201cto address US citizens request to depart Lebanon\u201d. Posting to X, the US embassy said it will provide additional flights \u201cwith seats for personal purchase\u201d. The US embassy also urged American citizens currently in Lebanon to depart \u201cwhile commercial options still remain available\u201d, and that they should \u201cexercise security awareness of their surroundings, maintain a low profile, and take appropriate measures to ensure their safety and security.\u201d On Sunday, some employees at the US embassy in Beirut and their family members were ordered to leave Lebanon. A US state department statement on Sunday said: US Embassy Beirut personnel are restricted from personal travel without advance permission. Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. personnel under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats. Germany has evacuated some non-essential staff out of Lebanon, as well as families of embassy workers and German nationals who are medically vulnerable, a statement by the German foreign ministry said on Monday. The German foreign ministry raised its crisis level for missions in Beirut, Ramallah and Tel Aviv again at the weekend, though the embassies there remain operational, Reuters reported. There are currently 1,800 German citizens in Lebanon who have registered on the ministry\u2019s emergency preparedness Elefand list, a spokesperson for the ministry said. According to the German news agency dpa, a ministry spokesperson said it was assisting people seeking to leave Lebanon but that \u201cwe are not explicitly in an evacuation scenario\u201d right now. Israel\u2019s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, appears to have hinted that Israel intends to mount a ground invasion of Lebanon, after he told troops in the north of the country that \u201cWe will use all of our capabilities \u2013 including you\u201d. Gallant said that returning Israelis to their homes in the north \u2013 about 60,000 have been forced to evacuate by repeated rocket fire from Lebanon \u2013 was \u201cthe mission of the IDF\u201d Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader Naim Qassem issued a defiant statement, saying that the group would shortly appoint a replacement for assassinated leader Hassan Nasrallah, and claimed Hezbollah was still only using a fraction of the group\u2019s capabilities to attack Israel. He boasted of the range of Hezbollah\u2019s weaponry, and said that the group would continue to fight. He suggested that any other organisation subjected to the pager and walkie-talkie sabotage attack in Lebanon would have collapsed, but Hezbollah did not. The attack, which killed dozens and injured thousands of others, has been widely attributed to an Israeli attempt to target Hezbollah operatives Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson has said Israel \u201cwill not go unpunished for the crimes it has committed\u201d. Nasser Kanaani said \u201cWe do not make empty promises. Iran will not leave any aggressive actions of the Zionist regime, which target Iran\u2019s interests, unanswered\u201d A Lebanese solider has been killed by an Israeli drone strike, Lebanon\u2019s army has announced.

Israeli media reports that the latest barrage fired towards Israel from the direction Lebanon consisted of 25 projectiles heading towards western Galilee. A Lebanese solider has been killed by an Israeli drone strike, Lebanon\u2019s army has announced. The National News Agency reports that in a statement the army said \u201cone of the soldiers was martyred as a result of an Israeli enemy drone targeting a motorcycle\u201d. It said the incident happened at a checkpoint. Israel has claimed it is targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. So far, since Israel stepped up its aerial bombardment of Lebanon, about 1,000 people have been killed and 6,000 injured, with the government stating that one million Lebanese people have been forced to flee their homes. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli security forces have detained 45 people in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in the past 24 hours. It states that the total number of people detained by Israeli forces since 7 October now exceeds 11,000. The claims have not been independently verified. Britain has said that all sides should seek de-escalation and a ceasefire after Israeli strikes on Lebanon, adding that arms export licences to Israel are held under \u201cconstant review\u201d. A spokesperson for prime minister Keir Starmer said that Britain\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s right to self-defence was \u201cironclad\u201d but that only a ceasefire could restore stability and security to the region. \u201cClearly we stood with Israel previously. We do repeatedly say that Israel has the right to defend itself, but our focus now is on a ceasefire, and we call on all sides to show restraint, to step back from the brink and avoid any further escalation,\u201d he said. He was also asked about arms export licences. In response, the spokesperson said: \u201cIt\u2019s slightly distinct, the arms export criteria specifically in legislation, but it\u2019s kept under constant review, and the UK is continually obliged to review its position on that, and obviously we\u2019ll continue to do so and provide any updates if anything was to change in that.\u201d The British government has said it is doing \u201ceverything we can\u201d to secure seats on commercial flights as it reiterated calls for British nationals to leave Lebanon, PA Media reports. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been very, very clear that British nationals should leave now, particularly whilst commercial flights are still available. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to work with commercial airlines to maximise capacity because we want people to leave, and I understand that there have been extra Middle East Airlines flights leaving Lebanon over the weekend, another scheduled for Tuesday and we have secured seats for British nationals on those flights.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on at the moment is securing extra spaces on commercial flights for those who do want to leave and reiterating our calls for those to leave and to register their presence with us and book the first available flights. We\u2019re also working to send a rapid deployment team to bolster the efforts of our embassy in supporting British nationals who want to leave.\u201d Asked why an evacuation has not started, the spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear whilst there are commercial flights available, British nationals can and, indeed, should leave.\u201d The spokesperson also pointed to the deployment of 700 troops, alongside Border Force and Foreign Office officials, to Cyprus to continue work on \u201call contingency options and plan for a range of scenarios in the region\u201d. Bahrain\u2019s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa has said it is important to preserve Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty and to intensify efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, Reuters reports. The death toll from an Israeli strike on the southern Lebanese town of Ain Deleb has risen to 45, Reuters reports, citing Lebanon\u2019s health ministry. Al Jazeera is carrying a fuller version of Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson\u2019s quotes from earlier, in which he said Israel \u201cwill not go unpunished for the crimes it has committed.\u201d Nasser Kanaani said during a news briefing: We do not make empty promises, we have shown in practice that we stand firmly against aggressors who intend to violate Iran\u2019s national security, and our response will be regretful for them. Iran will not leave any aggressive actions of the Zionist regime, which target Iran\u2019s interests, unanswered. This regime will not go unpunished for the crimes it has committed, and Iran will take appropriate measures in response. Israel\u2019s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, appears to have hinted that Israel intends to mount a ground invasion of Lebanon, after he told troops in the north of the country that \u201cWe will use all of our capabilities \u2013 including you.\u201d Gallant said that returning Israelis to their homes in the north \u2013 about 60,000 have been forced to evacuate by repeated rocket fire from Lebanon \u2013 was \u201cthe mission of the IDF.\u201d He continued: That is what we will do, and we will deploy whatever is needed \u2013 you, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and from the land. He described the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as \u201ca very important step, but that\u2019s not all.\u201d Earlier, Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader Naim Qassem issued a defiant statement, saying that the group would shortly appoint a replacement for Nasrallah, and claimed Hezbollah was still only using a fraction of the group\u2019s capabilities to attack Israel. He boasted of the range of Hezbollah\u2019s weaponry, and said that the group would continue to fight. He suggested that any other organisation subjected to the pager and walkie-talkie sabotage attack in Lebanon would have collapsed, but Hezbollah did not. The attack, which killed dozens and injured thousands of others, has been widely attributed to an Israeli attempt to target Hezbollah operatives. While Israel continues airstrikes on Lebanon, its assault on Gaza also continues, with 12 people including a journalist reported dead in strikes on Monday. In Lebanon 1,000 people are reported to have been killed, with 6,000 more wounded, and one million people displaced from their homes by Israeli strikes. Over the weekend Israel attacked targets in the Houthi-controlled region of Yemen, and on Monday morning there were reports of explosions in Damascus in Syria. Reuters reports that 12 people, including journalist Wafa Al-Udaini, have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza today. It cited Palestinian health officials. Udaini\u2019s death raised the number of Palestinian journalists killed in the Israeli offensive since 7 October to 174, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said. The Committee to Protect Journalists puts the figure slightly lower, at 116 journalists and media workers killed since 7 October, which still makes it the deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Germany\u2019s foreign spokesperson has said that Israel\u2019s assassination of Hezbollah\u2019s leader Hassan Nasrallah, via an airstrike on a residential area of Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut, was use of Israel\u2019s right to self-defence. Reuters reports the spokesperson said: Hezbollah is of course a terrorist organization and it was obviously a meeting of the top leadership of Hezbollah, from which one can assume, even from a distance, that they were planning their further operations. So in this respect, there are also reasons to believe that the right to self-defence was exercised here. Lebanon will hold a parliamentary session to elect a new president as soon as a ceasefire in the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel takes hold, Retuers reports the caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati said on Monday after talks with the house speaker. Lebanon has been without a president since October 2022, when the term of Michel Aoun ended. The Kremlin on Monday condemned the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli air attack last week, Reuters reports. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Nasrallah\u2019s death had led to a serious destabilisation in the broader region. He said the bombing of residential areas in Lebanon had caused heavy casualties and would create a humanitarian catastrophe akin to the one in Gaza. Israel\u2019s military has issued a statement about the killing of Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amine, the leader of Hamas in Lebanon, who the organisation earlier said was killed in an airstrike. In the statement, Israel said: Overnight, during a joint IDF and ISA intelligence-based activity, the IAF struck and eliminated the terrorist Fatah Sharif, head of the Lebanon branch in the Hamas terrorist organisation. Sharif was responsible for coordinating Hamas\u2019 terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives. He was also responsible for Hamas\u2019 efforts in Lebanon to recruit operatives and acquire weapons. He led the Hamas terrorist organization\u2019s force buildup efforts in Lebanon and operated to advance Hamas\u2019 interests in Lebanon, both politically and militarily. The IDF and the ISA will to continue to operate against anyone who poses a threat to the civilians of the state of Israel. In another part of his address, the Hezbollah deputy leader Naim Qassem said that Israeli tactics against the organisation consisted of \u201ctwo tracks\u201d. He said: To our families and our beloved ones, I know the sacrifice is great. And the enemy works on two tracks. One to attack the military capabilities and the leaders of the resistance. The other track to hit the towns, villages and civilians, to create a rift between the resistance and the people. The Hezbollah deputy leader Naim Qassem did not announce replacements for any of the senior figures recently assassinated by Israel, but said the matter was in hand. He said \u201cin our hierarchy, we have deputies for all commanders. We have other alternatives in case the leader was killed or got injured.\u201d He added \u201cWe will choose a secretary general for Hezbollah sooner [rather] than later, according to the mechanism put in to select the new secretary general. And all the posts, all the vacancies will be filled.\u201d Hezbollah\u2019s deputy secretary-general, Naim Qassem, in an address, has claimed Israel is committing massacres of civilians in Lebanon with the full support of the US, that Hezbollah \u2018love martyrdom\u2019, and that any other organisation would have collapsed in the face of the attacks launched at it by Israel, but it did not. He pledged the group would continue to fight Israel and \u201cvictory will be ours\u201d. He said Israel is committing crimes and massacres in every part of Lebanon. Israel has chosen particular villages and towns and houses, and every house has the traces of the Israeli aggression. Israel attacks the civilians, the medics. Israel attacks everyone who walks in the streets and, everyone who stays in the houses. They are not fighters. The Israeli forces are killing, committing massacres and crimes against the civilians The US administration is supporting Israel by all means, and America is a partner with Israel in everything, through the unlimited military support, all types and kinds of support, culturally, politically, economically. And if Israel thinks that determination to be brutal and to continue aggressions, then Israel is deluded. The pains are there, the sacrifices are there. But everyone must know that we love martyrdom. He went on to say: We have sacrificed a lot since the pager operations and the martyrdom of the leaders and the martyrdom of the leader. If this happens anywhere else, these organisations will collapse, but we did not. We are going on despite the pains and the sacrifices. We are going on because we have the hope and we trust Allah almighty to be victorious. We are the people of jihad. He boasted of Hezbollah\u2019s reach into Israel and ability to target places like Haifa, and said that just one missile had caused a large number of Israelis to flee their homes. He said that Hezbollah would continue to fight, saying: We are all there in the field, despite the loss of some leaders and Hassan Nasrallah the main target, and despite the aggressive attacks against all the civilians in Lebanon, despite the sacrifices and the actions that are aimed to create chaos in our front. We will stay there. We will be steadfast. We will continue the Islamic resistance. We will continue facing the Israeli enemy in support of Palestine and Gaza and in defence of our Lebanese people. He suggested that Hezbollah was currently using \u201cthe minimum efforts from our side\u201d and said that \u201cWe are strong enough, and we will turn the Israelis mad because they will never, ever be able to reach and hit and hurt our military capabilities.\u201d He finished by saying \u201cWe need to be patient. We need some time. But the tools and equipment are there. Allah almight asked us to prepare the tools and the equipment and inshallah, this is happening, and this will happen, and peace be upon you all.\u201d Please note this is a transcription of the address as it was being translated live into English. Hezbollah\u2019s deputy secretary-general, Naim Qassem has begun an address, and said the group lost a brother and a leader when Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah. He has offered condolences to the families of everybody who was killed in the same strike. Reuters reports, citing the state news agency WAM, that the UAE is to pledge an urgent relief aid package worth $100m (\u00a374.5m / \u20ac89.3m) to Lebanon. While Israel steps up its attacks on targets inside Lebanon to its north, the Israeli military also continues operations in Gaza to its south-west. Hani Mahmoud reporting for Al Jazeera from Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, tells the news network: Since this morning, we\u2019ve been seeing funeral after funeral in the halls of the hospital. And there are more bodies still in the morgue as officials are waiting for family members to arrive and take them for burial. Additionally, more shelters have been attacked by Israel, deepening the trauma as it plays out this psychological warfare. The Palestinians\u2019 sense of safety is shattered by these attacks. Al Jazeera has been banned from operating inside Israel by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, which has also raided and closed the network\u2019s officie in the Israeli-occupied West Bank city of Ramallah. There are multiple unconfirmed reports of explosions being heard in Damascus in Syria. More details soon \u2026 Our video team have put together this report on Israel\u2019s attack against the Houthi-controlled Yemeni Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. Israel\u2019s military has stated on its official Telegram channel that in the last hour about 35 projectiles have crossed into northern Israel from Lebanon. It said \u201cseveral projectiles were intercepted and the rest fell in open areas\u201d. There are no reports of any casualties. There are media reports that Hezbollah deputy secretary-general, Naim Qassem, will be giving a speech at noon local time (9am GMT). More details soon \u2026 Iran will not leave any of \u201cthe criminal acts\u201d of Israel unanswered, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a weekly news conference on Monday, Reuters reports. In other Iranian reaction, the Tasnim news agency quotes head of the Iranian government information council, Elias Hazrati, saying: We will show the defeat of Israel to the people of the world. The experience of the past several decades shows that the page will return. Hezbollah\u2019s foundations are so strong that there is no possibility of disruption on its path. Hezbollah has kicked Israel out of Lebanon many times. A terrorist who should have been arrested is now ordering assassinations from the United Nation. Hezbollah has not used its weapons and now it must start. The Islamic Republic of Iran stands by the people of Lebanon and Hezbollah, and we use all our capacity to help Hezbollah and the people of Lebanon. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Lebanon over the news wires. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is convening an extraordinary informal meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday to discuss the EU\u2019s response to the latest escalation in Lebanon, Rueters reports an EU spokesperson said on Monday. Here is the latest round-up of news from the Middle East crisis from my colleague Peter Beaumont: Israel\u2019s rapidly expanding war on multiple fronts saw it strike central Beirut for the first time since 2006 early on Monday, after heavy Israeli air strikes involving dozens of aircraft bombed Yemen hours earlier in a long range raid. The latest strike came as the UN reported some 100,000 people had fled Lebanon for Syria since the latest escalation in the war and as CNN quoted an unnamed figure in the Biden administration saying that the US has changed it military posture in the Middle East amid concerns Iran might attack Israel in response for Israel\u2019s assassination of Hezbollah\u2019s ling time leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. The Beirut strike targeted three senior figures in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a group associated with a series of high profile aircraft hijackings in the 1970s. The left wing faction, which has not played a significant role in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Shiite militant group Hezbollah, said that its military and security commanders in Lebanon, and a third member, were killed in the attack. Israeli strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, and elsewhere continued on Monday as the Palestinian militant group Hamas said its leader in Lebanon was killed Monday in a strike on the country\u2019s south. Monday\u2019s airstrike comes after Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 105 people had been killed and another 359 injured by Israeli strikes across the country on Sunday. More than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, it said, without saying how many were civilians. The government said a million people \u2013 a fifth of the population \u2013 have fled their homes. Here is the video clip of US president Joe Biden saying \u201ca broader war in the Middle East had to be averted\u201d. Despite diplomatic efforts the US, Egypt and Qatar have been unable to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire in Gaza since the 2023 deal ended ten months ago on 30 November. Itay Blumental, who is military correspondent at Israel\u2019s Channel 11, reports on social media that the UAV intercepted earlier by Israel\u2019s military was targeted at infrastructure in the Karish gas field out at sea. Israel\u2019s military has also issued a video which it says shows the interception. The Karish gas field belongs to Israel as part of a deal brokered with Lebanon over disputed waters in 2022. Reuters and Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency are both also reporting an Israeli strike on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Since Israel stepped up its campaign in its north in the past two weeks, more than 1,000 Lebanese people have been killed and 6,000 wounded. Lebanon\u2019s government has said a million people \u2013 a fifth of the population \u2013 have fled their homes. About 60,000 people in northern Israel have been forced to evacuate due to Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli forces launchiung rockets into the north of the country. There are unconfirmed media reports, including from Israeli army radio, that Israel has again struck at the southern suburbs of Beirut in Lebanon. More details soon \u2026 Israel\u2019s military has reported on its official Telegram channel that it intercepted a UAV that had crossed into Israel\u2019s territorial water in the north. The claim has not been independently verified. Israeli media outlet Haaretz reports that families of those being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas have gathered to protest in Jerusalem outside the residence of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for a ceasefire deal and their release. On 7 October 2023 about 250 people were seized in southern Israel and taken hostage. Nearly a year later, Israeli authorities believe that about 100 of them are still in captivity in Gaza. Hamas said on Monday that its leader in Lebanon had been killed in an airstrike in the country\u2019s south, as official media reported a strike on a Palestinian refugee camp. \u201cFatah Sharif Abu al-Amine, the leader of Hamas \u2026 in Lebanon and member of the movement\u2019s leadership abroad\u201d was killed in a strike on his \u201chome in the Al-Bass camp in south Lebanon\u201d, a Hamas statement said. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reported an airstrike on the camp near the southern city of Tyre. A Palestinian militant group said three of its leaders were killed in an Israeli attack on central Beirut early on Monday, in what would be the first time Israel\u2019s military had struck the centre of Lebanon\u2019s capital city since 2006. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a militant group taking part in the fight against Israel, said three senior figures were killed in the Beirut attack, with initial footage from the scene showing two storeys of an apartment building completely blown out, and onlookers running towards the building. Two bodies could be seen lying on the street atop a car outside the building, seemingly ejected by the force of the blast. The sound of the explosion was heard around the city. There was no immediate comment from Israel\u2019s military. The Beirut strike, carried out using a drone, according to one source quoted by Agence France-Presse, hit near the Kola intersection, a popular reference point in the city, where taxis and buses gather to pick up passengers. A hundred munitions \u2013 including, it is believed, US-made 2,000lb bombs \u2013 were used by the Israeli air force in Friday evening\u2019s overwhelming air raid that killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an underground complex hidden in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieh. Nasrallah, who was careful to the point of paranoia about his security arrangements and only rarely appeared in public, would have given little notice of his plan to undertake the fateful trip to the meeting. But the intelligence penetration of Hezbollah was so deep that Israel knew Nasrallah and other surviving members of Hezbollah\u2019s already decimated leadership would be meeting at the supposedly secret location \u2013 and that an order to bomb them could be given. Benjamin Netanyahu was required to give permission to undertake the attack from New York, where the Israeli prime minister had given a bellicose speech at the UN general assembly. There was, presumably, felt to be little time to wait. According to an unsubstantiated report in the French newspaper Le Parisien, the mole who informed the Israelis that Nasrallah was on his way to the bunker was Iranian. If true, it would be eye-catching, given that Iran is Hezbollah\u2019s principal backer. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Palestinian militant group Hamas has said that its leader in Lebanon, Fateh Sherif Abu el-Amin, was killed along with some of his family members in an Israeli strike in the south of the country. It comes as another Palestinian group announced that three of its leaders were killed in an Israeli strike on central Beirut, which if confirmed would be the first attack within the Lebanese capital\u2019s city limits since 2006. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the three leaders were killed in a strike that targeted Beirut\u2019s Kola district. The strike hit the upper floor of an apartment building in the Kola district of Lebanon\u2019s capital, Reuters witnesses said. There was no immediate comment from Israel\u2019s military. More on that in a moment, first here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s other main events. More than 100 people were killed across Lebanon by Israeli strikes on Sunday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. It said more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said a million people \u2013 a fifth of the population \u2013 have fled their homes. Israel said it bombed Houthi targets in Yemen on Sunday. The airstrikes on Yemen\u2019s port of Hodeidah were a response to Houthi missile attacks on Israel in recent days, Israel said. The Houthi-run health ministry said at least four people were killed and 29 wounded. Images from Hodeidah showed parts of the city covered in a massive pall of dust, and towering explosions in the distance. Hezbollah confirmed that Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of the militant group\u2019s central council, was killed on Saturday, making him the seventh senior Hezbollah leader slain in Israeli strikes in a little over a week. The group also confirmed that Ali Karaki, another senior commander, died in the airstrike on Friday strike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah denied claims that Abu Ali Rida, the commander of the group\u2019s Bader Unit in south Lebanon had been killed. Rida is the last remaining senior military commander of Hezbollah that remains alive. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Israel\u2019s airstrikes in Lebanon had \u201cwiped out\u201d Hezbollah\u2019s command structure, but he warned the group will work quickly to rebuild it. President Joe Biden said Sunday he would speak soon with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and believes that an all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided. Israel on Sunday vowed to keep up its assault. \u201cWe need to keep hitting Hezbollah hard,\u201d Israel\u2019s military chief of staff Herzi Halevi said. Israel\u2019s military said it struck dozens of targets in Lebanon including launchers and weapons stores and had intercepted eight projectiles coming from the direction of Lebanon and one from the Red Sea. It also said dozens of Israeli aircraft had attacked power plants and Ras Issa and Hodeidah ports in Yemen, accusing the Houthis of operating under Iran\u2019s direction and in cooperation with Iraqi militias. The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has broken his silence on Israel\u2019s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah. On Sunday, Syria\u2019s state-run outlet Sana quoted Assad as saying: \u201cWe are certain that the Lebanese national resistance will continue on the path of struggle and justice in the face of the occupation, and will continue to support the Palestinian people in their struggle for their just cause.\u201d Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian said Israel should not be allowed to attack countries in the Iran-aligned \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d one after the other. Pezeshkian, in comments carried by state media, said Lebanon should be supported. An Iranian Revolutionary Guards deputy commander, Abbas Nilforoushan, was also killed in the attack that killed Nasrallah in Beirut. Pezeshkian said \u201cwe cannot accept such actions and they will not be left unanswered. A decisive reaction is necessary.\u201d Saudi Arabia has stressed the \u201cneed to preserve Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. In a statement released on Sunday amid Israel\u2019s deadly airstrikes, the Saudi foreign ministry said it was \u201cfollowing with great concern the developments taking place in Lebanon\u201d. Israeli opposition lawmaker Gideon Saar rejoined Netanyahu\u2019s government on Sunday, a step that is likely to strengthen the Israeli prime minister politically. Saar, who has been one of Netanyahu\u2019s most vocal critics in the past few years, is due to serve as a minister without a portfolio and have a seat in the prime minister\u2019s security cabinet, Israeli media reported. Expanding the government to include Saar\u2019s strengthens Netanyahu by making him less reliant on other members of his ruling coalition, which has been struggling in the polls.",

In the speech to about 3,000 Chinese Communist party (CCP) members and foreign dignitaries on Monday, the eve of China\u2019s national day, Xi praised China\u2019s advancement since Communist forces ousted the Nationalist government and established the PRC. Xi, head of China\u2019s ruling CCP, said \u201cno difficulties can stop the Chinese people from moving forward\u201d but called on the population to be \u201cvigilant\u201d, prepare for danger, and rely on the party and its army ahead of tough times. \u201cThe road ahead will not be smooth, there will definitely be difficulties and obstacles, and we may encounter major tests such as high winds and rough seas, or even stormy waves,\u201d said Xi, who has tightened control over the CCP and Chinese people during his rule. China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy and second most populous nation but has struggled to bounce back after the Covid-19 pandemic and major issues in its housing sector \u2013 two of the biggest drivers of an economic downturn that is also affected by an ageing population and low consumer spending. In recent weeks the government has announced a raft of measures to boost the economy, including lowering interest rates and raising the retirement age, but analysts have warned it may not be enough. It is also engaged in territorial disputes with neighbours including the Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan that are significant drivers of ongoing hostilities with the US \u2013 a major supporter of all three.

Taiwan is boosting domestic defences in preparation for a potential attack. The US is a major weapons supplier to Taiwan, under US legislation requiring it to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. On Sunday the US government approved the biggest military sales package to date: US$567m worth of weapons, training, and logistics support. In response, China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs accused the US of \u201cconniving\u201d and \u201cemboldening\u201d secessionist forces, undermining peace and stability in the region, and warned its support would \u201cbackfire\u201d. \u201cNo matter how many weapons the US provides to the Taiwan region, it will never weaken our firm will in opposing \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 and safeguarding China\u2019s national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d a spokesman said. The banquet where Xi spoke was one of few events marking the 75th anniversary. Tuesday was a surprisingly muted affair marked in Beijing only by a flag raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square. Past milestone years have seen opulent ceremonies and big military parades. Chinese state media headlines ran Xi\u2019s speech prominently, but focused mostly on the positive elements, lauding China\u2019s achievements under CCP rule. Coverage was otherwise muted compared to past years, a likely signal that the authorities are avoiding ostentatious displays while Chinese people are under financial strain. By contrast, Hong Kong is reportedly expected to hold a record number of events, overseen by thousands of police. In the wake of the 2019 pro-democracy protest and government crackdown, Hong Kong has become increasingly controlled by and aligned with the CCP. An electoral overhaul has ensured only pro-Beijing \u201cpatriots\u201d can sit in the legislature, and national security legislation has effectively banned public forms of dissent.

Anderson has committed the ABC to accept in principle all 15 recommendations made in the Listen Loudly, Act Strongly review, led by Indigenous lawyer Dr Terri Janke, a Wuthathi, Yadhaighana and Meriam woman. \u201cOn behalf of everyone at the ABC, I am sorry for any and all racist behaviour and past harms experienced by our Indigenous and Cald [Culturally and Linguistically Diverse] employees, either currently or formerly employed,\u201d the outgoing managing director said. \u201cWe all need to do better for our colleagues on our commitment to zero tolerance for racism in our workplace. \u201cWe all need to do better for our colleagues by preventing or acting on behaviour that seeks to discriminate against, bully or demean them. \u201cWe all need to do better for our colleagues by remaining vigilant against racism or discrimination of any kind in our workplace.\u201d Janke\u2019s team spoke to 120 participants comprising current and former ABC staff to hear their experiences of racism at work. Only one participant said they had not personally experienced racism within the ABC. The review was sparked in part by the treatment of broadcaster Stan Grant who faced racist attacks on social media fuelled by a \u201crelentless campaign\u201d against the ABC\u2019s coronation broadcast from News Corp. The ABC was criticised for hosting a panel discussion with Grant about the impact of colonialism on Indigenous Australians and the relevance of the monarchy in 2023. Grant targeted ABC management itself for a lack of support and accused the rightwing media of telling lies and distorting his words about the coronation. The ABC\u2019s news director, Justin Stevens, said last year he regretted not defending Grant earlier. The report details anonymised examples of overt and covert racism. Overt examples include racial slurs; offensive comments about a person\u2019s appearance; excluding staff from workplace opportunities and mistaking someone for a more junior person based on their racial appearance. Some of the covert examples include stereotyping, assumptions and unconscious bias; a lack of opportunity and reporters not being considered to be impartial in reporting on a cultural group because they were perceived to be from that cultural group. \u201cIt is important that the lens of lived experience be valued in story-telling \u2013 seen as a strength, not a deficit, and that people of all backgrounds feel safe to tell stories at the ABC,\u201d the report said. Many First Nations and culturally diverse current and former staff said senior management had failed to back them in the same way as they had supported Anglo staff. \u201cMany participants described being targeted by other media organisations or individuals on their social media accounts,\u201d the report said. \u201cSuch attacks included racial commentary, and was often used to bring the objectivity or impartiality of the staff member into question.\u201d A common complaint was that non-Anglo staff were referred to as \u201cdiversity hires\u201d. \u201cWe emphasise that the majority of participants expressed significant hurt, helplessness and exhaustion around their experiences in the workplace,\u201d the report said. \u201cThese experiences present barriers to staff for career progression. Cumulatively, these experiences have a profound impact on the self-esteem, and sense of self-worth for participants. This impacts entire lives \u2013 not just in the workplace.\u201d Janke found the broadcaster had introduced measures to address racism in the workplace in recent years, but the implementation of these strategies has been inconsistent. Among the recommendations made by Janke is that the ABC improve its responses to public attacks, whether they come from external media, individuals or on social media. The corporation has also been asked to enhance its understanding of how lived experience shapes story-telling and to improve representation of people who are First Nations and Cald on the board and senior leadership team. Cultural, linguistic and socio-economic diversity could be improved if the ABC establishes voice coaching protocols to ensure staff feel safe using their authentic voices. Some participants reported that having a \u201cnon-Australian\u201d voice was career limiting but they had been denied voice coaching by management. They were told, or it was implied, they could not be on air with a \u201cnon-Australian\u201d accent, which had a significant impact on their self esteem.

Airstrikes continued in Beirut and in at least 10 locations across the south of the country, according to Lebanon\u2019s state news agency.</p> \n<p>The Israeli military declared areas of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel a closed military zone.</p> \n<p>The US president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>, said earlier he was aware of Israel\u2019s plans to launch an operation into Lebanon as he urged against such a move. \u201cI\u2019m more aware than you might know and I\u2019m comfortable with them stopping,\u201d he told reporters at the White House when asked if he was comfortable with Israeli plans for a cross-border incursion. \u201cWe should have a ceasefire now.\u201d</p> \n<p>The towns of Marjayoun, Wazzani and Khiam \u2013 which sit in a series of interlocking valleys overlooked by steep slopes \u2013 were being shelled on Monday night.</p> \n<p>One resident in Marjayoun said that a local official had received a phone call ordering residents to evacuate but shelling had started before people could leave the town. \u201cThey called the mukhtar of Marjayoun, and told us we needed to evacuate. But we can\u2019t move, the roads are filled with shelling and airstrikes,\u201d the resident said.</p> \n<p>An hour later, the road leading out of Marjayoun was hit by an Israeli airstrike and rendered inoperable, Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reported.</p> \n<p>The area, with its scattered villages, and scrubby landscape hiding bunkers and combat tunnels, has long been a base for Hezbollah fighters and was heavily fought over during the last war between Israel and Hezbollah 18 years ago.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah said in a statement that it had targeted a group of Israeli soldiers who were in the \u201corchard\u201d near <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/20/inside-a-lebanese-village-where-war-with-israel-has-already-arrived\">the Lebanese border towns of Odaisseh and Kafr Kila</a>, \u201cachieving confirmed casualties\u201d. Kafr Kila is one of the towns that borders the area that Israel declared a closed military zone on Monday.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Lebanese army said it was \u201crepositioning and regrouping forces\u201d amid reports it had withdrawn three miles from the country\u2019s southern border. Lebanon\u2019s army has historically stayed on the sidelines of major conflicts with Israel, and in the past year of hostilities has not fired on the Israeli military.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, reports emerged of US concern about Israel\u2019s exit strategy in the wake of the ground operations. Jacob Magid, the Times of Israel US bureau chief, reported concern from the White House that the \u201cIDF will get bogged down in the country or be drawn to expand the mission once it\u2019s already in motion.\u201d</p> \n<p>Magid reports that a US official pointed to Israel\u2019s 1982 invasion of Lebanon which was characterised as a \u201climited incursion, but it turned into an 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon\u201d.</p> \n<p>Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat and critic of Benjamin Netanyahu, warned that any ground incursion could lead to the kind of deadly mission creep that had characterised the previous operations of 1982 \u2013 which helped spark the creation of Hezbollah and led to a 15-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon \u2013 and 2006.</p> \n<p>Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said on Sunday that more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said 1 million people \u2013 a fifth of the population \u2013 have fled their homes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli military has begun a \u201climited, localised and targeted\u201d ground operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, it has said, as it continued shelling areas close to the border and carrying out airstrikes on the capital, Beirut. \u201cThe IDF [Israel Defense Forces] began limited, localised, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon,\u201d the military said in a statement on X early on Tuesday. \u201cThese targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel,\u201d it continued, adding: \u201cOperation \u2018Northern Arrows\u2019 will continue according to the situational assessment and in parallel to combat in Gaza and in other arenas.\u201d Lebanese media reported one strike targeted a building in Ain al-Hilweh refugee Palestinian camp near the southern city of Sidon early on Tuesday, with Al Jazeera reporting multiple casualties. Israel is yet to comment on the attack. Israeli media is reporting that Mounir Maqdah, who is reportedly a commander in the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the purported target of the strike, was injured in the attack. If confirmed, it marked the first strike on the overcrowded camp, Lebanon\u2019s largest of several Palestinian camps, since hostilities broke out nearly a year ago. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed by an Israeli strike on Beirut on Friday, dealing a heavy blow to the militant group and raising fears that Israel might be preparing for a ground offensive in Lebanon, and that conflict could spread across the Middle East. That followed two weeks of strikes which began with the deadly explosion of pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members that killed dozens of people and injured thousands. Israel has since continued pounding Beirut and also launched strikes on Yemen and Syria. Syria\u2019s official news agency Sana said early on Tuesday the country\u2019s air defence systems had intercepted three rounds of strikes in the Damascus area. State television said its news anchor, Safaa Ahmad, was killed \u201cin the Israeli aggression\u201d on Damascus, while Sana reported three civilians killed and nine others wounded. It was not clear if Ahmad was counted among the three and the reports could not be verified independently. Tuesday\u2019s statement from the IDF followed Israeli media reports that the country\u2019s cabinet had approved the next stage of its operation in Lebanon after a meeting chaired by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin later said he had spoken with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, and that the pair had \u201cagreed on the necessity of dismantling [Hezbollah\u2019s] attack infrastructure along the border\u201d. He also said the US was \u201cwell postured\u201d to defend US personnel and allies and warned of \u201cserious consequences for Iran\u201d in the event of a direct attack on Israel, while also adding that \u201cI reaffirmed that a diplomatic resolution is required to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border\u201d. Early on Tuesday, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said at least 95 people had been killed and 172 wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon\u2019s southern regions, the eastern Bekaa Valley, and Beirut in the past 24 hours. Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader, Naim Qassem, in a first public speech on Monday since Nasrallah\u2019s death, said that \u201cthe resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement\u201d. \u201cWe know that the battle may be long. We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006,\u201d he said, referring to the 2006 war. Heavy shelling into Lebanon was taking place along the boundary in the area north of Kiryat Shmona, in an area where Israeli armour and infantry advanced into Lebanon during the 2006 war. Airstrikes continued in Beirut and in at least 10 locations across the south of the country, according to Lebanon\u2019s state news agency. The Israeli military declared areas of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel a closed military zone. The US president, Joe Biden, said earlier he was aware of Israel\u2019s plans to launch an operation into Lebanon as he urged against such a move. \u201cI\u2019m more aware than you might know and I\u2019m comfortable with them stopping,\u201d he told reporters at the White House when asked if he was comfortable with Israeli plans for a cross-border incursion. \u201cWe should have a ceasefire now.\u201d The towns of Marjayoun, Wazzani and Khiam \u2013 which sit in a series of interlocking valleys overlooked by steep slopes \u2013 were being shelled on Monday night. One resident in Marjayoun said that a local official had received a phone call ordering residents to evacuate but shelling had started before people could leave the town. \u201cThey called the mukhtar of Marjayoun, and told us we needed to evacuate. But we can\u2019t move, the roads are filled with shelling and airstrikes,\u201d the resident said. An hour later, the road leading out of Marjayoun was hit by an Israeli airstrike and rendered inoperable, Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reported. The area, with its scattered villages, and scrubby landscape hiding bunkers and combat tunnels, has long been a base for Hezbollah fighters and was heavily fought over during the last war between Israel and Hezbollah 18 years ago. Hezbollah said in a statement that it had targeted a group of Israeli soldiers who were in the \u201corchard\u201d near the Lebanese border towns of Odaisseh and Kafr Kila, \u201cachieving confirmed casualties\u201d. Kafr Kila is one of the towns that borders the area that Israel declared a closed military zone on Monday. Meanwhile, the Lebanese army said it was \u201crepositioning and regrouping forces\u201d amid reports it had withdrawn three miles from the country\u2019s southern border. Lebanon\u2019s army has historically stayed on the sidelines of major conflicts with Israel, and in the past year of hostilities has not fired on the Israeli military. On Tuesday, reports emerged of US concern about Israel\u2019s exit strategy in the wake of the ground operations. Jacob Magid, the Times of Israel US bureau chief, reported concern from the White House that the \u201cIDF will get bogged down in the country or be drawn to expand the mission once it\u2019s already in motion.\u201d Magid reports that a US official pointed to Israel\u2019s 1982 invasion of Lebanon which was characterised as a \u201climited incursion, but it turned into an 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon\u201d. Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat and critic of Benjamin Netanyahu, warned that any ground incursion could lead to the kind of deadly mission creep that had characterised the previous operations of 1982 \u2013 which helped spark the creation of Hezbollah and led to a 15-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon \u2013 and 2006. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said on Sunday that more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said 1 million people \u2013 a fifth of the population \u2013 have fled their homes.",

There are fringe meetings with titles such as <a href=\"https://public.conservatives.com/static/documents/conference/2024/CPC24_Handbook-v3.pdf\">What went wrong? An election postmortem</a>, where the pollster and 2019 manifesto author Rachel Wolf bravely said: \u201cWe are loathed. Don\u2019t underestimate the mountain to be climbed.\u201d A devastating <a href=\"https://www.ukonward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Onward-Breaking-Blue-General-Election-2024-3.pdf\">report</a> from the thinktank Onward warns that \u201cthe party could easily disappear\u201d. But as the politics professor Tim Bale <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2024/09/26/tim-bale-labour-is-struggling-but-there-are-four-reasons-conservatives-cannot-be-complacent/\">says</a>, there\u2019s an \u201ceerily familiar conviction\u201d that it is still Britain\u2019s \u201cnatural party of government\u201d.</p> <p>Yes, they messed up, they all agree. Bad things happened, from Boris Johnson and Partygate to Truss ramping up everyone\u2019s mortgage repayments. The campaign was a mistimed catastrophe, with Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/07/rishi-sunak-says-sorry-for-leaving-d-day-event-early-to-record-tv-interview\">flight from the D-day event</a> and police investigating Tory MPs for election date bets with inside information. Yes, that 24% vote was their worst defeat ever. And so on. Yet on they go with their tug of war between the right \u2013 seeking northern \u201cred wall\u201d votes that were lost to Reform UK \u2013 and the others \u2013 pursuing those southern votes lost to the Lib Dems.</p> <p>They don\u2019t, can\u2019t, maybe never will understand that their crisis is far more frighteningly profound. The fundamental tenets of everything Conservatives believe are now so rebarbative that whenever they open their mouths, out jump frogs that scare most people.</p> <p>The wonder is why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/29/what-are-the-four-candidates-pitches-to-become-next-tory-leader\">four contenders</a> for the leadership want this most fragile of crowns. Any opinion they proffer beyond the ineffably banal is a gaffe, exposing how toxic Tory views have become.</p> <p>Take the small state, the Conservatives\u2019 foundational creed: less government, less regulation, keep more of your own money, step away and leave it all to individual responsibility. But this party is light years from understanding how its austerity experiment killed off growth, causing higher costs and higher taxes. That won\u2019t be forgotten or forgiven. Everyone sees denuded public services, a \u201cbroken\u201d NHS, schools stripped of arts and sports, terrible transport, a crisis in housing, the courts, police and prisons, and rising poverty. Yet the Conservatives still can\u2019t hear the great majority out there who want more government \u2013 a lot more of it. They want good public services that are fully functioning and safe. Listen out for the Tories\u2019 new euphemism: \u201cstreamlined government\u201d.</p> <p>Can tax cuts save them? Mel Stride from one platform bemoaned bleakly: \u201cWe offered a huge \u00a318bn in tax cuts. \u00a318bn!\u201d But it doesn\u2019t work any more. People have rumbled that tax is the necessary price for good services.</p> <p>This pivot towards social democratic thinking came from the deep shock of the pandemic. Even a rightwing Conservative government, against all its instincts, had to protect lives and livelihoods. Only the state guarded against death and destitution. Why does the right constantly replay and writhe over the memory of the pandemic, claiming that masks, isolation and furlough were too drastic and costly? It\u2019s because they know that was a national psychological turning point. The nanny state saved us. \u201cCovid reset what the public believes the state should do,\u201d says YouGov\u2019s Patrick English. \u201cBut the Conservatives don\u2019t want the conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Any Tory calling for a shrunken state will have to tell us what, exactly, they will do less of. Kemi Badenoch fell straight into that trap when she suggested that maternity pay was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/29/maternity-pay-is-excessive-says-tory-leadership-hopeful-kemi-badenoch\">excessive</a>\u201d (it\u2019s among the lowest in the OECD). She rambled into a no-go zone when <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/bc40a612-49df-49fc-b6d6-28786f0a3c1b?shareToken=9d16e8ae773141058ff00f7429c7a0c6\">musing that in the future</a>, NHS reform might mean charging: \u201cI don\u2019t think we are ready for changing the principle of free at the point of use, certainly not immediately.\u201d Not now, not ever. As Labour discovered the hard way, no cuts are currently tolerable. Not even the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance. Not even when the outgoing Spectator editor\u2019s millionaire friend <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/reeves-is-right-to-cut-the-winter-fuel-bung/\">boasts of spending his</a> on an exceptional bottle of wine once a year. </p> <p>What\u2019s left of Conservatism when its signature privatisations of rail, mail, water, social care and council housing have collapsed into spectacular unpopularity? The war on regulationended in tragedy at Grenfell. Brexit will increasingly be seen as a bizarre act of national sabotage. Daring to admit it would signal a start to recovery, but don\u2019t hold your breath. The longer the Tories cling to it, the less the young people they inflicted it on will vote for them: the party came fourth among the under 40s, Stride warns, and first only among those older than 64.</p> <p>The leadership contenders fight over things such as the European court of human rights that the public cares little about. On the right, Danny Kruger (a Jenrickite) told one meeting: \u201cWe need to win the culture war.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/our-work/research/backfire-culture-wars-and-the-general-election/\">More in Common polling</a> shows overwhelming public non-interest in that stuff. On the left, in the beleaguered One Nation caucus, only four MPs attended to hear Tom Tugendhat introduced as \u201cthe next prime minister of the most successful party in the world\u201d, to declare \u2013 well, nothing much.</p> <p>Meanwhile, influencers of the right encourage the hallucinations. As Paul Marshall, a major investor in GB News, swallows up the Spectator, <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2024/09/26/tim-bale-labour-is-struggling-but-there-are-four-reasons-conservatives-cannot-be-complacent/\">Bale warns them</a> all of \u201ca media and thinktank milieu whose concerns and preconceptions bear far too little relation to those of the average Brit\u201d. Immigration matters to all parties, but it\u2019s only the vote-decider for Reform UK voters.</p> <p>The Tories\u2019 Cassandra, Theresa May, who once warned that some people saw them as the \u201cnasty party\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/28/tories-too-focused-reform-lib-dem-threat-theresa-may\">warns</a> that \u201cwe lost because we had trashed our brand\u201d while \u201cdancing to the tune\u201d of Nigel Farage. But no one listens to Cassandra. The Tories\u2019 only hope is that whoever wins has been lying through their teeth to their tiny reactionary electorate, and afterwards emerges with something \u2013 anything \u2013 new to say.</p> <p>Right now, this party draws its false comfort from gloating over Labour\u2019s early missteps. Look, the old pendulum will swing back, they say. See how hard Labour is finding government! Their comfort zone cossets them. It tells them that if they just wait for Labour to fail, all will be well. Hasta la vista. But maybe not.</p> <ul> <li><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Don\u2019t underestimate the mountain to be climbed.\u201d A devastating report from the thinktank Onward warns that \u201cthe party could easily disappear\u201d. But as the politics professor Tim Bale says, there\u2019s an \u201ceerily familiar conviction\u201d that it is still Britain\u2019s \u201cnatural party of government\u201d. Yes, they messed up, they all agree. Bad things happened, from Boris Johnson and Partygate to Truss ramping up everyone\u2019s mortgage repayments. The campaign was a mistimed catastrophe, with Sunak\u2019s flight from the D-day event and police investigating Tory MPs for election date bets with inside information. Yes, that 24% vote was their worst defeat ever. And so on. Yet on they go with their tug of war between the right \u2013 seeking northern \u201cred wall\u201d votes that were lost to Reform UK \u2013 and the others \u2013 pursuing those southern votes lost to the Lib Dems. They don\u2019t, can\u2019t, maybe never will understand that their crisis is far more frighteningly profound. The fundamental tenets of everything Conservatives believe are now so rebarbative that whenever they open their mouths, out jump frogs that scare most people. The wonder is why the four contenders for the leadership want this most fragile of crowns. Any opinion they proffer beyond the ineffably banal is a gaffe, exposing how toxic Tory views have become. Take the small state, the Conservatives\u2019 foundational creed: less government, less regulation, keep more of your own money, step away and leave it all to individual responsibility. But this party is light years from understanding how its austerity experiment killed off growth, causing higher costs and higher taxes. That won\u2019t be forgotten or forgiven. Everyone sees denuded public services, a \u201cbroken\u201d NHS, schools stripped of arts and sports, terrible transport, a crisis in housing, the courts, police and prisons, and rising poverty. Yet the Conservatives still can\u2019t hear the great majority out there who want more government \u2013 a lot more of it. They want good public services that are fully functioning and safe. Listen out for the Tories\u2019 new euphemism: \u201cstreamlined government\u201d. Can tax cuts save them? Mel Stride from one platform bemoaned bleakly: \u201cWe offered a huge \u00a318bn in tax cuts. \u00a318bn!\u201d But it doesn\u2019t work any more. People have rumbled that tax is the necessary price for good services. This pivot towards social democratic thinking came from the deep shock of the pandemic. Even a rightwing Conservative government, against all its instincts, had to protect lives and livelihoods. Only the state guarded against death and destitution. Why does the right constantly replay and writhe over the memory of the pandemic, claiming that masks, isolation and furlough were too drastic and costly? It\u2019s because they know that was a national psychological turning point. The nanny state saved us. \u201cCovid reset what the public believes the state should do,\u201d says YouGov\u2019s Patrick English. \u201cBut the Conservatives don\u2019t want the conversation.\u201d Any Tory calling for a shrunken state will have to tell us what, exactly, they will do less of. Kemi Badenoch fell straight into that trap when she suggested that maternity pay was \u201cexcessive\u201d (it\u2019s among the lowest in the OECD). She rambled into a no-go zone when musing that in the future, NHS reform might mean charging: \u201cI don\u2019t think we are ready for changing the principle of free at the point of use, certainly not immediately.\u201d Not now, not ever. As Labour discovered the hard way, no cuts are currently tolerable. Not even the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance. Not even when the outgoing Spectator editor\u2019s millionaire friend boasts of spending his on an exceptional bottle of wine once a year. What\u2019s left of Conservatism when its signature privatisations of rail, mail, water, social care and council housing have collapsed into spectacular unpopularity? The war on regulationended in tragedy at Grenfell. Brexit will increasingly be seen as a bizarre act of national sabotage. Daring to admit it would signal a start to recovery, but don\u2019t hold your breath. The longer the Tories cling to it, the less the young people they inflicted it on will vote for them: the party came fourth among the under 40s, Stride warns, and first only among those older than 64. The leadership contenders fight over things such as the European court of human rights that the public cares little about. On the right, Danny Kruger (a Jenrickite) told one meeting: \u201cWe need to win the culture war.\u201d More in Common polling shows overwhelming public non-interest in that stuff. On the left, in the beleaguered One Nation caucus, only four MPs attended to hear Tom Tugendhat introduced as \u201cthe next prime minister of the most successful party in the world\u201d, to declare \u2013 well, nothing much. Meanwhile, influencers of the right encourage the hallucinations. As Paul Marshall, a major investor in GB News, swallows up the Spectator, Bale warns them all of \u201ca media and thinktank milieu whose concerns and preconceptions bear far too little relation to those of the average Brit\u201d. Immigration matters to all parties, but it\u2019s only the vote-decider for Reform UK voters. The Tories\u2019 Cassandra, Theresa May, who once warned that some people saw them as the \u201cnasty party\u201d, warns that \u201cwe lost because we had trashed our brand\u201d while \u201cdancing to the tune\u201d of Nigel Farage. But no one listens to Cassandra. The Tories\u2019 only hope is that whoever wins has been lying through their teeth to their tiny reactionary electorate, and afterwards emerges with something \u2013 anything \u2013 new to say. Right now, this party draws its false comfort from gloating over Labour\u2019s early missteps. Look, the old pendulum will swing back, they say. See how hard Labour is finding government! Their comfort zone cossets them. It tells them that if they just wait for Labour to fail, all will be well. Hasta la vista. But maybe not. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

From a palm tree in Borneo that flowers underground to a Malagasy orchid that spends its life growing on other plants, researchers are still making dozens of new species discoveries every year. But with more than 100,000 plant species believed to be undiscovered, the majority of which are believed to be at risk of extinction, a new project led by Kew\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens is highlighting parts of the world where botanists should be concentrating their search. From Madagascar to Bolivia, scientists have identified the areas of plant diversity in an effort to turbocharge identification. The study, published in the journal New Phytologist, builds on analysis by researchers at Kew last year that found that three-quarters of all undescribed plant species were likely to be threatened with extinction. Scientists believe the unknown species could hold clues to future drug discoveries, fuels or other innovations. Prof Alexandre Antonelli, director of science at Kew and senior author of the paper, said the research was aimed at helping to better target conservation and speed up the rate of plant discoveries, warning that many species would become extinct before they were ever known to science at the current rate of identification. \u201cWe are protecting 30% of the planet by this decade under current UN targets \u2013 but we don\u2019t know which areas to protect unless we have the right information,\u201d Antonelli said. \u201cPrevious research has shown that biologists haven\u2019t been particularly efficient in documenting biodiversity.

      "body": "<p>Copenhagen is a gastronome\u2019s paradise. Stroll around the Danish capital\u2019s elegant boulevards and before long you\u2019re bound to stumble upon a hallowed, Michelin-starred temple of New Nordic cuisine. However, there\u2019s a cheaper and more convivial side to the city\u2019s culinary scene: its communal supper tables.</p> <p>Leading the way is the community centre <a href=\"https://absaloncph.dk/en/\">Absalon</a>, a former church in the smart Vesterbro neighbourhood. On a Sunday evening in September, the air buzzes with conversation and the clatter of cutlery as about 200 people tuck into bowls of steaming tomato lentil soup and piles of fried potatoes in a creamy fennel and chive sauce. This is the nightly <em>f\u00e6llesspisning</em> dinner (the Danish word loosely translates as communal dining), featuring long tables, shared by strangers. The menu changes daily to spotlight locally sourced ingredients made into affordable dishes that are served tableside by the guests themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>All around us, people are chatting away in English and Danish. Everyone is at ease, but I\u2019m fairly sure we\u2019re not the only tourists here</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m sharing with a group of Danish nurses who are in town to celebrate 40 years since they met as students. They ladle out bowls of soup and kindly insist on serving my son first \u2013 he is getting restless in his high chair \u2013 and pass down extra chunks of focaccia for him throughout the meal. All around us, people are chatting in English and Danish, and though everyone looks very at ease, I\u2019m fairly sure we\u2019re not the only tourists here. It\u2019s a pragmatic kind of welcome, with all diners expected to get stuck in: at the end of the meal, we all stack our plates neatly and file happily back over to the kitchen.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d says one of the nurses, Ivonne Christensen, when I ask what she and her friends enjoy about f\u00e6llesspisning. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to cook, you can come here when you\u2019re tired; it\u2019s easy.\u201d</p> <p>Crucially, it\u2019s also affordable. At Absalon dinner costs 60DKK (about \u00a36.75), or \u00a311.20 on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, when dessert is included. Children under three eat for free.</p> <p>\u201cThis is for everyone,\u201d says Lennart Lajboschitz, the founder of the Danish retail chain Flying Tiger, who launched Absalon in 2015 with the goal of bringing people together over food. \u201cIt\u2019s such a simple thing, but a very important thing.\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s accessible, Absalon strives to offer an interesting and elevated dining experience: recent chef-led creations have included creamed potatoes and braised chicken, as well as more international dishes such as coconut dal and cauliflower and chickpea korma. \u201cWe want it to be good quality,\u201d says Lajboschitz of the cuisine. \u201cPeople said, \u2018You can\u2019t do both, that\u2019s too cheap,\u2019 because prices are high in Denmark. But we do the magic.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It was communal dinners that provided the most interaction with Danes and a sense that we had scratched beneath the surface of the city</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lajboschitz also has two hotels in Copenhagen, including the upmarket waterside property <a href=\"https://kanalhusetcph.com/en/forside-english/\">Kanalhuset</a> \u2013 where a sophisticated f\u00e6llesspisning offering costs about \u00a317 \u2013 but variations on these communal suppers can be found at venues all over the city. At the supper club <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kafa-x/273482803282409\">Kafa-x</a>, weekly vegan or vegetarian dinners come with a suggested donation of 30krona (\u00a33.40), and guests are asked to wash their own plates and cutlery.</p> <p>Certain supper clubs are great for young children. At <a href=\"https://kube.frederiksberg.dk/\">Ku.Be</a>, a cultural centre in Frederiksberg, fortnightly f\u00e6llesspisning includes child-friendly versions of whatever\u2019s on the menu \u2013 which could be anything from spinach and ricotta dumplings to seafood or vegetarian paella. <a href=\"https://www.sendflerekrydderier.dk/\">Send Flere Krydderier</a> is a social enterprise that employs women of ethnic minority backgrounds and has two canteens in the N\u00f8rrebro area, and an onsite children\u2019s library, play area and sports hall at its <a href=\"https://www.sendflerekrydderier.dk/norrebrohallen/\">N\u00f8rrebrohallen</a> site \u2013 meaning younger diners have plenty of opportunity to burn off energy before or after the weekly communal dinners.</p>    <p>The Send Flere Krydderier vibe is noisy but relaxed: everyone is free to sit wherever they like, food is served from 5pm onwards and meals are collected from the counter when your number is called.

      "bodyText": "Copenhagen is a gastronome\u2019s paradise. Stroll around the Danish capital\u2019s elegant boulevards and before long you\u2019re bound to stumble upon a hallowed, Michelin-starred temple of New Nordic cuisine. However, there\u2019s a cheaper and more convivial side to the city\u2019s culinary scene: its communal supper tables. Leading the way is the community centre Absalon, a former church in the smart Vesterbro neighbourhood. On a Sunday evening in September, the air buzzes with conversation and the clatter of cutlery as about 200 people tuck into bowls of steaming tomato lentil soup and piles of fried potatoes in a creamy fennel and chive sauce. This is the nightly f\u00e6llesspisning dinner (the Danish word loosely translates as communal dining), featuring long tables, shared by strangers. The menu changes daily to spotlight locally sourced ingredients made into affordable dishes that are served tableside by the guests themselves. I\u2019m sharing with a group of Danish nurses who are in town to celebrate 40 years since they met as students. They ladle out bowls of soup and kindly insist on serving my son first \u2013 he is getting restless in his high chair \u2013 and pass down extra chunks of focaccia for him throughout the meal. All around us, people are chatting in English and Danish, and though everyone looks very at ease, I\u2019m fairly sure we\u2019re not the only tourists here. It\u2019s a pragmatic kind of welcome, with all diners expected to get stuck in: at the end of the meal, we all stack our plates neatly and file happily back over to the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d says one of the nurses, Ivonne Christensen, when I ask what she and her friends enjoy about f\u00e6llesspisning. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to cook, you can come here when you\u2019re tired; it\u2019s easy.\u201d Crucially, it\u2019s also affordable. At Absalon dinner costs 60DKK (about \u00a36.75), or \u00a311.20 on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, when dessert is included. Children under three eat for free. \u201cThis is for everyone,\u201d says Lennart Lajboschitz, the founder of the Danish retail chain Flying Tiger, who launched Absalon in 2015 with the goal of bringing people together over food. \u201cIt\u2019s such a simple thing, but a very important thing.\u201d Although it\u2019s accessible, Absalon strives to offer an interesting and elevated dining experience: recent chef-led creations have included creamed potatoes and braised chicken, as well as more international dishes such as coconut dal and cauliflower and chickpea korma. \u201cWe want it to be good quality,\u201d says Lajboschitz of the cuisine. \u201cPeople said, \u2018You can\u2019t do both, that\u2019s too cheap,\u2019 because prices are high in Denmark. But we do the magic.\u201d Lajboschitz also has two hotels in Copenhagen, including the upmarket waterside property Kanalhuset \u2013 where a sophisticated f\u00e6llesspisning offering costs about \u00a317 \u2013 but variations on these communal suppers can be found at venues all over the city. At the supper club Kafa-x, weekly vegan or vegetarian dinners come with a suggested donation of 30krona (\u00a33.40), and guests are asked to wash their own plates and cutlery. Certain supper clubs are great for young children. At Ku.Be, a cultural centre in Frederiksberg, fortnightly f\u00e6llesspisning includes child-friendly versions of whatever\u2019s on the menu \u2013 which could be anything from spinach and ricotta dumplings to seafood or vegetarian paella. Send Flere Krydderier is a social enterprise that employs women of ethnic minority backgrounds and has two canteens in the N\u00f8rrebro area, and an onsite children\u2019s library, play area and sports hall at its N\u00f8rrebrohallen site \u2013 meaning younger diners have plenty of opportunity to burn off energy before or after the weekly communal dinners. The Send Flere Krydderier vibe is noisy but relaxed: everyone is free to sit wherever they like, food is served from 5pm onwards and meals are collected from the counter when your number is called. The dishes are inspired by African and Middle Eastern cuisine \u2013 the name means Send More Spices, a reference to what women who arrived in Denmark in the 1980s and 90s would write in their letters to family in their home countries. On our visit, my son (who is under three, so eats free of charge again; adult portions are \u00a38 ) devours his baby portion of aubergine and chickpea curry and fresh scallion salad, before being set free to attempt to commandeer toys from his Danish peers. \u201cThese kinds of places are made for kids,\u201d says Eva Buchhave, a regular at Send Flere Krydderier since having her own child three years ago. \u201cRestaurants are expensive and not for screaming kids \u2013 and park picnics are off the agenda in cold winter months,\u201d she says. Indeed, despite visiting several parks \u2013 including the beautiful King\u2019s Garden \u2013 repeatedly during our trip, as well as the theme park Tivoli Gardens and the fabled food markets at Reffen and Broens Street Food, it was the communal dinners that provided the most interaction with Danes and a sense that we had scratched beneath the surface of the city\u2019s cool, calm and collected culture. F\u00e6llesspisning is, inherently, a welcoming tradition, but there\u2019s no denying that eating at a communal dinner requires a little more courage than frequenting restaurants staffed by polyglot waiters. At Absalon, an onstage host welcomes everyone to the meal and runs through the evening\u2019s dishes in English, but eating at other venues as a tourist necessitates more legwork, with many websites and online ticketing systems only available in Danish.

It\u2019s created by sound designer and composer Danny Krass and six writers including the late Oliver Emanuel.

Here in America In the context of today\u2019s \u201cparanoid, polarising politics\u201d, David Edgar has returned to 1950s America and a meeting between director Elia Kazan and playwright Arthur Miller as they choose different paths in the face of McCarthyism. James Dacre\u2019s production at the Orange Tree is available from 22-25 October. Buried Child A newspaper article about the accidental exhumation of a child\u2019s body in a back yard led Sam Shepard to write his darkly humorous 1979 Pulitzer winner. He revised it for different productions, including this 2016 revival starring Ed Harris, who said Shepard \u201cunderstood what a labyrinth the human psyche is\u201d. On BroadwayHD. Turn and Draw Theatres are creating increasingly sophisticated films to complement their stage productions, like this preview of Romeo and Juliet, to be produced next year by the Belgrade theatre, Bristol Old Vic and Hackney Empire. Corey Campbell\u2019s short, filmed in the grounds of Coventry cathedral, explodes into rap as the rapiers are drawn.

After he played the chauffeur Hoke opposite Angela Lansbury on stage, the pair reunited for an Audible version of Driving Miss Daisy. Underdog: The Other Other Bront\u00eb Are the Kardashians latterday Bront\u00eb sisters?

And that\u2019s a pity because it\u2019s important to have dissenting voices in the party,\u201d said Kay Andrews, a former probation service worker who was strolling through Canterbury centre. She and her partner, Nick \u2013 a retired headteacher \u2013 also noted how Duffield had opposed winter fuel allowance cuts and spoken out in support of the veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott.</p> <p>That said, they were on the fence as to whether they would vote in five years\u2019 time for Duffield. For now though, departure from Labour was continuing to make ripples at Westminster.</p>    <p>Asked by reporters about Duffield\u2019s weekend claim that Starmer has a \u201cproblem with women\u201d and is \u201cmore interested in greed and power\u201d than making changes to the country, a spokesperson for the prime minster responded with a blunt \u201cno\u201d.</p> <p>Among her constituents, there was evidence that such sentiment nevertheless had made an impact, alongside continuing anger at cuts to the winter fuel allowance for all but the poorest pensioners.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t be affected by it but there are obviously people who are struggling and I think it should have been left as it is,\u201d said John Rolph, who works in a charity shop in the city.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m honest, I never had an opinion of her as to whether or not she was a good or a bad MP but there will be a lot of people who probably agree broadly with what she has said. She\u2019s also had a go at Starmer over taking gifts and hospitality, which again doesn\u2019t look very good for him.\u201d</p>    <p>However, there was also no shortage of evidence that Duffield could well struggle to hold on to the seat she has held since 2017. In some ways, local views of the MP sometimes broke down along generational lines in a city where the presence of university students have been key to Labour\u2019s success.</p> <p>Now an independent, she is now the focus of speculation among some former Labour colleagues that she could ultimately jump ship for Reform UK. \u201cThat\u2019s the journey she seems to be on, and it would probably suit both,\u201d said one Labour MP. </p> <p>After a weekend media blitz, Duffield was not doing interviews, but told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m about as likely to join Reform as Jeremy Corbyn is.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Canterbury, a source in the city\u2019s Labour party said they felt let down and said that the 20,000 people who had voted for her three months ago had not wanted to send an independent back to parliament.</p>    <p>Those voters included Kate Tompsett, owner of the Happy and Glorious gift shop in the city centre. She said: \u201cThere was definitely a longing for change. I wanted to vote for the Green party but I was concerned it would split the vote and so I ended up supporting her, even if I disagree with her on other things.</p> <p>\u201cI think she also shouts very loudly about some of those things \u2013 to the extent that it perhaps drowns out the need to speak up on behalf of the city and its needs.\u201d</p> <p>Those \u201cthings\u201d included transgender rights. For long a high-profile gender-critical voice in the party, she has described receiving threats over her stance and has complained of receiving little support from the party leadership.</p> <p>This cut little ice, however, with younger Canterbury voters like Ethan Chuter, who said they would never vote for her again and who told of how their boyfriend, a trans person, had been \u201ccelebrating\u201d the news of Duffield\u2019s departure.</p> <p>\u201cI think support for trans rights is quite a big thing in our generation and shouldn\u2019t be underestimated,\u201d Chuter added.</p>    <p>Chuter\u2019s parter, Gon\u00e7alo Alves, said that their views of Duffield were \u201cmixed\u201d. \u201cAs a leftist, it\u2019s preferable to have a Labour MP. However, when following her on social media, expecting to see her talking about issues and policies regarding Canterbury, I was met with a large percentage of tweets being purely about transgender people.</p> <p>\u201cSo while as a constituent I\u2019m trying to do my part in keeping informed about the state of my city, I\u2019m instead being faced with a barrage of tweets that put in question the dignity and humanity of people like me.\u201d</p> <p>Such issues, while not front and centre, are likely to be integral to Duffield\u2019s future and that of who wins the seat at the next election.</p> <p>While Labour has benefited from an influx of new residents \u2013 young professionals priced out of the London housing market, attracted by affordable properties and the high-speed rail link \u2013 her Conservative opponents also pointed to tactical voting and Duffield\u2019s own personality.</p> <p>Re-elected in July with an increased majority \u2013 thanks in part to Reform UK eating into the Tory vote \u2013 Duffield\u2019s own political wanderings may yet not be at an end.</p>",

Those voters included Kate Tompsett, owner of the Happy and Glorious gift shop in the city centre. She said: \u201cThere was definitely a longing for change. I wanted to vote for the Green party but I was concerned it would split the vote and so I ended up supporting her, even if I disagree with her on other things. \u201cI think she also shouts very loudly about some of those things \u2013 to the extent that it perhaps drowns out the need to speak up on behalf of the city and its needs.\u201d Those \u201cthings\u201d included transgender rights. For long a high-profile gender-critical voice in the party, she has described receiving threats over her stance and has complained of receiving little support from the party leadership. This cut little ice, however, with younger Canterbury voters like Ethan Chuter, who said they would never vote for her again and who told of how their boyfriend, a trans person, had been \u201ccelebrating\u201d the news of Duffield\u2019s departure. \u201cI think support for trans rights is quite a big thing in our generation and shouldn\u2019t be underestimated,\u201d Chuter added. Chuter\u2019s parter, Gon\u00e7alo Alves, said that their views of Duffield were \u201cmixed\u201d. \u201cAs a leftist, it\u2019s preferable to have a Labour MP. However, when following her on social media, expecting to see her talking about issues and policies regarding Canterbury, I was met with a large percentage of tweets being purely about transgender people. \u201cSo while as a constituent I\u2019m trying to do my part in keeping informed about the state of my city, I\u2019m instead being faced with a barrage of tweets that put in question the dignity and humanity of people like me.\u201d Such issues, while not front and centre, are likely to be integral to Duffield\u2019s future and that of who wins the seat at the next election. While Labour has benefited from an influx of new residents \u2013 young professionals priced out of the London housing market, attracted by affordable properties and the high-speed rail link \u2013 her Conservative opponents also pointed to tactical voting and Duffield\u2019s own personality. Re-elected in July with an increased majority \u2013 thanks in part to Reform UK eating into the Tory vote \u2013 Duffield\u2019s own political wanderings may yet not be at an end.",

      "body": "<p>October marks the 10th anniversary of the murder of Claire Throssell\u2019s two sons, Jack and Paul, by their father. He had lured them to the attic with sweets and a new train set, then barricaded the house and started 14 fires. He\u2019d locked all the doors, secured the patio doors with a heavy bike lock and used chairs and mattresses as extra barriers to slow down firefighters.</p> <p>Jack and Paul, aged 12 and nine, hadn\u2019t wanted to visit their father, Darren Sykes. He had previously hit both them and their mum. He\u2019d made them eat until they were sick. He used to call them \u201cmummy\u2019s boys\u201d. Paul had explained all this to a worker at Cafcass (<a href=\"https://www.cafcass.gov.uk/about-us\">Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service</a>) in a formal interview. Throssell had said in an evidence statement that, when angry, Sykes was capable of hurting or killing the boys, that he had told her he intended to take his own life and that he could understand fathers killing their children. Still, contact was awarded to him.</p> <p>Ten years on \u2013 or, in her own words, \u201c10 years into my life sentence\u201d \u2013 Throssell cannot believe how little has been learned. \u201cI\u2019ve had sleepless nights knowing that the judge who made the contact order was still on the bench and the Cafcass worker who interviewed Paul has never been held accountable,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t live now, I exist,\u201d she continues, \u201cand the only reason I exist is to make a difference. There are days I wake up disappointed I\u2019m alive, but then I remember that I made a vow to get my children\u2019s voices heard. We need a true overhaul of the family courts \u2013 and if I can\u2019t get that, why am I still here?\u201d</p> <p>Most cases that reach the family courts, like Throssell\u2019s, involve allegations of domestic abuse. Occasionally they make the news \u2013 one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/31/mother-devastated-after-rapist-ex-partner-given-access-to-their-daughter\">recent example</a> highlighted the child contact awarded to a serial rapist. Kristoffer Paul Arthur White was judged to have abused, raped and coercively controlled his ex-partner. He had also served a jail sentence for dragging a teenager into a garden, threatening to kill her and raping her twice. Despite this, he was granted unsupervised contact with his daughter.</p> <p>A paper published in <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09649069.2024.2382501\">August by the Shera research group</a>, examined 10 anonymous family court cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse carried out by the father \u2013 including cases where the father had admitted to it, or there was digital or video evidence, and one of child rape that had led to a prison sentence. In all of these cases, the father ultimately won some form of contact with their children, including overnight stays and 50/50 shared residency. One woman, whose ex was given five years on the sex offender register for downloading child sexual abuse images, mainly of girls, including babies and young children, was told by her Cafcass worker: \u201cWell, it\u2019s all right because you\u2019ve got a son.\u201d</p> <p>From time to time, cases like these alarm the public. Usually, though, family courts operate with little outside scrutiny, and under heavy reporting restrictions in order to protect children from unwanted publicity. Domestic abuse organisations regularly cite the courts as the single most common grievance raised by survivors, who say they retraumatise families and place them back in danger. The Women\u2019s Aid <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Child-First-Nineteen-Child-Homicides-Report.pdf\">Child First</a> campaign, which focused on 19 children killed in circumstances involving unsafe child contact, helped lead to the creation of an expert panel by the Ministry of Justice, which aimed to assess the harm to children caused by family court proceedings. Its <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895173/assessing-risk-harm-children-parents-pl-childrens-cases-report_.pdf\">final report</a>, published in 2020, made 72 recommendations designed to change the culture from \u201cpro-contact\u201d to \u201csafety and protection\u201d above all else. \u201cIt was wonderful and confirmed everything we\u2019d been saying,\u201d says Sophie Francis-Cansfield, head of policy at Women\u2019s Aid. \u201cFour years later, very few of those recommendations have been implemented. Progress has been incredibly slow.\u201d</p>    <p>Ironically, Throssell \u2013 like many victims of domestic abuse \u2013 had first turned to the family courts for protection. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fight on my own any more and I trusted the courts to see sense,\u201d she says. Throssell, who is from Penistone, South Yorkshire, had been married to Sykes, a carpet salesman, for 16 years, and for much of that he had been violent and controlling. For a long time, she had wanted to leave him and her children had wanted to go too. \u201cThey used to say: \u2018When are we leaving, Mum?\u2019 \u2018When will it just be the three of us?\u2019 I was trying to stay until they were both old enough to choose not to see their dad,\u201d says Throssell. There is no set age for this, though in practice it\u2019s usually 16. The thought of them alone in his care was enough to keep her in the marriage. \u201cHe used to always say: \u2018Don\u2019t think you\u2019re leaving because if you do, you can leave them two here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In April 2014, though, Throssell did leave. She hadn\u2019t planned it. Sykes had been standing at the top of the stairs, shouting at Jack, and as he was about to land a blow, Throssell intervened. The force of his fist threw her down the stairs. Jack and Paul ran to her side and Sykes stood at the top. \u201cI just told the boys to run to the car,\u201d says Throssell. \u201cI got up and followed them and we drove to my mum\u2019s.\u201d They never returned.</p> <p>That summer \u2013 the boys\u2019 last \u2013 was the happiest they had ever had. \u201cIt was the only summer of their lives that they really enjoyed,\u201d says Throssell. From May through to mid-August, they didn\u2019t see their dad. \u201cThey could be normal children \u2013 they didn\u2019t have any fear,\u201d says Throssell. \u201cWe went to the beach at Lytham St Annes and Paul just threw himself into the water with his clothes on because he could and not be told off. There was no walking on eggshells, not knowing what mood someone was in. I\u2019ve got a photograph of them at the top of Blackpool Tower and they haven\u2019t got a care in the world. They said they were flying.\u201d</p> <p>Just after that trip, Sykes turned up at Throssell\u2019s mother\u2019s house while Throssell<strong> </strong>wasn\u2019t there and took Jack on an unauthorised \u201ccontact visit\u201d. \u201cHe dragged Jack by the collar and there was nothing my mum could do,\u201d says Throssell. That\u2019s when she turned to the family courts.</p> <p>Her first experience in the courtroom shocked her. Most cases involve allegations of domestic abuse, and women who have fled their ex-partners.

Whatever the figure, there is a wealth of evidence showing that domestic abuse is not something that happens between parents that children just \u201cwitness\u201d, but something that harms them directly. These harms include trauma symptoms, such as nightmares, bed wetting, hyper-vigilance, depression, aggression, declines in educational development, self-harm, eating disorders, even lower levels of IQ. It\u2019s why children were recognised as victims in their own right in the Domestic Abuse Act 2021. Yet in the family courts, many believe, this is routinely brushed aside by the presumption of contact. \u201cPresumption of contact was one of the guiding principles of the 1989 Children Act, which established equal parenting in law,\u201d says Natalie Page, specialist <a href=\"https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fparamily.uk%2Fabout%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7C%7C18e083a306a249bf2ada08dcd3fe2812%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638618335763829021%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=WeNJhMz3rkX%2FUUdLtH4qOieRBpJkBGWQoYBiYSCYoC0%3D&amp;reserved=0\">paralegal</a> and founder of <a href=\"https://survivorfamilynetwork.com/\">Survivor Family Network</a>. \u201cSection 1 states that both parents playing a full part will further a child\u2019s welfare.

The mother of a child who expresses fear or negativity about seeing their dad is routinely accused of \u201calienating\u201d their children against him. A self-selecting <a href=\"https://candour.tv/films/torn-apart\">survey of 4,000 court users</a> by Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches found allegations of parental alienation were five times more likely to be made against parents who had themselves raised allegations of domestic abuse. A Home Office <a href=\"https://domesticabusecommissioner.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DAC_Family-Court-Report-_2023_Digital.pdf\">report</a> by the domestic abuse commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, describes how survivors are now sometimes advised by their legal team not to mention their abuse in court in case it leads to accusations of parental alienation and ultimately the loss of custody. <a href=\"https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/jgbv/6/1/article-p115.xml\">A study</a> by Women\u2019s Aid and Queen Mary University of London examined cases where custody has been transferred to the father for this reason.

She fully expects that it will. The next step will be overnight stays.</p> <p>Like Throssell, Charlotte had first turned to the family courts for help \u2013 in her case, to apply for a non-molestation order against her former partner, which was granted. She remains extremely frightened of him. Though they separated when their daughter was an infant \u2013 and he showed no interest in contact with her \u2013 he continued to control Charlotte from a distance with spyware. \u201cHe used to call and message, and threaten me and tell me what I was wearing that day,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was OK as long as I stayed at home and it\u2019s surprising how you get accustomed to that. For years, my life was the school run and nothing else.\u201d It was only when she began moving her life forward and got a job that he talked his way into her house and attacked her. She applied for and won a non-molestation order. His response was to launch a fight for full custody of their daughter. Despite the non-molestation order, Charlotte has lost count of how many times she has had to sit a few feet from him in court.</p> <p>\u201cHe has admitted in court to assaulting me,\u201d says Charlotte. \u201cHe was forced to attend a perpetrator programme, which reported back that the things he said about me were horrendous, and he had tried to manipulate the course facilitator as well as the other perpetrators. I suffer from complex PTSD \u2013 it\u2019s there in black and white on my hospital notes. I\u2019ve had to have exposure therapy because I didn\u2019t know how to deal with the outside world. I\u2019m hyper-vigilant because of the stalking. The courts see all this but still, it looks like, at the end of all this, I\u2019ll have to drive my daughter miles from my home to a secluded place where he lives and leave her there, wondering all the time what he\u2019s doing to her.</p> <p>\u201cI looked for safety and justice in the courtroom but every time I walk out of court, I feel worse than when I went in. If it wasn\u2019t for my daughter, there have been times I could easily have walked straight under a bus. The family courts actually give my ex-partner a run for his money.

It now has more than 100,000 signatures and Throssell will soon hand it to the secretary of state for justice, Shabana Mahmood. \u201cThere should be no \u2018presumption\u2019 of contact, there should only be proper investigation, gathering of information and listening to children,\u201d says Throssell. \u201cIt\u2019s not for anyone to \u2018presume\u2019 a child is safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123; the <a href=\"https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/\">domestic abuse helpline</a> is 0808 2000 247, or visit <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/\">Women\u2019s Aid</a>.

      "bodyText": "October marks the 10th anniversary of the murder of Claire Throssell\u2019s two sons, Jack and Paul, by their father. He had lured them to the attic with sweets and a new train set, then barricaded the house and started 14 fires. He\u2019d locked all the doors, secured the patio doors with a heavy bike lock and used chairs and mattresses as extra barriers to slow down firefighters. Jack and Paul, aged 12 and nine, hadn\u2019t wanted to visit their father, Darren Sykes. He had previously hit both them and their mum. He\u2019d made them eat until they were sick. He used to call them \u201cmummy\u2019s boys\u201d. Paul had explained all this to a worker at Cafcass (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service) in a formal interview. Throssell had said in an evidence statement that, when angry, Sykes was capable of hurting or killing the boys, that he had told her he intended to take his own life and that he could understand fathers killing their children. Still, contact was awarded to him. Ten years on \u2013 or, in her own words, \u201c10 years into my life sentence\u201d \u2013 Throssell cannot believe how little has been learned. \u201cI\u2019ve had sleepless nights knowing that the judge who made the contact order was still on the bench and the Cafcass worker who interviewed Paul has never been held accountable,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t live now, I exist,\u201d she continues, \u201cand the only reason I exist is to make a difference. There are days I wake up disappointed I\u2019m alive, but then I remember that I made a vow to get my children\u2019s voices heard. We need a true overhaul of the family courts \u2013 and if I can\u2019t get that, why am I still here?\u201d Most cases that reach the family courts, like Throssell\u2019s, involve allegations of domestic abuse. Occasionally they make the news \u2013 one recent example highlighted the child contact awarded to a serial rapist. Kristoffer Paul Arthur White was judged to have abused, raped and coercively controlled his ex-partner. He had also served a jail sentence for dragging a teenager into a garden, threatening to kill her and raping her twice. Despite this, he was granted unsupervised contact with his daughter. A paper published in August by the Shera research group, examined 10 anonymous family court cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse carried out by the father \u2013 including cases where the father had admitted to it, or there was digital or video evidence, and one of child rape that had led to a prison sentence. In all of these cases, the father ultimately won some form of contact with their children, including overnight stays and 50/50 shared residency. One woman, whose ex was given five years on the sex offender register for downloading child sexual abuse images, mainly of girls, including babies and young children, was told by her Cafcass worker: \u201cWell, it\u2019s all right because you\u2019ve got a son.\u201d From time to time, cases like these alarm the public. Usually, though, family courts operate with little outside scrutiny, and under heavy reporting restrictions in order to protect children from unwanted publicity. Domestic abuse organisations regularly cite the courts as the single most common grievance raised by survivors, who say they retraumatise families and place them back in danger. The Women\u2019s Aid Child First campaign, which focused on 19 children killed in circumstances involving unsafe child contact, helped lead to the creation of an expert panel by the Ministry of Justice, which aimed to assess the harm to children caused by family court proceedings. Its final report, published in 2020, made 72 recommendations designed to change the culture from \u201cpro-contact\u201d to \u201csafety and protection\u201d above all else. \u201cIt was wonderful and confirmed everything we\u2019d been saying,\u201d says Sophie Francis-Cansfield, head of policy at Women\u2019s Aid. \u201cFour years later, very few of those recommendations have been implemented. Progress has been incredibly slow.\u201d Ironically, Throssell \u2013 like many victims of domestic abuse \u2013 had first turned to the family courts for protection. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fight on my own any more and I trusted the courts to see sense,\u201d she says. Throssell, who is from Penistone, South Yorkshire, had been married to Sykes, a carpet salesman, for 16 years, and for much of that he had been violent and controlling. For a long time, she had wanted to leave him and her children had wanted to go too. \u201cThey used to say: \u2018When are we leaving, Mum?\u2019 \u2018When will it just be the three of us?\u2019 I was trying to stay until they were both old enough to choose not to see their dad,\u201d says Throssell. There is no set age for this, though in practice it\u2019s usually 16. The thought of them alone in his care was enough to keep her in the marriage. \u201cHe used to always say: \u2018Don\u2019t think you\u2019re leaving because if you do, you can leave them two here.\u2019\u201d In April 2014, though, Throssell did leave. She hadn\u2019t planned it. Sykes had been standing at the top of the stairs, shouting at Jack, and as he was about to land a blow, Throssell intervened. The force of his fist threw her down the stairs. Jack and Paul ran to her side and Sykes stood at the top. \u201cI just told the boys to run to the car,\u201d says Throssell. \u201cI got up and followed them and we drove to my mum\u2019s.\u201d They never returned. That summer \u2013 the boys\u2019 last \u2013 was the happiest they had ever had. \u201cIt was the only summer of their lives that they really enjoyed,\u201d says Throssell. From May through to mid-August, they didn\u2019t see their dad. \u201cThey could be normal children \u2013 they didn\u2019t have any fear,\u201d says Throssell. \u201cWe went to the beach at Lytham St Annes and Paul just threw himself into the water with his clothes on because he could and not be told off. There was no walking on eggshells, not knowing what mood someone was in. I\u2019ve got a photograph of them at the top of Blackpool Tower and they haven\u2019t got a care in the world. They said they were flying.\u201d Just after that trip, Sykes turned up at Throssell\u2019s mother\u2019s house while Throssell wasn\u2019t there and took Jack on an unauthorised \u201ccontact visit\u201d. \u201cHe dragged Jack by the collar and there was nothing my mum could do,\u201d says Throssell. That\u2019s when she turned to the family courts. Her first experience in the courtroom shocked her. Most cases involve allegations of domestic abuse, and women who have fled their ex-partners. Here they were expected to face them again, in close proximity \u2013 to sit beside them in waiting rooms, listen while they spun a story. \u201cThere were no safety measures,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was right there, glaring at me, then verbally attacking me. Then you go inside and it\u2019s like a boardroom with him sitting four seats away, hurling insult after insult. At one point the judge had to tell him to be quiet. I thought this was clear evidence that he can\u2019t control his emotions and wasn\u2019t safe to be around.\u201d Instead, Sykes was awarded five hours\u2019 contact a week. Although the judge ordered a section 7 report by Cafcass (a detailed report into the children\u2019s welfare and best interests), the contact visits were allowed to proceed in the meantime. \u201cEvery visit would break your heart,\u201d says Throssell. \u201cWhen I picked them up from school on the days they were going to see their dad, they\u2019d be in tears, they\u2019d cling to my legs. When they went to see him, they\u2019d cover themselves in my perfume because they said they wanted to take me with them. I had to bite my lip because it\u2019s Allure by Chanel and really expensive and it was going down at a really fast rate! When they were gone, I\u2019d worry, I\u2019d pace, my stomach would twist, I\u2019d feel sick.\u201d Paul was interviewed by a Cafcass officer for the section 7 report and described life with his dad, listing the many reasons he didn\u2019t want to see him. The Cafcass officer then met with Sykes. The serious case review following the boys\u2019 deaths found that Sykes became \u201cagitated and uncomfortable\u201d in that meeting and barred the door to prevent the officer leaving \u2013 her notes stated that she wanted extra support when with him in future. \u201cIf that Cafcass officer couldn\u2019t handle seeing him alone, how the hell did she think a nine- and 12-year-old would? She had the power to overrule the contact order there and then,\u201d says Throssell. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t.\u201d CCTV images have shown that, on leaving that meeting, Sykes went out and bought five cans of petrol. Two days later, during the next contact visit, he killed his sons and himself. Jack never got to speak to Cafcass \u2013 the day of his scheduled meeting was the day he died \u2013 but he did tell the firefighter who carried him from the house: \u201cMy dad did this and he did it on purpose.\u201d He repeated the same thing to the attending police officer and the consultant at Sheffield children\u2019s hospital before he was put under sedation. \u201cThat\u2019s the only time his voice was heard,\u201d says Throssell. The serious case review, published in 2015, did not conclude that contact should have been suspended, only that this option should have been \u201cconsidered\u201d. \u201cSuch judgments are difficult to make at the time,\u201d the report stated, \u201cand it is considerably easier to criticise with the benefit of hindsight.\u201d Women\u2019s Aid has recently won funding to establish how many more children have died during unsafe child contact since their last report.

It now has more than 100,000 signatures and Throssell will soon hand it to the secretary of state for justice, Shabana Mahmood. \u201cThere should be no \u2018presumption\u2019 of contact, there should only be proper investigation, gathering of information and listening to children,\u201d says Throssell. \u201cIt\u2019s not for anyone to \u2018presume\u2019 a child is safe.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123; the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid. The NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). Call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732; children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800.

Under the new rules 100% of tips \u2013 by cash or card \u2013 and any service charge levied on customers must be passed on to staff working in restaurants, cafes, hotels, hairdressers or taxi firms. The minister for employment rights, Justin Madders, said: \u201cWhen you tip someone for good service, you expect them to keep all their tip.

The payments are intended as a way for waiting staff to share tips with chefs and other back-of-house workers. But Unite claims the system can sometimes lead to earnings from tips and service charges being less than the amount owed to fellow workers. A spokesperson for Mitchells &amp; Butlers said it passed on all tips to staff: \u201cIn preparation for the new tips code of practice, our tipping policies were reviewed by an independent professional adviser to ensure that we remain fully compliant. \u201cOur approach under the new tips code of practice remains that our teams will agree how to distribute tips in each business through a democratic and transparent process, facilitated by each onsite general manager.\u201d It said distribution of tips was \u201centirely up to our individual teams in each of our [businesses].\u201d",

The 19th-century Bristol alderman Thomas Daniel, one of the owners of Ashton Court, received compensation for at least 4,424 African people.</p> <p>Gloria Daniel, the founder of TTeach Plaques, said: \u201c50 Plaques &amp; Places is a powerful act of reclamation, led by the descendants of those who were once enslaved. By bringing these plaques to Ashton Court Mansion \u2013 a site with its own painful connections to this history \u2013 we are forcing a confrontation with the truth, and in doing this we honour the memories of our African and Caribbean-born ancestors who experienced unspeakable terror and violence at the hands of these people with the endorsement and backing of the British government, the church and the crown.\u201d</p> <p>Other celebrations and events include a new festival in Birmingham called Niyo Fest, which will bring together tech, hair and beauty brands to collaborate; and the play <a href=\"https://thelowry.com/whats-on/slave-a-question-of-freedom/#:~:text=Performed%20by%20an%20outstanding%20ensemble,of%20trafficking%20and%20modern%20slavery.&amp;text=are%20enslaved%20today.\">Slave: A Question of Freedom</a>, which explores the life of the Sudanese author and human rights activist Mende Nazer, at the Quays theatre in Manchester.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Exhibitions and plaques celebrating leading Black figures and highlighting the harrowing legacy of the enslavement of African people will be part of Black History Month. First run in the UK in October 1987, Black History Month is the largest and most widespread celebration of Black culture and the historical and contemporary contributions of black Britons. This year\u2019s Black History Month, with the theme of \u201creclaiming narratives\u201d, marks what campaigners describe as a significant shift towards recognising and correcting the narratives of Black history and culture. The theme underscores \u201ca commitment to correcting historical inaccuracies and showcasing the untold success stories and the full complexity of Black heritage,\u201d Black History Month UK magazine said. In London on Tuesday, campaigners will gather for a ceremony to unveil a blue plaque at 57 Castletown Road, West Kensington, where five influential Black figures stayed between 1928 and 1964: Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya\u2019s first president; the Jamaican activists Marcus and Amy Garvey; Malcolm X; and Ladipo Solanke, a Nigerian-born anti-racism campaigner. Gaverne Bennett, a heritage officer at Hammersmith and Fulham council, said: \u201cThis particular plaque to these historic figures is important because it provides a living link that captures all the threads of Black History \u2013 and broader history \u2013 over the last 100 years in this one special place.\u201d Bennett, also a Leicester University PhD student, who created the Black literature timeline for the British Library, added: \u201cAnyone, particularly young people, looking for inspiration on how to change the country and the world need look no further than the five people being honoured here at the beginning of UK Black History Month.\u201d In Bristol, descendants of transatlantic slavery have opened an exhibition called 50 Plaques &amp; Places, showcasing plaques that commemorate individuals in the city who received financial compensation under the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 for the loss of their so-called \u201cproperty\u201d. The exhibition, curated by Gloria Daniel and Sandra Daniel, will be unveiled in Ashton Court, a venue that they said was \u201cdeeply symbolic\u201d and \u201claden with the painful reality of history\u201d. The 19th-century Bristol alderman Thomas Daniel, one of the owners of Ashton Court, received compensation for at least 4,424 African people. Gloria Daniel, the founder of TTeach Plaques, said: \u201c50 Plaques &amp; Places is a powerful act of reclamation, led by the descendants of those who were once enslaved. By bringing these plaques to Ashton Court Mansion \u2013 a site with its own painful connections to this history \u2013 we are forcing a confrontation with the truth, and in doing this we honour the memories of our African and Caribbean-born ancestors who experienced unspeakable terror and violence at the hands of these people with the endorsement and backing of the British government, the church and the crown.\u201d Other celebrations and events include a new festival in Birmingham called Niyo Fest, which will bring together tech, hair and beauty brands to collaborate; and the play Slave: A Question of Freedom, which explores the life of the Sudanese author and human rights activist Mende Nazer, at the Quays theatre in Manchester.",

You can tell because its eyes are clear and not blurry,\u201d he said. Hundreds of other fish had washed up nearby on the river\u2019s green willow-fringed banks. A large pike lay in the mud. Nearby, in a patch of yellow lilies, was a motionless carp. \u201cEverything is dead, starting from the tiniest minnow to the biggest catfish,\u201d Kraskov added mournfully.</p> \n<p>Kraskov is the mayor of the village of Slabyn, in Ukraine\u2019s northern Chernihiv region. The rustic settlement \u2013 population 520 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/chernihiv-ukrainians-territory-russia-occupation-kyiv\">escaped the worst</a> of Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion. But the war arrived last week in a new and horrible form. Ukrainian officials say the Russians deliberately poisoned the Seym River, which flows into the Desna. The Desna connects with a reservoir in the Kyiv region and a water supply used by millions.</p> \n<p>A toxic slick was detected on 17 August coming from the Russian border village of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyotkino\">Tyotkino</a>. According to Kyiv, chemical waste from a sugar factory had been dumped in vast quantities into the Seym. It included ammonia, magnesium and other poisonous nitrates. At the time, fierce fighting was going on in the surrounding area. Ukraine\u2019s armed forces had launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/zelenskiy-defiant-russia-retakes-kursk-villages-ukraine\">surprise incursion into Russia</a> and had seized territory in Kursk oblast.</p> \n<p>The pollution crossed the international border just over a mile away and made its way into Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region. The Seym\u2019s natural ecosystem crashed. Fish, molluscs and crayfish were asphyxiated as oxygen levels fell to near zero. Settlements along the river reported mass die-offs. Kraskov got a call from the authorities warning him a disaster was coming his way. He spotted the first dead fish on 11 September. \u201cThere were a few of them in the middle of the river,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He returned the following weekend to find the Desna\u2019s banks clogged with rotting fish, stretching out from the shore for three metres into the water. Volunteers wearing rubber boots, masks and protective gloves shovelled the fish into sacks. They found a metre-long catfish. \u201cThe stench was terrible. You could scarcely breathe. The river was quiet. Nothing moved apart from a few frogs,\u201d Kraskov said. A tractor took the sacks to an abattoir that used to belong to the village\u2019s Soviet-era collective farm. They were buried in a pit.</p> \n<p>Serhiy Zhuk, the head of Chernihiv\u2019s ecology inspectorate, described what had happened as an act of Russian ecocide. \u201cThe Desna was one of our cleanest rivers. It\u2019s a very big catastrophe,\u201d he said. Zhuk traced the slick\u2019s route on a map pinned to his office wall: a looping multi-week journey along the Seym and Desna. \u201cMore than 650km is polluted. Not a single organism survived. This is unprecedented. It\u2019s Europe\u2019s first completely dead river,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>In his view, the Kremlin was waging total war of a kind not seen since the last century. Vladimir Putin\u2019s desire to eradicate Ukraine extended to the natural world, he suggested. \u201cThey are sending rockets through the air, burning our forests and threatening to blow us up with nuclear bombs. You can rebuild a bridge or a school. It takes longer, unfortunately, for wildlife to recover.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the contamination approached, Zhuk ordered the closure of Zolotyi Bank, the central beach in Chernihiv. A ban was imposed on fishing, swimming, and on using the river to water cattle or gardens. Scientists took samples, testing every 15-20km and bringing glass vials back to a laboratory. The results were hair-raising. In the city of Baturyn, a one-time Cossack capital on the Seym, oxygen content dipped to zero on 29 August. The next day it was 0.1 mg/dm\u00b3.

Recent rains dispersed some toxins. Zhuk was optimistic these measures would be enough to save Kyiv from the worst of the pollution. But he admitted the situation was grim. \u201cThere is a difference between a natural and man-made disaster. This was a diversionary act.

A sign in red letters warned \u201cDo not bathe\u201d. \u201cThis is a huge eco-tragedy. The river smells weird,\u201d Olha remarked. She noted that last year Russian troops <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/20/life-returns-to-ukrainian-reservoir-drained-by-russian-strike-on-dam\">blew up the Khakovka reservoir</a> in Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson province, flooding villages and killing people and fish. \u201cThis is Russia again, 100%,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to drink water from the tap and buy fish from the market. Now we can\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/09/5/7473610/\">Svitlana Hrynchuk</a>, Ukraine\u2019s minister for environmental protection, said water consumption in Kyiv remained safe. Various special measures had been taken to get rid of the nitrates, she said, with 120 tonnes of cleaning agents imported and nets strung across the Desna to catch dead fish. In the Kyiv region, none had turned up. Additionally, water was routinely purified before it was extracted for household use, she said, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a fish plague.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hrynchuk said this latest episode was part of a dismal pattern. Russian troops had destroyed national parks in occupied areas, killed animals and mined thousands of hectares of forest. Explosions had caused wildfires, a problem exacerbated by recent hot weather. \u201cUkraine is fighting for its future. That future has to include nature. We need clean water, clean air, woods, everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a beautiful country. We have to save and protect it.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said the river was a part of Ukrainian culture. In 1956, the Soviet film-maker Oleksandr Dovzhenko published a novel called The Enchanted Desna. Reminiscing about his childhood, he wrote: \u201cIt would be long past sunset and the large catfish would leap in the Desna under the stars as we listened agog till we dozed off in the fragrant hay under the oaks. Grandpa regarded the tench as the best fish of all. He scooped them right out of the water with his bare hands like a Chinese magician.\u201d</p> \n<p>Back at Slabyn, Kraskov said that before he became village mayor he worked at Chornobyl nuclear power station. He was involved in the construction of a concrete sarcophagus designed to contain radiation from the reactor, which blew up in 1986. \u201cI know how to bury dangerous substances,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cI also know how bureaucracy works. That\u2019s why we acted quickly with the dead fish.\u201d He continued: \u201cIf something goes wrong, officials like to find a scapegoat. So you better do everything correctly. Our life is like this.\u201d</p>",

The litigation over racially-based \u201caffirmative action\u201d put a spotlight on all the ways that white students benefit from non-racially-coded admissions practices, particularly \u201clegacy\u201d admissions, which media outlets dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2023/07/24/1189443223/affirmative-action-for-rich-kids-its-more-than-just-legacy-admissions\">affirmative action for rich kids</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The California law will ban admissions offices from \u201cfavoring applicants whose family members are graduates of or are significant donors to the school\u201d, which Ting\u2019s office called an \u201cunfair practice often results in a wealthier, less racially diverse student body\u201d.</p> <p>Advocacy groups that supported the bill called it an important step forward.</p> <p>In a statement, Helen Iris Torres, CEO of Hispanas Organized for Political Equality, called it \u201ca bold step to dismantle unfair admission practices\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLegacy and donor preferences are a recipe for aristocracy, not justice. [The law] is a critical first step toward ensuring that California\u2019s most selective colleges do not further tip the scales in favor of those who already enjoy the most privilege,\u201d Ryan Cieslikowski, a recent Stanford graduate and the lead organizer at Class Action, an organization that fights against inequitable admissions processes, said in a statement.</p> <p>Across the US, the practice of giving priority university admission to students with family connections is coming under attack from multiple directions. Last year, the US department of education announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/12/college-admissions-fraud-scandal-felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin\">it was investigating allegations</a> that Harvard\u2019s admissions process \u201cdiscriminates on the basis of race by using donor and legacy preferences in its undergraduate admissions process\u201d.</p> <p>In a complaint against Harvard, Lawyers for Civil Rights, a non-profit based in Boston, argued that students with legacy ties are up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/25/us-education-department-inquiry-harvard-legacy-admission-policies\">seven times more likely to be admitted</a> to Harvard and can make up nearly a third of a class \u2013 and that about 70% are white.</p> <p>Some high-status private colleges and universities have announced they are voluntarily ending any admissions priority for \u201clegacy\u201d students, including Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland; Amherst College in Massachusetts, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wesleyan-legacy-admissions-21f7781a961bd784e14dd7752a79d860\">Wesleyan University in Connecticut</a>.</p> <p>A 2023 study that compared students by test scores and income found that wealth played a tremendous role in getting students admitted to elite private colleges. \u201cChildren from families in the top 1% are <a href=\"https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf\">more than twice as likely</a> to attend an Ivy-Plus college (Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, Duke and Chicago) as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores,\u201d the study concluded, pointing to private schools\u2019 preference for admitting children of alumni, among other advantages.</p> <p>Under an earlier California law, also authored by Ting, elite private schools in California had been forced to report how many of the students they admitted had each had benefitted in their applications from a personal connection to a donor or from a family member or members previously attending the school.</p> <p>In 2023, Stanford reported that <a href=\"https://irds.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj23826/files/media/file/2024_ab_697_report_1.pdf\">15.4% of its incoming fall 2023 class</a>, or 271 students, had benefitted from a legacy or donor connection, though it said that all of those students had also met the school\u2019s academic standards for admission. \u201cFirst generation\u201d students, whose parents did not attend college, represented 21.2% of the incoming class, Stanford said.</p> <p>The University of Southern California, a school that featured prominently in the recent \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/12/college-admissions-fraud-scandal-felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin\">admissions bribery scandal</a>, disclosed that, for its fall 2023 class, it admitted 1,791 students based on their relationships to donors or alumni. That was about 14.5% of USC\u2019s total number of admitted students, the Los Angeles Times <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-30/newsom-signs-bill-law-ban-legacy-donor-admissions\">reported</a>. As for Stanford, USC said that every legacy admission met their academic criteria for admissions.</p> <p>In signing the legislation into law, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, said the policy would make higher education in the state more fair: \u201cIn California, everyone should be able to get ahead through merit, skill, and hard work,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> <p>The public University of California system eliminated legacy admissions in 1998, Newsom said.</p> <p>It is not yet clear how the new anti-legacy laws will play out in practice, since children from wealthy, highly educated and well-connected families have many different kinds of advantages when approaching the increasingly competitive colleges admissions process.</p> <p>The supreme court ending \u201caffirmative action\u201d for racial minorities in US college admissions is expected to lead to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/30/affirmative-action-ban-state-colleges-racial-disparities-supreme-court\">decrease in the number of students</a> from underrepresented backgrounds who are admitted to US schools with competitive admissions processes, which is what happened at University of California schools when California voters banned affirmative action in 1996.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "California became the fifth state in the US to ban universities from admitting students based on their family connections, and the second state, after Maryland, to extend the ban to private, non-profit universities. \u201cHard work, good grades and a well-rounded background should earn you a spot in the incoming class \u2013 not the size of the check your family can write or who you\u2019re related to,\u201d Phil Ting, the Democratic state assembly member who authored the legislation, said in a statement. Private non-profit colleges popular with wealthy Americans, including Stanford and the University of Southern California, will be affected by the new legislation, which goes into effect in September 2025. Illinois, Colorado and Virginia have previously passed legislation banning public university admission based on \u201clegacy status\u201d, or connections to donors, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. The wave of new state laws comes in response to the decision last year by the supreme court\u2019s conservative majority to bar both private and public universities from considering race as a factor in college admissions. The litigation over racially-based \u201caffirmative action\u201d put a spotlight on all the ways that white students benefit from non-racially-coded admissions practices, particularly \u201clegacy\u201d admissions, which media outlets dubbed \u201caffirmative action for rich kids\u201d. The California law will ban admissions offices from \u201cfavoring applicants whose family members are graduates of or are significant donors to the school\u201d, which Ting\u2019s office called an \u201cunfair practice often results in a wealthier, less racially diverse student body\u201d. Advocacy groups that supported the bill called it an important step forward. In a statement, Helen Iris Torres, CEO of Hispanas Organized for Political Equality, called it \u201ca bold step to dismantle unfair admission practices\u201d. \u201cLegacy and donor preferences are a recipe for aristocracy, not justice. [The law] is a critical first step toward ensuring that California\u2019s most selective colleges do not further tip the scales in favor of those who already enjoy the most privilege,\u201d Ryan Cieslikowski, a recent Stanford graduate and the lead organizer at Class Action, an organization that fights against inequitable admissions processes, said in a statement. Across the US, the practice of giving priority university admission to students with family connections is coming under attack from multiple directions. Last year, the US department of education announced it was investigating allegations that Harvard\u2019s admissions process \u201cdiscriminates on the basis of race by using donor and legacy preferences in its undergraduate admissions process\u201d. In a complaint against Harvard, Lawyers for Civil Rights, a non-profit based in Boston, argued that students with legacy ties are up to seven times more likely to be admitted to Harvard and can make up nearly a third of a class \u2013 and that about 70% are white. Some high-status private colleges and universities have announced they are voluntarily ending any admissions priority for \u201clegacy\u201d students, including Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland; Amherst College in Massachusetts, and Wesleyan University in Connecticut. A 2023 study that compared students by test scores and income found that wealth played a tremendous role in getting students admitted to elite private colleges. \u201cChildren from families in the top 1% are more than twice as likely to attend an Ivy-Plus college (Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, Duke and Chicago) as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores,\u201d the study concluded, pointing to private schools\u2019 preference for admitting children of alumni, among other advantages. Under an earlier California law, also authored by Ting, elite private schools in California had been forced to report how many of the students they admitted had each had benefitted in their applications from a personal connection to a donor or from a family member or members previously attending the school. In 2023, Stanford reported that 15.4% of its incoming fall 2023 class, or 271 students, had benefitted from a legacy or donor connection, though it said that all of those students had also met the school\u2019s academic standards for admission. \u201cFirst generation\u201d students, whose parents did not attend college, represented 21.2% of the incoming class, Stanford said. The University of Southern California, a school that featured prominently in the recent \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d admissions bribery scandal, disclosed that, for its fall 2023 class, it admitted 1,791 students based on their relationships to donors or alumni. That was about 14.5% of USC\u2019s total number of admitted students, the Los Angeles Times reported. As for Stanford, USC said that every legacy admission met their academic criteria for admissions. In signing the legislation into law, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, said the policy would make higher education in the state more fair: \u201cIn California, everyone should be able to get ahead through merit, skill, and hard work,\u201d he said in a statement. The public University of California system eliminated legacy admissions in 1998, Newsom said. It is not yet clear how the new anti-legacy laws will play out in practice, since children from wealthy, highly educated and well-connected families have many different kinds of advantages when approaching the increasingly competitive colleges admissions process. The supreme court ending \u201caffirmative action\u201d for racial minorities in US college admissions is expected to lead to a decrease in the number of students from underrepresented backgrounds who are admitted to US schools with competitive admissions processes, which is what happened at University of California schools when California voters banned affirmative action in 1996.

      "bodyText": "Sixteen years ago, the Rudd government ordered an inquiry into the supermarket sector amid rising public discontent about grocery prices. The sector was already highly concentrated with Coles and Woolworths enjoying a collective 65% share of the market, as the Franklins business withered and upstart Aldi was still in its early stage of expansion in Australia. In 2008, the competition regulator found that profit margins at Coles and Woolworths were in line with major overseas supermarkets. Margins were generally above UK\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s, but well below Tesco and the US\u2019s Walmart. They were roughly in line with France\u2019s Carrefour and a host of other peers such as American chain Safeway. Fast forward to 2024, and the results out of Australia are not good for shoppers, with the big supermarkets now enjoying an even tighter hold on the sector, at 67%. The profit margins of Australia\u2019s grocery duopoly are among the highest in the world. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) ran the international comparison again as part of its new Albanese government-ordered supermarket inquiry, which found in an interim report that mirror-like offerings and prices charged by Coles and Woolworths may be stifling vigorous competition. Profit margins at Coles and Woolworths are now well above almost all of their international peers, including Tesco, Carrefour, Sainsbury\u2019s, Albertsons, Kroger Co and Ahold Delhaize, according to the ACCC analysis. Two chains \u2013 Walmart and Canada\u2019s dominant supermarket retailer, Loblaw \u2013 have similar margins to Coles and Woolworths. No international peers have reported consistently higher levels of profitability than Australia\u2019s big two throughout the pandemic and inflationary period. The ACCC hasn\u2019t drawn a conclusion on what the international comparison means for shoppers, as it will consider profit margins further ahead of its final report, due in February. Coles and Woolworths told the regulator their profits were \u201cnot unreasonably high\u201d and said grocery retailing was a high-turnover, low-margin business. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email They have defended their retail price increases of recent years, arguing they are justified in responding to the increases in underlying inflationary costs. The supermarkets also prefer to cite different profit metrics, an issue that played out in a fiery manner during the recent parliamentary inquiry. The e61 Institute, an economic research centre, said in a note on Monday that Australia\u2019s supermarket sector is \u201cmore concentrated than in other high-income economies\u201d. It suggests one policy option could be to provide consumers with transparent grocery price information, which could enable platforms to conduct user-friendly price comparisons of baskets of groceries or stores in a consumer\u2019s local area. While e61 does not reach a definitive conclusion about the supermarket sector, it does refer to the risks associated with a lack of competition in major Australian industries. \u201cCompetition is a force for good. It spurs innovation amongst firms and leads to higher quality goods and services and lower prices for consumers,\u201d it said. \u201cBut there is evidence of declining market dynamism in Australia, with rising markups and the top firms remaining at the top for longer.\u201d Jonathan Barrett is Guardian Australia\u2019s senior business reporter",

In March 1989, Ueberroth, who would soon be succeeded by Bart Giamatti, announced that his office was conducting a \u201cfull inquiry into serious allegations\u201d about Rose. Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the \u201caccumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.\u201d<br><br>Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/16/say-it-aint-so-joe-how-1919-informs-americas-entire-worldview-on-gambling\">expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series</a> \u2013 to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball\u2019s Rule 21, posted in every professional clubhouse, proclaims that \u201cAny player, umpire or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>As far back as the 1970s, teammates had worried about Rose. By all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether his baseball decisions were based on his own financial interest.</p> <p>In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated.</p> <p>But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall in his lifetime. His status was long debated. Rose\u2019s supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year before he was elected President, tweeted: \u201cCan\u2019t believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He\u2019s paid the price. So ridiculous \u2014 let him in!\u201d<br><br>Meanwhile, Rose\u2019s story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, Rose again claimed innocence, only to reverse course in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed he had \u201cmessed up\u201d and that his father would have been ashamed, but he still bet on baseball, albeit legally.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think betting is morally wrong. I don\u2019t even think betting on baseball if morally wrong,\u201d he wrote in Play Hungry, a memoir released in 2019. \u201cThere are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.\u201d</p> <p>His disgrace was all the harder because no one seemed to live for baseball more than Rose. He remembered details of games from long ago and could quote the most obscure statistics about players from other teams. He was as relentless in spring training as he was in the postseason, when he <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/pete-rose-mets-reds-fight-new-york-baseball.html\">brawled with the New York Mets\u2019 Buddy Harrelson</a> during the 1973 NL playoffs.</p> <p>Rose the man was never inducted into Cooperstown, but his career was well represented. Items at the Baseball Hall include his helmet from his MVP 1973 season, the bat he used in 1978 when his hitting streak reached 44 and the cleats he wore, in 1985, on the day he became the game\u2019s hits king.</p>",

Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the \u201caccumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.\u201d Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series \u2013 to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball\u2019s Rule 21, posted in every professional clubhouse, proclaims that \u201cAny player, umpire or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.\u2019\u2019 As far back as the 1970s, teammates had worried about Rose. By all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether his baseball decisions were based on his own financial interest. In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall in his lifetime. His status was long debated. Rose\u2019s supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year before he was elected President, tweeted: \u201cCan\u2019t believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He\u2019s paid the price. So ridiculous \u2014 let him in!\u201d Meanwhile, Rose\u2019s story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, Rose again claimed innocence, only to reverse course in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed he had \u201cmessed up\u201d and that his father would have been ashamed, but he still bet on baseball, albeit legally. \u201cI don\u2019t think betting is morally wrong. I don\u2019t even think betting on baseball if morally wrong,\u201d he wrote in Play Hungry, a memoir released in 2019. \u201cThere are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.\u201d His disgrace was all the harder because no one seemed to live for baseball more than Rose. He remembered details of games from long ago and could quote the most obscure statistics about players from other teams. He was as relentless in spring training as he was in the postseason, when he brawled with the New York Mets\u2019 Buddy Harrelson during the 1973 NL playoffs. Rose the man was never inducted into Cooperstown, but his career was well represented. Items at the Baseball Hall include his helmet from his MVP 1973 season, the bat he used in 1978 when his hitting streak reached 44 and the cleats he wore, in 1985, on the day he became the game\u2019s hits king.",
