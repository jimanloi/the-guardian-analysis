A 17-year-old boy was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash in Woodchurch, Wirral. An 18-year-old boy was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition. Merseyside police said they received reports at approximately 6.25pm on Saturday that two men had come off a motorbike at the junction of Hoole Road and Grass Wood Road. Police said that other men were present when the fatal incident occurred and they are still searching for the motorbike, which was missing at the scene. Insp Ian Cowell, from the force\u2019s roads policing team, said: \u201cThis is a tragic incident that has resulted in a teenager losing his life and our thoughts are with his family. \u201cAnother young man has also sustained significant injuries and he is currently in a critical condition in hospital. \u201cWe believe there were other males who were with them at the time of the collision and we are trying to locate them to see if they have any information. \u201cWhen officers arrived, the vehicle involved in the collision, which we believe was a motorbike, had been removed and part of our inquiries will be trying to locate this vehicle.\u201d The road where the incident took place has been closed and police have increased patrols in the area \u201cto carry out initial inquiries and establish exactly what happened\u201d, Merseyside police said. The police urge any potential witnesses to come forward. \u201cIf you live in the area or were driving past at the time, please review your CCTV to see if you captured anything, even if it appears small or insignificant, because it could be vital to our investigation,\u201d Cowell added. Police have informed the victim\u2019s family and are providing them with support.",

      "body": "<p>Football needs great characters and, for 12 years, English women\u2019s football was all the more interesting for the presence of one of the most charismatic coaches in the sport in the form of Emma Hayes; never afraid to speak her mind, never dull and scarcely ever beaten. Perhaps the Women\u2019s Super League and the wider English game did not realise quite how much it was missing Hayes until she brought her Olympic champions to London and reminded everyone what a difference a sprinkle of personality can make in&nbsp;helping to grow a sport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/england-usa-womens-international-friendly-match-report\">Emma Hayes frustrated as England hold her USA on Wembley homecoming</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The match itself was rather unexciting, but the USA coach somehow made the occasion anything but. The tone was set at the start of the week when Hayes hosted a press conference in a pub in Camden. Where else? She joked about the venue smelling of \u201cfart and feet\u201d, before pouring some pints from behind the bar. It would be unfair to label the 12 current WSL managers as dull by comparison but it is undeniably true that none of them can yet grab a room\u2019s attention quite like Hayes can, guarantee as many column inches or stir up quite so much attention for a friendly fixture.</p> <p>On the touchline night, Hayes was as animated as ever. At times in the first half it felt as though she was issuing almost nonstop instructions to her players, gesturing for specific positional tweaks or highlighting runs that could be made. Discussing that with reporters after the match, the USA centre-back Naomi Girma said: \u201cShe does a good job of getting us information on the field when we need it and not making it stressful, just instructive. She\u2019s just brought belief into the team. She\u2019s allows us to play with freedom and just go out and have fun. She brings that energy. To play underneath her, you just feel that freedom in whatever you\u2019re doing and feel that you can go out and express yourself.\u201d</p>    <p>Hayes had said in the buildup to the match, well aware that there would be an element of curiosity around whether or not she would sing either of the national anthems, that she would probably \u201chum\u201d along to them&nbsp;instead. </p> <p>When the moment came, the 48-year-old could not resist a little smile, as a television camera panned towards her during the anthems.

      "bodyText": "Football needs great characters and, for 12 years, English women\u2019s football was all the more interesting for the presence of one of the most charismatic coaches in the sport in the form of Emma Hayes; never afraid to speak her mind, never dull and scarcely ever beaten. Perhaps the Women\u2019s Super League and the wider English game did not realise quite how much it was missing Hayes until she brought her Olympic champions to London and reminded everyone what a difference a sprinkle of personality can make in helping to grow a sport. The match itself was rather unexciting, but the USA coach somehow made the occasion anything but. The tone was set at the start of the week when Hayes hosted a press conference in a pub in Camden. Where else? She joked about the venue smelling of \u201cfart and feet\u201d, before pouring some pints from behind the bar. It would be unfair to label the 12 current WSL managers as dull by comparison but it is undeniably true that none of them can yet grab a room\u2019s attention quite like Hayes can, guarantee as many column inches or stir up quite so much attention for a friendly fixture. On the touchline night, Hayes was as animated as ever. At times in the first half it felt as though she was issuing almost nonstop instructions to her players, gesturing for specific positional tweaks or highlighting runs that could be made. Discussing that with reporters after the match, the USA centre-back Naomi Girma said: \u201cShe does a good job of getting us information on the field when we need it and not making it stressful, just instructive. She\u2019s just brought belief into the team. She\u2019s allows us to play with freedom and just go out and have fun. She brings that energy. To play underneath her, you just feel that freedom in whatever you\u2019re doing and feel that you can go out and express yourself.\u201d Hayes had said in the buildup to the match, well aware that there would be an element of curiosity around whether or not she would sing either of the national anthems, that she would probably \u201chum\u201d along to them instead. When the moment came, the 48-year-old could not resist a little smile, as a television camera panned towards her during the anthems. But when quizzed on that topic in her post-match press conference, there came another example of Hayes\u2019s knowhow in handling the more awkward questions with ease, saying: \u201cI was smiling because I could see Naomi and Lynn [Williams] looking at me because I was definitely mouthing the national anthem. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be English and I\u2019m proud of our national anthem. And I\u2019m also really proud to coach America and I\u2019m really proud of that national anthem. Two things are possible all at once, and I\u2019m not going to run away from it. I know we want to, sort of, I don\u2019t know, fuel a \u2018nationalist debate\u2019 around it.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me! I\u2019ll leave you with John Brewin\u2019s report from the London Stadium. Thanks for reading! Tomorrow\u2019s Premier League fixtures: Chelsea vs Aston Villa Tottenham vs Fulham Manchester United vs Everton Liverpool vs Manchester City Arsenal full-back Jurrien Timber tells Sky Sports: \u201cIt was fun to play in. We scored a lot of goals and it\u2019s always fun to score a lot of goals. We showed some really great football, we just need to keep this momentum going because we have a really tough game to come against Man United \u201cWe have a big squad with a lot of good players and I think we showed that last week and again this week with different players in the starting line-up.\u201d Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tells BBC Sport: \u201cWe made it crazy, we played so well at the start of the game. We scored three early goals and then they score one immediately after kick-off and then another one - then it was game on. \u201cWe have to manage the game - we did that really well. The last two games were tricky and to score goals is a big one.\u201d Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka tells Sky Sports: \u201cI am taking a lot of pleasure from creating and scoring but the greatest pleasure is to win. Let\u2019s keep this form going. Definitely the last three games we have been back.\u201d Speaking of Liverpool vs Manchester City, here\u2019s a little preview to whet the appetite courtesy of Jonathan Liew. That second half certainly did not have as much drama as the first, but it\u2019s a testament to just how well Arsenal managed things following that five-minute blip. West Ham didn\u2019t have too many chances after the break and the visitors were able to take their foot off the gas. A well-earned three points for Mikel Arteta\u2019s side. They will now be able to relax ahead of tomorrow\u2019s huge clash between Liverpool and Manchester City. Arsenal go second in the table with a dramatic win at the London Stadium. 90+4 min: Sterling breaks into the box in possession before playing a short pass to Jesus on his left. The Brazilian goes for a powerful shot from a tight angle and his effort rattles the side netting. 90+2 min: Irving sends an excellent pass through to Ings, who taps the ball past Raya before shooting from a tight angle, but his effort runs across the face of goal and Arsenal can eventually make the clearance. 90+1 min: Five minutes have been added on. 89 min: Sterling steps up to take the free kick and curls his effort just wide of the post. 88 min: Irving gives away a free kick just outside the box for a challenge on Jesus. Jorginho gets a telling off from referee Anthony Taylor for standing in Fabia\u0144ski\u2019s way while he is trying to set up the wall. Not the most inventive idea from the midfielder. 85 min: Another change, Arsenal this time. Ethan Nwaneri is on for Trossard. Gary Neville is not happy about the number of changes on Sky Sports\u2019 commentary \u2013 he suggests the Premier League should introduce rolling substitutions\u2026 I\u2019m not sure on that idea. 83 min: You almost get the impression that Mikel Arteta also believes this game is. \u00d8degaard off, Saka off, Gabriel off. A three-goal lead, surely they can\u2019t go wrong here\u2026 81 min: West Ham fans are slowly starting to make their way out of the London Stadium. They think this match is done. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d leave just yet considering how the end of the first half went\u2026 78 min: Another double substitution, this time for West Ham. Soler is replaced by Andrew Irving while Paquet\u00e1 makes way for Guido Rodr\u00edguez. 76 min: Kiwior gives away a foul on Bowen with a shirt pull and West Ham have a free kick in a dangerous position. The ball is sent in but Raya can eventually claim following a headed effort from Sou\u010dek. 74 min: Mikel Arteta makes a double change as Saka, who today became the first player in Europe\u2019s top five leagues to reach 10 assists this season, makes way for Raheem Sterling. Meanwhile, Gabriel Jesus is on for \u00d8degaard. 72 min: The ball is played through to Timber, who makes a run to the edge of the box before sending a pass to Havertz, but a deflection takes it away from the striker\u2019s path and Fabia\u0144ski can claim. 69 min: Another corner for Arsenal and this time Saka is there to take it. He sends a cross in and there appears to be a bit of confusion before West Ham eventually make the clearance. 67 min: We\u2019re 22 minutes into this second half and no more goals \u2013 what\u2019s going on?! 64 min: A double change for the hosts as Antonio makes way for Danny Ings and Vladim\u00edr Coufal replaces Emerson, who scored arguably the best goal of the game so far. 61 min: There is some concern for Arsenal now as Saka is down with a knock. He receives some treatment from a physio and makes his way over to the sidelines. Meanwhile, the visitors have a corner. Rice crosses it in with a relatively poor effort, but Paquet\u00e1 attempts an even worse clearance and sends it behind for another corner. Fabia\u0144ski punches clear the next one. 59 min: I don\u2019t know how but Zinchenko has found himself over on the right wing. He plays a pass inside to \u00d8degaard on the edge of the box, who goes for goal, but Fabia\u0144ski saves. 57 min: Another change for Arsenal as Oleksandr Zinchenko replaces Calafiori as left-back. 55 min: West Ham break forward as Paquet\u00e1 is given plenty of space to carry the ball. He passes it through to Antonio, who shoots from the edge of the box and forces Raya into a fingertip save. 52 min: The ball is sent through to Bowen in the centre of attack, whose touch falls slightly away from him. He goes to make a run but Saliba catches him on the shin and West Ham have a free kick. Nothing comes of it, however. 49 min: Saka takes the corner and sends the ball towards the front post, where Calafiori makes a run, but West Ham clear the danger. 48 min: Arsenal look to play forward as Saka receives a pass on the right side of the box. \u00c1lvarez quicky comes across to make the challenge and sends the ball out for a corner. 47 min: Both teams made a change at the break, with Jakub Kiwior replacing goalscorer Gabriel for Arsenal. Meanwhile, Edson \u00c1lvarez is on for Summerville. And just like that, we\u2019re back under way! John Cox is not convinced about the free kick decision that led to West Ham\u2019s second\u2026 \u201cWas it me or did that free kick arise from a really terrible decision? Hard to see how Rice could have won the ball more cleanly.\u201d Tony is taking a moment to consider ex-West Ham manager David Moyes: \u201cSomewhere David Moyes is out there, perhaps relaxing in his most comfortable Chesterfield chair, sipping an irn bru and whisky, watching this game.\u201d Jeremy Boyce says: \u201cWow! Is Premier League Footie the new NBA? Goals Goals Goals today, and we haven\u2019t even started on tomorrow\u2019s fixture list of teams who\u2019ve forgotten how to defend, champions and challengers alike. Goal-less second half ?\u201d K\u00e1ri messaged in midway through the first half: \u201cOn the one hand, matches like this is why I fell in love with the game. On the other hand, at 4-0 I was already starting to prepare to make another batch of gingerbread during the second half. Now these biscuits will never get made.\u201d Then got back in touch when the half-time whistle went: \u201cOkay, now that it\u2019s 5-2 maybe I can risk making a new batch without getting so gripped that I forget the gingerbread in the oven.\u201d This is the point where I usually try to summarise the first half. But, to be quite honest, I don\u2019t know where to start. It was all Arsenal in the opening 30 minutes, but Mikel Arteta\u2019s side gave West Ham a glimpse at goal late in the half and they took it with both hands. Two goals, two minutes, and everything changes. That late penalty makes things a bit more comfortable for Arsenal \u2013 just. And, breathe\u2026 45+7 min: West Ham have another free kick, this time from a bit further out. Emerson steps up to take again and forces a fingertip save from Raya, Nothing comes of the following corner and that should be time. Saka converts the penalty, passing the ball into the bottom-left corner. Fabia\u0144ski got a hand to it, but it was not enough. It\u2019s a penalty! After a VAR check, Fabia\u0144ski is booked for accidentally punching Gabriel in the head. 45+2 min: Arsenal have another corner and Gabriel goes for goal but collides with Fabia\u0144ski. This could be a penalty\u2026 45+1 min: We\u2019re into five minutes of added time\u2026 44 min: Amid all the chaos, Saka and Emerson were booked for a clash on the left. 44 min: Despite being 4-2 up, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta looks incredibly frustrated after giving away those two goals in quick succession. The visitors have to be careful here. 41 min: Rice gives away a free kick in a dangerous position just outside the box. Emerson steps up to take it and fires his strike off the crossbar and into the top-right corner! I can barely keep up! What a game this has been so far! WHAT. A. HIT! WHAT A GAME! 39 min: Soler picks up the ball in midfield, turns and sends it through to Wan-Bissaka, who passes it into the bottom-right corner! Wan-Bissaka gets one back for the hosts! 36 min: \u00d8degaard receives the ball in midfield and sends a stunning pass over to Havertz in attack. Kilman goes to head it away but completely misses the clearance and Havertz takes it down before slotting into the bottom corner. Havertz gets in on the action! \u00d8degaard converts the spot kick to absolute perfection, tucking the ball into the bottom-right. Fabia\u0144ski went the right way, but it was too far into the corner. Saka is allowed to make his way into the box and Paquet\u00e1 sticks out a leg to bring him down. A very poor penalty to give away for West Ham. 28 min: Saka receives the ball on the right and plays it inside to \u00d8degaard. The midfielder then chips it into the perfect position for his team-mate to run onto. Saka regains possession before playing a simple pass across the six-yard box to Trossard, who slots it into an empty net. Trossard makes it two! A fantastic goal orchestrated by Saka and \u00d8degaard! 25 min: Timber comes close to making it two \u2013 in what could have been an exact replica of Gabriel\u2019s opener! Saka steps up to take a corner and the Dutchman drives towards the front post. He flicks the ball in the direction of goal and forces a save from Fabia\u0144ski. 22 min: \u00d8degaard is given plenty of time and space to run into the West Ham box before laying the ball off to Saka on his right. The winger goes for goal, but his effort flies wide. 20 min: Trossard receives the ball on the left and plays a pass with the outside of his boot to Calafiori in the box, but the left-back is nudged off-balance and Fabia\u0144ski can claim. 17 min: Summerville has the ball in the net for West Ham \u2013 but it won\u2019t count! Calafiori sends a poor pass back to Timber and it is intercepted. The ball is then sent through to Summerville, who lobs Raya, but he is immediately flagged offside. 15 min: Aside from that goal, Arsenal haven\u2019t really challenged Fabia\u0144ski too much so far. West Ham appear to be making life quite difficult for Saka on the right, with several players closing him down quickly whenever he gets on the ball. 12 min: Whatever Gabriel and Saka were planning before that corner clearly worked to absolute perfection! As the winger takes a slow walk over to the flag, his Arsenal team-mates congregate at the back of the box. They all quickly make a darting run to the front post where Gabriel flicks it past Fabia\u0144ski and into the net! And just like that, Gabriel heads in the opening goal! 9 min: Another corner for the visitors. Saka goes over to take it and has a subtle word with Gabriel on his way to the flag. What are they cooking up? 7 min: Arsenal have a corner and Gabriel takes a slow jog into the box. Rice is the man to take it, but West Ham can make a fairly easy clearance at the front post. 5 min: Saka picks up possession on the right, but Paquet\u00e1 comes storming over to win it back. The Brazilian eventually draws a foul from the Arsenal man, much to the delight of the home fans. 3 min: Bowen receives the ball on the right and looks to cut into the Arsenal box, but he is cut out by Calafiori. 2 min: West Ham manager Julen Lopetegui is watching from what looks to be the back of the Directors\u2019 Box. Not sure if that\u2019s the best place to sit when trying to manage a team\u2026 We\u2019re under way at the London Stadium! Charles Antaki has messaged in about the inclusion of Kieran Tierney\u2026 \u201cA small ripple of appreciation for Kieran Tierney as he edges back into contention. Arsenal fans aren\u2019t sure quite how much affection to invest in him anymore \u2013 there was plenty \u2013 but he\u2019s what? fourth or fifth in line for the left back role\u2026. If and when he goes we\u2019ll have plenty of fond memories; not many elite football players turn up to games with their belongings in a plastic bag, so he has that distinction probably in perpetuity.\u201d Martin \u00d8degaard proved once again last week that he is Arsenal\u2019s puppet master. The Gunners appeared to lose their way in his absence over the last few months, enduring a four-game winless run between the end of October and start of November. But they hit their stride when captain \u00d8degaard completed his comeback from injury. The Norwegian has the ability to make those around him better on the pitch, which is something West Ham will have to be wary of this evening. These two teams last met at the London Stadium back in February - and it was a miserable day for the hosts. Arsenal cruised to a huge 6-0 win over West Ham thanks to goals from William Saliba, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, Leandro Trossard and ex-Hammer Declan Rice. Will we see a repeat today? Or will West Ham shock Mikel Arteta and Co? Ahead of today\u2019s match, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said: \u201cI know him [Lopetegui], we are friends, I have huge admiration for what he has done in the game. He is from the same area as I am in the north of Spain. It\u2019s a team that\u2019s now in a high after the big win that they had against Newcastle away and it\u2019s always a really tough opponent, we know that. \u201c[They have] various ways to create big problems. They are a really physical side, really good in direct play, attacking second balls where they have to dominate the game through the ball. Or when they have the space they are a really dangerous team. Set pieces, and then individual quality they have, the front players can create in any moment any situation to cause you trouble. They are really well coached.\u201d Elsewhere in the Premier League today Wolves 2-4 Bournemouth Crystal Palace 1-1 Newcastle Nottingham Forest 1-0 Ipswich Town Brentford 4-1 Leicester City Julen Lopetegui will not be in the West Ham dugout this evening. The 58-year-old received his third yellow card of the season during Monday\u2019s clash with Newcastle, meaning he will have to serve a one-match touchline ban against Arsenal. \u201cThe players that are on the pitch is always most important,\u201d the manager said during his pre-match press conference. \u201cPlayers ready to help the team and to be able to compete against one of the, in my opinion, best teams in the Premier League. So we have to be ready. I am not going to be in the dugout, and maybe I have to improve my way because I have three yellow cards, but it\u2019s done. I am passionate. And sometimes you try to say something, or how you act, or you make an action with your hands.\u201d Kieran Tierney has been named in the Arsenal squad for the first time since August 2023. The left-back, who spent last season on loan at Real Sociedad, starts on the bench. I want to hear from you! Be sure to email me with any predictions, feelings, thoughts and all that jazz. Where will you be watching from? Who will you be watching with? Are you off to any other games this weekend? I want to know! Mikel Merino and Thomas Partey are both out of the Arsenal squad this evening. Merino is unavailable with a knee problem while Partey is absent due to a muscular issue. Arsenal fans breathe a collective sigh of relief as Gabriel is named in the starting line-up for this evening\u2019s match. There had been doubts regarding his involvement after he limped off against Sporting Lisbon earlier this week. In true Mikel Arteta style, the manager was incredibly cryptic about his availability during a pre-match press conference yesterday, but nevertheless \u2013 and it\u2019s not entirely a surprise \u2013 he is in from the start. Meanwhile, Julen Lopetegui names an unchanged squad from Monday\u2019s win over Newcastle. West Ham starting XI: \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski; Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Jean-Clair Todibo, Max Kilman, Emerson Palmieri; Carlos Soler, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Sou\u010dek; Jarrod Bowen (C), Lucas Paquet\u00e1, Crysencio Summerville; Michail Antonio. Substitutes: Alphonse Areola, Vladim\u00edr Coufal, Luis Guilherme, Danny Ings, Edson \u00c1lvarez, Guido Rodr\u00edguez, Andy Irving, Oliver Scarles, Ezra Mayers. Arsenal starting XI: David Raya; Jurrien Timber, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, Riccardo Calafiori; Jorginho, Declan Rice, Martin \u00d8degaard (C); Bukayo Saka, Leandro Trossard, Kai Havertz. Substitutes: Neto, Jakub Kiwior, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Josh Nichols, Gabriel Martinelli, Ethan Nwaneri, Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus. Team news will be out shortly. Mohammed Kudus is absent for West Ham while he serves the fifth of his five-match ban. Niclas F\u00fcllkrug is also sidelined with an Achilles injury. Ben White and Takehiro Tomiyasu remain unavailable for Arsenal, with Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es an uncertainty. Hello, good evening and welcome to coverage of West Ham\u2019s Premier League clash with Arsenal. Julen Lopetegui earned himself a lifeline on Monday when his team cruised to a shock 2-0 win over Newcastle at St James\u2019 Park. It was the club\u2019s first victory in just under a month, giving them some breathing space between the likes of Leicester and Everton. Meanwhile, Arsenal have returned to fine form following the international break. Mikel Arteta and his players endured a rough patch between the end of October and the start of November, but Martin \u00d8degaard\u2019s return to full fitness has provided a huge boost. The North London side earned a 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest last weekend followed by a 5-1 victory against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday, so they should be oozing confidence going into this London derby. We\u2019re certainly in for a treat! Kick-off is at 5:30pm GMT - join me!",

      "body": "<p>Ireland has bucked the European trend of elections going against incumbent governments, with two of the parties in its ruling coalition in pole position to lead the next parliament.</p> <p>An exit poll showed an appetite for change, with 60% backing opposition parties. But the prospect of an alternative left-leaning government still looks unlikely to materialise.</p> <p>The poll showed leftwing, nationalist Sinn F\u00e9in slightly ahead, with 21.1% of first-preference votes, followed by the two main parties in the outgoing coalition, centre-right Fine Gael at 21% and centre-right Fianna F\u00e1il at 19.5%.</p> <p>But with both those parties ruling out a partnership with Sinn F\u00e9in, they remain favourites to form the next government. They are expected to get between 30 and 40 seats each, which, with a third party, could make the 87 seats needed for a majority.</p> <p>The deputy leader of the Social Democrats, Cian O\u2019Callaghan, said early tallies suggested it would emerge as the fourth biggest party, with more than eight seats. Making an early pitch for a role in a coalition, he said: \u201cThis is our best election in our nine years. After the results are all in, we will talk to all parties.

      "bodyText": "Ireland has bucked the European trend of elections going against incumbent governments, with two of the parties in its ruling coalition in pole position to lead the next parliament. An exit poll showed an appetite for change, with 60% backing opposition parties. But the prospect of an alternative left-leaning government still looks unlikely to materialise. The poll showed leftwing, nationalist Sinn F\u00e9in slightly ahead, with 21.1% of first-preference votes, followed by the two main parties in the outgoing coalition, centre-right Fine Gael at 21% and centre-right Fianna F\u00e1il at 19.5%. But with both those parties ruling out a partnership with Sinn F\u00e9in, they remain favourites to form the next government. They are expected to get between 30 and 40 seats each, which, with a third party, could make the 87 seats needed for a majority. The deputy leader of the Social Democrats, Cian O\u2019Callaghan, said early tallies suggested it would emerge as the fourth biggest party, with more than eight seats. Making an early pitch for a role in a coalition, he said: \u201cThis is our best election in our nine years. After the results are all in, we will talk to all parties. We talked to Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael last time, and we will again this time round.\u201d Arriving at the main count centre in Dublin, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, was met with a chaotic media scrum. Flanked by the party\u2019s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O\u2019Neill, she declared her intention to try to create a government, saying the result had given Sinn F\u00e9in the same legitimacy as the two established parties. \u201cTwo-party politics is now gone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been consigned to the dustbin of history. That, in itself, is very significant. The question now arises for us: what do we do with that? And we are clear that we want to change people\u2019s lives. I believe another five years of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael is bad news for society.\u201d The biggest upset is expected to be the wipeout of the Green party, which, with 12 seats, had been the third partner in the outgoing coalition. By Saturday evening, they looked to have lost nearly all their seats, with leader Roderic O\u2019Gorman also in danger. Migration, an inflammatory issue in many recent elections in Europe, failed to fire up the electorate, with an exit poll showing it was the top priority for just 6% of voters, despite violent clashes over asylum seekers in the last year. Housing and homelessness was the the top issue, followed by the cost of living, health and the economy. Counting of votes in the 43 constituencies began at 9am on Saturday but with Ireland\u2019s proportional representation system final results may not be known until Sunday night or Monday. The Green party\u2019s former leader, Eamon Ryan, said he had been \u201csharing commiserations\u201d with colleagues but \u201cholding heads high\u201d. He told RT\u00c9: \u201cChange is difficult. Sometimes, when you\u2019re driving change, it upsets things. \u2026 I think in a general election people were voting for government and maybe we were caught in that squeeze. People who wanted to retain the current government have voted Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael and not us.\u201d The tallies suggest potential trouble for Fianna F\u00e1il in Wicklow, where the party\u2019s only candidate in the constituency \u2013 the health minister, Stephen Donnelly \u2013 is in danger of losing his seat. Jack Chambers, the departing Fianna F\u00e1il finance minister, said the national result was \u201ctoo close to call\u201d but said the exit poll showed the public did not want the \u201cvolatility\u201d that had spread in other countries on the back of the rise of the far right. Gary Murphy, a professor of politics at Dublin City University, told RT\u00c9:\u201cI think there is a problem that Irish politics has faced since the fragmentation and the economic crash in 2011 \u2013 that now we\u2019re not sure who\u2019s going to be in government.\u201d Fine Gael\u2019s director of elections, Olwyn Enright, said the exit poll had been a \u201cpositive\u201d prediction for the party, but that she had been \u201csurprised\u201d with survey results that put Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s McDonald as the preferred taoiseach against the incumbent, Simon Harris, who had a difficult final campaign week.

Government formation talks could take weeks \u2013 with, possibly, no new government until January. Elsewhere, the election threw up surprises. In Dublin Central, Gerry Hutch, a gangland figure released from bail recently in Spain to run for election, looked to be in contention for the last of four seats. Social Democrat Gary Gannon, a certainty for the third seat behind Fine Gael\u2019s Paschal Donohoe and McDonald, said \u201causterity from the financial crash\u201d had destroyed some communities, which felt a \u201creal sense of loss and pain over housing and poverty\u201d that the current government had failed to fix in the last five years. As the postmortem into the election began, Br\u00edd Smith of the socialist party People Before Profit\u2013Solidarity blamed Sinn F\u00e9in for not setting out a narrative of change stronger and earlier.

Given the inexperience of Lewis and Gvardiol\u2019s scrambled mind, Guardiola would probably like to field Nathan Ak\u00e9 there, but he has only just returned from injury and may, anyway, be needed in the centre. If Kyle Walker returns at right-back, Luis D\u00edaz could do serious damage if, as it appears, Walker\u2019s pace has deserted him. But underlying every tactical question is a nagging sense that none of it much matters. This is about City and Guardiola and their peculiarly intense psychodrama; Liverpool are league leaders but their part feels oddly subsidiary. Guardiola is a great coach and his squad laden with quality; they could still snap out of it. But over the past few days, the first serious thoughts have arisen that this might be the end.",

Both sides were blunt up front, the US perhaps unsurprisingly so given their entire first-choice front line \u2013 the Triple Espresso of Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson \u2013 were missing. But Sarina Wiegman, who embraced her friend Emma Hayes warmly on the full-time whistle, will take heart from that performance when it\u2019s viewed in the round. Having shipped four goals against Germany and given up a plethora of chances against South Africa, the Lionesses were much improved defensively, and that\u2019s something to build on as they head into major-championship year and the defence of their European crown. More positives than not, though they still need to cut out those careless errors at the back.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-30T19:28:02.364Z\">at 7.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-674b639b8f088c7046fe06c9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-30T19:12:57.932Z\">7.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: England 0-0 USA</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It wasn\u2019t a classic.

      "bodyText": "Suzanne Wrack was at Wembley. Her report has landed, and here it is. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night. Emma Hayes speaks to ITV. \u201cWhen you have to play England, after their defeat to Germany, we knew there would be a reaction to that performance \u2026 we kept the crowd quiet \u2026 we controlled the game \u2026 I got the chance to see younger players, less experienced players \u2026 we\u2019re building towards something \u2026 I\u2019m super proud the way we imposed ourselves \u2026 it was just the last part of the pitch \u2026 when you lose the quality by not having the Triple Espresso here \u2026 generally I\u2019m pleased with the performance \u2026 the number of entries into the final third was us more than them \u2026 we\u2019re in a developmental stage \u2026 I\u2019m so proud \u2026 two years ago I remember watching the USA here and it was a very transitional game \u2026 we handled the hostile moments \u2026 I\u2019m a proud English woman who is proud to coach America \u2026 I don\u2019t have to choose, I love both countries.\u201d Mary Earps talks to ITV. \u201cIt was tough \u2026 we were hard to beat \u2026 resolute \u2026 sometimes you have to griund it out \u2026 obviously things we have to improve on but nil-nil is OK \u2026 it\u2019s been a tough year \u2026 we know what we can do as a group \u2026 friendlies are the perfect time to experiment \u2026 nil-nil against the Olympic champions is no small thing \u2026 but we want to be winning games like this.\u201d Sarina Wiegman speaks to ITV. \u201cVery intense game at the very highest level \u2026 we played more maturely than we did the last time here at Wembley [against Germany] \u2026 as a team we defended really well \u2026 second half we could create some moments \u2026 I would like to have some more \u2026 the final pass, we lost it too quick \u2026 second half we did that better \u2026 a lot to learn \u2026 lots of information \u2026 exciting game \u2026 I hope everyone here liked it too \u2026 we are trying out things \u2026 as a team we did really well \u2026 tactically the team was really connected \u2026 we are learning things \u2026 this shows where we are at \u2026 we need to keep improving \u2026 this is November but the second of July the tournament starts \u2026 this is good but we want to be better again.\u201d USA were the better team in the first half. They were the better team in the second, too, though England came into the game more as an attacking force after the break. Both sides were blunt up front, the US perhaps unsurprisingly so given their entire first-choice front line \u2013 the Triple Espresso of Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson \u2013 were missing. But Sarina Wiegman, who embraced her friend Emma Hayes warmly on the full-time whistle, will take heart from that performance when it\u2019s viewed in the round. Having shipped four goals against Germany and given up a plethora of chances against South Africa, the Lionesses were much improved defensively, and that\u2019s something to build on as they head into major-championship year and the defence of their European crown. More positives than not, though they still need to cut out those careless errors at the back. It wasn\u2019t a classic. But after a couple of below-par performances, England will take it against the best team in the world. 90 min +4: Williamson clears it. That should be that. 90 min +3: USA pass it around the back patiently. Then Kelly unceremoniously barges Krueger off the pitch, and earns herself a late yellow card. A free kick on the halfway line, and one last chance to pump the ball into the England box. 90 min +2: Ryan\u2019s spectacular crossfield ball finds Lavelle on the right touchline, but Lavelle can\u2019t do anything with it. 90 min +1: The first of four additional minutes passes without incident. 90 min: Kelly turns on the jets and takes on Krueger in a footrace down the right. She wins a corner, and England take it short. Kirby reaches the byline but her cutback is no good. 89 min: The tension is palpable, both teams suddenly forgetting how to retain possession. 87 min: The US captain Horan is replaced by the 20-year-old debutant Sentnor. 86 min: Fox waltzes past Russo on the right to reach the byline. She pulls back into the six-yard box, but there\u2019s nobody in blue to take advantage. Earps grasps the ball. The USA seriously going for it here. 85 min: More space for Lavelle down the right. No pace on her cross, though, and Horan can\u2019t attack it. 84 min: Bronze is caught snoozing by Ryan, who tears off down the right. Earps flops on her low cross. England have defended well tonight, yet there have still been several careless lapses that could have proved costly. 83 min: The corner\u2019s nothing to write home about. England just about holding on here. 82 min: Albert steals the ball off Walsh, then sends Lavelle bombing into the box from the right. Her cross looks for Horan, but Williamson is again on hand to turn out for a corner. Coffey to take this one from the left. 80 min: England fail to deal with the corner, only half-clearing it to Girma, who loops into the mixer. Williamson slashes out for another corner, which is played back up the right flank to Fox, who looks for Horan with a long diagonal. Earps comes racing off her line to claim confidently. 79 min: Lavelle drives into space down the middle and sends Shaw away on the right. Shaw earns a corner. The USA turning up the heat again. 78 min: Horan and Shaw clip a couple of cute passes down the inside-left channel to release Lavelle into the box. Lavelle telescopes a leg in the hope of diverting the ball across Earps and into the bottom right, but Greenwood comes across to block, just in time. Earps snaffles the loose ball. That was a lovely move by the USA, with some staunch defence in response. 76 min: Mead advances down the left and hits a cross meant for Russo. Instead, it nearly sneaks into the bottom right. Naeher scrambles across in a panic but the ball sails out for a goal kick. 75 min: England respond to that double change with one of their own. A double change, that is. Kirby and Kelly come on for Park and Naz. 73 min: Thompson and Williams are replaced by Shaw and Albert. Horan moves up into the attack, the US having now replaced their entire starting front line. 72 min: Williamson tries to find Russo with a shovelled pass down the inside-left channel, but overcooks the pass, which sails out of play for a goal kick. \u201cShould the ref let Ryan take the shot off the rebound before blowing for the penalty in case it\u2019s overturned?\u201d wonders Zach Neeley, who may have a point. The decision, wrong though it was, effectively denied the USA another shooting chance. 70 min: Horan strides down the middle and has options either side. She clatters the ball into the nearest white shirt. The USA captain\u2019s radar has been off this evening. 68 min: A relieved England go on the attack. Russo dribbles hard down the right and looks for Bronze in the middle. The ball clanks out for a goal kick. 67 min: Eventually justice is done. The referee changes her mind. No idea why it took so long to overturn. Stanway will take a breath of relief, because that was yet another careless mistake that could have been extremely costly. 66 min: VAR sends the referee over to the monitor. Surely this is clear cut? No penalty, surely? The referee takes a long, long, long look. All very strange. 65 min: \u2026 but VAR will take a look at this, because that shot surely hit Greenwood on the chest, rather than the arm. 64 min: Stanway dithers and is robbed by Coffey. Ryan shoots. Greenwood chests down. Ryan prepares to have another go, but the referee points to the spot! 63 min: Bronze\u2019s loose pass in the middle of the park is snaffled by Horan, who should send Williams clear on goal, but overcooks the attempted assist. England just can\u2019t break their recent habit of offering careless gifts. 62 min: \u2026 however England refuse to let it lie, and Russo goes on a barrelling run down the middle. She nearly bursts clear, too, but a combination of Girma and Krueger is too much in the end. 61 min: Mead crosses from a deep position on the left. Bronze fights in the hope of winning a header but Girma calmly deals with the situation. The USA then take a moment to take it down a notch with some sterile passing around the back. 59 min: Bronze strides down the right and whips a low cross through the six-yard box. Fox struggles to clear it. Russo attempts to make space to shoot on the left-hand corner of the box, but can\u2019t turn quickly enough. USA clear, but all of a sudden it\u2019s England asking the questions! 58 min: That was the best \u2013 let\u2019s face it, only - period of sustained pressure from England. Much better, and it\u2019s got the crowd going again. It\u2019s also forced Williams into agriculturally booting a clearance upfield. All of which will give the hosts heart. 57 min: \u2026 but that was better from England, and they come again, Stanway picking up possession on the right and steaming infield before aiming for the top left. A pearler that looks like heading for the corner \u2026 but it\u2019s deflected out for a corner, and nothing comes of the set piece. 55 min: \u2026 so after all that, Stanway slips Park into space down the right. Park crosses long. Russo waits to head goalwards at the far post, but Fox is wise to the situation and turns the ball out for a corner. Williamson sends a weak header straight at Naeher, who looks to bowl the ball out immediately, only to be checked by Russo. Again the referee decides against booking an England player for a fairly cynical foul. Naeher not best pleased. 54 min: \u2026 and so should Ryan, who races into the England box down the right. She\u2019s one on one with Earps, but tries to tee up Horan in the middle instead of going for goal herself. That allows Williamson to divert the ball out for a corner, from which nothing happens. USA should be leading by now. 53 min: Horan enters the English box and fizzes a low diagonal shot across Earps and wide of the bottom-left corner. The USA captain hollers in frustration; she should have hit the target. 52 min: Sonnett wedges down the right for Williams, who can\u2019t quite find Thompson in the middle. A sense that a US goal could be in the post. 50 min: Ryan hasn\u2019t taken long to make her mark, and now she zips down the right, sending in a dangerous cross that Earps has to parry away from the lurking Thompson and Horan. Signs that Emma Hayes may have given her team the what-for during the break. 49 min: USA have the ball in the net. Ryan spins into space down the middle and dinks a ball into the box for Lavelle, who opens her body and aims for the right-hand side of the net. Lavelle gets it all wrong, the ball heading miles wide, but Horan sticks out a leg to divert it into the net. However Horan was clearly offside and the flag immediately goes up. 47 min: Fox strips Mead of possession and begins to dribble down the right. She\u2019s nudged from behind by Mead, who is extremely fortunate not to go into the book. But it is a free kick, and a chance for the USA to load the English box. Coffey hits it diagonally but Girma can\u2019t connect on the edge of the six-yard box. England clear. USA get the second half underway. They\u2019ve replaced Sears with Ryan. Half-time post-election postbag. \u201cThere may be future trade barriers put in place by the next administration but we love the gift of Emma from the UK to the USA. We are so grateful, but you should have never let her go, what a gem!\u201d \u2013 Mary Waltz \u201cWe need some Chloe Kelly\u201d \u2013 Peter Gartner The USA have enjoyed more possession, and taken all the shots. Yet they\u2019ve not looked particularly dangerous, and given the form of both teams going into this match, it\u2019ll be England who are happier going into the break. Both teams have higher gears, though. 45 min +1: Williamson clips Williams and there\u2019s time for one last free kick. Coffey hooks it into the mixer. Williams heads harmlessly over, and that\u2019ll be that for the first half. 45 min: There will be one additional minute. 44 min: Coffey sashays from right to left, along the curve of the England D, before unleashing a low swerving shot that Earps handles well. 42 min: Coffey turns up the speed and one-twos with Thompson down the inside-left channel \u2026 but again the door slams shut. The hosts will be happy with their defensive shift so far. 40 min: England are sitting back, inviting pressure. To be fair, they\u2019re soaking it up well, offering the USA little space in which to work. Horan buzzes around in the hope of cracking the code, but there\u2019s no way through. 38 min: Williamson\u2019s careless pass out from the back is snaffled by Horan. She\u2019s extremely fortunate that Horan dithers, unsure whether to look for Williams or shoot. The attack breaks down. Williamson clearly having learned little from her error that cost a goal against South Africa. 36 min: Park picks up possession 25 yards from goal. She considers the shot, but then opts to release Russo down the inside-right channel. She makes the pass, but Girma is on the case and intercepts. For a split second there, the USA looked vulnerable. 34 min: Neither team have particularly impressed in attack so far, but it\u2019s Earps who has had to make two big saves. The USA without their first-choice front line as well. They\u2019re not ranked number one for nothing. 32 min: Thompson dribbles down the left and cuts back for Krueger, who shoots low and hard. Earps parries, but the loose ball falls to Williams. However the US striker can\u2019t get anything meaningful away. Sears recycles possession on the right and crosses deep. Horan attempts a bicycle kick but doesn\u2019t connect and in any case the whistle goes for dangerous play. 31 min: Walsh sprays a delightful crossfield pass towards Bronze on the right wing, but Bronze is quickly surrounded and the chance to advance is gone. Defences very much on top. 29 min: The resulting free kick is hit long, diagonally towards Girma on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box. The ball doesn\u2019t come down quickly enough for Girma to get a shot away. She\u2019s closed down and England clear their lines. 28 min: Thompson dribbles hard down the left, zipping past Naz before being clipped by Walsh. That\u2019s a clever foul, because front on, it\u2019s not enough for a booking, and Sears was in acres on the other flank, waiting for the pass that would have set her free. 26 min: England continue to pass it out from the back, living on the edge, just about beating the press. These must be testing times for those who follow both England women and Southampton men. 24 min: Lavelle, tracking back as England break forward, runs slap-bang into the referee and is furious. Fortunately \u2013 for the official, anyway - nothing comes of the counter. This is all a bit scrappy at the moment. 22 min: Bronze advances down the right and is upended by Krueger. Free kick, just outside the box. Everyone gets in it. Greenwood whips the set piece towards Bronze at the back stick, but there\u2019s too much juice on the delivery and the ball sails out of play for a goal kick. Neither attack quite clicking yet. 20 min: England play out from the back. It\u2019s a risky venture, but they evade the US press and Russo scampers into acres of space down the left. She cuts back for Park who doesn\u2019t shoot this time, but isn\u2019t able to get a cross into the box. 18 min: Sears again makes good ground down the right and crosses long. Horan tries to bring the ball down but can\u2019t sort her feet out, allowing Naz to clear. England can\u2019t keep giving Sears so much room out on the right, though. 17 min: Stanway sprays a diagonal pass towards Mead on the left flank. That\u2019s a fine ball to release Mead on the attack. Mead makes it as far as the box before cutting back for Park, who sends a wild shot high and wide right. Mead, still in space and desirous of the return pass, tells it as she sees it. Not happy. 15 min: \u2026 so having said that, England do get out, Russo spinning the combative Coffey and drawing a cynical tug on the shirt that earns the US midfielder the first yellow card of the evening. Coffey, bang to rights, doesn\u2019t bother complaining. 14 min: Coffey snaps into a tackle in the centre circle to launch another USA attack. Nothing comes of this phase, but England can\u2019t get out. 13 min: Coffey and Horan exchange passes down the left, forcing Bronze into the concession of a corner. Bronze heads the corner clear, but then Fox picks up possession and tears down the right touchline. Fox\u2019s cross is deflected away from danger \u2026 this time. USA enjoying plenty of joy down this right flank already. 12 min: Sears probes down the right again, but this time there\u2019s no way around Greenwood and she walks the ball out for a goal kick. 10 min: Horan is fine to continue. On the touchline, her boss Emma Hayes casually takes a swig from a bottle of fruit squash. Much nicer than that aforementioned flat lager, and isotonic to boot. 8 min: Stanway stands on Horan\u2019s foot. All accidental, but the US captain requires some treatment. The game stops. 7 min: Walsh takes a loose touch 30 yards from her own goal and is extremely fortunate that Horan makes a mess of stealing the ball. Stanway has already been caught snoozing, too. England aren\u2019t being given a moment to rest. 6 min: USA suddenly take it up a notch, Sears bursting into space down the right and crossing low for Thompson, who has time to take a couple of touches before launching a rising shot towards the top right. Earps turns around the post and receives the ovation she deserves for a superb save. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. 4 min: USA stroke it around the back patiently. Everyone sizing things up at the moment. The big crowd bubbling along nicely nonetheless. 2 min: Otherwise, it\u2019s a uneventful start as both teams take turns to get a feel of the ball. 12 secs: Naz makes good down the right but her cross is too high for Russo in the middle. Naeher claims. What a start that could have been! After everyone takes a knee of equality, England get the ball rolling. The USA won the anthems, incidentally. By some distance. After a laser show that would put Jean-Michel Jarre to shame \u2013 an up-to-the-minute reference for all you pop kids out there \u2013 the teams emerge from the tunnel. England in white, the USA in second-choice blue and red. An 83,000-strong crackle of anticipation around Wembley. The Americans entertain themselves with an elaborate series of high-fives. Anthems and action to follow. Sarina Wiegman speaks to ITV. \u201cThis is the collaboration I want to see tonight \u2026 some little tweaks \u2026 I want to see both goalkeepers, I do not want to decide now \u2026 last time at Wembley, Hannah Hampton was in goal and now Mary Earps gets her opportunity \u2026 Emma Hayes does a tremendous job over there \u2026 you absolutely want to beat each other \u2026 she will make tweaks so we have to be sharp.\u201d Hayes smiled broadly through every nanosecond of that interview. She\u2019s clearly enjoying her new role immensely, which should be no surprise given her current 92 percent win ratio. In fact, the only time she wasn\u2019t caught wearing a sunny grin was when ITV showed footage of her pulling a pint in a Camden pub earlier this week for PR purposes, then grimacing as she had a sip of it. To be fair, she\u2019s not a fan of beer, and in any case the ale looked a bit flat. Emma Hayes, relaxed and jovial, speaks to ITV. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back here \u2026 I feel a bit bad always talking about how happy I am! \u2026 I needed to slow down \u2026 playing different opponents in different stadiums, it feels new and exciting \u2026 you feel a little bit like a grandparent! \u2026 they come into camp and are all happy to see you \u2026 you give them the best time ever \u2026 hopefully win a couple of medals \u2026 it\u2019s a completely different way of coaching \u2026 life is so short and I want to have a good time \u2026 I want to be the best coach I can be \u2026 I\u2019ve been put on this earth to do the best I can for the women\u2019s game.\u201d England make four changes to their starting XI in the wake of the unconvincing 2-1 win over South Africa last month. Lucy Bronze, Jess Carter, Keira Walsh and Alessia Russo take the places of Esme Morgan, Grace Clinton and Chloe Kelly, who drop to the bench, and Maya Le Tissier, who is missing after suffering concussion while playing for Manchester United last weekend. Seven of today\u2019s USWNT starters played when these teams last met at Wembley in 2022. Alyssa Naeher, Naomi Girma, Emily Fox, Sam Coffey, Rose Lavelle, Alyssa Thompson and captain Lindsey Horan were all on the wrong end of England\u2019s 2-1 win that day. Naeher, Horan and Lavelle are the only players who remain from the USA\u2019s 2-1 victory in the 2019 World Cup semis. The Triple Espresso front line of Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson \u2013 their nickname coined by Rodman live on NBC days before they won Olympic gold - are all out injured. England: Earps, Bronze, Carter, Williamson, Greenwood, Walsh, Naz, Park, Stanway, Mead, Russo. Subs: Moorhouse, Hampton, Bright, Turner, George, Morgan, Kirby, Mace, Blindkilde, Clinton, Kelly, Beever-Jones. USA: Naeher, Fox, Krueger, Sonnett, Girma, Coffey, Thompson, Lavelle, Horan, Williams, Sears. Subs: Haught, Davidson, Gaetino, Malonson, Sams, Albert, Yohannes, Nighswonger, Ryan, Hershfelt, Shaw, Sentnor. It\u2019s a clash of the titans, as the Lionesses taken on the USWNT at Wembley. England versus the USA. The world number two side versus the world number one. The European champions versus Olympic gold medallists. Sarina Wiegman v Emma Hayes. All perfectly poised, then \u2026 except that the USA have won their last nine and are unbeaten in 18, winning the Concacaf Gold Cup, the SheBelieves Cup and the Olympics along the way, while England\u2019s last three matches have been a nervy 0-0 draw in Sweden, a shambolic 3-4 home loss to Germany, and an extremely flattering 2-1 win over South Africa. That draw in Sweden, it must be said, secured Euro 2025 qualification for England, but fair to say one team is currently a lot closer to their best level than the other. A big test for the Lionesses, in other words, against the very best. Kick-off is at 5.20pm GMT. It\u2019s on!",

Of course, we know the USA is very dynamic, explosive and wanting to go forward,\u201d said Wiegman. \u201cWe defended very strongly as a team and found solutions to their overloads out wide well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hayes said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got two top teams. Sarina\u2019s an amazing coach. It was a good tactical match-up. I just enjoy coaching, I live in football matches, to be honest with you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hayes had been jovial before kick-off, declaring: \u201cLife is so short, I&nbsp;want&nbsp;to have a good time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The football did not quite deliver the good vibes the hyped-up crowd had been hoping for. After lasers, fireworks, smoke and thundering music, it was all a little bit flat, an intricate battle of strategy instead of a barnstormer.</p> \n<p>The visiting team were the relatively more organised and efficient side when on the ball in the first half, and their press stifled England when off it, limiting them to two touches in the area in the first half to the USA\u2019s 15 in England\u2019s. But Wiegman\u2019s side weren\u2019t particularly poor either.</p> \n<p>Jess Naz, making her third appearance for the Lionesses, was excellent ahead of Lucy Bronze on the right, tracking back to cover when the Chelsea full-back would go on a marauding run and causing problems for the USA at the back, although the quality of the final ball eluded her.</p> \n<p>With the action on the pitch lacking in bite, attention was easily drawn to the touchline, where arguably the two best managers in women\u2019s football were at work, gesticulating periodically, Hayes sometimes pausing with arms crossed, Wiegman with them clasped behind her back.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/nov/30/england-v-united-states-international-football-friendly-live\">England v United States: international football friendly \u2013 live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was a bit more energy after the restart, the crowd more vocal, willing the game poised on a knife-edge to tip one way or the other. Within four minutes, the net was bulging, the USA captain, Lindsey Horan, having poked in from close range, but the flag was up for offside. Hayes punched the air in glee before quickly doing so again in frustration.</p> \n<p>England were brighter too, there was more control and patience in possession. It was reflected in the stats, with the Lionesses going from two touches in the opposition box to 10 in the space of the next 20 minutes. \u201cWe want to go for a win. They wanted to go for a win too,\u201d said Wiegman.</p> \n<p>It was almost a disaster for the home side just past the hour mark, though, when Alex Greenwood was adjudged to have handled the ball in the area in blocking Yazmeen Ryan\u2019s shot. But replays showed the ball clearly came off the Manchester City defender\u2019s chest and the video assistant referee stepped in. Lina Lehtovaara overturned her decision after viewing the pitchside monitor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The arrival of Korbin Albert in place of Alyssa Thompson prompted the loudest reaction from the crowd in the first 73 minutes, boos ringing out for the player who had been forced to apologise for \u00adposting homophobic content on social media in March.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course, I understand the booing, and everybody is entitled to their opinions on it, without doubt,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cMy job is not to weigh in on the debate. I\u2019m a football coach. My job is to produce a football team. I\u2019ve sat down with her, I\u2019ve had several conversations with her in and around these things to make sure that the self-development piece is there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Experience arrived for England in the form of Fran Kirby and the Euros match-winner, Chloe Kelly, but the home team struggled to find gaps in a visiting backline marshalled by the exceptional centre-half Naomi Girma.</p> \n<p>It was the USA who looked the more likely to take the lead in the closing stages, but the stalemate was a fair result. Against top opposition, Hayes and Wiegman will have learned a lot and there is work to do. For Wiegman, that will have to be done quickly, with Nations League in the new year and England\u2019s defence of their European title in the summer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The gap between expectation and reality can be a big one and the tight chess match between England and the United States did not quite provide the action to match the clash-of-the-titans narrative that had been set up before the game. In front of 78,346 fans eager to see who would come away from the showpiece friendly in better shape \u2013 the European champions, led by Sarina Wiegman, or the Olympic gold medallists, led by the London native Emma Hayes \u2013 the answer was neither. \u201cIt was a very intense game. Of course, we know the USA is very dynamic, explosive and wanting to go forward,\u201d said Wiegman. \u201cWe defended very strongly as a team and found solutions to their overloads out wide well.\u201d Hayes said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got two top teams. Sarina\u2019s an amazing coach. It was a good tactical match-up. I just enjoy coaching, I live in football matches, to be honest with you.\u201d Hayes had been jovial before kick-off, declaring: \u201cLife is so short, I want to have a good time.\u201d The football did not quite deliver the good vibes the hyped-up crowd had been hoping for. After lasers, fireworks, smoke and thundering music, it was all a little bit flat, an intricate battle of strategy instead of a barnstormer. The visiting team were the relatively more organised and efficient side when on the ball in the first half, and their press stifled England when off it, limiting them to two touches in the area in the first half to the USA\u2019s 15 in England\u2019s. But Wiegman\u2019s side weren\u2019t particularly poor either. Jess Naz, making her third appearance for the Lionesses, was excellent ahead of Lucy Bronze on the right, tracking back to cover when the Chelsea full-back would go on a marauding run and causing problems for the USA at the back, although the quality of the final ball eluded her. With the action on the pitch lacking in bite, attention was easily drawn to the touchline, where arguably the two best managers in women\u2019s football were at work, gesticulating periodically, Hayes sometimes pausing with arms crossed, Wiegman with them clasped behind her back. There was a bit more energy after the restart, the crowd more vocal, willing the game poised on a knife-edge to tip one way or the other. Within four minutes, the net was bulging, the USA captain, Lindsey Horan, having poked in from close range, but the flag was up for offside. Hayes punched the air in glee before quickly doing so again in frustration. England were brighter too, there was more control and patience in possession. It was reflected in the stats, with the Lionesses going from two touches in the opposition box to 10 in the space of the next 20 minutes. \u201cWe want to go for a win. They wanted to go for a win too,\u201d said Wiegman. It was almost a disaster for the home side just past the hour mark, though, when Alex Greenwood was adjudged to have handled the ball in the area in blocking Yazmeen Ryan\u2019s shot. But replays showed the ball clearly came off the Manchester City defender\u2019s chest and the video assistant referee stepped in. Lina Lehtovaara overturned her decision after viewing the pitchside monitor. The arrival of Korbin Albert in place of Alyssa Thompson prompted the loudest reaction from the crowd in the first 73 minutes, boos ringing out for the player who had been forced to apologise for posting homophobic content on social media in March. \u201cOf course, I understand the booing, and everybody is entitled to their opinions on it, without doubt,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cMy job is not to weigh in on the debate. I\u2019m a football coach. My job is to produce a football team. I\u2019ve sat down with her, I\u2019ve had several conversations with her in and around these things to make sure that the self-development piece is there.\u201d Experience arrived for England in the form of Fran Kirby and the Euros match-winner, Chloe Kelly, but the home team struggled to find gaps in a visiting backline marshalled by the exceptional centre-half Naomi Girma. It was the USA who looked the more likely to take the lead in the closing stages, but the stalemate was a fair result. Against top opposition, Hayes and Wiegman will have learned a lot and there is work to do. For Wiegman, that will have to be done quickly, with Nations League in the new year and England\u2019s defence of their European title in the summer.",

After the Hezbollah-Israel agreement brought 13 months of fighting to a close last Wednesday, Bzeeh and his family arrived at their village of Zibqin in southern Lebanon to find their home ruined by an Israeli&nbsp;airstrike.</p> <p>Bzeeh immediately set to work, the wiry 18-year-old hefting piles of concrete and metal scrap off his driveway using a rusty shovel. His family watched as he worked, overlooking the street that they had left two months earlier, now lined by the burnt-out husks of their neighbours\u2019 homes.</p> <p>\u201cI feel overwhelmed. We came back to our land, our motherland, and there is so much damage here. But we will resist and stay here and fix our homes,\u201d Bzeeh said.</p> <p>He was not alone. His neighbours were already picking through the remains of their properties, hoping to find some heirlooms amid the rubble. In the days that would follow, hundreds of thousands of residents of south Lebanon would join them and a steady stream of cars backed up the highway for days.</p> <p>Most arrived to find similar scenes of destruction. There was no water, electricity or mobile phone service south of the Litani river, two months after Israel started its intensified aerial campaign and ground invasion of south Lebanon at the end of September. By the end of Israel\u2019s campaign, nearly 4,000 people had been killed in Lebanon, more than a million displaced and dozens of villages had been rendered uninhabitable.</p> <p>Despite the massive damage to their homes and death toll among their communities, many in south Lebanon viewed their very presence as a victory and a form of resistance.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, we are happy because we returned back here and we won the war. If you destroy all of our houses, we will stay here and we will resist because we are the [owners] of the land,\u201d Bzeeh said.</p> <p>Though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/displaced-return-to-southern-lebanon-amid-uneasy-ceasefire\">many residents had come back home</a> \u2013 with Israel still forbidding those living directly on the border from returning \u2013 the future of south Lebanon and the country was deeply uncertain. Hezbollah has claimed victory in its fight with Israel, proclaiming that Israel has failed to achieve any of its goals in Lebanon, including occupation of the south and destruction of the organisation.</p>    <p>However, it has acquiesced to demands that, prior to the offensive two months ago, it said were non-starters. It has not forced Israel to a ceasefire in Gaza, and it agreed to roll back its fighters north of the Litani river, about 20 miles from the border.</p> <p>The fighting has left the organisation, which for years has dominated Lebanon\u2019s domestic politics and served as a regional bogeyman for Israel and its allies, severely diminished. Its domestic opponents have called on the organisation to hand over its weapons to the state, insisting that it has passed its glory days.</p> <p>On Saturday, the Christian Lebanese Forces, the largest anti-Hezbollah bloc in Lebanon\u2019s parliament, held a session to discuss Lebanon\u2019s post-ceasefire reality. The leader of the Lebanese Forces, Samir Geagea, said that Hezbollah\u2019s weapons had become illegal after the approval of the ceasefire agreement and must be turned over to the army \u201cjust as the Lebanese Forces once did when they handed over their weapons.\u201d</p> <p>Under the terms of the ceasefire, the group\u2019s fighters in the south will be replaced by 10,000 Lebanese troops. The Lebanese army, chronically under-equipped and dwarfed in strength by Hezbollah, will be tasked with reasserting the state\u2019s power in south Lebanon and making sure that the militia does not rearm in the south.</p> <p>As it stands, the Lebanese army is tasked with internal security, not defending the country against foreign powers. Soldiers act as national police guards, rather than as a national fighting force.</p> <p>The ceasefire, however, has envisioned the army as capable of both ensuring that Hezbollah complies with the terms of the deal and protecting Lebanon from any encroachments by Israel on its sovereignty.</p> <p>The force has been crippled by Lebanon\u2019s five-year economic crisis, with soldiers earning just a few hundred dollars a month and lacking basic supplies. There is also a question of political will. Lebanon\u2019s delicate sectarian balance could be threatened if there was a confrontation between the army and Hezbollah.</p>    <p>Military experts have said that the army must be completely transformed and needs an infusion of international support if it hopes to protect Lebanese sovereignty.\u201cIf Israel attacks Lebanon, the Lebanese army will not be able to confront the Israeli tanks and missiles. The US wants the Lebanese army to be a police force, to maintain security,\u201d said Mounir Shehadeh, a retired general who oversaw the Lebanese government\u2019s coordination with UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon.</p> <p>Shehadeh explained that the army would need a true commitment from the international community to become a real, competent army. As part of this, it must be allowed to purchase advanced weaponry from western states, particularly, the US.</p> <p>In the first four days of the ceasefire, Israel has carried out multiple airstrikes in Lebanon on what it says were Hezbollah members violating the terms of the ceasefire. At least one of these airstrikes was in the Saida district of Lebanon, far north of where the ceasefire deal says Hezbollah must retreat. Hezbollah, though it had vowed to respond to ceasefire violations, has thus far not retaliated. The Lebanese army, for its part, said it would raise the issue with international mediators.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/30/nabatieh-lebanon-starts-to-rebuild-as-ceasefire-takes-effect\">\u2018Why would we wait?\u2019: Lebanon starts to rebuild as ceasefire takes effect</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the questions about Hezbollah\u2019s grip on power in the country and its supposed replacement as the protector of the country by the Lebanese military, the group and its supporters have taken the end of fighting as a cause for celebration.</p> <p>On Saturday, thousands of people gathered at the site of the Israeli airstrike which killed the three decades-long leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, holding Hezbollah flags and candles. The ceremony was meant to commemorate Nasrallah\u2019s death and chart a path forward after a year filled with immeasurable loss.</p> <p>In Zibqin, Bzeeh was also uncertain about his future. The 18-year-old, now that the war was over, had to contend with the more mundane, but equally serious, aspects of his life. He would return to his studies as a first-year university student, studying finance.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very confusing, the circumstances here in the country. I will work in banking, but not in Lebanon,\u201d Bzeeh said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mohammed Bzeeh spent the first hours of the ceasefire cleaning. After the Hezbollah-Israel agreement brought 13 months of fighting to a close last Wednesday, Bzeeh and his family arrived at their village of Zibqin in southern Lebanon to find their home ruined by an Israeli airstrike. Bzeeh immediately set to work, the wiry 18-year-old hefting piles of concrete and metal scrap off his driveway using a rusty shovel. His family watched as he worked, overlooking the street that they had left two months earlier, now lined by the burnt-out husks of their neighbours\u2019 homes. \u201cI feel overwhelmed. We came back to our land, our motherland, and there is so much damage here. But we will resist and stay here and fix our homes,\u201d Bzeeh said. He was not alone. His neighbours were already picking through the remains of their properties, hoping to find some heirlooms amid the rubble. In the days that would follow, hundreds of thousands of residents of south Lebanon would join them and a steady stream of cars backed up the highway for days. Most arrived to find similar scenes of destruction. There was no water, electricity or mobile phone service south of the Litani river, two months after Israel started its intensified aerial campaign and ground invasion of south Lebanon at the end of September. By the end of Israel\u2019s campaign, nearly 4,000 people had been killed in Lebanon, more than a million displaced and dozens of villages had been rendered uninhabitable. Despite the massive damage to their homes and death toll among their communities, many in south Lebanon viewed their very presence as a victory and a form of resistance. \u201cObviously, we are happy because we returned back here and we won the war. If you destroy all of our houses, we will stay here and we will resist because we are the [owners] of the land,\u201d Bzeeh said. Though many residents had come back home \u2013 with Israel still forbidding those living directly on the border from returning \u2013 the future of south Lebanon and the country was deeply uncertain. Hezbollah has claimed victory in its fight with Israel, proclaiming that Israel has failed to achieve any of its goals in Lebanon, including occupation of the south and destruction of the organisation. However, it has acquiesced to demands that, prior to the offensive two months ago, it said were non-starters. It has not forced Israel to a ceasefire in Gaza, and it agreed to roll back its fighters north of the Litani river, about 20 miles from the border. The fighting has left the organisation, which for years has dominated Lebanon\u2019s domestic politics and served as a regional bogeyman for Israel and its allies, severely diminished. Its domestic opponents have called on the organisation to hand over its weapons to the state, insisting that it has passed its glory days. On Saturday, the Christian Lebanese Forces, the largest anti-Hezbollah bloc in Lebanon\u2019s parliament, held a session to discuss Lebanon\u2019s post-ceasefire reality. The leader of the Lebanese Forces, Samir Geagea, said that Hezbollah\u2019s weapons had become illegal after the approval of the ceasefire agreement and must be turned over to the army \u201cjust as the Lebanese Forces once did when they handed over their weapons.\u201d Under the terms of the ceasefire, the group\u2019s fighters in the south will be replaced by 10,000 Lebanese troops. The Lebanese army, chronically under-equipped and dwarfed in strength by Hezbollah, will be tasked with reasserting the state\u2019s power in south Lebanon and making sure that the militia does not rearm in the south. As it stands, the Lebanese army is tasked with internal security, not defending the country against foreign powers. Soldiers act as national police guards, rather than as a national fighting force. The ceasefire, however, has envisioned the army as capable of both ensuring that Hezbollah complies with the terms of the deal and protecting Lebanon from any encroachments by Israel on its sovereignty. The force has been crippled by Lebanon\u2019s five-year economic crisis, with soldiers earning just a few hundred dollars a month and lacking basic supplies. There is also a question of political will. Lebanon\u2019s delicate sectarian balance could be threatened if there was a confrontation between the army and Hezbollah. Military experts have said that the army must be completely transformed and needs an infusion of international support if it hopes to protect Lebanese sovereignty.\u201cIf Israel attacks Lebanon, the Lebanese army will not be able to confront the Israeli tanks and missiles. The US wants the Lebanese army to be a police force, to maintain security,\u201d said Mounir Shehadeh, a retired general who oversaw the Lebanese government\u2019s coordination with UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon. Shehadeh explained that the army would need a true commitment from the international community to become a real, competent army. As part of this, it must be allowed to purchase advanced weaponry from western states, particularly, the US. In the first four days of the ceasefire, Israel has carried out multiple airstrikes in Lebanon on what it says were Hezbollah members violating the terms of the ceasefire. At least one of these airstrikes was in the Saida district of Lebanon, far north of where the ceasefire deal says Hezbollah must retreat. Hezbollah, though it had vowed to respond to ceasefire violations, has thus far not retaliated. The Lebanese army, for its part, said it would raise the issue with international mediators. Despite the questions about Hezbollah\u2019s grip on power in the country and its supposed replacement as the protector of the country by the Lebanese military, the group and its supporters have taken the end of fighting as a cause for celebration. On Saturday, thousands of people gathered at the site of the Israeli airstrike which killed the three decades-long leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, holding Hezbollah flags and candles. The ceremony was meant to commemorate Nasrallah\u2019s death and chart a path forward after a year filled with immeasurable loss. In Zibqin, Bzeeh was also uncertain about his future. The 18-year-old, now that the war was over, had to contend with the more mundane, but equally serious, aspects of his life. He would return to his studies as a first-year university student, studying finance. \u201cIt\u2019s very confusing, the circumstances here in the country. I will work in banking, but not in Lebanon,\u201d Bzeeh said.",

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran refused blindfolds, and sang as they stood before a firing squad of 12. They were killed at 12.35am. There were other names on the list that morning. Six further prisoners were also executed. But one woman scheduled to be killed that day was spared, granted a \u201cmiracle\u201d last-minute reprieve. Last week, nearly a decade since that morning, Mary Jane Veloso was granted a further amnesty: she will be repatriated to her native Philippines. \u201cMary Jane Veloso is coming home,\u201d the Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, announced. \u201c[Her] case has been a long and difficult journey.\u201d Now, the five members of the Bali Nine still in Indonesian prisons are also potentially on the verge of coming home. The Bali Nine were nine young Australians arrested on the island in April 2005, caught in a crude attempt to smuggle 8kg of heroin to Australia, four of them with tightly wrapped packages of drugs clumsily taped to their bodies. The father of Scott Rush, one of the nine Australians, concerned his son might have been travelling to Bali to commit a criminal offence, had rung a lawyer, Bob Myers, who had tipped off the Australian federal police in the hope they would intercept Rush before he left Australia. Instead, the AFP alerted Indonesian authorities, despite knowing it could expose the Australians to the death penalty. Nineteen years on, five of the group remain in Indonesian prisons, serving life sentences: Matthew Norman, Si-Yi Chen, Rush, Michael Czugaj and Martin Stephens are in jails across Bali and Java. Chan and Sukumaran were executed; Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen died of cancer in 2018; and Renae Lawrence, the only woman in the group, was repatriated to Australia in 2018 after having her sentence commuted.

On top of this, there were challenges around misleading labelling. In 2023, researchers from the Institute for Sustainable Futures analysed 26 bioplastic products sold in Australia and produced by 14 companies, including plastic bags, coffee pods, postage backs and balloons. The research found that nearly one-third of sustainability claims about the products were potentially misleading, including that not all that claimed to be compostable were certified to the Australian Standards.

As observed by Bob Brown, environmental campaigner and former senator, it seems utterly implausible that the world\u2019s biggest freshwater invertebrate species \u201cis not in the Nile, Amazon or Mississippi but in the comparatively tiny west-flowing rivers\u201d of this forest in Tasmania.</p> <p>Crucially, Takayna is also a stronghold for the endangered Tasmanian devil.

The relative health of Takayna\u2019s devil population has continued to surprise researchers.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>There are many things</strong> about Takayna that we don\u2019t yet know. Rainforests, particularly ancient ones, are so incredibly ecologically complex they can shelter secrets for generations. For example, species can thrive in pockets of wilderness beyond our reach, eluding even the most skilled and committed researchers.</p>    <p>But it\u2019s not just unknown species that are still being discovered in the area. There are also significant accounts of known endangered species that have been found to be flourishing here, in contradiction to all scientific knowledge.</p> <p>One example is the Tasmanian masked owl. This owl is a subspecies of the Australian masked owl, a large bird with a broad, heart-shaped face and dappled white-and-brown feathers (the Latin word <em>castaneus</em> means \u201cchestnut-coloured\u201d). </p> <p>Tasmanian masked owls are deeply territorial creatures, with each breeding pair occupying a massive territory of roughly 2000ha. Charley Gros, an ecologist and biodiversity researcher from the University of Tasmania, says this makes them wildly elusive. \u201cThey\u2019re very quick; they\u2019ll hide most of the time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear them when you study them and spend some time in their territory \u2013 but to see them is very, very rare.\u201d</p> <p>There are thought to be only about 1,000 individual owls left, and the only way researchers have found to track them is through blind navigation of forest calls over exhausting nights in the wilderness. Until very recently it was thought that masked owls exclusively inhabited dry eucalypt forests, such as the ones surrounding Hobart \u2013 largely because that is where people witnessed them on the rare occasion that one made its presence known.</p> <p>However, in recent years, activists camped out in the dense forests of Takayna began to hear their calls. Gros says there was a huge amount of resistance to this idea from scientists, who told him that it simply wasn\u2019t possible. He was told the rainforest was not the right habitat for the masked owl \u2013 and that they simply were not there.</p> <p>Gros, intent on proving the masked owl\u2019s existence in Takayna, marched into the forest with a photographer. They slept beneath the canopy for weeks, regularly hiking for kilometres back to the forest\u2019s edge to recharge their equipment. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to expect \u2026 but there was a tiny thread of hope, so we just held on to it very tightly,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>The pair slept during the day and picked up the recording instruments and cameras throughout the night for weeks on end. They heard the calls while they sat awake in the darkness, but it wasn\u2019t until their second week that one of the owls finally took an interest in them and landed at their campsite.</p> <p>\u201cIt was at dusk,\u201d Gros says. \u201cShe just sat there and [my photographer] was awake and he was able to put the light on and take the photo. She just hung out for five minutes and looked at us over the campfire. She was very curious, and it was a beautiful experience.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this remarkable interaction, it wasn\u2019t until the pair returned to their homes that they realised what they had recorded during their time in the forest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/24/spiky-blue-devils-and-chocolate-lilies-victorian-grassland-bursts-with-wildflowers-after-ecological-reset\">Spiky blue devils and chocolate lilies: Victorian grassland bursts with wildflowers after ecological \u2018reset\u2019 </a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI unpacked the SD cards and I started to listen to them and the first time I heard the calls I thought, \u2018Yes!

Gros believes protecting Takayna through world heritage listing is all the more important because habitat preservation is key to the owl\u2019s survival. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard, because I\u2019ve been studying them, and I know that there are some territories that have been logged and sometimes I will drive down those roads and all I will see are ghosts \u2013 the owls that we have lost,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are gone for ever. That\u2019s why we need to protect their habitat.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>That Takayna </strong><strong>fulfils</strong><strong> the</strong> criteria for world heritage listing set out by Unesco is an incontrovertible fact. However, whether or not an area of immense natural value fulfils these criteria, or those set out by any other organisation, should not dictate whether or not we protect them. While a world heritage listing ensures some legal responsibility for looking after a natural place, there are also inherent moral responsibilities that should not be overlooked.</p> <p>When I ask Gros what he thinks about the world heritage proposal, he agrees that, as a researcher, Takayna more than adequately meets the Unesco criteria. But there is also something innately spiritual in the way he speaks about the place \u2013 something that should not be ignored when we are assessing a place\u2019s ecological value or attempting to whittle this down into legislative jargon. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talk about the protected species but what about the fungi on the ground?

After I press through metres of the dense, dry shrubs that skirt the forest floor, the rainforest quickly opens into a dewy landscape of verdant greens bathed in golden light. The ground is a ballroom floor, moist to the touch, carpeted in soft mosses and punctuated by broad myrtle trunks. Tiny ferns unfurl towards the canopy, where shafts of sunlight streak through the treetops. It is an overwhelmingly beautiful place. In a world experiencing an increasingly rapid montage of alarming climate events caused by a warming planet, Tasmania\u2019s Takayna presents an alternate world, one that is primal and untouched by the ravages of industrialisation. I pause for a moment on a fallen tree trunk, in a place where a rich network of delicate spiderwebs, lichens and leaves capture my gaze. Old-growth forests (forests unscathed by industrial-scale human development) are complex places. \u201cThey have structural components that are completely absent from a forest that could be 150 or 200 years old, so they\u2019re essential for biodiversity,\u201d says Prof Hugh Possingham, a conservation researcher and Queensland\u2019s former chief scientist.

When I dream, if I\u2019m at a height I\u2019ll be freaking out and wake up in a sweat. I\u2019ve jumped out of planes! They don\u2019t bother me when I am awake.</p> <p>I\u2019ve actually never told anyone that. It feels really good to get that off my chest.</p> <p><strong>If animals could talk, who would be the nicest?</strong></p> <p>I think the nicest, most level-headed animal you could talk to would be a tortoise. They\u2019ve been around, they\u2019ve seen stuff. They know what\u2019s up. They exude this sense of knowledge and wisdom. I\u2019ve always thought it\u2019d be cool to have a conversation with a tortoise.</p> <p>We had a tortoise that lived to be over 175 years old. <a href=\"https://australiazoo.com.au/about-us/history/harriet/\">Her name was Harriet. She was collected by Charles Darwin.</a> She passed away some years ago, but I think she would be the coolest animal to talk to. I think she\u2019d have some serious stories to tell.</p>    <p><strong>What\u2019s the best lesson you\u2019ve learned from someone you\u2019ve worked with?</strong></p> <p>My dad [Steve Irwin] always used to say, \u201cYou need to treat every living being the way you wish to be treated.\u201d For him, that meant not only people but animals. Try to stand up for those who don\u2019t have a voice, whether that is wildlife or human beings. There\u2019s plenty of areas around the world where people don\u2019t have the same opportunities as we do and there\u2019s plenty of places where our environment is disappearing at a frightening rate. Dad was very passionate about giving a voice to the voiceless, and he would always say, treat everyone how you want to be treated and you\u2019ll have a really happy life. That is the most important thing, even if someone\u2019s bugging you. Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s been your most memorable interaction with a fan?</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s been some really interesting ones. Now everyone wants selfies but back in the day, people would ask you for an autograph. People will often ask me to sign their phone case, but one person came up and said, \u201cCan you sign my forehead?\u201d I replied, \u201cI can, but should I?\u201d Someone once got me to sign their arm and they got it tattooed, which was amazing.</p> <p>I said to this person, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tattoo my signature to your forehead.\u201d Thank goodness they didn\u2019t. But it was strange they wanted me to do it.</p> <p>Also, this has happened to us a couple of times \u2013 I will go into a bathroom stall and someone holds out a roll of toilet paper with a pen underneath the gap between the stalls. I\u2019m busy mate, maybe catch me later?</p> <p><strong>Which animal do you wish more people appreciated?</strong></p> <p>Crocodiles. I absolutely love them. They are such a misunderstood animal, because anything with big teeth and no fur is treated like a dinosaur. There\u2019s a lot more to them than meets the eye. They\u2019re one of the most charismatic animals that I work with. They are very intelligent and they have their own personalities, which I love.</p> <p>I get to work with pretty much any animal that you can name, and there is no animal that makes you feel as small as a crocodile does. When a big crocodile is striking out of the water at you, you feel insignificant, in the best way. You realise, I am just one humble part of a big tapestry of life. Whoa, that got very deep!</p> <p>I also have a Komodo dragon at home named Indah (Bahasa for beautiful) and she is one of the sweetest animals I\u2019ve ever met. She is like a little puppy dog. She\u2019ll curl up in your lap and give you a cuddle. She\u2019s just gorgeous. It\u2019s the maligned ones that often end up being the cutest and the most fun to be around.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the oldest thing you own, and why do you still have it?</strong></p> <p>I have some traditional Maasai weaponry that my dad was given by a Maasai tribe. They are some really cool, incredibly well built spears that had been passed down. Dad had them for a long time and I now have them. A lot of the oldest stuff I have is Dad\u2019s stuff. I\u2019ve still got one of his watches, which I had restored. It is very important to me. I\u2019m very sentimental with things \u2013 I think you develop that when you lose someone significant at a young age. Suddenly, Dad\u2019s watch becomes the most important thing I own. I wouldn\u2019t trade anything for that watch, and it doesn\u2019t even work.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a party trick?</strong></p> <p>I can do the worm! Sometimes when I\u2019m asked a question I\u2019m unsure about, I\u2019ll just do the worm. When I was at the Logies, I was asked a question about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/07/raygun-retires-rachael-gunn-competitive-breaking-australian-olympic-breakdancer\">Raygun</a> that put her in a very negative light. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna say anything negative about Raygun, she\u2019s cool.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, Raygun, watch out. I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d And I just started doing the worm down the red carpet.</p> <p>Also I can play guitar. I\u2019m not like Ken in Barbie \u2013 let me play at you! \u2013 but if it is requested, I will. Not to toot my own horn, but the song I sing really well is A Boy Named Sue by Johnny Cash.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The next season of I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! starts on 19 January on Channel 10</em></p></li> </ul>",

Her name was Harriet. She was collected by Charles Darwin. She passed away some years ago, but I think she would be the coolest animal to talk to. I think she\u2019d have some serious stories to tell. What\u2019s the best lesson you\u2019ve learned from someone you\u2019ve worked with? My dad [Steve Irwin] always used to say, \u201cYou need to treat every living being the way you wish to be treated.\u201d For him, that meant not only people but animals. Try to stand up for those who don\u2019t have a voice, whether that is wildlife or human beings. There\u2019s plenty of areas around the world where people don\u2019t have the same opportunities as we do and there\u2019s plenty of places where our environment is disappearing at a frightening rate. Dad was very passionate about giving a voice to the voiceless, and he would always say, treat everyone how you want to be treated and you\u2019ll have a really happy life. That is the most important thing, even if someone\u2019s bugging you. Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect. What\u2019s been your most memorable interaction with a fan? There\u2019s been some really interesting ones. Now everyone wants selfies but back in the day, people would ask you for an autograph. People will often ask me to sign their phone case, but one person came up and said, \u201cCan you sign my forehead?\u201d I replied, \u201cI can, but should I?\u201d Someone once got me to sign their arm and they got it tattooed, which was amazing. I said to this person, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tattoo my signature to your forehead.\u201d Thank goodness they didn\u2019t. But it was strange they wanted me to do it. Also, this has happened to us a couple of times \u2013 I will go into a bathroom stall and someone holds out a roll of toilet paper with a pen underneath the gap between the stalls. I\u2019m busy mate, maybe catch me later? Which animal do you wish more people appreciated? Crocodiles. I absolutely love them. They are such a misunderstood animal, because anything with big teeth and no fur is treated like a dinosaur. There\u2019s a lot more to them than meets the eye. They\u2019re one of the most charismatic animals that I work with. They are very intelligent and they have their own personalities, which I love. I get to work with pretty much any animal that you can name, and there is no animal that makes you feel as small as a crocodile does. When a big crocodile is striking out of the water at you, you feel insignificant, in the best way. You realise, I am just one humble part of a big tapestry of life. Whoa, that got very deep! I also have a Komodo dragon at home named Indah (Bahasa for beautiful) and she is one of the sweetest animals I\u2019ve ever met. She is like a little puppy dog. She\u2019ll curl up in your lap and give you a cuddle. She\u2019s just gorgeous. It\u2019s the maligned ones that often end up being the cutest and the most fun to be around. What\u2019s the oldest thing you own, and why do you still have it? I have some traditional Maasai weaponry that my dad was given by a Maasai tribe. They are some really cool, incredibly well built spears that had been passed down. Dad had them for a long time and I now have them. A lot of the oldest stuff I have is Dad\u2019s stuff. I\u2019ve still got one of his watches, which I had restored. It is very important to me. I\u2019m very sentimental with things \u2013 I think you develop that when you lose someone significant at a young age. Suddenly, Dad\u2019s watch becomes the most important thing I own. I wouldn\u2019t trade anything for that watch, and it doesn\u2019t even work. Do you have a party trick? I can do the worm! Sometimes when I\u2019m asked a question I\u2019m unsure about, I\u2019ll just do the worm. When I was at the Logies, I was asked a question about Raygun that put her in a very negative light. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna say anything negative about Raygun, she\u2019s cool.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, Raygun, watch out. I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d And I just started doing the worm down the red carpet. Also I can play guitar. I\u2019m not like Ken in Barbie \u2013 let me play at you! \u2013 but if it is requested, I will. Not to toot my own horn, but the song I sing really well is A Boy Named Sue by Johnny Cash. The next season of I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! starts on 19 January on Channel 10",

The letter described a \u201cpattern of behaviour\u201d by the MasterChef presenter that \u201cclearly fails to meet the sexual harassment and bullying standards that prohibit unwelcome sexual advances and sexual innuendo\u201d. It was announced on Thursday that Wallace would be stepping back from his role on MasterChef while allegations of historical misconduct are investigated. An investigation by BBC News revealed that Wallace is facing allegations of inappropriate sexual comments from 13 people who worked with him over a 17-year period. Channel 5 is also looking into allegations of inappropriate behaviour by the presenter while making the programme Gregg Wallace\u2019s Big Weekends in 2019. The 2022 letter, seen by the Observer, contained the experiences of several women, and detailed some of the allegations reported last week by the BBC, including complaints of sexualised comments and of Wallace appearing topless in front of colleagues. It was sent to the BBC four years after Wallace had already been issued with a formal warning following an HR investigation into his behaviour. It emerged last night that five years earlier, in 2017, Wallace was warned by a BBC executive that his conduct on set was \u201cunacceptable and cannot continue\u201d, after the broadcaster Aasmah Mir, who appeared on the 12th series of Celebrity MasterChef, complained about sexist comments Wallace had made during filming.

Schmidt earned his stripes by steadying sinking ships before launching ambitious campaigns that ended in glory. Australia may not be ready to beat the truly best teams just yet, but they are getting closer.",

      "body": "<p>The \u201cwar on woke\u201d has a new target and her name is the Wicked Witch of the West. If you\u2019re a fan of the musical <em>Wicked, </em>you\u2019ll also know her as Elphaba, the moniker imagined by Gregory Maguire in his 1995 prequel to L Frank Baum\u2019s <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. </em>As played by Margaret Hamilton in the 1939 movie, she was the nemesis of Judy Garland\u2019s Dorothy; as played this year by the musical theatre star Cynthia Erivo, she has conservative men across Britain and America bursting their blood vessels.</p> <p>Since Maguire came up with his novel \u2013 an extravagant piece of fan-fiction that suggests this \u201cwitch\u201d might simply have been misunderstood \u2013 it has been reinterpreted as a stage musical and now as a movie in two parts. <em>Wicked\u2019</em>s target market consists of teenage girls who see themselves in this backstory for Elphaba and her college-friend-turned-rival, Glinda the Good Witch. In the 21 years since Stephen Schwartz\u2019s adaptation opened on Broadway, the show has been a cult phenomenon among young musical fans, blithely ignored by everyone else. Now the screen version has brought into mainstream conversation and the land of Oz<em> </em>has become a battleground in America\u2019s culture war.</p> <p>As a musical, <em>Wicked </em>is harmless to the point of vapid. Winnie Holzman\u2019s storyline for the show is a more anodyne affair than Maguire\u2019s hallucinatory fever dream of a book, which included bestiality and orgies. It features Elphaba as a talented girl arriving at a magical college, only to be bullied by Glinda and a clique of rosy-cheeked sycophants because she happens to have been born with green skin. This is <em>Mean Girls</em> meets Hogwarts. It has two songs you\u2019ll remember: Popular,<em> </em>in which Glinda reveals the secrets of social success, and Defying Gravity,<em> </em>in which Elphaba vows to pursue excellence and fight prejudice. <em>Wicked </em>is sweet and fun and ultimately forgettable.</p> <p>All of which makes it sad to watch Jon M Chu\u2019s movie become a flashpoint for grown adults. Since opening last weekend, <em>Wicked</em> has been subject to increasingly rabid media attacks. Some of this follows a familiar pattern: outrage for clicks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Well-funded political marketeers are turning key cultural moments into wedge issues</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is no surprise that Erivo, a black woman who describes herself as queer, has been the target of particular bile.</p> <p>Yet take a look at the organised and powerful social media accounts pushing attacks on Erivo, and it becomes clear that Hollywood is facing a new type of challenge. <em>Wicked </em>has been released into a landscape in which well-funded political marketeers are adept at turning key cultural moments into wedge issues. These are darker arts than anything conjured by the Wicked Witch of the West. Film studios need to decide whether to respond by leaning into the politics of polarisation, ramping up a strategy that already targets movies at different segments of the US electorate, or by making the case for blockbusters that can still bring progressives and conservatives together.</p> <p>The attacks on <em>Wicked</em> range from the plausible to the overtly ridiculous. British media outlets objected to a <a href=\"https://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-us/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-wicked\">British Board of Film Classification note</a> that expounded on its PG rating by explaining that the movie featured \u201cdiscrimination\u201d. \u201cSeeing beloved characters being mistreated, especially when Elphaba\u2019s skin-colour is used to demonise her as the \u2018Wicked Witch\u2019, may be upsetting and poignant for some audiences,\u201d says the advice.</p> <p>Piers Morgan was among those who denounced this as the working of the \u201cwoke brigade\u201d. Has he seen <em>Wicked</em>? Sure, BBFC advice to parents can be po-faced and limiting. But the BBFC has been issuing such warnings since 1912 \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Manger_to_the_Cross\">following a </a><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Manger_to_the_Cross\">Daily Mail</a></em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Manger_to_the_Cross\"> campaign</a> against an early screen depiction of Jesus \u2013 which hardly makes it the cutting edge of wokery. Morgan\u2019s complaint seems to be that it is \u201cnonsense\u201d to claim that a movie about bullying based on skin-colour could be understood as an allegory for racism. Which is a bit like objecting to a note that <em>The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe </em>might be an allegory for Christianity. </p> <p>More serious attacks on the film, however, have emerged from a cluster of high-impact, anonymous accounts on X (formerly Twitter) that have flourished in the era of Elon Musk. One such, an account named \u201cEnd Wokeness\u201d, was set up a few months after Musk bought the platform and already boasts 3.3 million followers; its banner image is a photograph of a bloodied Donald Trump raising his fist after surviving an assassination attempt. Elsewhere on X, an account named \u201cDefiant L\u2019s\u201d has joined the game. It is linked to a website named \u201cResist the Mainstream\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-09-12/how-a-hyperpartisan-news-site-found-fame-on-alternative-social-networks\">which the Bloomberg news agency has traced</a> to a Macedonian-based disinformation network pushing conspiracy theories about Covid-19 and Trump\u2019s 2020 electoral loss. Defiant L\u2019s has been endorsed by Elon Musk as \u201cone of the best accounts on X\u201d.</p> <p>The attacks on <em>Wicked </em>promoted by these accounts have received widespread coverage. They blame Erivo\u2019s casting on \u201cwokeness\u201d and complain about munchkins being played by actors of average height, instead of dwarves as in the Oz movie. A video clip pushed out by the End Wokeness account went viral after it showed Erivo and her co-star, the singer Ariana Grande, holding hands emotionally while a reporter asked them to comment on the LGBT community \u201cholding space\u201d for the song Defying Gravity<em> </em>in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s election victory. (The phrase \u201cholding space\u201d refers to a trend for fans to post lyrics from the song online and reflect on their meaning.) What seems to have been missed by other commentators, however, is the role of such social media accounts in pushing the clip, one of hundreds in a packed press tour, to mainstream attention. These are familiar tricks in Trumpworld.</p> <p>Back in 2022, it was reported that the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/daily-wire-amber-heard-johnny-depp/\">Daily Wire website, led by Ben Shapiro, had spent between $35,000 and $47,000</a> promoting misleading video clips and news articles attacking Amber Heard, during her defamation battle with her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. The clear intention was to warn young men that the 21st century had become hostile terrain thanks to the excesses of feminism: Trump is the political solution to this problem. End Wokeness and Defying L\u2019s are part of Shapiro\u2019s shared ecosystem. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zZeZFs5KLQ\">The open-source analyst Ryan McBeth has alleged</a> that the former account is run by the alt-right activist Jack Posobiec, whom the Southern Poverty Law Centre categorises as an extremist <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/jack-posobiec\">with alleged neo-Nazi connections</a>. Related accounts amplified recent attacks on the black actress Halle Bailey when she was cast in Disney\u2019s remake of the <em>Little Mermaid,</em> and Colombian-Polish actress Rachel Zegler when cast in <em>Snow White.</em></p> <p>British commentators jumping on the anti-woke bandwagon likely have no idea that they\u2019re doing the work of far-right disinformation specialists. Nor have members of the cast of <em>Wicked </em>helped themselves by gushing through an overexposed press tour. But our culture sphere needs to wake up to the fact that our responses to major movie events are increasingly being shaped by a white supremacist media operating out of Texas \u2013 or, in this case, Macedonia.</p> <p>Hollywood studios would do well to call out this misinformation when they see it. Their other option is to cater exclusively to one side or other of the political divide. That would prove bad for business and bad for the rest of us.</p> <p>\u2022 Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and culture</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A video clip pushed out by the End Wokeness account went viral after it showed Erivo and her co-star, the singer Ariana Grande, holding hands emotionally while a reporter asked them to comment on the LGBT community \u201cholding space\u201d for the song Defying Gravity in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s election victory. (The phrase \u201cholding space\u201d refers to a trend for fans to post lyrics from the song online and reflect on their meaning.) What seems to have been missed by other commentators, however, is the role of such social media accounts in pushing the clip, one of hundreds in a packed press tour, to mainstream attention. These are familiar tricks in Trumpworld. Back in 2022, it was reported that the Daily Wire website, led by Ben Shapiro, had spent between $35,000 and $47,000 promoting misleading video clips and news articles attacking Amber Heard, during her defamation battle with her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. The clear intention was to warn young men that the 21st century had become hostile terrain thanks to the excesses of feminism: Trump is the political solution to this problem. End Wokeness and Defying L\u2019s are part of Shapiro\u2019s shared ecosystem. The open-source analyst Ryan McBeth has alleged that the former account is run by the alt-right activist Jack Posobiec, whom the Southern Poverty Law Centre categorises as an extremist with alleged neo-Nazi connections. Related accounts amplified recent attacks on the black actress Halle Bailey when she was cast in Disney\u2019s remake of the Little Mermaid, and Colombian-Polish actress Rachel Zegler when cast in Snow White. British commentators jumping on the anti-woke bandwagon likely have no idea that they\u2019re doing the work of far-right disinformation specialists. Nor have members of the cast of Wicked helped themselves by gushing through an overexposed press tour. But our culture sphere needs to wake up to the fact that our responses to major movie events are increasingly being shaped by a white supremacist media operating out of Texas \u2013 or, in this case, Macedonia. Hollywood studios would do well to call out this misinformation when they see it. Their other option is to cater exclusively to one side or other of the political divide. That would prove bad for business and bad for the rest of us. \u2022 Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and culture Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "body": "<p>This story begins in a fever. It was the spring of 2021 and I\u2019d contracted my first bout of Covid. Confined to bed, I turned to the pile of books that had been staring at me guiltily for weeks, if not months. The one I pulled out was a soon-to-be released noir-ish thriller called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/07/the-passenger-by-ulrich-alexander-boschwitz-review-on-the-run-in-nazi-germany\">The Passenger</a></em>. It was set in the Germany of the 1930s, following a man on the run from the Nazi authorities, hoping to make his escape by hopping on and off trains crisscrossing the country. As the Gestapo net around him tightens, he plunges into paranoia and breakdown. Perhaps the coronavirus&nbsp;intensified the experience, but I was gripped. I tweeted that it was part Franz Kafka, part John Buchan and completely riveting.</p> <p>But there was a twist. This was not a new book, but one written nearly a century earlier. The author was Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz, just 23 years old when his novel was published in 1938 and a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany. In 1935, he had made his way across Europe to reach Britain, where he was promptly classified as an \u201cenemy alien\u201d and interned in a camp on the Isle of Man. He was held with more than a thousand other \u00e9migr\u00e9s, among them a remarkable number of artists, musicians, writers and intellectuals&nbsp;on what Simon Parkin has called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/13/the-island-of-extraordinary-captives-review-simon-parkin-internment-camp-fleischmann\">the&nbsp;island of extraordinary captives</a>.</p> <p>Eventually the British authorities decided that some of these enemy aliens should be shipped to Australia. After a hellish journey, Boschwitz was held in another detention camp, this time in New South Wales. Finally, in 1942, he was reclassified \u2013 now deemed to be a \u201cfriendly alien\u201d\u2013 and allowed to return to Britain. He climbed on board a ship, the MV Abosso, and set sail for what he hoped would be the start of a new life. He was 27.</p>    <p>But the Abosso was spotted by a German U-boat and torpedoed. The ship sank, killing 362 of those on board, young, luckless Boschwitz among them. Lost with him was his revised manuscript of <em>The Passenger</em> which, he felt sure, would have made an even better book.</p> <p>But there was another text he had left behind, a story for children that he had dreamed up while held on the Isle of Man. Less than 3,000 words long, it was called <em>King Winter\u2019s Birthday: A Fairy Tale</em>. The original, handwritten manuscript, complete with drawings added by Ulrich\u2019s mother, had lain undisturbed in a New York archive for eight long decades.</p> <p>I learned all this from Adam Freudenheim of Pushkin Press, the publisher who had so successfully resurrected <em>The Passenger</em>, turning it into a belated international bestseller. I had become something of a champion of that novel and now he had an unusual proposal to make. Would I take a look at Boschwitz\u2019s forgotten fairytale and see if it could be brought to a contemporary audience? Might I, a political columnist and sometime writer of thrillers, relish the challenge of writing for children? The answers were yes and yes.</p>    <p>I read Freudenheim\u2019s translation from the German and my first instinct was that, while I couldn\u2019t exactly adapt the story, I could certainly take inspiration from it. Indeed, the conceit at the core of Boschwitz\u2019s tale \u2013 Winter summoning the other seasons, his&nbsp;siblings, to celebrate his birthday&nbsp;\u2013 had prompted an idea&nbsp;the&nbsp;instant I read it.</p> <p>Two decisions, apparently contradictory, came to me just as quickly. First, I realised that this story would need to be aimed at children younger than those Boschwitz had seemed to have in mind. Older children might have accepted the idiom of a fairytale \u2013 kings and palaces and the like \u2013 in the 1940s, but I suspected their counterparts today would be far less&nbsp;patient.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The plot turns on a demanding concept: the need to put right a world that has lost its natural balance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, I had an animating thought for the story that might, at first blush, appear an unlikely theme for the youngest readers. Yes, the structure of my <em>King Winter\u2019s Birthday</em> is straightforward and the words are simple, but the plot turns on a seemingly demanding concept: the need to put right a world that has lost its natural&nbsp;balance.</p> <p>Some might think that too much for a child to take on, but I remembered from my own experience as a parent and, many decades ago, in informal education, that young children are often able to grasp the largest ideas.

But that was that as far as Northampton and points scoring went in the first half. Gloucester were rampant, picking off passes, offloading extravagantly. Thomas nicked one pass from Northampton and galloped away before sending Mercer to the posts on the switch. Then Wade turned Sleightholme after another interception and put Carreras over again. The latter thought he had a hat-trick just before the break, after more breathless approach work, but the television match official spotted a knock-on in the buildup. Still, Fasogbon and Jack Clement between them forced a penalty, which Carreras converted to take Gloucester into half-time 22-7 up. We know enough about this competition to expect, as night follows day, the trailing team to come back. Sure enough, the second half was all Northampton\u2019s. Three times they thought they had scored; three times they were denied by the TMO, twice when Sleightholme failed narrowly to ground the ball during the most outrageous of dives for the corner, once when Alex Mitchell, returning from injury, flicked a pass out of the back of his hand slightly forward. Juarno Augustus did score for Saints a few minutes into the second half, powering over after a couple of tapped penalties. But those denied tries meant they would not score again till the 73rd minute, when Hutchinson kicked a penalty to bring the home side to within a score. Gloucester were forced to play the final minutes down to 14, Mercer hobbling from the field with all substitutes deployed. Carreras landed his second penalty with two minutes remaining to take Gloucester clear again they stayed.",

Ben Fisher was there to see Frank Lampard\u2019s first game as Coventry boss. It almost went very wrong. West Ham v Arsenal is not the only MBM in town. Oh no. Because it\u2019s England v the USA. It\u2019s Sarina Wiegman v Emma Hayes. Scott Murray will guide you through this one which kicks off in about 10 minutes. An eventful day in the Premier League and we\u2019ll have match reports shortly. Attention now turns to the London Stadium where it\u2019s West Ham v Arsenal. Emillia Hawkins is on the MBM for this one. Celtic 5-0 Ross County Dundee United 2-0 St Mirren Kilmarnock 1-1 Dundee Motherwell 0-3 Hibernian Bristol City 4-0 Plymouth Coventry 2-2 Cardiff Norwich 4-2 Luton Preston 1-1 West Brom Stoke 0-2 Burnley Swansea 2-2 Portsmouth Middlesbrough 3-1 Hull Oxford 1-1 Millwall Watford 0-0 QPR Blackburn 1-0 Leeds Brentford 4-1 Leicester Crystal Palace 1-1 Newcastle Nottingham Forest 1-0 Ipswich Wolves 2-4 Bournemouth The Magpies go to sleep and guess who cashes in? Munoz! Despite his horrendous miss earlier, it seems he was destined to get his first Palace goal today and this back-post header from a Guehi cross looks to have nicked a point for the hosts. More penalty hat-trick news in this one from the archives. Morrissey a figure of interest for quirky reasons in those days. It\u2019s a bad day for Wayne Rooney with Plymouth losing 4-0 at Bristol City. In more positive Rooney news, Colleen is second favourite for I\u2019m A Celebrity. Meanwhile, better news for Frank Lampard\u2019s Coventry as they pull level at 2-2 with Cardiff thanks to an 86th-minute penalty. Kluivert won\u2019t be scoring another penalty however as his work here is done. Claps to the away fans. What a day for Patrick\u2019s boy. As for his fellow hat-trick hero today, Kevin Schade is only the fourth German to score a hat-trick in the Premier League. Harry Kane got a hat-trick of penalties for Bayern recently I think. Although it\u2019s easy to lose count. The England skipper is in action in the big one in Germany soon as Bayern take on Borussia Dortmund at 5.30pm. And OptaJoe is indeed on the case\u2026 Justin Kluivert is the first player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick of penalties in a single match, with teammate Evanilson also the first to win three penalties in the same game in the competition. Spotted. Sa clatters Evanilson, who has now won all three penalties. But Kluivert will deservedly get all the headlines as he converts yet again to complete a hat-trick of spot-kicks. OptaJoe will be busy now. Game on at Molineux where the home crowd have been roused again. Bournemouth get caught in possession, Guedes breaks and Strand Larsen chips the ball home for his second of the game to narrow the gap. But wait\u2026 we have another penalty to Bournemouth! Not a good day for famous footballers turned managers. Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s Leicester are losing 4-1 at Brentford, Wayne Rooney\u2019s Plymouth are 3-0 down at Bristol City and Frank Lampard\u2019s Coventry trail 2-1 at home to Cardiff. Crystal Palace piling on the pressure against Newcastle as they chase an equaliser. Sarr\u2019s shot is saved by Pope and Dan Burn, who sounds like a security guard for a US president, hurls himself in front of the bullet to block Munoz\u2019s follow-up effort. Cue the \u2018Ruud awakening\u2019 headlines although Kevin Schade will feel he should be the story here as he completes a hat-trick. Woeful defending from Leicester. Great work from Collins as he puts Schade through to fire home his third. West Ham: Fabia\u0144ski, Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Emerson, Soler, Sou\u010dek, Bowen, Paquet\u00e1, Summerville, Antonio. Arsenal: Raya, Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori, Jorginho, Rice, \u00d8degaard, Saka, Trossard, Havertz. Table news. If results stay the same, Forest would go sixth, Newcastle seventh and Brentford eighth. It looks like another miserable away day for Wayne Rooney and Plymouth as they go 1-0 down at Bristol City. If they lose this one, Rooney\u2019s away points tally will be two from 30. They\u2019ve only lost once at home though to be fair. #discrepancy A clever free-kick routine from the visitors ends with Anthony Gordon\u2019s deflected strike coming off Marc Guehi for an own goal. Tonali involved too. 1-0 to the visitors. Burnley can go second in the table with victory at Stoke and they\u2019re on target to do so as Smiths fan Jay Rodriguez find the net. Some goals are bigger than others. Chris Wood smashes home the penalty and Forest lead 1-0. That makes him the Trees\u2019 all-time top Premier League scorer alongside Bryan Roy. The affable Kiwi got the chance to join the Dutchman after Silva was brought down by Szmodics. Ipswich like a draw though so don\u2019t rule them out just yet. Here we go again. A strange split of goals in the Premier League in that first 45 minutes. Two games with four goals in them and two still goalless. Although\u2026 Nottingham Forest have a penalty! And read here how Barcelona were stunned 2-1 at home by Las Palmas. That\u2019s now just one point in the last nine for the leaders. Here\u2019s the match report of Blackburn\u2019s 1-0 win over Leeds. Celtic 5-0 Ross County Dundee United 0-0 St Mirren Kilmarnock 0-0 Dundee Motherwell 0-2 Hibernian Bristol City 0-0 Plymouth Coventry 1-1 Cardiff Norwich 2-1 Luton Preston 0-1 West Brom Stoke 0-0 Burnley Swansea 1-2 Portsmouth Results in early games Middlesbrough 3-1 Hull Oxford 1-1 Millwall Watford 0-0 QPR Blackburn 1-0 Leeds Scenes at Molineux at the break as goalkeeper Jose Sa goes into the crowd to confront a fan, who is then removed. Brentford 3-1 Leicester Crystal Palace 0-0 Newcastle Nottingham Forest 0-0 Ipswich Wolves 1-3 Bournemouth This could be a tough afternoon for Ruud van Nistelrooy now. The Bees add a third in the seventh minute of added time as Schade dinks a lovely finish over Hermansen after being put in by Damsgaard. That\u2019s his second of the game and, fun fact, it was Brentford\u2019s 17th first-half goal of the season. That\u2019s the best in the league. Simon McMahon is back. \u201cMaybe Celtic will score 36? They\u2019re 5-0 up now and look like scoring every time they have the ball.\u201d Spotter\u2019s badge for Rob Moore. \u201cIn Where Are They Now? news, in the 92nd minute of their big win, Las Palmas brought on a certain Oli McBurnie.\u201d News from our resident fitba correspondent, Simon McMahon. \u201cAfternoon David. In the Scottish Premier Celtic have taken an early lead at home to Ross County, the other games, including Dundee United v St. Mirren, remain goalless. It\u2019s also Scottish Cup third round day, but not much to report so far, other than to say I doubt Arbroath will be winning 36-0, as they are currently goalless at home to Queen of the South. Still plenty time, I suppose.\u201d Some feedback from reader K\u00e1ri Tulinius on Barcelona\u2019s shock 2-1 home defeat to Las Palmas. \u201cEveryone who I consider smarter than me about football, a long list, thinks otherwise, but I\u2019ve long been skeptical of Hansi Flick as a manager. I also realize his six trophy season in charge of Bayern is a point against me, but then he benefited from following a disciplinarian who\u2019d whipped FC Hollywood into shape, and so that collection of brilliant talent was pulling in the same direction. His tenure as Germany manager was a disaster, and I suspect his Barcelona team will fade away. Now that I\u2019ve said it out loud, I\u2019ve probably reverse jinxed the Blaugrana into another six trophy season.\u201d Still 0-0 at the City Ground. Nottingham Forest have managed seven shots to Ipswich\u2019s three although both have had two on target and the visitors are starting to look much more threatening. One concern for Ipswich is that two of their defenders \u2013 O\u2019Shea and Tuanzebe \u2013 are on yellow cards after early bookings. An incredible miss at Selhurst Park! Munoz arrives at the far post to tap home from three yards following a cross from Sarr and great work from Eze but somehow fluffs his lines. How are Crystal Palace not in front? Relief for Newcastle. FT: Blackburn 1-0 Leeds. Even with 10 minutes of added time, Leeds can\u2019t find the net and it\u2019s defeat at Ewood Park. They stay second, three points behind Sheffield United, while Blackburn are up to eighth in the live table thanks to Todd Cantwell\u2019s penalty. A missed opportunity for Leeds, who had a late \u2018goal\u2019 ruled out. And Leicester\u2019s task is even harder now as Brentford complete the turnaround with two inside five minutes. Schade, who set up the first, fires home the second from a Bryan Mbeumo cross. Leicester\u2019s lead didn\u2019t last long as a first-time finish from Yoane Wissa from a Schade cross gives Brentford a deserved equaliser with 25 minutes on the clock. The Bees have won more home points than anyone in the Premier League this season so Leicester will do well to take something from this having been pegged back so soon. Bad news for Newcastle \u2013 and fantasy managers \u2013 as Isak can\u2019t continue and is replaced by Harvey Barnes. A goal against the run of play. Jamie Vardy, still a zippy customer, cuts the ball back to the unmarked Facundo Buonanotte, who taps home inside the six-yard box to put the Foxes in front. As for those other Premier League games, Forest started brightly at home to Ipswich but the visitors are finding their way back into it, Brentford are turning up the heat on Leicester although can\u2019t find a breakthrough and lots of Newcastle players seem to be needing treatment at Crystal Palace. Isak is one of them although he seems fine to continue. Kluivert slams home his second penalty, this time going to the goalkeeper\u2019s right, and Bournemouth are 3-1 up. Four goals in this one; none elsewhere in the Premier League. Bournemouth have been given a second penalty at Molineux! A dithering Jose Sa takes fouls Evanilson, who earlier missed a sitter, and the Cherries are on the brink of a 3-1 lead. Brentford 0-0 Leicester. It\u2019s Brentford, not Bournemouth, who have made a reputation for early goals but they haven\u2019t managed one yet against Leicester. That said, it took a brilliant save from Foxes goalkeeper Mads Hermansen to keep out Kevin Schade\u2019s fifth-minute header. And straight back to Molineux where there\u2019s a third goal in a bonkers opening eight minutes. The Cherries are back in front via a beauty from flying full-back Milos Kerkez, who slams home into the top corner after being set up by Tavernier. Coventry 1-1 Cardiff. And quite a start in Frank Lampard\u2019s first game in charge of Coventry. Cardiff take the lead through Yakou Meite but Ephron Mason-Clark has Frank smiling again just 90 seconds later. What a start at Molineux. The visitors are level as Bellegarde crosses from the right and Strand Larsen heads home the equaliser. Quite the opening five minutes. Wow! Barcelona have lost 2-1 at home to Las Palmas. Barca were 1/10 to win that. Justin Kluivert strokes home the penalty and the visitors lead 1-0 after just three minutes. A penalty at Molineux! It\u2019s to Bournemouth although there\u2019s a check going on. Evanilson is the man brought down. Groans in the Wolves crowd as it\u2019s given. The four 3pm matches in the Premier League are in play, as are lots of others in the EFL, FA Cup and many places abroad. Hopefully, that \u2018text message\u2019 news below will answer Frank from Missouri\u2019s curiosity. \u201cAs the only Leicester fan I know, I\u2019m wondering what, if any, influence Ruud will have on today\u2019s game, given that (1) he only got appointed hours ago and (2) he\u2019ll be watching from the stands. I\u2019m looking for a ray of hope here, after the blah start to the season.\u201d Jeremy Boyce is back in touch. \u201cI am beginning to wonder if Leeds shouldn\u2019t officially change their name to Leeds 69% Possession United. It\u2019s the same every match every week, and they either score a hatful or none at all.\u201d They\u2019ve actually had 76% in the second half, Jeremy, but remain 1-0 down to Blackburn at Ewood Park. Soz. A relaxed Ruud van Nistelrooy has arrived at Brentford and will take his place up in the stands. Apparently, he exchanged text messages with stand-in Ben Dawson last night, presumably to do with Leicester\u2019s line-up rather than any good Netflix recommendations. In the Bundesliga, what are fourth-placed Leipzig playing at? Less than 20 minutes gone and they\u2019re 3-0 down at home to Wolfsburg. Barcelona are seven minutes away from a shock 2-1 home loss to Las Palmas. If is stays like that, Real Madrid can go top by winning their two games in hand. The first of those is at home to Getafe on Sunday. Como v Monza is a top-flight game in Italy. No, really (18th v 19th). That\u2019ll cause furrowed brows to those who loved Serie A in the 90s but are a bit sketchy on who\u2019s in the top-flight now. For such people, have a read of this and the others in the series. Oh, Como are leading 1-0 by the way. Jeremy Boyce gets in touch via email. \u201cLeeds fan here, so \u201cthanks\u201d for the update from Ewood Park. The Forest - Ipswich match looks pretty tasty, and plenty riding on it for both teams. Ipswich desperately need to turn their agreeable playing style into points, Forest have already turned their agreeable style into surprisingly many points but need to get back on track after two reversals. Could be fun. 0-0 then.\" Barcelona 1-2 Las Palmas. As I was saying, plenty of time for the hosts. Although I wasn\u2019t thinking of a sentence ending \u2018to ship another shock goal\u2019. Good grief, the visitors are back in front. Fabio Silva with the goal to get the locals muttering again. Barcelona 1-1 Las Palmas. Barca are level and it\u2019s a tidy goal from Brazilian forward Raphinha. Still around half an hour to go there so plenty of time for the hosts. As for Raphinha\u2019s former team Leeds, they trail 1-0 at the break against Blackburn at Ewood Park. The visitors have had 69% possession but just haven\u2019t done enough with it. The second half about to start. Results from the early kick-offs in the Championship and League Two. Middlesbrough jump to fifth, edging (on goal difference) above Watford, who are held at home by second-bottom QPR. Championship: Middlesbrough 3-1 Hull Oxford 1-1 Millwall Watford 0-0 QPR League Two: Carlisle 1-1 Crewe Fleetwood 0-0 Colchester Oxford 1-1 Millwall. Tyler Goodrham looks to have rescued a point for Oxford with an equaliser four minutes from time. Barcelona 0-1 Las Palmas. Yikes. The visitors take the lead in the 49th minute via Sandro Ramirez. What madness is this. Just under 26 hours until Liverpool v Manchester City. Some previews to whet the appetite: Barcelona 0-0 Las Palmas. Barca are dominant (68% possession, 10 shots to 3) but they\u2019re drawing 0-0 at the break against Las Palmas. Middlesbrough 3-1 Hull. After their glut of recent goals dried up in a 1-0 defeat to Blackburn, Middlesbrough are back at it and now have three against Hull. Tommy Conway\u2019s second of the game with 11 minutes left looks likely to secure all three points. Premier League team news. So, digesting some of those starting XIs, it\u2019s good news for Crystal Palace with Eberechi Eze returning following a hamstring injury. Jefferson Lerma also comes back. Nottingham Forest have made five changes from the team that lost at Arsenal, with Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson among those returning. Antoine Semenyo and Lewis Cook are suspended for Bournemouth \u2013 that\u2019s a blow \u2013 so Ryan Christie and David Brooks get the call. But perhaps the biggest eyebrow raising is at Leicester where first-team coach Ben Dawson, likely prompted by Ruud van Nistelrooy (sitting in the stands), has given first Premier League starts of the season to Conor Coady and Luke Thomas. Nottingham Forest: Sels, Aina, Milenkovic, Murillo, Williams, Yates, Anderson, Jota, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi, Wood. Ipswich: Muric, Tuanzebe, O\u2019Shea, Burgess, Davis, Morsy, Cajuste, Hutchinson, Chaplin, Szmodics, Delap. Wolves: Sa, Semedo, Lemina, Toti, Ait-Nouri, Andre, J. Gomes, Bellegarde, R. Gomes, Cunha, Strand Larsen. Bournemouth: Kepa, Kerkez, Senesi, Brooks, Evanilson, Christie, Adams, Smith, Tevernier, Kluivert, Zabarnyi. Blackburn 1-0 Leeds. Bad news for the 7,000 travelling Leeds fans as Rovers go ahead via Todd Cantwell\u2019s 22th-minute penalty. Crystal Palace: Henderson, Munoz, Chalobah, Lacroix, Guehi, Mitchell, Lerma, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Sarr. Newcastle: Pope, Schar, Joelinton, Tonali, Gordon, Isak, Hall, Livramento, Willock, Burn, Guimaraes. Brentford: Flekken, Van den Berg, Collins, Pinnock, Lewis-Potter, Norgaard, Jensen, Damsgaard, Schade, Mbeumo, Wissa. Leicester: Hermansen, Justin, Faes, Coady, Okoli, Thomas, Ndidi, Soumare, Buonanotte, Ayew, Vardy. Here\u2019s the match report of Wycombe\u2019s FA Cup win at Wealdstone. Our Simon Burnton was there. As we await the starting XIs, here\u2019s Will Unwin\u2019s piece on how Liverpool have gone to the toppermost of the poppermost in both the Premier League and Champions League. Premier League team news now drops 75 minutes before kick-off so (counts fingers, thumbs and toes) we\u2019ll bring it to you very shortly. Here\u2019s a thing \u2013 Barcelona are in action right now too! Yes, you heard that right. The Catalans are top of La Liga but have stuttered recently with a draw and a loss in two away games. They remain perfect at home though and are looking to make it six wins out of six with victory over 17th-place Las Palmas. Nothing doing just yet though and it\u2019s 0-0 with 30 minutes gone. Half-times in the early kick-offs around the country below. We\u2019ve already had one result in the FA Cup with League One Wycombe winning 2-0 at National League Wealdstone. Wycombe reach the third round for the first time since 2020/21. Championship: Middlesbrough 2-0 Hull Oxford 0-1 Millwall Watford 0-0 QPR League Two: Carlisle 1-0 Crewe Fleetwood 0-0 Colchester Welcome! The weekend Premier League action got under way last night with Southampton earning a good point at Brighton and actually feeling aggrieved that it wasn\u2019t all three after more VAR controversy. That means there\u2019s no 12.30pm fixture today but there\u2019s plenty to tuck into at 3pm with four top-flight games kicking off. Okay, none of the top six are in action but there\u2019s plenty of intrigue in this quartet of fixtures: Brentford v Leicester Crystal Palace v Newcastle Nottingham Forest v Ipswich Wolves v Bournemouth Can you look at any of those four and be confident of a winner? Okay, Brentford have been awesome at home (five wins and a draw in six matches). But what about the Ruud van Nistelrooy Leicester bump effect? There\u2019s a sentence. So there\u2019s all that plus news from the EFL and Europe. Leeds can return to the top of the Championship with victory at Blackburn (1.30pm) while we\u2019ll check in on the trio of live Championship games and also bring you hot news from the FA Cup second round. Sounds fun doesn\u2019t it and for those looking for a further fix when this clockwatch shuts down, there\u2019s West Ham v Arsenal in a separate MBM at 5.30pm. Join me!",

      "body": "<p>At the finish it wasn\u2019t readily apparent who was at the end of yet another enervating season and who was not even at the halfway point. It can get like that when the margins are tight and the mind takes over. For Australia they were trying to get beyond break-even in their campaign, another brick in the defensive wall against the Lions next summer. Ireland were in \u00adsimilar statistical mode: two from four this month would not have been a good look. With the bean counters at their end-of-match positions, Ireland managed to avoid that.</p> \n<p>In a week dominated by Andy Farrell picking a novice at No 10, it was fitting that another from the same age bracket nudged Ireland into the safe zone. The replacement hooker Gus McCarthy brought something extra to a game where it was badly needed. His late try off a maul put Ireland in credit. By then the other new kid on the block, Sam Prendergast, had played a hugely positive part in a game ruined by the time wasted to set scrums, and the number of handling errors that led to those scrums. Somewhere in between those two \u00adpitfalls was a game of rugby looking for some attention. So, far from perfect, but something positive for both sides to take away.</p> \n<p>\u201cI felt that at times in that first half we didn\u2019t quite capitalise on the line breaks we made,\u201d Joe Schmidt, the former Ireland coach, said. \u201cWe did get to the ball and we kept it but in the second half probably my one disappointment around the game was we got quite conservative. And when you do that against Ireland and you\u2019re hanging on and you\u2019ve got a four-point lead and you\u2019re hoping that\u2019s enough \u2013 I think we tried to do that from too far out. I don\u2019t know what the territory and stats were but we were having to work very, very hard.\u201d</p> \n<p>If this is all about the Wallabies getting up to speed before next summer\u2019s Lions tour, then the way their attack flowed was a huge positive, best illustrated by Max Jorgensen\u2019s try in the first half. They dragged the home team from one side to the other expertly for the wing to finish with a bit of room to spare.</p> \n<p>Their defence too was impressive, despite finishing 1-3 on the try count. Ireland\u2019s attack shape is relentless, with some variations built in, but the gold shirts put the hammer on them.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was very proud of our defensive effort, especially in that second half when we kept showing up for each other,\u201d the captain, Harry Wilson, said. \u201cBut they kept on coming.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yes, they did, but not always with ball in hand. The 21 handling errors by men in green was a handbrake pulled up more than released. So for Farrell the review will be painful, even if it secured three wins from four games this month. If tagged along with the New Zealand game, it will make for a heap of homework for Simon Easterby, who fills in now for Farrell until the end of next summer\u2019s tour to Georgia and Portugal while the coach goes off to lead the Lions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/nov/30/ireland-v-australia-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-live\">Ireland v Australia: Autumn Nations Series rugby union \u2013 live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By half-time Ireland had backed themselves into a corner, squandering great attacking platforms off the lineout, where four throws were lost by the end of the day. They turned around 13-5 down, although it would have been just a point if Joe McCarthy had not been robbed \u2013 his own fault \u2013 under the crossbar. Along with Finlay Bealham, he has to wear a few&nbsp;howlers.</p> \n<p>The good news for Ireland was Prendergast\u2019s love of the environment: he is made for this. In the opening 10 minutes of the second half he was adding five points off the tee, with Caelan Doris\u2019s try putting Ireland ahead. But Noah Lolesio hauled the Aussies back in front before the late charge off the bench got Ireland over the line. The relief was palpable against a side dismissed out of hand at the World Cup.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think supporters of the Lions can see enough of what we\u2019ve delivered in these last four weeks to think they\u2019ll be entertained,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cAnd that it\u2019s going to be a contest.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "At the finish it wasn\u2019t readily apparent who was at the end of yet another enervating season and who was not even at the halfway point. It can get like that when the margins are tight and the mind takes over. For Australia they were trying to get beyond break-even in their campaign, another brick in the defensive wall against the Lions next summer. Ireland were in similar statistical mode: two from four this month would not have been a good look. With the bean counters at their end-of-match positions, Ireland managed to avoid that. In a week dominated by Andy Farrell picking a novice at No 10, it was fitting that another from the same age bracket nudged Ireland into the safe zone. The replacement hooker Gus McCarthy brought something extra to a game where it was badly needed. His late try off a maul put Ireland in credit. By then the other new kid on the block, Sam Prendergast, had played a hugely positive part in a game ruined by the time wasted to set scrums, and the number of handling errors that led to those scrums. Somewhere in between those two pitfalls was a game of rugby looking for some attention. So, far from perfect, but something positive for both sides to take away. \u201cI felt that at times in that first half we didn\u2019t quite capitalise on the line breaks we made,\u201d Joe Schmidt, the former Ireland coach, said. \u201cWe did get to the ball and we kept it but in the second half probably my one disappointment around the game was we got quite conservative. And when you do that against Ireland and you\u2019re hanging on and you\u2019ve got a four-point lead and you\u2019re hoping that\u2019s enough \u2013 I think we tried to do that from too far out. I don\u2019t know what the territory and stats were but we were having to work very, very hard.\u201d If this is all about the Wallabies getting up to speed before next summer\u2019s Lions tour, then the way their attack flowed was a huge positive, best illustrated by Max Jorgensen\u2019s try in the first half. They dragged the home team from one side to the other expertly for the wing to finish with a bit of room to spare. Their defence too was impressive, despite finishing 1-3 on the try count. Ireland\u2019s attack shape is relentless, with some variations built in, but the gold shirts put the hammer on them. \u201cI was very proud of our defensive effort, especially in that second half when we kept showing up for each other,\u201d the captain, Harry Wilson, said. \u201cBut they kept on coming.\u201d Yes, they did, but not always with ball in hand. The 21 handling errors by men in green was a handbrake pulled up more than released. So for Farrell the review will be painful, even if it secured three wins from four games this month. If tagged along with the New Zealand game, it will make for a heap of homework for Simon Easterby, who fills in now for Farrell until the end of next summer\u2019s tour to Georgia and Portugal while the coach goes off to lead the Lions. By half-time Ireland had backed themselves into a corner, squandering great attacking platforms off the lineout, where four throws were lost by the end of the day. They turned around 13-5 down, although it would have been just a point if Joe McCarthy had not been robbed \u2013 his own fault \u2013 under the crossbar. Along with Finlay Bealham, he has to wear a few howlers. The good news for Ireland was Prendergast\u2019s love of the environment: he is made for this. In the opening 10 minutes of the second half he was adding five points off the tee, with Caelan Doris\u2019s try putting Ireland ahead. But Noah Lolesio hauled the Aussies back in front before the late charge off the bench got Ireland over the line. The relief was palpable against a side dismissed out of hand at the World Cup. \u201cI think supporters of the Lions can see enough of what we\u2019ve delivered in these last four weeks to think they\u2019ll be entertained,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cAnd that it\u2019s going to be a contest.\u201d",

It was Jota\u2019s lively nature that resulted in Forest winning a penalty in the early stages of the second half, which Wood smashed down the middle to put him alongside Roy on 24 top-flight goals. There was contact between Jota and Sammie Szmodics \u2013 the Forest player made sure there was \u2013 but the fall was somewhat theatrical. The referee Tony Harrington was certain of his decision, while VAR saw no reason to change his mind. \u201cWe have to own it and we have to look at it and say that you can\u2019t lunge in from behind in the penalty area,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cWe had the box well covered, we had plenty of people in the frame of the goal and it\u2019s not a particularly threatening situation. I think away from home especially, but away from home or at home we shouldn\u2019t give the referee a possibility to make a decision there and it ends up being a decisive moment in the game.\u201d Muric produced a superb save, tipping a close-range Murillo header from a corner on to the bar to prevent Forest doubling the lead. Set pieces were causing Ipswich problems, as Elliot Anderson almost curled a corner straight in, forcing the goalkeeper to palm it away from under his own crossbar, before Burgess headed off the line to prevent Jota from scoring. Ipswich struggled to cause problems for Forest\u2019s defence as the much-lauded Delap was kept quiet by Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo. Despite the visitors chasing the game, Sels was allowed a relaxed afternoon, barely needing to be awake for Ipswich\u2019s best chance of the second half when substitute Jack Clarke\u2019s shot from inside the box was sent straight at the goalkeeper. It left Ipswich in the bottom three and Forest back on track.",

Although I know my grandmother\u2019s great-grandparents came to the US from Denmark and spoke little English for much of their lives, I have no idea from what country our surname, Galusha, originates. I wanted to know more. So despite my misgivings \u2013 and there were many \u2013 my curiosity won out, and I sent in a test.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/12/23andme-layoffs\">Genetic testing firm 23andMe cuts 40% of its workforce amid financial struggles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What did I get in exchange for handing the company $119 and indefinite access to my genetic data? Confirmation that I am 63% British and Irish, 17% Danish and otherwise \u201cbroadly north-western European\u201d. I felt a resounding ambivalence about the results, including some disappointment that I had not discovered a newfound heritage \u2013 a piece of information that would give my identity new dimension. I was also surprised to find out that some parts of my identity present in the family lore \u2013 a Czech heritage \u2013 was not actually present in my genes. Now, as the looming collapse of the company raises serious concerns about what will happen to the database of users\u2019 genomic information, I am struggling to reconcile the fact that I traded away my genetic privacy to find out that I am mostly British.</p> <p>Timothy Caulfield, a professor at University of Alberta who has studied motivations for undergoing genetic ancestry testing and how consumer respond to their results, said my reaction \u2013 one of ambivalence \u2013 is actually the most common.</p> <p>\u201cWe are told by pop culture that we are supposed to care \u2013 that your genes matter,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of people get their results and find it very underwhelming.\u201d</p>    <p>In addition to finding my results inconsequential, I have always found the idea of genetic testing for ancestry to be fraught, and was hesitant to buy into the idea that my genetic origins have any bearing on who I am as a person. Caulfield, who <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-your-dna-test-wont-reveal-the-real-you/\">had his own ancestry tested</a> despite similar misgivings, is of the same mind. He asserts that race is \u201ca biological fiction\u201d, one that these companies promote, marketing the idea that our genes are relevant to how we view ourselves as individuals. This mindset, Caulfield says, is \u201cthe essence of racism\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOn one hand, I am enraged by it \u2013 I think it is an incredibly harmful trend, especially in this polarized world that we live in, where we\u2019re becoming more tribalistic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I get it. People are looking for roots. They\u2019re looking for meaning. They\u2019re looking for a tribe to belong to. And I think the marketing plays into that idea.\u201d</p> <p>That marketing was wildly successful for the better part of two decades. 23andMe was co-founded in 2006 by Anne Wojcicki. By the time it went public in 2021, the company was worth $3.5bn, and its value reached a peak of $6bn shortly thereafter. Competitors like Ancestry.com and MyHeritage entered the sphere, and by 2024 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/18/rise-in-dna-tests-used-to-claim-citizenship-of-other-countries-brexit-eu\">more than 40 million people</a> in the world had taken consumer genetic tests.</p> <p>The individual appeal of these tests varies widely, but many consumers expressed an explicit desire to understand personal origins that inform their identities, said Muriel Leuenberger, a postdoctoral researcher at University of Zurich whose work centers on philosophy of identity and genealogy.</p> <p>\u201cOne hope I see in people pursuing these tests is to develop a richer self-conception,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a thought that you get this information, and then suddenly things you did in the past or character traits that you have might fall into place and make sense in a different way that they haven\u2019t before.\u201d</p> <p>For many people, those tests can reframe a sense of identity, for better or worse. Many have shared stories about a genetic test disproving longstanding family lore \u2013 like a long-cited story of Native American roots being negated, for example. I had always heard my family was Czech \u2013 a heritage that did not show up in any percentage in my results. This identity was not part of my upbringing beyond passing references, so discovering it did not exist make a huge impact on me. However, similar discoveries can lead to existential crises for those who have closely associated with a certain identity, said Leuenberger.</p> <p>\u201cFor some, you have a whole cultural background with which you really identify, maybe it was even part of your upbringing, and suddenly you\u2019re kind of cut off from it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can lead people to question this connection and whether they have a right to it if it is not proven by a genetic test.\u201d</p> <p>Such desires for certain cultural connections differ substantially by country, noted Caulfield \u2013 whose research found that in places like Canada and the US, consumers take tests hoping for an \u201cexotic\u201d background that aligns with the cultural understanding of our countries as a genetic melting pot. Black Americans <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/08/04/1191914142/a-landmark-study-opens-a-new-possible-way-for-black-americans-to-trace-their-anc\">have used</a> genetic testing to trace a lineage violently fractured by the transatlantic slave trade, though some Black Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/24/dna-test-roots-black-woman-ancestry\">have expressed</a> concerns about privacy \u2013 as well as the ways in which DNA testing risks reifying racial stratification.<strong> </strong>In markets like China and Japan, he said, advertising campaigns instead seek to appeal to reaffirmation of ancestral purity.</p> <p>With the future of 23andMe in peril, the overarching question among previous customers now is what will happen to the data that has already been collected. Leuenberger noted that by entering DNA into a database, users sacrifice not only their own privacy but that of blood relatives. Because an individual\u2019s DNA is similar in structure to that of their relatives, information about others can be gleaned from one person\u2019s sample. This is especially pronounced with the rise of open-access DNA sites like GEDMatch, on which users <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/magazine/dna-test-crime-identification-genome.html\">can upload</a> genetic data that can be compared to other samples. A consumer genealogy test <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/dna-from-genealogy-site-used-to-catch-suspected-golden-state-killer-1.4637726\">contributed</a> to the identification of serial killer Joseph James DeAngelo.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is ethically tricky with genetic data is that it\u2019s not just about self-knowledge \u2013 it\u2019s also knowledge about all of your relatives,\u201d Leuenberger said. \u201cMorally speaking, it is not necessarily information that is yours to give \u2013 and this risk is exacerbated if this company goes down and the fate of the data becomes more perilous.\u201d</p> <p>In an attempt to minimize these risks, I requested that my account be deleted and the company send me a copy of my data. I received an email confirming my deletion request \u2013 with some caveats. While samples I consented to have stored would be discarded, if I had opted into having my data used for research, that information could not be withdrawn or undone. Luckily, I had not. 23andMe and its genotyping labs are required under the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and California laboratory regulations to retain my genetic information, date of birth and sex. In other words, the company is required to retain some portions of the information I am asking it to delete. The company will also retain \u201climited information\u201d related to my deletion request.</p> <p>23andMe declined to respond to questions regarding the nature of genetic information it is required to retain. In a statement, spokesperson Katie Watson cited 23andMe\u2019s \u201cstrong customer privacy protections\u201d, including not sharing customer data with third parties without customer consent. Many privacy concerns center around what will happen to the data if 23andMe changes ownership or goes bankrupt. Regarding those concerns, Watson noted that the company\u2019s CEO, Wojcicki, has stated she intends to take the company private, and is not open to considering third party takeover proposals \u2013 thus maintaining the current privacy policy.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to protecting customer data and are consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThat will not change.\u201d</p> <p>As for my genetic data, I received a copy of my ancestry report \u2013 confirming my largely British heritage \u2013 and a 17MB text file containing my entire genome. While being able to receive such data is compulsory under many privacy laws, it raises the question of how useful reclaiming our data from tech companies really is, Caulfield said. Referencing a study <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid=10.1371/journal.pone.0229044\">conducted</a> in 2020<strong>, </strong>he said consumers at a fundamental level feel they should have a right to their genomic information \u2013 even if they cannot understand the raw mass of millions of As, Cs, Ts and Gs.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to people to have a right to this data dump with their whole genome, even though for virtually every human on the planet it is meaningless,\u201d Caulfield said.</p> <p>So what will I do with my newfound understanding of self and long list of genotype identifiers sitting on my computer desktop? Nothing. I have traveled little in Europe, and thus have yet to visit any of my disparate homelands. Perhaps if I make my way over to London in the near future, I will be overwhelmed with a sense of belonging, and all my angst over who owns my genomic information will all be worth it. But I am doubtful that the tradeoff resulted in anything but a resounding ambivalence and the sacrifice of my genetic self.</p>",

Although I know my grandmother\u2019s great-grandparents came to the US from Denmark and spoke little English for much of their lives, I have no idea from what country our surname, Galusha, originates. I wanted to know more. So despite my misgivings \u2013 and there were many \u2013 my curiosity won out, and I sent in a test. What did I get in exchange for handing the company $119 and indefinite access to my genetic data? Confirmation that I am 63% British and Irish, 17% Danish and otherwise \u201cbroadly north-western European\u201d. I felt a resounding ambivalence about the results, including some disappointment that I had not discovered a newfound heritage \u2013 a piece of information that would give my identity new dimension. I was also surprised to find out that some parts of my identity present in the family lore \u2013 a Czech heritage \u2013 was not actually present in my genes. Now, as the looming collapse of the company raises serious concerns about what will happen to the database of users\u2019 genomic information, I am struggling to reconcile the fact that I traded away my genetic privacy to find out that I am mostly British. Timothy Caulfield, a professor at University of Alberta who has studied motivations for undergoing genetic ancestry testing and how consumer respond to their results, said my reaction \u2013 one of ambivalence \u2013 is actually the most common. \u201cWe are told by pop culture that we are supposed to care \u2013 that your genes matter,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of people get their results and find it very underwhelming.\u201d In addition to finding my results inconsequential, I have always found the idea of genetic testing for ancestry to be fraught, and was hesitant to buy into the idea that my genetic origins have any bearing on who I am as a person. Caulfield, who had his own ancestry tested despite similar misgivings, is of the same mind. He asserts that race is \u201ca biological fiction\u201d, one that these companies promote, marketing the idea that our genes are relevant to how we view ourselves as individuals. This mindset, Caulfield says, is \u201cthe essence of racism\u201d. \u201cOn one hand, I am enraged by it \u2013 I think it is an incredibly harmful trend, especially in this polarized world that we live in, where we\u2019re becoming more tribalistic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I get it. People are looking for roots. They\u2019re looking for meaning. They\u2019re looking for a tribe to belong to. And I think the marketing plays into that idea.\u201d That marketing was wildly successful for the better part of two decades. 23andMe was co-founded in 2006 by Anne Wojcicki. By the time it went public in 2021, the company was worth $3.5bn, and its value reached a peak of $6bn shortly thereafter. Competitors like Ancestry.com and MyHeritage entered the sphere, and by 2024 more than 40 million people in the world had taken consumer genetic tests. The individual appeal of these tests varies widely, but many consumers expressed an explicit desire to understand personal origins that inform their identities, said Muriel Leuenberger, a postdoctoral researcher at University of Zurich whose work centers on philosophy of identity and genealogy. \u201cOne hope I see in people pursuing these tests is to develop a richer self-conception,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a thought that you get this information, and then suddenly things you did in the past or character traits that you have might fall into place and make sense in a different way that they haven\u2019t before.\u201d For many people, those tests can reframe a sense of identity, for better or worse. Many have shared stories about a genetic test disproving longstanding family lore \u2013 like a long-cited story of Native American roots being negated, for example. I had always heard my family was Czech \u2013 a heritage that did not show up in any percentage in my results. This identity was not part of my upbringing beyond passing references, so discovering it did not exist make a huge impact on me. However, similar discoveries can lead to existential crises for those who have closely associated with a certain identity, said Leuenberger. \u201cFor some, you have a whole cultural background with which you really identify, maybe it was even part of your upbringing, and suddenly you\u2019re kind of cut off from it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can lead people to question this connection and whether they have a right to it if it is not proven by a genetic test.\u201d Such desires for certain cultural connections differ substantially by country, noted Caulfield \u2013 whose research found that in places like Canada and the US, consumers take tests hoping for an \u201cexotic\u201d background that aligns with the cultural understanding of our countries as a genetic melting pot. Black Americans have used genetic testing to trace a lineage violently fractured by the transatlantic slave trade, though some Black Americans have expressed concerns about privacy \u2013 as well as the ways in which DNA testing risks reifying racial stratification. In markets like China and Japan, he said, advertising campaigns instead seek to appeal to reaffirmation of ancestral purity. With the future of 23andMe in peril, the overarching question among previous customers now is what will happen to the data that has already been collected. Leuenberger noted that by entering DNA into a database, users sacrifice not only their own privacy but that of blood relatives. Because an individual\u2019s DNA is similar in structure to that of their relatives, information about others can be gleaned from one person\u2019s sample. This is especially pronounced with the rise of open-access DNA sites like GEDMatch, on which users can upload genetic data that can be compared to other samples. A consumer genealogy test contributed to the identification of serial killer Joseph James DeAngelo. \u201cWhat is ethically tricky with genetic data is that it\u2019s not just about self-knowledge \u2013 it\u2019s also knowledge about all of your relatives,\u201d Leuenberger said. \u201cMorally speaking, it is not necessarily information that is yours to give \u2013 and this risk is exacerbated if this company goes down and the fate of the data becomes more perilous.\u201d In an attempt to minimize these risks, I requested that my account be deleted and the company send me a copy of my data. I received an email confirming my deletion request \u2013 with some caveats. While samples I consented to have stored would be discarded, if I had opted into having my data used for research, that information could not be withdrawn or undone. Luckily, I had not. 23andMe and its genotyping labs are required under the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and California laboratory regulations to retain my genetic information, date of birth and sex. In other words, the company is required to retain some portions of the information I am asking it to delete. The company will also retain \u201climited information\u201d related to my deletion request. 23andMe declined to respond to questions regarding the nature of genetic information it is required to retain. In a statement, spokesperson Katie Watson cited 23andMe\u2019s \u201cstrong customer privacy protections\u201d, including not sharing customer data with third parties without customer consent. Many privacy concerns center around what will happen to the data if 23andMe changes ownership or goes bankrupt. Regarding those concerns, Watson noted that the company\u2019s CEO, Wojcicki, has stated she intends to take the company private, and is not open to considering third party takeover proposals \u2013 thus maintaining the current privacy policy. \u201cWe are committed to protecting customer data and are consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThat will not change.\u201d As for my genetic data, I received a copy of my ancestry report \u2013 confirming my largely British heritage \u2013 and a 17MB text file containing my entire genome. While being able to receive such data is compulsory under many privacy laws, it raises the question of how useful reclaiming our data from tech companies really is, Caulfield said. Referencing a study conducted in 2020, he said consumers at a fundamental level feel they should have a right to their genomic information \u2013 even if they cannot understand the raw mass of millions of As, Cs, Ts and Gs. \u201cIt is important to people to have a right to this data dump with their whole genome, even though for virtually every human on the planet it is meaningless,\u201d Caulfield said. So what will I do with my newfound understanding of self and long list of genotype identifiers sitting on my computer desktop? Nothing. I have traveled little in Europe, and thus have yet to visit any of my disparate homelands. Perhaps if I make my way over to London in the near future, I will be overwhelmed with a sense of belonging, and all my angst over who owns my genomic information will all be worth it. But I am doubtful that the tradeoff resulted in anything but a resounding ambivalence and the sacrifice of my genetic self.",

If and when it goes ahead, the Liberal party and voters on the left are expected to switch support to Lasconi in a concerted bid to block Georgescu.</p> <p>This unprecedented turmoil is dramatising another pan-European worry: Russian hybrid warfare and, specifically, election interference and disinformation campaigns via social media. Georgescu\u2019s feat in coming from nowhere to win raised red flags about \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d and under-the-radar influence operations. An <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2n83vgxxjo\">inquiry has been launched</a> amid calls for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/romanian-regulator-tiktok-suspended-cyber-interference-election-georgescu\">TikTok</a> to be suspended. </p> <p>Yet even if Georgescu is ultimately thwarted, the evident appeal of his hard-right, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/romanian-liberals-back-centrist-presidential-candidate-after-hard-right-surge-2024-11-26/\">sovereigntist agenda</a> could shift the next parliament to the right and profoundly affect Romania\u2019s future direction. </p> <p>Nato has particular reason to worry. Earlier this year the alliance announced a $2.7bn expansion at its Mihail Kogalniceanu base in Constanta, on the Black Sea coast. When complete, it will be the <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2024/03/21/romania-to-host-largest-nato-military-base-in-europe/\">largest Nato military base</a> in Europe. Its presence underscores Romania\u2019s vital role in maintaining supply routes to Ukraine, facilitating Kyiv\u2019s grain exports, and holding the frontline in the west\u2019s deepening confrontation with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. </p> <p>Yet if he has his way, Georgescu <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/romania-election-stunner-who-is-calin-georgescu-marcel-ciolacu/\">would cut aid</a> to Ukraine and limit Romania\u2019s collaboration with Nato, which he believes makes the country a target. He is critical of the deployment of US anti-missile batteries at Deveselu, in southern Romania, which he deems unnecessarily provocative of Moscow.</p> <p>All this is sending shivers across a Europe that already feels itself under siege, internally from extremist political parties, and externally from a subversive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/16/trump-putin-xi-strongmen-are-at-the-gate-but-europes-leaders-are-too-busy-infighting-to-notice\">Russia and its anti-democratic allies</a>. Instability along the EU\u2019s south-eastern frontline, exacerbated by economic discontents, is increasing. Fear of what Russia might do next, after Ukraine, is driving support for Kremlin appeasers and conciliators.</p> <p>Elections in Moldova, Romania\u2019s neighbour, in November provided additional chilling insights into these shared challenges. Maia Sandu, the country\u2019s pro-western president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/moldovans-vote-in-presidential-runoff-amid-claims-of-russian-interference\">narrowly won</a> re-election in the teeth of a covert, Russian-inspired and funded campaign to oust her. Sandu defeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/moldova-fears-kremlin-fixing-eu-referendum-russia\">Moldova\u2019s version</a> of Georgescu, the Kremlin-friendly outsider Alexandr Stoianoglo. A referendum on EU integration in October was also illicitly targeted by Moscow.</p> <p>]</p> <p>Across the Black Sea, Georgia\u2019s voters are embroiled in a political nightmare after the ruling party, Georgian Dream, stole October\u2019s parliamentary elections. The EU has rejected the outcome, highlighting \u201csignificant irregularities\u201d, bribery, impersonation and violence. Adding insult to injury time, a former Manchester City footballer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/former-manchester-city-player-becomes-presidential-candidate-in-georgia\">Mikheil Kavelashvili</a>, looks set to be installed as president. </p> <p>Georgian Dream\u2019s authoritarian drift is blamed for a breakdown in EU accession talks. The party is viewed as increasingly influenced by Russia, which was once again reportedly at work behind the election scenes. Passionate opposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/georgia-protest-irakli-kobakhidze-salome-zourabichvili\">street protests</a>, continuing last week, and a boycott of parliament have failed to overturn the result.</p> <p>Brussels has expressed dismay. US president Joe Biden said he was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgej9vyld8qo\">deeply alarmed</a> by the country\u2019s democratic backsliding\u201d \u2013 but little has been done to help. Score that one to Moscow, too. </p> <p>The story is not so very different elsewhere in south-eastern and central Europe. In Serbia, Bosnia, Hungary and Slovakia, right-leaning political leaders pay court to Putin and challenge the EU values they profess to uphold. Even in France and Germany, heartlands of the European project, the rightist Russian-incited rot has set in. Where Angela Merkel once ruled, Marine Le Pen and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/germany-far-right-afd-leader-alice-weidel-eu-exit-campaign\">Alice Weidel</a> now strut.</p> <p>Nationalist-populist parties feeding off anger over cost of living, migration and cultural tensions, and encouraged and funded by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/23/the-ukraine-missile-crisis-putins-shadow-war-against-the-west-finally-breaks-cover\">hostile Russia</a> waging hybrid and cognitive warfare \u2013 these are the twinned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/russia-sabotage-of-west-may-prompt-nato-defence-clause\">foes disrupting</a>, dividing and weakening European democracies. None is immune. None has yet worked out how to turn the tide.</p> <p>And now a third negative force is at work. Romania\u2019s are the first national elections to be held in a western democracy since Donald Trump triumphed in America. Is there a Trump effect? His cynical populism, me-first economics, pro-Russia stance and disdain for democratic norms and values exemplify \u2013 and spuriously validate \u2013 all that is going wrong across Europe today. Recalling the 1930s, some say Codreanu\u2019s Iron Guard-style fascism is returning. Maybe, maybe not. Whatever name you give it, it\u2019s frightening.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commentator</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Its presence underscores Romania\u2019s vital role in maintaining supply routes to Ukraine, facilitating Kyiv\u2019s grain exports, and holding the frontline in the west\u2019s deepening confrontation with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Yet if he has his way, Georgescu would cut aid to Ukraine and limit Romania\u2019s collaboration with Nato, which he believes makes the country a target. He is critical of the deployment of US anti-missile batteries at Deveselu, in southern Romania, which he deems unnecessarily provocative of Moscow. All this is sending shivers across a Europe that already feels itself under siege, internally from extremist political parties, and externally from a subversive Russia and its anti-democratic allies. Instability along the EU\u2019s south-eastern frontline, exacerbated by economic discontents, is increasing. Fear of what Russia might do next, after Ukraine, is driving support for Kremlin appeasers and conciliators. Elections in Moldova, Romania\u2019s neighbour, in November provided additional chilling insights into these shared challenges. Maia Sandu, the country\u2019s pro-western president, narrowly won re-election in the teeth of a covert, Russian-inspired and funded campaign to oust her. Sandu defeated Moldova\u2019s version of Georgescu, the Kremlin-friendly outsider Alexandr Stoianoglo. A referendum on EU integration in October was also illicitly targeted by Moscow. ] Across the Black Sea, Georgia\u2019s voters are embroiled in a political nightmare after the ruling party, Georgian Dream, stole October\u2019s parliamentary elections. The EU has rejected the outcome, highlighting \u201csignificant irregularities\u201d, bribery, impersonation and violence. Adding insult to injury time, a former Manchester City footballer, Mikheil Kavelashvili, looks set to be installed as president. Georgian Dream\u2019s authoritarian drift is blamed for a breakdown in EU accession talks. The party is viewed as increasingly influenced by Russia, which was once again reportedly at work behind the election scenes. Passionate opposition street protests, continuing last week, and a boycott of parliament have failed to overturn the result. Brussels has expressed dismay. US president Joe Biden said he was \u201cdeeply alarmed by the country\u2019s democratic backsliding\u201d \u2013 but little has been done to help. Score that one to Moscow, too. The story is not so very different elsewhere in south-eastern and central Europe. In Serbia, Bosnia, Hungary and Slovakia, right-leaning political leaders pay court to Putin and challenge the EU values they profess to uphold. Even in France and Germany, heartlands of the European project, the rightist Russian-incited rot has set in. Where Angela Merkel once ruled, Marine Le Pen and Alice Weidel now strut. Nationalist-populist parties feeding off anger over cost of living, migration and cultural tensions, and encouraged and funded by a hostile Russia waging hybrid and cognitive warfare \u2013 these are the twinned foes disrupting, dividing and weakening European democracies. None is immune. None has yet worked out how to turn the tide. And now a third negative force is at work. Romania\u2019s are the first national elections to be held in a western democracy since Donald Trump triumphed in America. Is there a Trump effect? His cynical populism, me-first economics, pro-Russia stance and disdain for democratic norms and values exemplify \u2013 and spuriously validate \u2013 all that is going wrong across Europe today. Recalling the 1930s, some say Codreanu\u2019s Iron Guard-style fascism is returning. Maybe, maybe not. Whatever name you give it, it\u2019s frightening. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commentator Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They use the lights on their phone to show what happened when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/26/wales-valleys-floods-aberfan-climate-adaptation\">long-abandoned coal tip collapsed</a> during last weekend\u2019s torrential rainfall and surged through their front and back doors.</p> <p>\u201cOur house bore the brunt of the landslide\u2026 I spent an hour holding the door to prevent the slurry from getting in [last Sunday night],\u201d says Connor, 49, as he stands in the cold gloom of their powerless living room. \u201cIt was frightening but when you are in it, you just react. It\u2019s fight or flight.\u201d</p> <p>The millions of tonnes of coal dug up from rich seams below Cwmtillery and other Welsh valleys powered British industry in the 18th and 19th centuries. But the mining companies left behind giant spoil piles on hillsides, which now pose a growing threat to the miners\u2019 descendants \u2013 not only because torrential rain can cause landslides, but because the carbon emitted from that same coal they extracted hundreds of years ago is driving up global temperatures and causing heavier rainfall.</p>    <p>The tip above Connor and Honeyfield\u2019s home was categorised as posing the highest risk to public safety under a Welsh government programme launched after a landslip in a nearby former mining valley in 2020. Overall, there are <a href=\"https://www.gov.wales/coal-tip-safety\">360</a> coal tips deemed to be a risk in Wales, which are inspected either twice a year or once a year because increasingly intense rainfall is making them more unstable.</p> <p>The entire Connor-Honeyfield family, including their two teenage children, have been placed in a family room in a Premier Inn since the landslip. But they come back regularly because they run the community cafe in the village. Other residents have also been moved out in case more of the tip comes down. \u201cPeople are angry that we were living under a tip that we didn\u2019t know was dangerous,\u201d says Honeyfield, 49. \u201cI\u2019d like it to be removed because then I wouldn\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/wales-floodmap/giv-4559fRJuhyYJ4Xu5/\" data-alt=\"towns affected by floods\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/wales-floodmap/giv-4559fRJuhyYJ4Xu5/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The Welsh government estimated it <a href=\"https://www.gov.wales/new-data-shows-true-scale-of-coal-tip-challenge-as-first-minister-makes-fresh-funding-call\">needed</a> at least \u00a3500m to \u00a3600m to remedy the country\u2019s tips in 2021 but the Conservative government failed to provide extra funding.

      "body": "<p>As a few low murmurs broke out in a respectfully reflective House of Commons chamber after its historic vote on assisted dying in England and Wales, one figure in the public gallery had a special interest in the result.</p> <p>Back in 2015, Rob Marris, the former Labour MP for Wolverhampton South West, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/10/david-cameron-opposes-any-move-to-legalise-assisted-dying\">tabled the previous attempt</a> to pass a bill changing the law. It was comprehensively defeated.</p> <p>On Friday, he returned to the Commons for the first time since departing as an MP in 2017. The bill being discussed was remarkably similar to the one he had presented nine years earlier, but he and other advocates for assisted dying desperately hoped that sentiment among MPs had shifted.</p> <p>As the debate progressed and a series of MPs gave thoughtful and heartfelt speeches against any change in the law, Marris feared the opportunity would again be lost for another decade. So when the vote\u2019s result arrived after five hours of dignified but impassioned discussion, it came as a surprise.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who I expected to support the bill were not doing so in their speeches,\u201d he said, moments after leaving the chamber. \u201cI thought that maybe the tide was not with us. But there is still a long way to go on this bill.\u201d</p>    <p>He and other MPs who were present for the last vote on the issue noticed a satisfying symmetry after Friday\u2019s vote. In 2015, 330 MPs voted against assisted dying for terminally ill people. Last week, 330 voted in favour of the bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/assisted-dying-bill-parliament-kim-leadbeater-labour-mp\">presented by Labour backbencher Kim Leadbeater</a>.</p> <p>That reversal was taken by some MPs as a neat reflection of a debate that had reached a tipping point. Yet just as Marris warned, others supportive of the idea now say that the hard work must continue to hold on to wavering MPs.</p> <p>For those in favour of change, the vote was a moment in which parliament finally reflected the long-held views of the public. Polls have regularly shown a majority in favour of assisted dying.</p> <p>The latest Opinium poll for the <em>Observer</em> found that almost two-thirds (64%) support making it legal for someone to seek assisted dying, while a fifth (19%) are opposed.</p> <p>But the current campaign to hand the right of assisted dying to terminally ill people with six months left to live gained serious traction over the past year.</p>    <p>It began last December, with interventions from two public figures from outside Westminster. First, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/dec/09/diana-rigg-plea-assisted-dying\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/dec/09/diana-rigg-plea-assisted-dying\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/dec/09/diana-rigg-plea-assisted-dying\"> revealed</a> that actor Diana Rigg had made an impassioned case to legalise assisted dying in a message recorded shortly before her \u201ctruly awful\u201d and \u201cdehumanising\u201d death from cancer in 2020.</p> <p>Just days later, television presenter Esther Rantzen, who has lung cancer, revealed she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/dec/19/esther-rantzen-considering-assisted-dying-if-cancer-treatment-fails\">joined the Dignitas assisted dying clinic in Switzerland</a>. Backing a change in England and Wales, she said there should be a choice over \u201chow you want to go and when you want to go\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/23/two-former-health-secretaries-join-calls-for-new-law-on-assisted-dying\">former health secretaries Stephen Dorrell and Alan Milburn</a> said they were backing a change.</p> <p>Crucially, Labour confirmed that, should it win power, it would make time and expert advice available for an assisted dying bill if MPs backed it in a free House of Commons vote. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/11/mps-begin-debate-assisted-dying-bill\">Keir Starmer had backed Marris\u2019s bill back in 2015</a> and remains supportive of a new law.</p> <p>Momentum built in July, when Charles Falconer, who was lord chancellor in Tony Blair\u2019s government and had first adopted the issue of assisted dying in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/26/assisted-dying-bill-to-be-introduced-into-house-of-lords\">introduced a private members\u2019 bill to the House of Lords</a>.</p> <p>But he and other campaigners knew that it was a vote in the Commons that was really needed to have any real prospect of success. By the autumn, the issue had become a regular public debating point.</p> <p>Yet it is a quirk of Westminster\u2019s obscure traditions that when the opportunity for this sea change in social policy arose, it came not through public pressure, but via a small ball printed with the number 238.</p> <p>The ball \u2013 one of 458 in a bowl \u2013 was picked out at random in mid-September as part of the raffle to decide which MPs would have the chance to present their own private members\u2019 bills. Leadbeater\u2019s came out on top.</p> <p>Tory MP Nusrat Ghani, who had the task of picking out the balls, reacted with unerring prescience. \u201cWell done to Kim,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are No 1 and you\u2019ll be, gosh, very busy indeed.\u201d</p>    <p>When it came, it was a vote that divided the closest of fellow travellers. Leftwing flag bearers John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn found themselves entering different division lobbies \u2013 one of the rarest of political occasions.</p> <p>McDonnell had recently reached the decision that he was ready to vote in favour of giving people more choice over how they die, while Corbyn continued to worry about safeguards.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nigel Farage voted against the bill, but his deputy and former Reform UK leader, Richard Tice, voted in favour.</p> <p>Parties split, the cabinet split \u2013 and even families found themselves divided. Danny Kruger, a leading opponent of what he described as \u201cassisted suicide\u201d, is at odds with his mother, the television presenter Prue Leith.</p> <p>Yet the only real political fallout has been some anger aimed at Wes Streeting, the health secretary, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/13/assisted-dying-law-nhs-cuts-wes-streeting\">spoke out against the bill</a>. Ministers had been advised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/18/how-are-are-cabinet-ministers-likely-to-vote-on-assisted-dying\">stay out of the public debate</a>.</p> <p>While Streeting has talked openly of his fears about a \u201cchilling slippery slope\u201d, some in the party believe he sees it as a significant distraction from his huge task of reforming the NHS to bring down waiting times.</p> <p>But overall, there was broad agreement that last week\u2019s considered debate showed parliament at its best.</p> <p>\u201cI kept saying to colleagues that it would be a day where parliament shows itself in that way,\u201d said one cabinet minister. \u201cIt nearly always does that at these moments. I knew there\u2019d be no shenanigans.\u201d</p> <p>Friday\u2019s passing of the second reading of the bill is in itself a historic moment but, as Marris and others have said, obstacles remain before it becomes law, and the hard work for Leadbeater and other leading advocates still lies ahead.</p> <p>All sides of the debate now agree that proper time should be given to the bill to ensure that expert evidence is given, impact assessments are carried out and it is improved line by line where necessary.</p>    <p>That will mean it will be studied and scrutinised by a cross-party committee for months, before re-emerging in parliament in about April.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/29/what-happens-next-assisted-dying-bill\">What happens next after MPs\u2019 vote in favour of assisted dying bill?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 55-strong majority returned in the vote is seemingly robust in normal parliamentary terms, but the bill\u2019s passage into law cannot yet be guaranteed.</p> <p>Some MPs backed the bill in order to continue the debate and are awaiting reassurances before voting it into law. Among them is former Brexit secretary David Davis, though the <em>Observer</em> has heard from other MPs in the same position. There are also the 31 MPs who did not record a vote, who could yet be crucial.</p> <p>More granular debates lie ahead. Looking back on Friday\u2019s events, however, some of those involved in the assisted dying debate for years reflected on the fact that even with so many new MPs in parliament, almost all of them opted to grapple with the issue and take a view.</p> <p>\u201cIf that is the template for this parliament, it\u2019s going to be a very, very impressive parliament,\u201d said Lord Falconer. \u201cWhatever else happens in this parliament, it will be remembered for this incredibly historic change.\u201d</p>",

Keir Starmer had backed Marris\u2019s bill back in 2015 and remains supportive of a new law. Momentum built in July, when Charles Falconer, who was lord chancellor in Tony Blair\u2019s government and had first adopted the issue of assisted dying in 2013, introduced a private members\u2019 bill to the House of Lords. But he and other campaigners knew that it was a vote in the Commons that was really needed to have any real prospect of success. By the autumn, the issue had become a regular public debating point. Yet it is a quirk of Westminster\u2019s obscure traditions that when the opportunity for this sea change in social policy arose, it came not through public pressure, but via a small ball printed with the number 238. The ball \u2013 one of 458 in a bowl \u2013 was picked out at random in mid-September as part of the raffle to decide which MPs would have the chance to present their own private members\u2019 bills. Leadbeater\u2019s came out on top. Tory MP Nusrat Ghani, who had the task of picking out the balls, reacted with unerring prescience. \u201cWell done to Kim,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are No 1 and you\u2019ll be, gosh, very busy indeed.\u201d When it came, it was a vote that divided the closest of fellow travellers. Leftwing flag bearers John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn found themselves entering different division lobbies \u2013 one of the rarest of political occasions. McDonnell had recently reached the decision that he was ready to vote in favour of giving people more choice over how they die, while Corbyn continued to worry about safeguards. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage voted against the bill, but his deputy and former Reform UK leader, Richard Tice, voted in favour. Parties split, the cabinet split \u2013 and even families found themselves divided. Danny Kruger, a leading opponent of what he described as \u201cassisted suicide\u201d, is at odds with his mother, the television presenter Prue Leith. Yet the only real political fallout has been some anger aimed at Wes Streeting, the health secretary, who spoke out against the bill. Ministers had been advised to stay out of the public debate. While Streeting has talked openly of his fears about a \u201cchilling slippery slope\u201d, some in the party believe he sees it as a significant distraction from his huge task of reforming the NHS to bring down waiting times. But overall, there was broad agreement that last week\u2019s considered debate showed parliament at its best. \u201cI kept saying to colleagues that it would be a day where parliament shows itself in that way,\u201d said one cabinet minister. \u201cIt nearly always does that at these moments. I knew there\u2019d be no shenanigans.\u201d Friday\u2019s passing of the second reading of the bill is in itself a historic moment but, as Marris and others have said, obstacles remain before it becomes law, and the hard work for Leadbeater and other leading advocates still lies ahead. All sides of the debate now agree that proper time should be given to the bill to ensure that expert evidence is given, impact assessments are carried out and it is improved line by line where necessary. That will mean it will be studied and scrutinised by a cross-party committee for months, before re-emerging in parliament in about April. The 55-strong majority returned in the vote is seemingly robust in normal parliamentary terms, but the bill\u2019s passage into law cannot yet be guaranteed. Some MPs backed the bill in order to continue the debate and are awaiting reassurances before voting it into law. Among them is former Brexit secretary David Davis, though the Observer has heard from other MPs in the same position. There are also the 31 MPs who did not record a vote, who could yet be crucial. More granular debates lie ahead. Looking back on Friday\u2019s events, however, some of those involved in the assisted dying debate for years reflected on the fact that even with so many new MPs in parliament, almost all of them opted to grapple with the issue and take a view. \u201cIf that is the template for this parliament, it\u2019s going to be a very, very impressive parliament,\u201d said Lord Falconer. \u201cWhatever else happens in this parliament, it will be remembered for this incredibly historic change.\u201d",

Speaking to the Observer, Ask Hesby Holm, chief executive of Digitalt Ansvar, said the company was shocked by the results, having thought that, as the images it shared increased in severity, they would set off alarm bells on the platform. \u201cWe thought that when we did this gradually, we would hit the threshold where AI or other tools would recognise or identify these images,\u201d he said. \u201cBut big surprise \u2013 they didn\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cThat was worrying because we thought that they had some kind of machinery trying to figure out and identify this content.\u201d Failing to moderate self-harm images can result in \u201csevere consequences\u201d, he said. \u201cThis is highly associated with suicide. So if there\u2019s nobody flagging or doing anything about these groups, they go unknown to parents, authorities, those who can help support.\u201d Meta, he believes, does not moderate small private groups, such as the one his company created, in order to maintain high traffic and engagement. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they moderate bigger groups, but the problem is self-harming groups are small,\u201d he said. Lotte Rub\u00e6k, a leading psychologist who left Meta\u2019s global expert group on suicide prevention in March after accusing it of \u201cturning a blind eye\u201d to harmful Instagram content, said while she was not surprised by the overall findings, she was shocked to see that they did not remove the most explicit content. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought that it would be zero out of 85 posts that they removed,\u201d she said. \u201cI hoped that it would be better. \u201cThey have repeatedly said in the media that all the time they are improving their technology and that they have the best engineers in the world. This proves, even though on a small scale, that this is not true.\u201d Rub\u00e6k said Meta\u2019s failure to remove images of self-harm from its platforms was \u201ctriggering\u201d vulnerable young women and girls to further harm themselves and contributing to rising suicide figures. Since she left the global expert group, she said the situation on the platform had only worsened, the impact of which is plain to see in her patients. The issue of self-harm on Instagram, she said, is a matter of life and death for young children and teenagers. \u201cAnd somehow that\u2019s just collateral damage to them on the way to making money and profit on their platforms.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111.

The photographs really did not do justice to just how impressive and characterful it is. The skin is almost jet black.\u201d</p> <p>The animal is an enormous bit of surviving evidence of a period of so-called \u201crhinomania\u201d that swept Europe at the end of the 18th century, with clocks, decorations and occasionally even wigs all styled to feature the shape of the animal.</p> <p>One thing that hosting the rhino has already made clear to Morgan is that it would never be possible for a human to ride it without the sort of specially constructed saddle controversially invented for the new <em>Gladiator II</em> film. \u201cThe rhino\u2019s back is far too wide, and it would not be advisable to try, in any case,\u201d he said.</p>    <p>The French king\u2019s rhino, which eventually died a violent death of its own, is to be one of the main attractions at the museum\u2019s major new show, <a href=\"https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/versailles-science-and-splendour\">Versailles: Science and Splendour</a>, which opens next week. The exhibition will look at all the animals collected from around the world, and subsequently studied, that were held at the zoo at Versailles, each brought over to France to advertise the king\u2019s power and global reach.</p> <p>\u201cIt is significant that it\u2019s an Indian rhino, because that speaks to the geopolitical expression of Louis XV\u2019s power,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBut then, as it was studied by scientists, it became incredibly important to our growing zoological knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>The male rhino (<em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>) lived alone in a fenced pen in the Royal M\u00e9nagerie, with a little pool, and soon became one of the most famous residents of the French capital. A gift from the French governor of Chandernagore, Jean-Baptiste Chevalier, it had been conveyed over on a boat, travelling for 10 months before arriving at Versailles. Leaving Calcutta, West Bengal on 22 December 1769, it arrived in Lorient, Brittany on 11 June 1770.</p>    <p>\u201cThe sea voyage was long because there was no Suez canal then, but the journey across France was just as bad,\u201d said Morgan. There was no suitable transportation for such a big beast at the port of Lorient, so it remained there for several weeks, while a vehicle was built that could transport it the 450km east to Versailles.</p> <p>\u201cIt was one of many animals in the menagerie, and we will highlight that it was not kept in conditions that can compare even to a modern zoo,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIt was unhealthy, but must have had moments of complete passivity, because it was possible to massage.\u201d</p> <p>The animal stayed at Versailles for 22 years, passing down into the ownership of the king\u2019s grandson, Louis XVI, until it was killed by a sabre thrust in 1793, during the Reign of Terror after the French Revolution.</p> <p>The rhino then became the subject of the earliest known experiment in taxidermy at such scale. Two eminent taxidermists, Jean-Claude Mertrud and F\u00e9lix Vicq d\u2019Azyr, worked together to dissect and stuff it. \u201cIt looks oddly barrel-chested because the exterior shape was supported with wooden hoops and the legs are too straight due to the beams inside,\u201d said Morgan. The rhino then went on display at the Grande Galerie de l\u2019Evolution in the Jardin des Plantes, while its skeleton was sent to the neighbouring Galerie de Pal\u00e9ontologie et d\u2019Anatomie compar\u00e9e, both parts of Paris\u2019s Natural History Museum.</p> <p>For 200 years, the rhino wore a mismatched horn. A 19th-century naturalist had given it a much larger one in an effort to accentuate its regal status. \u201cIt was probably one that came from an African rhino,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBut it now has a replica of the right one and has been a mainstay of the Paris museum. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never been on loan before, except to go back to Versailles, briefly, a decade ago for an exhibition. The loan of such a fragile, significant exhibit is testament to the strength of the relationship we have built up.\u201d</p>",

The skin is almost jet black.\u201d The animal is an enormous bit of surviving evidence of a period of so-called \u201crhinomania\u201d that swept Europe at the end of the 18th century, with clocks, decorations and occasionally even wigs all styled to feature the shape of the animal. One thing that hosting the rhino has already made clear to Morgan is that it would never be possible for a human to ride it without the sort of specially constructed saddle controversially invented for the new Gladiator II film. \u201cThe rhino\u2019s back is far too wide, and it would not be advisable to try, in any case,\u201d he said. The French king\u2019s rhino, which eventually died a violent death of its own, is to be one of the main attractions at the museum\u2019s major new show, Versailles: Science and Splendour, which opens next week. The exhibition will look at all the animals collected from around the world, and subsequently studied, that were held at the zoo at Versailles, each brought over to France to advertise the king\u2019s power and global reach. \u201cIt is significant that it\u2019s an Indian rhino, because that speaks to the geopolitical expression of Louis XV\u2019s power,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBut then, as it was studied by scientists, it became incredibly important to our growing zoological knowledge.\u201d The male rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) lived alone in a fenced pen in the Royal M\u00e9nagerie, with a little pool, and soon became one of the most famous residents of the French capital. A gift from the French governor of Chandernagore, Jean-Baptiste Chevalier, it had been conveyed over on a boat, travelling for 10 months before arriving at Versailles. Leaving Calcutta, West Bengal on 22 December 1769, it arrived in Lorient, Brittany on 11 June 1770. \u201cThe sea voyage was long because there was no Suez canal then, but the journey across France was just as bad,\u201d said Morgan. There was no suitable transportation for such a big beast at the port of Lorient, so it remained there for several weeks, while a vehicle was built that could transport it the 450km east to Versailles. \u201cIt was one of many animals in the menagerie, and we will highlight that it was not kept in conditions that can compare even to a modern zoo,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIt was unhealthy, but must have had moments of complete passivity, because it was possible to massage.\u201d The animal stayed at Versailles for 22 years, passing down into the ownership of the king\u2019s grandson, Louis XVI, until it was killed by a sabre thrust in 1793, during the Reign of Terror after the French Revolution. The rhino then became the subject of the earliest known experiment in taxidermy at such scale. Two eminent taxidermists, Jean-Claude Mertrud and F\u00e9lix Vicq d\u2019Azyr, worked together to dissect and stuff it. \u201cIt looks oddly barrel-chested because the exterior shape was supported with wooden hoops and the legs are too straight due to the beams inside,\u201d said Morgan. The rhino then went on display at the Grande Galerie de l\u2019Evolution in the Jardin des Plantes, while its skeleton was sent to the neighbouring Galerie de Pal\u00e9ontologie et d\u2019Anatomie compar\u00e9e, both parts of Paris\u2019s Natural History Museum. For 200 years, the rhino wore a mismatched horn. A 19th-century naturalist had given it a much larger one in an effort to accentuate its regal status. \u201cIt was probably one that came from an African rhino,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBut it now has a replica of the right one and has been a mainstay of the Paris museum. \u201cIt\u2019s never been on loan before, except to go back to Versailles, briefly, a decade ago for an exhibition. The loan of such a fragile, significant exhibit is testament to the strength of the relationship we have built up.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former prime minister Gordon Brown and the Scottish first minister, John Swinney, were among those who gathered at a memorial service for Alex Salmond after his sudden death in October at the age of 69. Tributes were paid to Salmond during the service on Saturday in Edinburgh; held to celebrate his love of Scotland and his commitment to the cause of independence. Among those paying tribute was Kenny MacAskill, a longtime friend who served as the justice secretary under Salmond and helped him run the Alba party after the two men left the Scottish National party. MacAskill, now the acting Alba leader, told the congregation Salmond had been a \u201cgiant of man\u201d who was \u201can inspiration, a political genius\u201d. \u201cMost of all a man who had the cause of independence burned into his heart and seared in his soul,\u201d he added.

Recalling Salmond\u2019s words from when he stood down as first minister that \u201cthe dream shall never die\u201d, MacAskill concluded his address with the words: \u201cYour dream shall be delivered.\u201d Attenders included Salmond\u2019s widow Moira, as well as the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, the former Labour first minister Henry McLeish and the Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay. The former Conservative Brexit minister and Salmond\u2019s longtime friend David Davis gave a reading as did the former SNP government minister and MSP Fergus Ewing. The Scottish folk singer Dougie MacLean performed his song Caledonia, while the singer Sheena Wellington led mourners in a rendition of Robert Burns\u2019 classic A Man\u2019s a Man For a\u2019 That. The Scottish duo the Proclaimers were applauded for their performance of Cap in Hand \u2013 a pro-independence song that features the line: \u201cI can\u2019t understand why we let someone else rule our land, cap in hand.\u201d Brothers Craig and Charlie Reid said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this for Alex, with love and respect and eternal gratitude for everything you did for our country.\u201d Christina Hendry described her \u201cUncle Alex\u201d as a \u201cpolitical giant, a strong leader, a fearless campaigner\u201d but also remembered him as a \u201cdearly loved husband, brother and uncle\u201d. While she said he had been \u201cthe top man in Scotland\u201d, he had \u201calways made time for his family\u201d, recalling how he phoned her brother on his birthday \u2013 the day after the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 \u2013 to apologise for not posting a card \u201cas he\u2019d been busy\u201d, before telling them he would be \u201cresigning in 10 minutes\u201d. She told the congregation: \u201cAs his family, we always felt loved no matter how far away he was or the time that passed before we saw him next. \u201cWe always knew he was standing up for our country, and for that we were grateful.\u201d Hendry continued: \u201cThe world will be a much quieter place without Uncle Alex, for Moira, for the wider family and for Scotland. \u201cUncle Alex passing means a great loss for many. A loss of Scotland\u2019s voice on the international stage. A loss of integrity in Scottish politics. And a great loss to Scotland\u2019s independence movement. As a family it is likely a loss we will never get over.\u201d A private family funeral has already taken place. While about 500 people, including family, friends and politicians from across the spectrum, attended the service at St Giles\u2019 Cathedral, his successor Nicola Sturgeon was not present.",

Russian defence minister Andrei Belousov has said on a visit to Pyongyang, North Korea, that cooperation between the two countries is growing \u201cin all areas\u201d while Kim Jong-un vows North will \u201cinvariably support\u201d Moscow\u2019s war. Ukraine has asked Latin American parliamentarians and diplomats to assist in its defence in the war with Russia. Representatives of Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Ecuador, Peru, and Costa Rica arrived in Kyiv for a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, pictures show. Former UK Ambassador to Russia Sir Tony Brenton has said Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is \u201cplaying a very sophisticated game\u201d in calling for Ukrainian-controlled territories to come under the Nato umbrella. But he added that Zelenskyy had made \u201cquite a major concession\u201c in stating he is prepared to see a ceasefire and then negotiate the return of Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine over the long term. Police in Moscow raided multiple bars early Saturday and arrested the director of a gay travel agency under laws criminalising \u201cLGBT propaganda\u201d, state media reported. The Kremlin has ramped up conservative rhetoric since launching its military assault on Ukraine almost three years ago, casting the conflict as a battleground against the West and its values. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) says it has charged Russian Colonel-General Yevgeny Nikiforov in absentia for ordering a missile strike on a theater in Chernihiv, in the North of the country, that killed seven people and wounded 200 in August 2023. The SBU charged Nikiforov, the commander of the \u201cWest\u201d grouping of troops in the Russian Armed Forces, with \u201cviolation of the laws and customs of war, combined with premeditated murder\u201d, the Kyiv Independent reports. It said Nikiforov ordered the missile strike on the Taras Shevchenko Chernihiv Regional Academic Music and Drama Theater that took place on August 19, last year. As of November 2024, Ukraine has charged 730 people and convicted 137 in absentia for committing war crimes in Ukraine, according to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. Sergey Lavrov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, has claimed that the Ukrainian security services were directly involved in assassinations of Russian journalists. Lavrov took part in a roundtable discussion Ukraine Crisis which the Kremlin said was attended by over 70 foreign ambassadors to Moscow on Friday. Videos of the event have been broadcast on state broadcaster RT and show attendees from Lebanon, Yemen, Morocco, Jordan and Guinea Bissau. He is quoted as saying: \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard a word of condemnation of these terrorist attacks from the Western countries. \u201cThe countries of the collective West, which like to speak about freedom of Speech, pluralism and democracy, actually show fierce intolerance of any alternative views.\u201d Police in Moscow raided multiple bars early Saturday and arrested the director of a gay travel agency under laws criminalising \u201cLGBT propaganda\u201d, state media reported. The raids came on the one year anniversary of Russia\u2019s Supreme Court outlawing the \u201cinternational LGBT movement\u201d, paving the way for arrests and prosecutions of the country\u2019s already repressed LGBTQ community. Russian security forces raided at least three bars and nightclubs overnight \u201cas part of measures to combat LGBT propaganda\u201d, the state TASS news agency reported. The Kremlin has ramped up conservative rhetoric since launching its military assault on Ukraine almost three years ago, casting the conflict as a battleground against the West and its values. Rights groups say the country is waging an unprecedented crackdown on LGBTQ people that has seen the owners of gay bars arrested and anyone associated with promoting LGBTQ rights prosecuted. Russian-Uzbek billionaire Alisher Usmanov was elected president of the International Fencing Federation at the body\u2019s congress in Uzbekistan\u2019s capital Tashkent on Saturday, the businessman\u2019s representative said. Usmanov, who according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index has a total net worth of $14.4 billion, made his fortune in mining, industry, telecoms, and media. He has been a major donor to international fencing through his charity fund. Usmanov was first elected FIE president in 2008 and re-elected in 2012, 2016 and 2021. The 71-year-old, currently under European Union and United States sanctions and a travel ban, stepped down as president of the federation after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine but was nominated for a return to the post. His candidacy got the backing of 120 out of 146 federation members who voted, his representative said. Usmanov was running against 58-year-old Swedish former Olympian Otto Drakenberg. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested that Ukrainian territory under his control should be taken under the \u201cNato umbrella\u201d to try to stop the \u201chot stage\u201d of the war with Russia. Speaking to Sky News, the Ukrainian president said that such a proposal has \u201cnever been considered\u201d by Ukraine because it has never \u201cofficially\u201d been offered. Speaking via a translation, Zelenskyy said: \u201cIf we want to stop the hot stage of the war, we should take under Nato umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control. That\u2019s what we need to do fast, and then Ukraine can get back the other part of its territory diplomatically. Former UK Ambassador to Russia Sir Tony Brenton has said Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is \u201cplaying a very sophisticated game\u201d in calling for Ukrainian-controlled territories to come under the Nato umbrella. \u201cHe knows that [Donald] Trump is about to descend on him and on Russia\u201d, Brenton said. \u201cHe is already arranging to have something to offer Trump on Trump\u2019s mission to bring the war to an end. What he is suggesting in many ways is bringing us much closer to the obvious target area which is a freeze in the fighting where the lines actually currently are and then an eventual negotiation about who retains which bit of territory and then security guarantees for Ukraine in the course of that ceasefire.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s air force announced Saturday that the country had come under attack from ten Russian drones, of which eight were shot down over the Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kherson regions. One drone returned to Russian-occupied territory, while the final drone disappeared from radar, often a sign of the use of electronic defenses. Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said that 11 Ukrainian drones had been shot down by the country\u2019s air defense systems. Both the mayor of Sochi, Andrey Proshunin, and the head of Russia\u2019s Dagestan region, Sergey Melikov, both in Russia\u2019s southwest, said that drones had been destroyed in their regions overnight. No casualties were reported. Poland\u2019s Prime Minister Donald Tusk traveled Saturday to his country\u2019s border with the Russian region of Kaliningrad to inspect progress in the construction of military fortifications along the eastern frontier, calling it \u201can investment in peace.\u201d \u201cThe better the Polish border is guarded, the more difficult it is to access for those with bad intentions,\u201d Tusk said at a news conference near the village of Dabrowka as he stood in front of concrete anti-tank barriers. Ukraine has asked Latin American parliamentarians and diplomats to assist in its defence in the war with Russia. Representatives of Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Ecuador, Peru, and Costa Rica arrived in Kyiv for a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, pictures show. The President urged them to join the peace process \u2013 according to Ukraine - work together to facilitate the return of illegally deported Ukrainian children, address food security issues and help Ukraine recover from shelling. Ukranian political analysts have argued Donald Trump\u2019s choice of special envoy for Ukraine and Russia is \u201cacceptable for Ukraine\u201d. Trump announced this week he would appoint Keith Kellogg \u2013 who was the chief of staff of the National Security Council from 2017 to 2018 and national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence from 2018 to 2021 \u2013 to the role. \u201cThere will be no (outright) pro-Ukrainian appointments (under Trump),\u201d Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. \u201cBut it\u2019s good if an appointee is not anti-Ukrainian.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Defence Ministry claims Russia has suffered an additional 1,740 combat losses. Publishing a graphic today which shows Ukraine\u2019s estimate of Russia\u2019s combat losses from February 24, 2022 to November 30, 2024, the ministry states Russia\u2019s losses include 72 vehicles and fuel tanks, 42 drones and 23 artillery systems. Ukraine claims Russia has lost 740,400 personnel in total, with almost half of that figure accounted for by lost vehicles and fuel tanks. Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, warned that Putin coming out of Ukraine with \u201cwhat feels like a win\u201d would be very risky for the UK. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme, he agreed with Richard Moore, the head of MI6, that it was currently the most dangerous moment in national security due to the \u201csheer number of simultaneous threats and crises\u201d the UK is facing. \u201cPutin is now feeling increasingly reckless\u201d, Ricketts said. \u201cThere used to be during the cold war and afterwards kind of unwritten rules of the road between the major powers to stop them from colliding together. The head of MI6 has warned in a speech yesterday \u2013 that amounted to a plea to Donald Trump to continue supporting Kyiv \u2013 that abandoning Ukraine would jeopardise British, European and American security and lead to \u201cinfinitely higher\u201d costs in the long term. Richard Moore, giving a rare speech, said he believed Vladimir Putin \u201cwould not stop\u201d at Ukraine if he was allowed to subjugate it in any peace talks involving the incoming US Republican administration. \u201cIf Putin is allowed to succeed in reducing Ukraine to a vassal state, he will not stop there. Our security \u2013 British, French, European and transatlantic \u2013 will be jeopardised,\u201d Moore said during an address given in Paris alongside his French counterpart. Ukraine\u2019s air force announced Saturday that the country had come under attack from ten Russian drones, of which eight were shot down over the Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kherson regions.

No casualties were reported. On Friday, the Ukrainian president announced a number of changes to military leadership, saying that changes in personnel management were needed to improve the situation on the battlefield. General Mykhailo Drapatyi, who led the defense of Kharkiv during Russia\u2019s new offensive on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city this year, was appointed the new head of Ukraine\u2019s Ground Forces. Oleh Apostol was named as the new Deputy Commander-in-Chief responsible for improving military training. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi also announced Friday that he would bolster units in Donetsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove with additional reserves, ammunition, weapons and military equipment. Former UK Ambassador to Russia Sir Tony Brenton has said Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is \u201cplaying a very sophisticated game\u201d in calling for Ukrainian-controlled territories to come under the Nato umbrella. \u201cHe knows that [Donald] Trump is about to descend on him and on Russia\u201d, Brenton said. \u201cHe is already arranging to have something to offer Trump on Trump\u2019s mission to bring the war to an end. \u201cWhat he is suggesting in many ways is bringing us much closer to the obvious target area which is a freeze in the fighting where the lines actually currently are and then an eventual negotiation about who retains which bit of territory and then security guarantees for Ukraine in the course of that ceasefire.\u201d But he added that Zelenskyy had made \u201cquite a major concession\u201c in stating he is prepared to see a ceasefire and then negotiate the return of Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine over the long term. \u201cPutin will see this as a concession by Zelenskyy\u201d, Brenton said. \u201cHe will say to himself \u2018ah, they are feeling weak, I can press for more\u2019. That is a danger as we go into this.\u201d Poland\u2019s Prime Minister Donald Tusk traveled Saturday to his country\u2019s border with the Russian region of Kaliningrad to inspect progress in the construction of military fortifications along the eastern frontier, calling it \u201can investment in peace.\u201d \u201cThe better the Polish border is guarded, the more difficult it is to access for those with bad intentions,\u201d Tusk said at a news conference near the village of Dabrowka as he stood in front of concrete anti-tank barriers. \u201cEverything we are doing here - and we will also be doing this on the border with Belarus and Ukraine - is to deter and discourage a potential aggressor, which is why it is truly an investment in peace,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cWe will spend billions of zlotys on this, but right now the whole of Europe is observing these investments and our actions with great satisfaction and will support them if necessary.\u201d He said he wants Poles \u201cto feel safer along the entire length of the eastern border.\u201d Tusk also said the fortifications would include Poland\u2019s border with Ukraine, a close ally, but did not elaborate. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has suggested that the war in his country could end without totally taking back territories occupied by Russia under Kyiv\u2019s control. Zelenskyy suggested that land controlled by the Ukrainian army could be taken under the Nato umbrella to end the \u2018hot war\u2019, and then diplomacy used to regain the remainder. Ukraine has asked Latin American parliamentarians and diplomats to assist in its defence in the war with Russia. Representatives of Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Ecuador, Peru, and Costa Rica arrived in Kyiv for a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, pictures show. The President urged them to join the peace process \u2013 according to Ukraine - work together to facilitate the return of illegally deported Ukrainian children, address food security issues and help Ukraine recover from shelling. \u201cThese are not weapons issues; these are other issues. These are issues of people having something to eat, something to feed their children, something to cook, electricity to keep them warm at night. Especially now, in winter,\u201d Zelenskyy emphasized. He called the visit of the Latin American delegation to Kyiv important for \u201ccountering Russian disinformation\u201d. Zelenskyy urged them to share their experiences and impressions and create platforms that would facilitate the exchange of reliable data on the Ukrainians\u2019 struggle against Russian aggression. Ukranian political analysts have argued Donald Trump\u2019s choice of special envoy for Ukraine and Russia is \u201cacceptable for Ukraine\u201d. Trump announced this week he would appoint Keith Kellogg \u2013 who was the chief of staff of the National Security Council from 2017 to 2018 and national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence from 2018 to 2021 \u2013 to the role. \u201cThere will be no (outright) pro-Ukrainian appointments (under Trump),\u201d Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. \u201cBut it\u2019s good if an appointee is not anti-Ukrainian.\u201d \u201cFrom this standpoint, if you compare (Kellogg) with others, he\u2019s absolutely acceptable for Ukraine,\u201d Fesenko added. \u201cHis position is understandable (for Kyiv), and we can adapt to it.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Defence Ministry claims Russia has suffered an additional 1,740 combat losses.

Read our explainer here for what we know on day 1,011: Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, warned that Putin coming out of Ukraine with \u201cwhat feels like a win\u201d would be very risky for the UK. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme, he agreed with Richard Moore, the head of MI6, that it was currently the most dangerous moment in national security due to the \u201csheer number of simultaneous threats and crises\u201d the UK is facing. \u201cPutin is now feeling increasingly reckless\u201d, Ricketts said. \u201cThere used to be during the cold war and afterwards kind of unwritten rules of the road between the major powers to stop them from colliding together. \u201cNow Putin is being staggeringly reckless in the way he continues to expand what he sees as a war on the West now. \u201cHe sees no boundaries and therefore the risk that Putin coming out with what feels like a win from the war in Ukraine would be very risky\u201d, he added. \u201cWe will be faced with a larger bill later for trying to contain a rampant Russia.\u201d The head of MI6 has warned in a speech yesterday \u2013 that amounted to a plea to Donald Trump to continue supporting Kyiv \u2013 that abandoning Ukraine would jeopardise British, European and American security and lead to \u201cinfinitely higher\u201d costs in the long term. Richard Moore, giving a rare speech, said he believed Vladimir Putin \u201cwould not stop\u201d at Ukraine if he was allowed to subjugate it in any peace talks involving the incoming US Republican administration. \u201cIf Putin is allowed to succeed in reducing Ukraine to a vassal state, he will not stop there. Our security \u2013 British, French, European and transatlantic \u2013 will be jeopardised,\u201d Moore said during an address given in Paris alongside his French counterpart. \u201cThe cost of supporting Ukraine is well known,\u201d said Moore. \u201cBut the cost of not doing so would be infinitely higher. If Putin succeeds, China would weigh the implications, North Korea would be emboldened and Iran would become still more dangerous.\u201d \u201cFor decades the US-UK intelligence alliance has made our societies safer; I worked successfully with the first Trump administration to advance our shared security and look forward to doing so again,\u201d Moore told his audience at the UK embassy, a short walk from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the official home of the French president. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested that Ukrainian territory under his control should be taken under the \u201cNato umbrella\u201d to try to stop the \u201chot stage\u201d of the war with Russia. Speaking to Sky News, the Ukrainian president said that such a proposal has \u201cnever been considered\u201d by Ukraine because it has never \u201cofficially\u201d been offered.

That\u2019s what we need to do fast, and then Ukraine can get back the other part of its territory diplomatically. \u201cThis proposal has never been considered by Ukraine because no one has ever offered that to us officially.\u201d In the same interview, Zelenskyy also said that any invitation should be given \u201cwithin its internationally recognised border, you can\u2019t give invitation to just one part of a country\u201d. Welcome to our continuing coverage of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Here\u2019s an overview of the latest news. North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, vowed his country will \u201cinvariably support\u201d Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine as he met Russia\u2019s defence minister and they agreed to boost military cooperation between the two countries, the North\u2019s state media reported on Saturday. A Russian military delegation led by the defence minister, Andrei Belousov, arrived in North Korea on Friday amid growing international concern about the countries\u2019 expanding cooperation after Pyongyang sent thousands of troops to Russia last month. Kim and Belousov reached a consensus on boosting strategic partnership and defending each country\u2019s sovereignty and security interests, the Associated Press cited the official Korean Central News Agency as saying. Kim said North Korea \u201cwill invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d, KCNA said. Belousov said Moscow-Pyongyang ties were \u201cactively expanding in all areas, including military cooperation\u201d, Russian news agencies reported. Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, has urged his Nato counterparts to issue an invitation to Kyiv at a meeting in Brussels next week to join the western military alliance, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested that Ukrainian territory under his control should be taken under the \u201cNato umbrella\u201d to try to stop the \u201chot stage\u201d of the war with Russia. He told Sky News that such a proposal had \u201cnever been considered\u201d by Kyiv because it had never \u201cofficially\u201d been offered. In other developments: Abandoning Ukraine would jeopardise British, European and US security and lead to \u201cinfinitely higher\u201d costs in the long term, the head of MI6 warned in a speech that amounted to a plea to US president-elect Donald Trump to continue supporting Kyiv. Richard Moore said he believed the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, \u201cwould not stop\u201d at Ukraine if he was allowed to subjugate it in any peace talks involving the incoming US Republican administration. Moore accused Russia of waging a \u201cstaggeringly reckless campaign\u201d of sabotage in Europe while also stepping up its nuclear sabre-rattling to scare other countries off from backing Ukraine. \u201cOur security \u2013 British, French, European and transatlantic \u2013 will be jeopardised,\u201d he said during an address in Paris alongside his French counterpart. Volodymyr Zelenskyy appointed Maj Gen Mykhailo Drapatyi as the new commander of Ukraine\u2019s land forces. \u201cThe Ukrainian army needs internal changes to achieve our state\u2019s goals in full,\u201d the Ukrainian president said on Telegram on Friday. The French president vowed to give Ukraine intensive support in its battle against Russia\u2019s \u201cescalation\u201d of its invasion, his office said. Emmanuel Macron condemned Russia\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate\u201d strikes against Ukraine\u2019s cities and power infrastructure in a phone call with Zelenskyy on Friday, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said. France has said Ukraine\u2019s use of French missiles remains \u201can option\u201d. Russia launched more than 100 drones at Ukraine overnight on Thursday and early on Friday, killing one person and injuring eight others, officials said. A drone attack killed a woman in the southern city of Kherson, said the head of the local military administration, Roman Mrochko. A drone attack on the southern region of Odesa damaged 13 residential buildings and injured seven people, the national police said. Fragments from downed Russian drones struck buildings in two Kyiv districts and injured one person, officials said. At least two Ukrainian regions suffered power cuts on Friday, electricity operator Ukrenergo said. Local media reported 70% of customers in Mykolaiv and the surrounding region had been without electricity for a second day as a result of Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Moscow said on Friday its forces had seized the village of Rozdolne in the southern part of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, where it has made a string of territorial gains in recent months. Russia downed 47 attack drones fired by Ukraine overnight to Friday, mainly targeting the Rostov border region, where a major fire broke out at an industrial site, authorities said. Ukraine\u2019s military said it struck the region\u2019s Atlas oil depot, causing a fire. Ukraine also struck a radar station for a Russian Buk air defence system in Ukraine\u2019s southern Zaporizhzhia region, the military said. Russia has sentenced Alexei Gorinov, the first person to be convicted for speaking out against Moscow\u2019s military offensive in Ukraine, to another three years in prison in a second trial. The 63-year-old is already serving a seven-year sentence after a conviction in 2022. He wore a paper badge with a peace sign drawn on it as a court in Vladimir, east of Moscow, handed him the new sentence on charges of \u201cjustifying terrorism\u201d on Friday, the Medizazona website reported. Russian authorities returned more than 500 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat, with most having died in the eastern Donetsk region, Ukraine said on Friday. Russia, for its part, does not announce the return of its bodies.",

      "bodyText": "The Harry Potter actor Rupert Grint has been ordered to pay \u00a31.8m in taxes after a legal dispute with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Grint, best known for playing Ron Weasley in the film franchise, was told to pay the figure in 2019 when HMRC questioned one of his tax returns. HMRC disputed \u00a34.5m in income he received during the 2011-12 tax year, claiming it should have been taxed as regular income rather than as a capital asset. The 36-year-old actor, who was the sole shareholder of a company managing his business affairs, claimed the payment was related to residual income and bonuses from the Potter films. Grint\u2019s lawyers argued he should only have to pay capital gains tax, which would have been at a rate of 10%. However, HMRC said the money should be taxed as income, subject to a higher tax rate of 52%. Judge Harriet Morgan ruled in favour of HMRC, dismissing Grint\u2019s appeal, and said the money \u201cderived substantially the whole of its value from the activities of Mr Grint\u201d, which was \u201cotherwise realised\u201d as income. It is not the first time the actor\u2019s tax affairs have been subject to court proceedings. Grint also lost a separate court case in 2016 involving a \u00a31m tax refund. A tax tribunal judge rejected the actor\u2019s appeal against an HMRC block on him using a change in accounting dates to shield his earnings from the higher 50% tax rate. The actor was calculated to have earned about \u00a324m from the Potter franchise. Judge Barbara Mosedale described how Grint had followed advice from tax advisers Clay &amp; Associates to change his accounting date so that 20 months of income would be taxed in 2009-10. The judge said Grint wished to bring forward to the earlier year liability for payments on eight months\u2019 worth of income otherwise due in the tax year 2010-11 \u2013 the year the top rate of tax rose from 40% to 50%. Mosedale said if the date change had been accepted it would have led to a 10% saving on income \u2013 about \u00a31m, according to Grint\u2019s accountants. Grint appeared in all eight of the Harry Potter films between 2001 and 2011, and has since appeared in the films Into the White and Knock at the Cabin, as well as working in TV and theatre.

After early stage roles including <em>The History Boys</em> at the National Theatre, he was cast in E4\u2019s <em>Misfits</em> and Channel 4\u2019s <em>Utopia</em>. He starred in the 2017 National Theatre production of Tony Kushner\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/07/angels-in-america-review-nathan-lane-andrew-garfield-denise-gough\">Angels in America</a></em>, as well as its Broadway transfer. He has appeared in films <em>Dom Hemingway</em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/25/candyman-review-nia-dacosta-jordan-peele-horror\">Candyman</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/03/femme-review-unbearably-tense-queer-london-revenge-thriller\">Femme</a></em>, for which he and George MacKay won a 2023 Bifa award for best joint lead performance. His TV roles include <em>Doctor Who</em> and <em>The Trial of Christine Keeler</em>. He stars in the second season of the heist thriller <em>Culprits</em>, on ITVX from 19 December. </p> <h2><strong>1. </strong><strong>Film</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/sep/16/10\">The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</a> (dir</strong><strong> Jacques Demy, 1964)</strong></p>    <p>When I first saw this, not long ago, it kind of broke me. I thought it was the most amazing, colourful thing in the world \u2013 it is a classic for a reason. It\u2019s about two young people who fall in love: Catherine Deneuve works at an umbrella store, and Nino Castelnuovo is a mechanic. Then he goes off to war, and he doesn\u2019t die, but something bad happens. It\u2019s the most heartbreaking story for Christmas, but doesn\u2019t everyone love a bit of a Christmas cry?</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>Art</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/mike-kelley-ghost-and-spirit?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=CAMP_mike_kelley&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgJa6BhCOARIsAMiL7V-Rzdcp5odNqigs-pwawWrTJjIKwrj1RFU0ys2GJTHvgjzCvk8iYAEaAuPmEALw_wcB\">Mike Kelley: Ghost and Spirit, Tate Modern, until 9 March</a></strong></p>    <p>I didn\u2019t really know anything about the artist but I thought this exhibition was really exciting \u2013 very political, very rebellious. He did a lot of performance art in New York, these crazy installations, but also monkeys with big butts and genitalia-like fruit. He had this idea that adolescence is like a poltergeist taking over your body, which I thought was a cool conceit. I liked the sense of humour and his grungy take on things, the way he stuck it to the man: it made me think that maybe now art and commerce are too closely aligned.</p>    <h2><strong>3. </strong><strong>Book</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-racket-9781844886401/\">The Racket by Conor Niland</a></strong></p> <p>I\u2019m obsessed with tennis. [Former player] Conor Niland has written a book about the highs and lows of failure \u2013 I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s a failure, but I think it is somewhat a study in failure. He got to 129th in the world, but he wanted to be the best Irish player in the Open era, and he was. I thought it was really interesting to write a book about missing the moment, not being the person you know you can be, and sometimes just having a string of bad luck. I\u2019m an actor, so this was overly familiar at points.</p> <h2><strong>4. </strong><strong>TV</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81222923\">The Empress</a></strong><strong> (Netflix)</strong></p>    <p>There were these [1950s] movies with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/sep/29/romy.schneider\">Romy Schneider</a>, the Sissi series, about Elisabeth, the Empress of Austria. This is a Netflix series about her young days and I\u2019m really looking forward to watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KMmZc49lXE\">the new season</a>. It\u2019s a German-language period drama about her life in the palace; the Emperor\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t approve of her, so there\u2019s a power struggle, but eventually the country falls in love with her. It looks amazing and it\u2019s got this Visconti-esque thing going on that I really like.</p> <h2><strong>5. </strong><strong>Restaurant</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.strakers.london/\">Straker\u2019s, London W10</a></strong></p>    <p>I love this restaurant. They\u2019ve got two little tables in the windows, and it\u2019s perfect for a little chat or gossip. It just feels wholly intimate. It\u2019s modern Italian cuisine \u2013 I had the flatbread with chilli and mussel butter, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had before. At one point, the sommelier sat down and had a drink with us. It\u2019s everything one would want in a restaurant: very relaxed, the food is spectacular, great drinks and great staff. It makes me want to live on Golborne Road.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Born in London in 1987, the actor Nathan Stewart-Jarrett studied at the Brit school and the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. After early stage roles including The History Boys at the National Theatre, he was cast in E4\u2019s Misfits and Channel 4\u2019s Utopia. He starred in the 2017 National Theatre production of Tony Kushner\u2019s Angels in America, as well as its Broadway transfer. He has appeared in films Dom Hemingway, Candyman, and Femme, for which he and George MacKay won a 2023 Bifa award for best joint lead performance. His TV roles include Doctor Who and The Trial of Christine Keeler. He stars in the second season of the heist thriller Culprits, on ITVX from 19 December. 1. Film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (dir Jacques Demy, 1964) When I first saw this, not long ago, it kind of broke me. I thought it was the most amazing, colourful thing in the world \u2013 it is a classic for a reason. It\u2019s about two young people who fall in love: Catherine Deneuve works at an umbrella store, and Nino Castelnuovo is a mechanic. Then he goes off to war, and he doesn\u2019t die, but something bad happens. It\u2019s the most heartbreaking story for Christmas, but doesn\u2019t everyone love a bit of a Christmas cry? 2. Art Mike Kelley: Ghost and Spirit, Tate Modern, until 9 March I didn\u2019t really know anything about the artist but I thought this exhibition was really exciting \u2013 very political, very rebellious. He did a lot of performance art in New York, these crazy installations, but also monkeys with big butts and genitalia-like fruit. He had this idea that adolescence is like a poltergeist taking over your body, which I thought was a cool conceit. I liked the sense of humour and his grungy take on things, the way he stuck it to the man: it made me think that maybe now art and commerce are too closely aligned. 3. Book The Racket by Conor Niland I\u2019m obsessed with tennis. [Former player] Conor Niland has written a book about the highs and lows of failure \u2013 I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s a failure, but I think it is somewhat a study in failure. He got to 129th in the world, but he wanted to be the best Irish player in the Open era, and he was. I thought it was really interesting to write a book about missing the moment, not being the person you know you can be, and sometimes just having a string of bad luck. I\u2019m an actor, so this was overly familiar at points. 4. TV The Empress (Netflix) There were these [1950s] movies with Romy Schneider, the Sissi series, about Elisabeth, the Empress of Austria. This is a Netflix series about her young days and I\u2019m really looking forward to watching the new season. It\u2019s a German-language period drama about her life in the palace; the Emperor\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t approve of her, so there\u2019s a power struggle, but eventually the country falls in love with her. It looks amazing and it\u2019s got this Visconti-esque thing going on that I really like. 5. Restaurant Straker\u2019s, London W10 I love this restaurant. They\u2019ve got two little tables in the windows, and it\u2019s perfect for a little chat or gossip. It just feels wholly intimate. It\u2019s modern Italian cuisine \u2013 I had the flatbread with chilli and mussel butter, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had before. At one point, the sommelier sat down and had a drink with us. It\u2019s everything one would want in a restaurant: very relaxed, the food is spectacular, great drinks and great staff. It makes me want to live on Golborne Road.",

      "body": "<p>Mumbai is more than a city. It\u2019s an ever-expanding universe. Night shots of the thronged streets in this exquisite, Cannes prize-winning drama by Mumbai-born documentary director turned fiction film-maker Payal Kapadia show the skyline as a shimmering constellation of lights. And behind each flickering window, inside every snaking commuter train, there is a whole world with its own myriad of stories.

On one recent afternoon, there were 60 bikes on the junction, some discarded on the footpath and others blocking tactile paving stones to alert visually impaired people that they are about to cross the road. E-bikes were also parked randomly on nearby roads including Herbert Crescent and Pavilion Road, where it was impossible to pass without going on to the road. One resident said that \u201cat the worst of times, you would be fortunate just to be able to walk up here. It is absolutely outrageous. [The operators] should be fined.\u201d Matt Kaczmarczyk, a cyclist who works in the area, took matters into his own hands by moving the e-bikes out of the way so people could pass and he could park his own bike. \u201cI see this more and more. It is getting worse and worse,\u201d he said. The experiences of the well-heeled Kensington residents is one mirrored in many other areas of the capital. Brent council threatened to remove e-bikes from the borough because of abandonment and poor parking until Lime reduced the number on the streets and promised to remove errant cycles within two hours of reporting. Other new transport systems have faced similar difficulties. In the summer Melbourne banned rental e-scooters, as did Paris last year. Italy last month passed a law requiring all e-scooter riders to wear helmets and be insured. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council put bays in place in Kensington to tackle the problem of discarded cycles and said it had not seen e-bike operators implementing charges on users who leave the bikes outside designated parking areas. After the TfL enforcement announced last week, the council is taking advice on \u201capplying the law in a similar way\u201d, according to a statement. \u201cWe remain supportive of the principle of e-bikes, but not at the expense of disabled and vulnerable people getting around the city and our narrow pavements,\u201d said Cllr Cem Kemahli. A spokesperson for Lime said one of the biggest issues facing the e-bike industry is overcrowded parking bays and called for more parking locations to be designated by the council. \u201cWe are working to address this issue in Kensington by enforcing mandatory parking, improving our response time to any issues raised and bolstering our Lime parking patrol, a dedicated team who tidy mis-parked bikes and overcrowded bays,\u201d they said. Forest also called for more parking spaces and apologised for the congestion. \u201cUsers who misuse Forest e-bikes or leave them outside of bays are warned, fined and ultimately can be banned from accessing the service,\u201d a statement said.",

      "body": "<p>Marietje Schaake is a former Dutch member of the European parliament. She is now the international policy director at Stanford University Cyber Policy Center and international policy fellow at Stanford\u2019s <a href=\"https://online.stanford.edu/schools-centers/stanford-institute-human-centered-artificial-intelligence-hai\">Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence</a>. Her new book is entitled <em>The Tech Coup: How to Save Democracy from Silicon Valley</em>.</p> <p><strong>In terms of power and political influence, what are the main differences between big tech and previous incarnations of big business?<br></strong>The difference is the role that these tech companies play in so many aspects of people\u2019s lives: in the state, the economy, geopolitics. So while previous monopolists amassed a lot of capital and significant positions, they were usually in one sector, like oil or car production. These tech companies are like octopuses with tentacles in so many different directions. They have so much data, location data, search, communications, critical infrastructure, and now AI can be built on top of all that assembled power, which makes these companies very different animals to what we\u2019ve seen in the past.</p> <p><strong>Peter Kyle, the UK\u2019s technology secretary</strong><strong>, recently suggest</strong><strong>ed that governments need to show a </strong><strong>\u201csense of humility\u201d</strong><strong> with big tech companies and <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/britain-must-treat-tech-giants-like-nation-states-minister-warns-ktmm5vmc9\">treat them more like nation states</a></strong><strong>. What are your thoughts on that?</strong><strong> <br></strong>I think it\u2019s a baffling misunderstanding of the role of a democratically elected and accountable leader. Yes, these companies have become incredibly powerful, and as such I understand the comparison to the role of states, because increasingly these companies take decisions that used to be the exclusive domain of the state. But the answer, particularly from a government that is progressively leaning, should be to strengthen the primacy of democratic governance and oversight, and not to show humility. What is needed is self-confidence on the part of democratic government to make sure that these companies, these services, are taking their proper role within a rule of law-based system, and are not overtaking it.</p> <p><strong>What do you think the impact will be of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency? <br></strong>The election of Donald Trump changes everything because he has brought specific tech interests closer than any political leader ever has, especially in the United States, which is this powerful geopolitical and technological hub. There\u2019s a lot of crypto money supporting Trump. There\u2019s a lot of VCs [venture capitalists] supporting him, and of course he has elevated Elon Musk and has announced a deregulatory agenda. Every step taken by his administration will be informed by these factors, whether it\u2019s the personal interests of Elon Musk and his companies, or the personal preferences of the president and his supporters. On the other hand, Musk is actually critical of some dynamics around AI, namely existential risk. We\u2019ll have to see how long the honeymoon between him and Trump lasts, and also how other big tech companies are going to respond. Because they\u2019re not going to be happy that Musk decides on tech policy over his competitors. I\u2019m thinking rocky times ahead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s important to understand that the way we are taught to think about technology is shaped by the tech companies themselves </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Why have politicians been so light touch in the face of the digital technological revolution? <br></strong>The most powerful companies we see now were all rooted in this sort of progressive, libertarian streak of counterculture in California, that romantic narrative of a couple of guys in their shorts in a basement or garage, coding away and challenging the big powers that be: the publishers of the media companies, the hotel branches, the taxi companies, the financial services, all of which had pretty bad reputations to begin with. And surely there was room for disruption, but this kind of underdog mentality was incredibly powerful. The companies have done a really smart job of framing what they are doing as decentralising, like the internet itself. Companies like Google and Facebook have consistently argued that any regulatory step would hurt the internet. So it\u2019s a combination of wanting to believe the promise and not appreciating how very narrow corporate interests won out at the expense of the public interest.</p> <p><strong>Do you see any major politicians who are prepared to stand up to big tech interests? <br></strong>Well someone like [US senator] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a> has the most clear vision about the excessive power and abuse of power by corporations, including the tech sector. She\u2019s been consistent in trying to address this. But broadly I\u2019m afraid that political leaders are not really taking this on the way they should. In the European Commission, I\u2019m not really seeing a vision. I\u2019ve seen elections, including in my own country, where tech didn\u2019t feature as a topic at all. And we see those comments by the UK government, although one would assume that democratic guardrails around excessively powerful corporates are a no-brainer.</p> <p><strong>Have politicians been held back by their technological ignorance? <br></strong>Yes, I think they are intimidated. But I also think that the framing against the agency of governments is a deliberate one by tech companies. It\u2019s important to understand the way in which we are taught to think about technology is shaped by the tech companies themselves. And so we get the whole narrative that governments are basically disqualified to deal with tech because they\u2019re too stupid, too outdated, too poor in service delivery. The message is that if they can\u2019t even process the taxes on time, what do you think they\u2019re going to do with AI? It\u2019s a caricature of government, and government should not embrace that caricature.</p> <p><strong>Do you think the UK has been weakened in its position with big tech as a result of leaving the EU? <br></strong>Yes and no. Australia and Canada have developed tech policies, and they\u2019re smaller in numbers than the UK population. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that. I think it\u2019s actually much more of a deliberate choice to want to attract investment. So maybe it\u2019s just self-interest that transcends Conservative and Labour governments, because I don\u2019t see much change in the tech policy, whereas I had anticipated change. I was obviously overly optimistic there.</p> <p><strong>You talk about regaining sovereignty. Do you think most people even recogni</strong><strong>se that any sovereignty has been lost? <br></strong>One of the reasons why I wrote this book is to reach average news readers, not tech experts. Explaining that this is a problem that concerns people is a huge undertaking. I\u2019m curious to see how the impact of the Trump government will invite responses from European leaders, but also from others around the world who are simply going to think we cannot afford this dependence on US tech companies. It\u2019s undesirable. Because, essentially, we\u2019re shipping our euros or pounds over to Silicon Valley, and what do we get in return? More dependency. It\u2019s going to be incredibly challenging, but not doing anything is certainly not going to make it better.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Tech Coup </em>by Marietje Schaake is published by Princeton University Press (\u00a322).

The most powerful companies we see now were all rooted in this sort of progressive, libertarian streak of counterculture in California, that romantic narrative of a couple of guys in their shorts in a basement or garage, coding away and challenging the big powers that be: the publishers of the media companies, the hotel branches, the taxi companies, the financial services, all of which had pretty bad reputations to begin with. And surely there was room for disruption, but this kind of underdog mentality was incredibly powerful. The companies have done a really smart job of framing what they are doing as decentralising, like the internet itself. Companies like Google and Facebook have consistently argued that any regulatory step would hurt the internet. So it\u2019s a combination of wanting to believe the promise and not appreciating how very narrow corporate interests won out at the expense of the public interest. Do you see any major politicians who are prepared to stand up to big tech interests? Well someone like [US senator] Elizabeth Warren has the most clear vision about the excessive power and abuse of power by corporations, including the tech sector. She\u2019s been consistent in trying to address this. But broadly I\u2019m afraid that political leaders are not really taking this on the way they should. In the European Commission, I\u2019m not really seeing a vision. I\u2019ve seen elections, including in my own country, where tech didn\u2019t feature as a topic at all. And we see those comments by the UK government, although one would assume that democratic guardrails around excessively powerful corporates are a no-brainer. Have politicians been held back by their technological ignorance? Yes, I think they are intimidated. But I also think that the framing against the agency of governments is a deliberate one by tech companies. It\u2019s important to understand the way in which we are taught to think about technology is shaped by the tech companies themselves. And so we get the whole narrative that governments are basically disqualified to deal with tech because they\u2019re too stupid, too outdated, too poor in service delivery. The message is that if they can\u2019t even process the taxes on time, what do you think they\u2019re going to do with AI? It\u2019s a caricature of government, and government should not embrace that caricature. Do you think the UK has been weakened in its position with big tech as a result of leaving the EU? Yes and no. Australia and Canada have developed tech policies, and they\u2019re smaller in numbers than the UK population. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that. I think it\u2019s actually much more of a deliberate choice to want to attract investment. So maybe it\u2019s just self-interest that transcends Conservative and Labour governments, because I don\u2019t see much change in the tech policy, whereas I had anticipated change. I was obviously overly optimistic there. You talk about regaining sovereignty. Do you think most people even recognise that any sovereignty has been lost? One of the reasons why I wrote this book is to reach average news readers, not tech experts. Explaining that this is a problem that concerns people is a huge undertaking. I\u2019m curious to see how the impact of the Trump government will invite responses from European leaders, but also from others around the world who are simply going to think we cannot afford this dependence on US tech companies. It\u2019s undesirable. Because, essentially, we\u2019re shipping our euros or pounds over to Silicon Valley, and what do we get in return? More dependency. It\u2019s going to be incredibly challenging, but not doing anything is certainly not going to make it better. The Tech Coup by Marietje Schaake is published by Princeton University Press (\u00a322).

Musk has basically been camping out at Mar-a-Lago since the election, and has earned \u201cuncle status\u201d according to <a href=\"https://x.com/kaitrump/status/1855734110062272874\">Trump\u2019s granddaughter Kai</a>.</p> <p>The tech billionaire also had a seat at the Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/29/politics/musk-trump-thanksgiving-mar-a-lago/index.html\">family table for Thanksgiving dinner</a>, where he <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1862331915337945516\">bopped to YMCA</a> and presumably had a little giggle over a <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1862281187600793830\">bizarre AI-generated video</a> Trump tweeted which showed Donald popping out of a turkey Joe Biden was about to carve and gyrating.

In the original painting, the matriarch is holding up a turkey. In Vance\u2019s version he \u2013 clad in an apron and blue dress \u2013 is holding up a very red map of America.

      "body": "<p>A long-awaited Fifa report into the legacy of the Qatar World Cup has been published, but only after its key recommendation was rejected by the organisation.</p> <p>Fifa\u2019s subcommittee on human rights and social responsibility has found that the game\u2019s world body \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to provide financial remedy to workers who suffered loss as a result of employment at the 2022 World Cup. Its report argues that Fifa should use its Qatar legacy fund for those workers. Two days before the report was published, however, Fifa announced that the $50m fund would be used on international development projects instead.</p> <p>The subcommittee was commissioned in March last year to examine Fifa\u2019s obligations arising from the tournament and its impact on those workers who experienced harm. The report was submitted last December but it is understood that internal resistance meant it only came out 11 months later, at midnight central European time on Friday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/fifa-saudi-arabia-2034-world-cup-football-evaluation-report\">Fifa issues glowing Saudi 2034 World Cup report despite human rights fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report contains an independent assessment by the human rights consultancy Human Level. It acknowledges a number of measures Fifa undertook with Qatari authorities to improve conditions, but \u201ca number of severe human rights impacts did ultimately occur in Qatar from 2010 through 2022 for a number of workers connected to the 2022 World Cup\u201d and that \u201ca credible argument can be made that Fifa contributed to some of the impacts\u201d.</p> <p>Publication was welcomed by Lise Klaveness, president of the Norwegian football federation, whose submission to the Fifa congress in 2023 initiated the report. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that it\u2019s been published,\u201d she said. \u201cI really want to celebrate that, even though it\u2019s been a year of work to get it out. I want to congratulate Michael Llamas who leads this committee and also Dominique Blanc of the Swiss federation who led Uefa\u2019s work on this.\u201d</p> <p>Fifa is signed up to the United Nations\u2019 guiding principles on business and human rights, which holds companies responsible for the impact of their work, while its article 6 says: \u201cFifa is committed to providing for or cooperating in remediation where it has caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts.\u201d Klaveness said the subcommittee\u2019s report will lead to a better understanding of those human rights obligations.</p> <p>\u201cIt sets out some framework of what is Fifa responsible for and what it is not. This is very important,\u201d she said. \u201cIt actually does the analysis of the categorisations of workers and areas where Fifa has responsibility. It also says something about why Fifa is responsible and it attaches it to article 6.

      "bodyText": "A long-awaited Fifa report into the legacy of the Qatar World Cup has been published, but only after its key recommendation was rejected by the organisation. Fifa\u2019s subcommittee on human rights and social responsibility has found that the game\u2019s world body \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to provide financial remedy to workers who suffered loss as a result of employment at the 2022 World Cup. Its report argues that Fifa should use its Qatar legacy fund for those workers. Two days before the report was published, however, Fifa announced that the $50m fund would be used on international development projects instead. The subcommittee was commissioned in March last year to examine Fifa\u2019s obligations arising from the tournament and its impact on those workers who experienced harm. The report was submitted last December but it is understood that internal resistance meant it only came out 11 months later, at midnight central European time on Friday. The report contains an independent assessment by the human rights consultancy Human Level. It acknowledges a number of measures Fifa undertook with Qatari authorities to improve conditions, but \u201ca number of severe human rights impacts did ultimately occur in Qatar from 2010 through 2022 for a number of workers connected to the 2022 World Cup\u201d and that \u201ca credible argument can be made that Fifa contributed to some of the impacts\u201d. Publication was welcomed by Lise Klaveness, president of the Norwegian football federation, whose submission to the Fifa congress in 2023 initiated the report. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that it\u2019s been published,\u201d she said. \u201cI really want to celebrate that, even though it\u2019s been a year of work to get it out. I want to congratulate Michael Llamas who leads this committee and also Dominique Blanc of the Swiss federation who led Uefa\u2019s work on this.\u201d Fifa is signed up to the United Nations\u2019 guiding principles on business and human rights, which holds companies responsible for the impact of their work, while its article 6 says: \u201cFifa is committed to providing for or cooperating in remediation where it has caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts.\u201d Klaveness said the subcommittee\u2019s report will lead to a better understanding of those human rights obligations. \u201cIt sets out some framework of what is Fifa responsible for and what it is not. This is very important,\u201d she said. \u201cIt actually does the analysis of the categorisations of workers and areas where Fifa has responsibility. It also says something about why Fifa is responsible and it attaches it to article 6. It\u2019s important that these responsibilities are not just [the result of] political pressure or media pressure, it\u2019s actually within the statutes of Fifa and need implementation. These frameworks can now be used if we all fight for it and work for it in the future.\u201d The $50m fund is to be spent with the World Health Organisation, World Trade Organisation and the UN refugee agency the UNHCR. This, Klaveness said, was \u201cvery positive, but it is in no way a substitute for the remedy that is pointed out in this report. It\u2019s not necessarily important how the funds are delivered but that they are done so in timely, effective and meaningful fashion.\u201d A Fifa spokesperson said: \u201cAll reports and recommendations were considered during a comprehensive review by the Fifa administration and relevant bodies.

The best-of-14-games match is scheduled to take place from 23 November to 15 December at Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore for an overall prize fund of $2.5m (\u00a31.98m).</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ding became China's first men\u2019s world chess champion by defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi last year in Kazakhstan, winning the title vacated by longtime world No 1 Magnus Carlsen of Norway. But the 32-year-old from Zhejiang province has played only 44 classical games in the 19 months since winning the world title while battling personal difficulties including depression and will go off as an underdog in his first world title defense.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Gukesh, commonly known as Gukesh D, stunned the chess establishment by winning the eight-man Candidates tournament in Toronto aged 17 to become the youngest ever challenger for the world championship, finishing top of a stacked field that included Nepomniachtchi, Hikaru Nakamura and Fabiano Caruana. The 18-year-old can shatter the record for youngest ever world champion held by Garry Kasparov, who was 22 when he dethroned Karpov in their 1985 rematch in Moscow.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The format</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The match will consist of 14 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches seven and a half points first will be declared the champion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The time control for each game in the classical portion is 120 minutes per side for the first 40 moves, then 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move starting with move 41.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the score is equal after 14 games, tiebreak games with faster time controls will be played:</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;A match consisting of four rapid games with 15 minutes per side and a 10-second increment starting with move 1 would be played. If a player scores 2\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is still equal, a mini-match of two rapid games would be played, with 10 minutes per side and a five-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is equal after the rapid portion, a mini-match of two blitz games would be played, with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship. A drawing of lots would take place before each mini-match to decide which player plays with the white pieces.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the blitz mini-match are tied, a single blitz game with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1 would be played, and the winner would win the championship. A drawing of lots would decide which player plays with the white pieces. If this game was drawn, another blitz game with reversed colors would be played with the same time control, and the winner would win the championship. This process is repeated until either player wins a game.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Players are not allowed to agree to a draw before black's 40th move.

      "body": "<p>On 9 November 2021, a call was made to MI5\u2019s public hotline for reporting national security concerns. The man did not give his name but identified himself as a soldier in the British army \u2013 and the concern he was reporting was himself.</p> <p>The anonymous caller told the UK\u2019s domestic security service he had been in contact with Iran for more than two years but now wanted to help his country by becoming a double agent.</p> <p>After receiving no response, he rang the line again two weeks later to offer his services to the British intelligence agencies once more. MI5 made nine attempts to return his calls, which were from an unregistered mobile phone, but ultimately decided to refer the case to counter-terror police.</p> <p>Specialist investigators identified the caller as Daniel Abed Khalife, a then 20-year-old soldier based at Beacon Barracks in Staffordshire.</p> <p>Last week, Khalife, now 23, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/28/former-soldier-daniel-khalife-found-guilty-of-spying-for-iran\">found guilty of passing on information to Iran</a>, contrary to the Official Secrets Act 1911, and also of eliciting information that could be useful to a terrorist, in contravention of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p> <p>The case has highlighted vulnerabilities in the systems for vetting members of the British armed forces and detecting potential \u201cinsider threats\u201d, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/12/british-army-solider-recruited-far-right-group-national-action\">previous infiltration by the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action</a> and the 2008 conviction of another soldier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/afghanistan-iran\">who offered his services to Iran</a>.</p>    <p>Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan police\u2019s counter-terrorism command, said last week: \u201cEveryone is much more alive to the threat posed by insiders after Daniel Khalife, particularly in the Ministry of Defence [MoD]. Insider threats remain a really significant challenge for us all.\u201d</p> <p>On paper, Khalife was exemplary. After joining the army at 16, weeks after getting 10 GCSEs at his south-west London school, he became a signaller and was given the award for best junior soldier in his squadron in 2020. He received praise from both superiors and fellow soldiers, who mocked up an image of Khalife holding a falcon, in reference to his mastery of the Falcon military communications system.</p> <p>In September 2021, Khalife was promoted to lance corporal and even expressed an interest in joining the special forces, before an officer advised him he was unlikely to pass vetting \u201cbecause of where his parents were from\u201d \u2013 Iran and Lebanon.</p> <p>But the concerns only appeared to be about perception. Nobody Khalife served with is known to have flagged any concerns about his behaviour, and counter-terror police admitted that it was only the soldier\u2019s own calls to MI5 that raised the alarm.</p> <p>Murphy said: \u201cThat was the start of our investigation. That\u2019s not to say that he wouldn\u2019t have come to our attention by other means, but as it stands at the moment, his calls to MI5, his second call particularly, are what started this off.\u201d</p> <p>When police moved in to arrest Khalife on 6 January 2022, electronic devices and documents seized from his barracks revealed that he had been spying for Tehran for more than two and a half years. Since the age of just 17, he had been passing on information, including a list of special forces soldiers, details of military computer systems and classified documents concerning drones and surveillance.</p>    <p>In August 2020, Khalife flew to Istanbul in what his Iranian handlers appear to have planned as part of a journey to Tehran. He told one of his contacts he \u201cdelivered a package\u201d, but it is unclear whether he made in-person contact with Iranian agents.</p> <p>In messages to a handler, saved on his phone as \u201cDavid Smith\u201d, Khalife wrote: \u201cI won\u2019t leave the military until you tell me to. 25+ years.\u201d The handler urged him to be careful, saying there was \u201cno rush about our mission\u2026 We can work together a lot of years.\u201d</p> <p>Khalife used a 2021 deployment to the Fort Hood US army base in Texas to take photos and screenshots of sensitive equipment, but British police were never able to confirm how much was passed on to Iran.</p> <p>Conversations with his Iranian handlers were conducted on the encrypted Telegram app \u2013 most of which were deleted \u2013 and Khalife also used the much older spycraft technique of dead drops to collect cash payments.

      "bodyText": "On 9 November 2021, a call was made to MI5\u2019s public hotline for reporting national security concerns. The man did not give his name but identified himself as a soldier in the British army \u2013 and the concern he was reporting was himself. The anonymous caller told the UK\u2019s domestic security service he had been in contact with Iran for more than two years but now wanted to help his country by becoming a double agent. After receiving no response, he rang the line again two weeks later to offer his services to the British intelligence agencies once more. MI5 made nine attempts to return his calls, which were from an unregistered mobile phone, but ultimately decided to refer the case to counter-terror police. Specialist investigators identified the caller as Daniel Abed Khalife, a then 20-year-old soldier based at Beacon Barracks in Staffordshire. Last week, Khalife, now 23, was found guilty of passing on information to Iran, contrary to the Official Secrets Act 1911, and also of eliciting information that could be useful to a terrorist, in contravention of the Terrorism Act 2000. The case has highlighted vulnerabilities in the systems for vetting members of the British armed forces and detecting potential \u201cinsider threats\u201d, after previous infiltration by the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action and the 2008 conviction of another soldier who offered his services to Iran. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan police\u2019s counter-terrorism command, said last week: \u201cEveryone is much more alive to the threat posed by insiders after Daniel Khalife, particularly in the Ministry of Defence [MoD]. Insider threats remain a really significant challenge for us all.\u201d On paper, Khalife was exemplary. After joining the army at 16, weeks after getting 10 GCSEs at his south-west London school, he became a signaller and was given the award for best junior soldier in his squadron in 2020. He received praise from both superiors and fellow soldiers, who mocked up an image of Khalife holding a falcon, in reference to his mastery of the Falcon military communications system. In September 2021, Khalife was promoted to lance corporal and even expressed an interest in joining the special forces, before an officer advised him he was unlikely to pass vetting \u201cbecause of where his parents were from\u201d \u2013 Iran and Lebanon. But the concerns only appeared to be about perception. Nobody Khalife served with is known to have flagged any concerns about his behaviour, and counter-terror police admitted that it was only the soldier\u2019s own calls to MI5 that raised the alarm. Murphy said: \u201cThat was the start of our investigation. That\u2019s not to say that he wouldn\u2019t have come to our attention by other means, but as it stands at the moment, his calls to MI5, his second call particularly, are what started this off.\u201d When police moved in to arrest Khalife on 6 January 2022, electronic devices and documents seized from his barracks revealed that he had been spying for Tehran for more than two and a half years. Since the age of just 17, he had been passing on information, including a list of special forces soldiers, details of military computer systems and classified documents concerning drones and surveillance. In August 2020, Khalife flew to Istanbul in what his Iranian handlers appear to have planned as part of a journey to Tehran. He told one of his contacts he \u201cdelivered a package\u201d, but it is unclear whether he made in-person contact with Iranian agents. In messages to a handler, saved on his phone as \u201cDavid Smith\u201d, Khalife wrote: \u201cI won\u2019t leave the military until you tell me to. 25+ years.\u201d The handler urged him to be careful, saying there was \u201cno rush about our mission\u2026 We can work together a lot of years.\u201d Khalife used a 2021 deployment to the Fort Hood US army base in Texas to take photos and screenshots of sensitive equipment, but British police were never able to confirm how much was passed on to Iran. Conversations with his Iranian handlers were conducted on the encrypted Telegram app \u2013 most of which were deleted \u2013 and Khalife also used the much older spycraft technique of dead drops to collect cash payments. At one point, he picked up \u00a31,500 left in a dog waste bag in a north London park, and \u00a31,000 was left under a flower pot at a cemetery. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of actually knowing everything that Daniel Khalife has passed on or recovered or got access to,\u201d Murphy admitted. \u201cWe\u2019ve got evidence of him collecting money but we don\u2019t know if anything was left.\u201d Police also remain in the dark about Khalife\u2019s true motivations. His defence at trial was that he aimed to be a double agent working for the good of the UK all along, and only initiated contact with Iranian agents in April 2019 to prove bosses wrong after being told his Iranian heritage could stop him being promoted. Khalife told jurors that the TV series Homeland, which follows an American soldier acting as a double agent for al-Qaida, was the inspiration for his elaborate plot and that he emailed MI6 to offer his services in August 2019 but received no response. Woolwich crown court heard that Khalife had faked some documents and edited others to make them seem more significant, including by changing \u201cofficial\u201d classifications to \u201csecret\u201d \u2013 or, as Khalife wrote, \u201csecert\u201d. But Murphy said he also passed on \u201cgenuine information\u201d and that even faked documents could cause \u201cadditional damage\u201d if the Iranians believed them to be real. \u201cThe problem is he\u2019s a Walter Mitty character who is having an extremely significant impact in the real world,\u201d he added. \u201cOnly he will know why he was doing this, and I do believe that there is some of this that fitted into his own fantasies, but he caused a substantial amount of damage.\u201d Khalife was released on bail after his arrest, but shortly before he was due to be charged in January 2023, he was reported as missing by the Army. He was found after three weeks on the run in a stolen van, which he had converted to live in and drove around the Staffordshire countryside while police scrambled to stop him leaving the UK or reaching the Iranian embassy. It would not be his last escape. In September 2023, while awaiting trial, Khalife escaped from Wandsworth prison by hiding under a food delivery lorry, sparking a huge national manhunt involving hundreds of police officers. After three days on the run, he was arrested by police as he was cycling along a canal towpath in London with a Waitrose bag containing a phone, receipts, a diary and about \u00a3200 in cash. He will be sentenced next year. Dr Jessica White, acting director of terrorism and conflict studies at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, who has researched infiltration by far-right groups in the British military, warned that there are \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in the system. \u201cThe vetting process is lacking in a lot of ways.

White added: \u201cKhalife was seen to be doing well \u2013 the system falls down where everything relies on a command structure to sense problems.\u201d A spokesperson for the MoD said that the vetting process for people wanting to join the military was \u201cstrict and robust\u201d and that potential threats arising from the information Khalife shared had been addressed. They added: \u201cWe constantly monitor threats and provide specialist advice and security training to our personnel so that they understand how to respond appropriately to security incidents and protect information.\u201d White warned that, with the growth of encrypted online communications and online disinformation operations by hostile states, the opportunities for people to be radicalised and recruited for espionage are growing.

      "body": "<p>As Sheikh Hasina watched Dhaka fade from view, aboard a military helicopter, crowds were storming her palatial residence.</p> <p>Far below, about 1,000 Bangladeshis lay dead and countless more injured, the toll of a brutal crackdown by her security forces on student-led protests, sometimes called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/07/bangladesh-gen-z-revolution-students-protest-change-sheikh-hasina-awami-dhaka\">Monsoon Revolution</a>. Hasina was soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/18/bangladesh-seek-extradition-ousted-leader-sheikh-hasina-india\">in India</a>, where she has remained in exile since August.</p> <p>Now, as Bangladesh rebuilds after her 16-year reign, attention has turned to reclaiming funds allegedly lost to corruption by members of her deposed regime and its allies \u2013 money the country\u2019s interim leaders say is badly needed for its reconstruction.</p> <p>Bangladeshi authorities believe a handful of powerful families and businesses linked to Hasina\u2019s Awami League party acquired billions of pounds by illicit means, including huge loans from state-owned banks that have never been repaid. These funds, investigators believe, may have been siphoned out of Bangladesh using the <em>hundi</em> system of money transfer popular in South Asia.</p> <p>The destination for some of that money has been, according to investigators and the new regime, a familiar home for illicit funds: the UK.</p> <p>Dhaka\u2019s interim government has enlisted help in tracking down about \u00a313bn of assets, following a global paper trail they believe leads to hiding places that include London property.</p> <p>Today, an investigation by the <em>Observer</em>, in partnership with campaign group Transparency International, reveals Bangladeshi power players accused of corruption have amassed a portfolio of British real estate worth almost \u00a3400m \u2013 and possibly much more.</p> <p>The network of about 350 properties ranges from modest flats to mansions in gated communities. Their owners include UK and offshore companies owned by some of Bangladesh\u2019s wealthiest and most influential businessmen, as well as two ex-ministers of the Hasina regime. The owners claim the allegations are politically motivated attacks by the new regime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/bangladesh-propertiesintheuk/giv-4559a6iwyH6UtAP4\" data-alt=\"Map showing Hasina allies\u2019 properties around Britain\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/bangladesh-propertiesintheuk/giv-4559a6iwyH6UtAP4\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The findings raise questions about rules governing a phalanx of British firms \u2013 including major banks, law firms and estate agents \u2013 that earned handsome fees for their services on multimillion-pound property transactions. They have prompted concern among MPs and campaigners about the progress of efforts to combat Britain\u2019s reputation as a magnet for dirty money \u2013 in particular whether rules on background checks and identifying sources of clients\u2019 funds are sufficiently robust.</p> <p>Now, Transparency International says, the UK faces the \u201cfirst test\u201d of its ambition to make London the anti-corruption capital of the world.</p> <h2><strong>The minister\u2019s land and the land minister</strong></h2> <p>Days after Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh, Salman F Rahman was arrested while also allegedly attempting to flee, this time by boat on Dhaka\u2019s network of waterways. Rahman was Hasina\u2019s adviser on private industry and investment. Many in Bangladesh saw him as the most influential figure in the regime.</p> <p>He now faces allegations of money-laundering by the Dhaka-based Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a specialist investigative unit. The Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU), part of the central bank, has frozen his bank accounts and those of family members.</p> <p>Rahman is the co-founder and vice chair of Beximco, one of Bangladesh\u2019s largest conglomerates, with sprawling interests in everything from garment manufacture to pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>Since the Awami League came to power, benefits that Beximco is reported to have enjoyed include the refinancing of vast loans from state-owned banks. It even held a national monopoly on distribution of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine to a nation of more than 170 million people.</p> <p>Now, however, its financial affairs \u2013 including around \u00a31bn of allegedly unpaid loans \u2013 are under investigation by the National Board of Revenue, the country\u2019s tax authority. Bangladesh\u2019s central bank has appointed a custodian to oversee its finances.</p>    <p>Beximco is a family affair. Both Rahman\u2019s son, Ahmed Shayan, and his nephew, Ahmed Shahryar, have held the position of chief executive officer or run key divisions, according to LinkedIn and company publications.</p> <p>The duo are under investigation by the CID, while Ahmed Shayan\u2019s assets in the country have been frozen.</p> <p>Authorities tracing that money have alighted on Grosvenor Square, in London\u2019s Mayfair district, among the largest and most prestigious of the capital\u2019s 18th-century garden plazas.</p> <p>Members of the Rahman family own \u2013 or hold stakes in \u2013 seven luxury apartments there, most via companies based in offshore jurisdictions. One, bought for \u00a326.75m in March 2022, is owned \u2013 via a British Virgin Islands company \u2013 by Ahmed Shayan Rahman. He also owns another flat in the square that cost \u00a335.5m.</p> <p>Offshore companies controlled by his cousin, Ahmed Sharyar, own a further four properties worth a combined \u00a323m, in the same square and nearby.</p> <p>Lawyers for Ahmed Shayan Rahman and Ahmed Shahryar Rahman said the properties had been acquired in full compliance with financial regulations, including money-laundering rules.</p> <p>They said the men had no information about Dhaka\u2019s investigation of Beximco and that police investigations into the pair appeared to relate to a civil dispute regarding export trade. They also indicated that the interim Dhaka government was focusing its corruption investigations on political opponents.</p> <p>The central bank governor, Ahsan Mansur, disputes this. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate legal process \u2026 against those who have taken resources from Bangladesh,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cWe want to get it back.\u201d</p> <p>Sources close to the interim government point to the fact that officials who make up the authorities investigating the country\u2019s lost assets are not simply enemies of the Awami League but come from a mixture of backgrounds, both in politics and civil society.</p> <p>But at least one other former Awami League figure, the former land minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury, is under scrutiny. His bank accounts have been frozen by the BFIU, while a court has ordered the seizure of immovable assets owned by him and family members. He is subject to a travel ban and Dhaka\u2019s Anti-Corruption Commission is investigating allegations that he illegally acquired hundreds of millions of dollars.</p> <p>Investigators want to know how he and his family acquired a vast UK property portfolio of more than 300 titles, acquired for at least \u00a3160m, according to the UK\u2019s Land Registry.</p>    <p>Reporters for Al Jazeera spotted Chowdhury outside one, a \u00a314m London mansion, last month, but he has not responded to requests for comment from the <em>Observer</em>, sent by email and letter. He has said that funds used to buy his overseas properties had come from legitimate businesses outside Bangladesh.</p> <h2><strong>Town, country and Dubai</strong></h2> <p>But it is not just former ministers who have amassed an impressive portfolio of British property. So, too, did some of the business figures who flourished under the Awami League\u2019s reign.</p> <p>With its tree-lined private roads and professional security guards, Wentworth \u2013 built around the golf course of the same name \u2013 is the perfect bolthole for a privacy-conscious multimillionaire. The prestigious Surrey estate is home to several members of the Sobhan family, headed by patriarch Ahmed Akbar, known as Shah Alam.</p> <p>Members of the family own two vast properties here, acquired for a combined \u00a313m and owned via companies registered in the British Virgin Islands, Golden Oak Venture Limited and Kaliakra Holdings Limited.</p> <p>A third, a French-style mansion, owned by one of Shah Alam\u2019s sons, appeared to be under construction when the <em>Observer </em>visited.</p> <p>The development itself is owned via an Isle of Man company called Cessnock Limited. A contractor working on the project emphasises its core value \u2013 \u201cdiscretion\u201d.</p> <p>The Sobhan family\u2019s wealth comes from the Bashundhara Group, a conglomerate with interests spanning real estate, shipping, media and sport. The family were first investigated over corruption allegations in 2008 but later cleared. The fall of the Hasina regime has triggered a fresh probe, including scrutiny of the alleged failure to repay state loans. </p> <p>On 21 October, a Dhaka court issued a travel ban against six members of the Sobhan family, including Shah Alam, while the BFIU has frozen their bank accounts.</p> <p>Dhaka authorities are believed to be scrutinising the family assets, including property, expected to be a focus for a new asset recovery taskforce. They believe, despite strict currency controls that prevent citizens from transferring more than $12,000 out of the country, billions have been diverted abroad, including through hubs such as Singapore and Dubai.</p> <p>Two family properties raise questions about the role of those financial centres as staging posts for money pouring into UK property. One \u00a310m mansion, on a gated estate in London\u2019s Kensington, is owned by Shah Alam\u2019s son and the vice chairman of Bashundhara Group, Safwan Sobhan, through a company called Austino Limited. Austino is registered in the British Virgin Islands but a Land Registry file documenting the purchase of the house directs correspondence to Atro International, a construction materials business based in Dubai.</p> <p>A similar arrangement relates to a \u00a35.6m Chelsea waterfront property owned by Safwan\u2019s brother, part of a portfolio amassed at a cost of \u00a328m. The apartment was purchased by Red Pine Trading, which is based in the British Virgin Islands but gives its address as a tower in Singapore.</p> <p>Safwan Sobhan, answering on behalf of himself and his brother, said the family \u201cstrongly refute all allegations of wrongdoing and will robustly defend ourselves against these allegations.</p> <p>\u201cWe consider the investigations to be legally weak and politically driven,\u201d he said, referring to a House of Commons research brief from September 2024, which <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-10096/CBP-10096.pdf\">referred to concerns</a> about targeting of Hasina\u2019s allies and associates.</p>    <p>He did not answer questions about the role of Dubai and Singapore in the ownership of UK properties via BVI-registered companies.</p> <p>Down the road from Safwan Sobhan\u2019s Kensington pad lie a clutch of properties owned by another tycoon who is feeling the Dhaka heat.</p> <p>Nazrul Mazumder, the founder and chairman of another Bangladeshi conglomerate, Nassa Group, is under investigation by the Dhaka CID for alleged money laundering, while his assets have been frozen by the BFIU.</p> <p>Bangladeshi authorities are expected to examine how Mazumder and his family members funded the acquisition of five luxury properties in Kensington, south-west London, bought for a combined \u00a338m.</p> <p>Local inquiries by the <em>Observer </em>indicate that most of the properties have been rented out, ensuring a steady income for Mazumder, as he faces charges in his home country.</p> <p>Sources close to Mazumder indicated that he rejected any suggestion that the properties were purchased with funds acquired illicitly and would contest allegations made against him in Bangladesh.</p> <h2><strong>The British connection</strong></h2> <p>In practice, the true scale of properties owned by Bangladeshi politicians and business figures could be much greater than that identified by the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>As of 2023, the UK publishes data on overseas entities that hold land titles. But ownership can be easily hidden by simply wrapping the property-owning company inside another offshore vehicle, like an anonymous trust.

      "bodyText": "As Sheikh Hasina watched Dhaka fade from view, aboard a military helicopter, crowds were storming her palatial residence. Far below, about 1,000 Bangladeshis lay dead and countless more injured, the toll of a brutal crackdown by her security forces on student-led protests, sometimes called the Monsoon Revolution. Hasina was soon in India, where she has remained in exile since August. Now, as Bangladesh rebuilds after her 16-year reign, attention has turned to reclaiming funds allegedly lost to corruption by members of her deposed regime and its allies \u2013 money the country\u2019s interim leaders say is badly needed for its reconstruction. Bangladeshi authorities believe a handful of powerful families and businesses linked to Hasina\u2019s Awami League party acquired billions of pounds by illicit means, including huge loans from state-owned banks that have never been repaid. These funds, investigators believe, may have been siphoned out of Bangladesh using the hundi system of money transfer popular in South Asia. The destination for some of that money has been, according to investigators and the new regime, a familiar home for illicit funds: the UK. Dhaka\u2019s interim government has enlisted help in tracking down about \u00a313bn of assets, following a global paper trail they believe leads to hiding places that include London property. Today, an investigation by the Observer, in partnership with campaign group Transparency International, reveals Bangladeshi power players accused of corruption have amassed a portfolio of British real estate worth almost \u00a3400m \u2013 and possibly much more. The network of about 350 properties ranges from modest flats to mansions in gated communities. Their owners include UK and offshore companies owned by some of Bangladesh\u2019s wealthiest and most influential businessmen, as well as two ex-ministers of the Hasina regime. The owners claim the allegations are politically motivated attacks by the new regime. The findings raise questions about rules governing a phalanx of British firms \u2013 including major banks, law firms and estate agents \u2013 that earned handsome fees for their services on multimillion-pound property transactions. They have prompted concern among MPs and campaigners about the progress of efforts to combat Britain\u2019s reputation as a magnet for dirty money \u2013 in particular whether rules on background checks and identifying sources of clients\u2019 funds are sufficiently robust. Now, Transparency International says, the UK faces the \u201cfirst test\u201d of its ambition to make London the anti-corruption capital of the world. The minister\u2019s land and the land minister Days after Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh, Salman F Rahman was arrested while also allegedly attempting to flee, this time by boat on Dhaka\u2019s network of waterways. Rahman was Hasina\u2019s adviser on private industry and investment. Many in Bangladesh saw him as the most influential figure in the regime. He now faces allegations of money-laundering by the Dhaka-based Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a specialist investigative unit. The Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU), part of the central bank, has frozen his bank accounts and those of family members. Rahman is the co-founder and vice chair of Beximco, one of Bangladesh\u2019s largest conglomerates, with sprawling interests in everything from garment manufacture to pharmaceuticals. Since the Awami League came to power, benefits that Beximco is reported to have enjoyed include the refinancing of vast loans from state-owned banks. It even held a national monopoly on distribution of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine to a nation of more than 170 million people. Now, however, its financial affairs \u2013 including around \u00a31bn of allegedly unpaid loans \u2013 are under investigation by the National Board of Revenue, the country\u2019s tax authority. Bangladesh\u2019s central bank has appointed a custodian to oversee its finances. Beximco is a family affair. Both Rahman\u2019s son, Ahmed Shayan, and his nephew, Ahmed Shahryar, have held the position of chief executive officer or run key divisions, according to LinkedIn and company publications. The duo are under investigation by the CID, while Ahmed Shayan\u2019s assets in the country have been frozen. Authorities tracing that money have alighted on Grosvenor Square, in London\u2019s Mayfair district, among the largest and most prestigious of the capital\u2019s 18th-century garden plazas. Members of the Rahman family own \u2013 or hold stakes in \u2013 seven luxury apartments there, most via companies based in offshore jurisdictions. One, bought for \u00a326.75m in March 2022, is owned \u2013 via a British Virgin Islands company \u2013 by Ahmed Shayan Rahman. He also owns another flat in the square that cost \u00a335.5m. Offshore companies controlled by his cousin, Ahmed Sharyar, own a further four properties worth a combined \u00a323m, in the same square and nearby. Lawyers for Ahmed Shayan Rahman and Ahmed Shahryar Rahman said the properties had been acquired in full compliance with financial regulations, including money-laundering rules. They said the men had no information about Dhaka\u2019s investigation of Beximco and that police investigations into the pair appeared to relate to a civil dispute regarding export trade. They also indicated that the interim Dhaka government was focusing its corruption investigations on political opponents. The central bank governor, Ahsan Mansur, disputes this. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate legal process \u2026 against those who have taken resources from Bangladesh,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cWe want to get it back.\u201d Sources close to the interim government point to the fact that officials who make up the authorities investigating the country\u2019s lost assets are not simply enemies of the Awami League but come from a mixture of backgrounds, both in politics and civil society. But at least one other former Awami League figure, the former land minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury, is under scrutiny. His bank accounts have been frozen by the BFIU, while a court has ordered the seizure of immovable assets owned by him and family members. He is subject to a travel ban and Dhaka\u2019s Anti-Corruption Commission is investigating allegations that he illegally acquired hundreds of millions of dollars. Investigators want to know how he and his family acquired a vast UK property portfolio of more than 300 titles, acquired for at least \u00a3160m, according to the UK\u2019s Land Registry. Reporters for Al Jazeera spotted Chowdhury outside one, a \u00a314m London mansion, last month, but he has not responded to requests for comment from the Observer, sent by email and letter. He has said that funds used to buy his overseas properties had come from legitimate businesses outside Bangladesh. Town, country and Dubai But it is not just former ministers who have amassed an impressive portfolio of British property. So, too, did some of the business figures who flourished under the Awami League\u2019s reign. With its tree-lined private roads and professional security guards, Wentworth \u2013 built around the golf course of the same name \u2013 is the perfect bolthole for a privacy-conscious multimillionaire. The prestigious Surrey estate is home to several members of the Sobhan family, headed by patriarch Ahmed Akbar, known as Shah Alam. Members of the family own two vast properties here, acquired for a combined \u00a313m and owned via companies registered in the British Virgin Islands, Golden Oak Venture Limited and Kaliakra Holdings Limited. A third, a French-style mansion, owned by one of Shah Alam\u2019s sons, appeared to be under construction when the Observer visited. The development itself is owned via an Isle of Man company called Cessnock Limited. A contractor working on the project emphasises its core value \u2013 \u201cdiscretion\u201d. The Sobhan family\u2019s wealth comes from the Bashundhara Group, a conglomerate with interests spanning real estate, shipping, media and sport. The family were first investigated over corruption allegations in 2008 but later cleared. The fall of the Hasina regime has triggered a fresh probe, including scrutiny of the alleged failure to repay state loans. On 21 October, a Dhaka court issued a travel ban against six members of the Sobhan family, including Shah Alam, while the BFIU has frozen their bank accounts. Dhaka authorities are believed to be scrutinising the family assets, including property, expected to be a focus for a new asset recovery taskforce. They believe, despite strict currency controls that prevent citizens from transferring more than $12,000 out of the country, billions have been diverted abroad, including through hubs such as Singapore and Dubai. Two family properties raise questions about the role of those financial centres as staging posts for money pouring into UK property. One \u00a310m mansion, on a gated estate in London\u2019s Kensington, is owned by Shah Alam\u2019s son and the vice chairman of Bashundhara Group, Safwan Sobhan, through a company called Austino Limited. Austino is registered in the British Virgin Islands but a Land Registry file documenting the purchase of the house directs correspondence to Atro International, a construction materials business based in Dubai. A similar arrangement relates to a \u00a35.6m Chelsea waterfront property owned by Safwan\u2019s brother, part of a portfolio amassed at a cost of \u00a328m. The apartment was purchased by Red Pine Trading, which is based in the British Virgin Islands but gives its address as a tower in Singapore. Safwan Sobhan, answering on behalf of himself and his brother, said the family \u201cstrongly refute all allegations of wrongdoing and will robustly defend ourselves against these allegations. \u201cWe consider the investigations to be legally weak and politically driven,\u201d he said, referring to a House of Commons research brief from September 2024, which referred to concerns about targeting of Hasina\u2019s allies and associates. He did not answer questions about the role of Dubai and Singapore in the ownership of UK properties via BVI-registered companies. Down the road from Safwan Sobhan\u2019s Kensington pad lie a clutch of properties owned by another tycoon who is feeling the Dhaka heat. Nazrul Mazumder, the founder and chairman of another Bangladeshi conglomerate, Nassa Group, is under investigation by the Dhaka CID for alleged money laundering, while his assets have been frozen by the BFIU. Bangladeshi authorities are expected to examine how Mazumder and his family members funded the acquisition of five luxury properties in Kensington, south-west London, bought for a combined \u00a338m. Local inquiries by the Observer indicate that most of the properties have been rented out, ensuring a steady income for Mazumder, as he faces charges in his home country. Sources close to Mazumder indicated that he rejected any suggestion that the properties were purchased with funds acquired illicitly and would contest allegations made against him in Bangladesh. The British connection In practice, the true scale of properties owned by Bangladeshi politicians and business figures could be much greater than that identified by the Observer. As of 2023, the UK publishes data on overseas entities that hold land titles. But ownership can be easily hidden by simply wrapping the property-owning company inside another offshore vehicle, like an anonymous trust. This loophole is just one concern shared by those who question the adequacy of the UK\u2019s transparency regime. Now, attention is now turning to the compliance rules governing City firms such as those involved in helping members and allies of the Hasina regime manage their property wealth. MPs on the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for anti-corruption want British regulators to look at whether the background checks that UK firms are required to do on property investors are sufficiently robust. Nazrul Mazumder and a company in which he is a shareholder have borrowed from the British branch of Swiss bank UBS and from Coutts, the private bank that also serves the royal family, to fund his family\u2019s Kensington properties. Salman F Rahman\u2019s son bought his \u00a326.75m Grosvenor Square pad using a mortgage provided by the UK branch of Credit Suisse, with the assistance of law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. Both he and his cousin, Ahmed Shahryar, bought properties with a mortgage from Barclays. Another London law firm, Jaswal Johnston, has frequently worked on property deals for Rahman family members. Members of the Sobhan family have benefited from the advice of Orbis London, the UK outpost of a real estate adviser with offices in Liechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland. Chowdhury\u2019s vast portfolio was acquired and managed with assistance from firms including the estate agent Moving City, law firm Charles Douglas and lender Market Financial Solutions. There are many more, too numerous to name. All are required to perform due diligence on their clients\u2019 source of wealth, including enhanced checks on \u201cpolitically exposed persons\u201d (PEPs) such as Chowdhury and Salman F Rahman, and their families. \u201cWe need stronger anti-money-laundering supervision and enforcement to analyse the source of the wealth flowing through London,\u201d said Joe Powell MP, the APPG\u2019s chair. \u201cI support all efforts by the Bangladesh authorities to trace assets they believe may have been improperly acquired.\u201d The minister most closely responsible for scrutinising and updating the rules that govern the UK\u2019s financial sector is the City minister, Tulip Siddiq. She also happens to be the niece of Sheikh Hasina. In 2022, it emerged that Siddiq\u2019s mother, Sheikh Rehana \u2013 the sister of Sheikh Hasina and one of the Awami League\u2019s most powerful figures \u2013 was living rent-free in a London property owned by Ahmed Shayan Rahman. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Siddiq, who is understood to have recused herself from any policymaking relating to Bangladesh. This month, members of the APPG wrote to a string of UK regulators and law enforcement bodies urging them to look into whether British firms who assisted Saifuzzaman Chowdhury had done sufficient due diligence. For their part, each firm said it had. The same MPs are calling on the British government to leave no stone unturned in helping Bangladesh recover funds needed to rebuild the country. Campaigners say this will be a crucial test of the appetite for strengthening London\u2019s ethical credentials.

      "body": "<p>The royal family is being deployed by the UK government to roll out the red carpet for the autocratic leaders of Gulf states, amid hopes of a trade deal with the oil-rich countries.</p> <p>This week will see <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/news-and-activity/2024-10-11/state-visit-by-the-amir-of-the-state-of-qatar\">King Charles welcome the emir of Qatar</a>, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and the first of his three wives, Sheikha Jawaher, to Buckingham Palace \u2013 the first state visit under the new Labour government. The visit comes amid a flurry of activity involving the royal family or government ministers with the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s six nations: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>Keir Starmer and the foreign secretary, David Lammy, are hoping to use the soft power of the British monarchy to help seal a free trade deal with the GCC. They hope the Gulf countries will boost their sovereign wealth fund investment in Britain and can also mediate in the Middle East conflict.</p> <p>Britain has a \u00a357bn annual trade with the GCC nations and is in the final stages of negotiating a free-trade agreement predicted to raise that figure by 16%. Starmer\u2019s government is also seeking similar free-trade deals with Switzerland, South Korea, and now India, which is likely to receive a state visit by the king and queen next year. But the GCC is understood to be the immediate priority.</p> <p>In the Gulf, the historic ties between the all-powerful monarchies and the House of Windsor can be very useful, according to experts in the region. Many of the Gulf\u2019s leaders are British-educated, share interests such as horse racing, and have a long history of investing in Britain.</p> <p>Starmer and Lammy have also established a close working relationship with King Charles. \u201cIt is always the case that as head of state, the king plays an important role,\u201d Lammy said last month in response to questions about whether the monarch\u2019s relationship with Donald Trump might help the government\u2019s dealings with the incoming US administration.</p>    <p>The sheikh was educated at Sherborne, Harrow and Sandhurst, and ultimately controls Paris Saint-Germain football club. The billionaire will receive a ceremonial welcome on Horse Guards Parade, a palace state banquet and a reception by MPs when he addresses parliament this week. His visit on 3 and 4 December follows a trip by King Hamad bin Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa of Bahrain to Windsor Castle last month, during which Charles, encouraged by government ministers in attendance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/13/exiles-ask-king-charles-to-rescind-honour-awarded-to-king-of-bahrain\">made him an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order</a> to mark his silver jubilee.</p> <p>Last week it was Oman\u2019s turn, when <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a63008864/prince-william-oman-crown-prince-appearance/\">Prince William joined the country\u2019s Crown Prince</a>, Theyazin bin Haitham, at the Royal Geographical Society in London to launch the \u201cJewel of Arabia\u201d, an expedition showcasing the desert sultanate\u2019s natural beauty to schoolchildren in both countries. William was invited to be co-patron of the expedition, to the delight of Britain\u2019s Foreign Office, and he expressed his desire to return to Oman, which he visited in 2019. \u201cWe\u2019ll make something happen. Time flies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Later this month Starmer will travel to the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were also <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/royal-family/article/prince-andrew-beatrice-eugenie-middle-east-q6qlzbz53\">recently described as unofficial ambassadors</a> after Beatrice appeared at two conferences in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi in the past few weeks, and Eugenie attended events in Qatar.</p> <p>Human rights organisations have urged the government to use any diplomatic meetings this week to press for reforms in the Gulf countries, which have faced criticism over their treatment of foreign workers, women, LGBTQ+ people and anyone who opposes the regimes.</p> <p>Polly Truscott, foreign policy adviser at Amnesty International UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that Qatar\u2019s poor human rights record isn\u2019t overlooked during the pomp and ceremony of this visit.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cDuring this visit, ministers and officials should be pressing the emir on the urgent need for Qatar to put in place long-overdue human rights reforms, not least a viable compensation scheme for migrant workers and their families who\u2019ve suffered enormously as a result of Qatar\u2019s abuse-ridden labour laws.\u201d</p> <p>The government believes Saudi Arabia, Qatar and regional players including Jordan can help find a lasting resolution to the Middle East conflict.</p> <p>Some of the groundwork on trade and mediation was laid by Rishi Sunak\u2019s Tory government, but Labour is seeking to firm up what has been a shaky relationship in recent years.</p> <p>Dr Neil Quilliam, a Middle East specialist at the Chatham House thinktank, said: \u201cThe Johnson to Sunak years stretched the patience of Britain\u2019s Gulf partners \u2013 all of whom had looked for new opportunities in post-Brexit Britain, but were, in most cases, frustrated by consecutive Conservative leaders\u2019 focus on domestic matters and party politics. A number of high-level inward visits were cancelled at the last minute.</p> <p>\u201cThe quick turnover of ministers made it difficult to establish strong trusted relations with Gulf ministers. During such times, it is commonplace to send royals to reassure Gulf partners that there is continuity in relations and that Britain shares meaningful relations based on historical ties.\u201d</p> <p>But the decision to hand out honours, particularly to the King of Bahrain, has upset human rights campaigners.</p> <p>Jeed Basyouni, a spokesperson for Reprieve, which defends people facing human rights abuses, said: \u201cNo one is suggesting the royal family shouldn\u2019t promote Britain\u2019s interests abroad. But they should be clear about the costs of celebrating some of the world\u2019s worst human rights abusers and tacitly condoning their actions \u2013 both to the victims of these abuses and the UK\u2019s international reputation.\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham Palace referred questions to the Foreign Office, which said the Gulf mattered to the UK\u2019s economy, security and geopolitical interests.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The royal family is being deployed by the UK government to roll out the red carpet for the autocratic leaders of Gulf states, amid hopes of a trade deal with the oil-rich countries. This week will see King Charles welcome the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and the first of his three wives, Sheikha Jawaher, to Buckingham Palace \u2013 the first state visit under the new Labour government. The visit comes amid a flurry of activity involving the royal family or government ministers with the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s six nations: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Keir Starmer and the foreign secretary, David Lammy, are hoping to use the soft power of the British monarchy to help seal a free trade deal with the GCC. They hope the Gulf countries will boost their sovereign wealth fund investment in Britain and can also mediate in the Middle East conflict. Britain has a \u00a357bn annual trade with the GCC nations and is in the final stages of negotiating a free-trade agreement predicted to raise that figure by 16%. Starmer\u2019s government is also seeking similar free-trade deals with Switzerland, South Korea, and now India, which is likely to receive a state visit by the king and queen next year. But the GCC is understood to be the immediate priority. In the Gulf, the historic ties between the all-powerful monarchies and the House of Windsor can be very useful, according to experts in the region. Many of the Gulf\u2019s leaders are British-educated, share interests such as horse racing, and have a long history of investing in Britain. Starmer and Lammy have also established a close working relationship with King Charles. \u201cIt is always the case that as head of state, the king plays an important role,\u201d Lammy said last month in response to questions about whether the monarch\u2019s relationship with Donald Trump might help the government\u2019s dealings with the incoming US administration. The sheikh was educated at Sherborne, Harrow and Sandhurst, and ultimately controls Paris Saint-Germain football club. The billionaire will receive a ceremonial welcome on Horse Guards Parade, a palace state banquet and a reception by MPs when he addresses parliament this week. His visit on 3 and 4 December follows a trip by King Hamad bin Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa of Bahrain to Windsor Castle last month, during which Charles, encouraged by government ministers in attendance, made him an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order to mark his silver jubilee. Last week it was Oman\u2019s turn, when Prince William joined the country\u2019s Crown Prince, Theyazin bin Haitham, at the Royal Geographical Society in London to launch the \u201cJewel of Arabia\u201d, an expedition showcasing the desert sultanate\u2019s natural beauty to schoolchildren in both countries. William was invited to be co-patron of the expedition, to the delight of Britain\u2019s Foreign Office, and he expressed his desire to return to Oman, which he visited in 2019. \u201cWe\u2019ll make something happen. Time flies,\u201d he said. Later this month Starmer will travel to the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were also recently described as unofficial ambassadors after Beatrice appeared at two conferences in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi in the past few weeks, and Eugenie attended events in Qatar. Human rights organisations have urged the government to use any diplomatic meetings this week to press for reforms in the Gulf countries, which have faced criticism over their treatment of foreign workers, women, LGBTQ+ people and anyone who opposes the regimes. Polly Truscott, foreign policy adviser at Amnesty International UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that Qatar\u2019s poor human rights record isn\u2019t overlooked during the pomp and ceremony of this visit.\u201d She added: \u201cDuring this visit, ministers and officials should be pressing the emir on the urgent need for Qatar to put in place long-overdue human rights reforms, not least a viable compensation scheme for migrant workers and their families who\u2019ve suffered enormously as a result of Qatar\u2019s abuse-ridden labour laws.\u201d The government believes Saudi Arabia, Qatar and regional players including Jordan can help find a lasting resolution to the Middle East conflict. Some of the groundwork on trade and mediation was laid by Rishi Sunak\u2019s Tory government, but Labour is seeking to firm up what has been a shaky relationship in recent years. Dr Neil Quilliam, a Middle East specialist at the Chatham House thinktank, said: \u201cThe Johnson to Sunak years stretched the patience of Britain\u2019s Gulf partners \u2013 all of whom had looked for new opportunities in post-Brexit Britain, but were, in most cases, frustrated by consecutive Conservative leaders\u2019 focus on domestic matters and party politics. A number of high-level inward visits were cancelled at the last minute. \u201cThe quick turnover of ministers made it difficult to establish strong trusted relations with Gulf ministers. During such times, it is commonplace to send royals to reassure Gulf partners that there is continuity in relations and that Britain shares meaningful relations based on historical ties.\u201d But the decision to hand out honours, particularly to the King of Bahrain, has upset human rights campaigners. Jeed Basyouni, a spokesperson for Reprieve, which defends people facing human rights abuses, said: \u201cNo one is suggesting the royal family shouldn\u2019t promote Britain\u2019s interests abroad. But they should be clear about the costs of celebrating some of the world\u2019s worst human rights abusers and tacitly condoning their actions \u2013 both to the victims of these abuses and the UK\u2019s international reputation.\u201d Buckingham Palace referred questions to the Foreign Office, which said the Gulf mattered to the UK\u2019s economy, security and geopolitical interests.",

      "body": "<p>The summer I met Evan B Harris, Portland was in the midst of a heatwave. People sat hot and listless on their porches, and took trips out to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm\">Crater Lake</a>. In the backyard of my rental house, the grass grew dry and yellowed.</p> <p>One evening, a friend invited me to an art opening across town. Inside, Ben Gibbard from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/deathcabforcutie\">Death Cab for Cutie</a> was playing an acoustic set, but most of us were out in the yard, drinking beer in the lowering sun. I remember Evan, heavily tattooed and wearing a wide-brimmed hat. He asked how I was enjoying the exchange rate \u2013 in those days two dollars to the pound \u2013 and I joked I\u2019d bought so much vintage clothing I was thinking I would have to buy a house to keep it all in.</p> <p>Portland, a midsize city in north-west Oregon, was affordable back then. Not just for visiting Britons, but for artists, musicians and writers. </p> <p>When I began to spend time there, in the mid-2000s, the city was not without corporate influence \u2013 it was home to the HQ of Nike, Adidas and Intel. But its character seemed more marked by its dive bars and thrift stores, its art galleries, coffee shops and cooperative groceries. There was a rich LGBTQ community, a Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Camp for Girls and a feminist bookstore. There were craft breweries, artisanal goods and farm-to-table restaurants. It was all of the things that would be affectionately skewered some years later by the TV series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/04/best-portlandia-sketches-season-seven\">Portlandia</a>, and was perhaps best summed up by a line from the show: \u201cPortland is a place where young people go to retire.\u201d</p> <p>Evan was an artist. Not long before we met, he had completed a mural in the stairwell of the city\u2019s newly opened Ace hotel \u2013 the second in what would later become an international hipster chain. His work was beautiful: old-fashioned and intricate folk art, filled with sea creatures, jays and foxes, with moths and mermaids, sailors and sweethearts.</p> <p>I saw Evan quite a few times that summer, and on subsequent trips to Portland. It was not romantic \u2013 I simply liked Evan the way I liked Portland itself; in a way that felt easy and creative and joyous. One time we drove out to Astoria, through the Clatsop forest. I remember the logging museum where we stopped for coffee, and the family of deer that crowded the road. It was a beautiful drive, but a solemn one: Evan\u2019s younger brother had experienced some serious mental health issues and he was awaiting news of a diagnosis.</p> <p>Until then, I had known little of Evan\u2019s past, but as we drove, he told me about his upbringing: how his mother was a schizophrenic and a heroin addict who often paid for her drug habit with sex. They were homeless, moving constantly. Often she would head off for days at a time, leaving Evan with friends or relatives, or sometimes on his own, without food. When he was 11, she took her own life and he went to live with his father and his new family; a situation little better than the one he had left. That anyone should not only overcome such a terrible start but reach adulthood unscathed struck me as an achievement. That he should be such a warm and generous person, seemingly so beloved in his city, was remarkable.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>For the next decade, life took me off in other directions. It had been a long time since I\u2019d been to Portland and I knew the city had changed. In part, it had become a victim of its own success: its reputation as a cultural hotspot with a high standard of living meant that between 2000 and 2014, its population grew by 90,000. House prices rose exponentially. Homelessness figures followed suit. In May 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">the murder of George Floyd</a> prompted more than 100 days of protest in Portland: clashes ensued, federal agents were deployed, and the city began a reckoning with its past.</p> <p>Still, I thought of my time there fondly. Sometimes I would look up at my bookshelves and see the painting Evan had once given me \u2013 a bird in a waistcoat \u2013 and I would seek him out on Instagram. He was always busy: there were gallery shows and artwork for breweries, bands and feature films. I saw he had married, settled in a new art studio and seemed content.</p> <p>I noticed when he stopped posting in the spring of 2021 and was curious, but not particularly worried. He\u2019d told me once he\u2019d be happy living quietly, making art by the sea, so when he disappeared from view I imagined that was where he was, and felt happy for him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I had already lost my mom to suicide, and to lose my dad the same way, it was too much. I didn\u2019t know how to process it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then in June this year, Evan returned to social media, posting a picture of himself with a friend. He looked different now. He was wearing garish makeup, several kinds of animal print and many rings and necklaces. \u201cI can\u2019t thank Jordan, Kristin and Evie enough for welcoming me into their hearts and home,\u201d the caption began. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for them I would either be back to being homeless on the streets of Portland or dead from a fentanyl overdose.\u201d</p> <p>The post made no sense. I could not fathom how the person I had known \u2013 so bright and talented and popular \u2013 had ended up in this situation. So I got back in touch with Evan, and we had long conversations that would eventually branch out into equally long conversations with others who know him. His story is by turns horrifying and hopeful.</p> <p>To understand what happened to my friend is also, I think, to understand what happened to Portland, and to many cities across the US and beyond; a story of opiate addiction, mental health crisis and a homelessness epidemic; a lesson in how we care for our most vulnerable.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It is strange, after so many years, to see Evan through a screen. He is sitting in Jordan and Kristin\u2019s house in Pennsylvania, next to one of their dogs. There is a slowness and fragility to him that feels new; as if he is finding his footing as he walks me through the events that led him here.</p> <p>It was a few years ago that Evan\u2019s father began to suffer with mental health issues. By the time the pandemic arrived, he was in full crisis, using drugs and worried enough about Covid that he had locked himself inside his house. For a week, Evan stayed with him, and they shuttled back and forth to hospital as his father experienced mounting phobias and suicidal thoughts, but refused treatment. At the end of that week, his father took his own life.</p> <p>Over the years, Evan had experienced periods of depression and anxiety, but he had never fully addressed them, or the loss of his mother, or considered the impact of his early life. \u201cI just buried these problems, this grief that I had,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But the loss of his father unmoored him. \u201cI had already lost my mom to suicide, and to lose another parent the same way, it was just too much,\u201d he says. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know how to process it.\u201d He began isolating himself from friends and family. Previously an occasional weed smoker, he now started consuming large quantities of pot. He brought his father\u2019s extensive antiques collection to the house he shared with his wife and sat among it with his thoughts. \u201cI was surrounded by his stuff, and this grief and sadness,\u201d he says. \u201cI was overwhelmed, and my mind just broke.\u201d</p> <p>When he first began to hear voices, Evan was unsettled. It was different from an internal dialogue. Instead the voice appeared to be standing outside of him, talking over his shoulder and whispering in his ear. \u201cIn my brain it was my dad\u2019s ghost talking to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought his soul was trying to enter my body.\u201d</p> <p>More voices came, then hallucinations. He saw faces everywhere. In trees. In the pattern of a carpet. He took these to be ghosts, too. When he also began hearing strange sounds, he believed it was because he was being programmed by passing cars. Meanwhile, the thoughts of what happened to his father played constantly in his head. \u201cAnd it just absolutely spiralled from there.\u201d</p>    <p>It was hard to explain to anyone what was going on inside his mind. He grew paranoid, and believed his wife and her family were trying to trick him. He pushed away his brother and his friends, and started to alter both his appearance and his personality. \u201cI was so afraid of looking like my dad, or being like him, that I started just destroying my persona,\u201d he explains. He gave away the antiques and abandoned painting. Those who knew him were scared of the person he had become. No longer able to live with his wife, Evan moved into his car.</p> <p>When the car was written off in an accident, the only place he could think to go was Lone Fir Cemetery, a 30-acre plot of 25,000 graves in the south-east of the city. \u201cI figured everyone else would be too scared to live in there,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I climbed over the fence and I lived in a bush in the graveyard for a year.\u201d</p> <p>It was around this time Evan began painting his face white. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look at my face because it reminded me of my dad,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even look in a mirror any more.\u201d His mind fractured further. \u201cI thought I was possessed by ghosts, so one day I\u2019d be a man, one day a woman, one day a kid, speaking in different accents. I mean, I was just so far gone. I was terrifying to people.\u201d</p> <p>He had no money. His ID and mobile phone were stolen. The pandemic was at its height and people walked around wearing masks. He recognised no one. Meanwhile, Portland was recovering from the recent riots. \u201cSo the city was destroyed,\u201d Evan recalls. An influx of homeless people also brought change: \u201cThere were homeless camps on every corner, fentanyl and crystal meth had flooded the streets. It looked like someone had dropped a bomb in Portland.\u201d The scene was so apocalyptic, Evan believed the world had ended.</p> <p>He ate out of trash cans and slept in his clothes. \u201cAnd when my clothes would get too wet and ruined, I\u2019d just take whatever I could from the boxes of free clothes people would leave out. But it was hard to sleep because it was so cold, and in Portland it rains all the time.\u201d </p> <p>One of the few items Evan had in his possession was a guitar, and it was through playing music that he met Michael, who lived in a homeless camp close to the cemetery. Michael was a meth addict, and the camp he lived in was cobbled together \u201clike a Mad Max fort\u201d from furniture left out on the street. Evan joined the camp and found a kind of camaraderie with its residents. \u201cFor the most part we were all hallucinating because we all had some form of schizophrenia,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I would spend all day saying, \u2018Do you see that thing right there?\u2019 And they\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh yeah I see that.\u2019 We kind of created this world within a world.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>A record number of people are now homeless in the US. The <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2023-ahar-part-1.Pdf\">2023 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report</a> found that on a single night in January, 653,104 people were without a home \u2013 up more than 12% on the previous year. Over the course of that same year, nearly a million people experienced homelessness for the first time, the majority forced to live rough for want of affordable housing.</p> <p>In Portland, an estimated 6,300 people are now homeless. As is the case nationally, many of the city\u2019s homeless experience mental health issues \u2013 63%, according to a 2021 study by the Oregonian newspaper. There is a lack of facilities, a lack of qualified workers, a lack of money to help those who need it.</p> <p>It is not that people didn\u2019t try to help Evan. His wife, his brother, his friends all did what they could. A mutual friend tells me of meeting for coffee one day and finding Evan \u201cout there. His personality had totally changed. He had painted his face and was drinking large amounts of THC\u201d \u2013 tinctures infused with cannabis. \u201cHe was fucked up. I said, \u2018Let\u2019s go and get you some help.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The friend took him to an in-patient clinic, but was told Evan needed out-patient care. Knowing he had nowhere to go, he paid for a hotel room and helped him set up a GoFundMe page, but Evan grew paranoid and accused the friend of taking advantage of him.</p> <p>At a later date, the same friend went to find him in the cemetery. \u201cI told him, \u2018This isn\u2019t you, Evan.\u2019 He said, \u2018That Evan\u2019s dead.\u2019\u201d He grew angry and abusive. \u201cHe started shouting, \u2018You\u2019re a paedophile!\u2019 and got really violent.\u201d It was deeply distressing. \u201cFor months after that I would see him around the corners of the city, and I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>For several years before his psychotic break, Evan had designed labels for Coppertail, a brewery in Tampa, Florida, and it was through this work that he had met a Pennsylvania film-maker named Jordan. The pair had become fast friends, and when Jordan noticed that Evan was no longer replying to his messages, he contacted his wife, and was bewildered by the story she told him: the mental health crisis, the makeup, the move to the cemetery. There was little he could do from the other side of the country, so in May 2021 he took a trip to Oregon to try to find Evan.</p>    <p>On his first evening in Portland he paced the perimeter of the cemetery, calling Evan\u2019s name. The following evening, he was sitting on the kerb, eating a slice of pizza, when he looked down the street and saw Evan looking through some bushes. \u201cAnd that was the start of something really, really difficult and heartbreaking for a long time,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cI didn\u2019t consider the emotional toll of this. I maybe had the bravado of, \u2018I\u2019m going to fix this right now!\u2019 I was like, \u2018How complicated could this be?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It was scary to see his friend in such bad shape. \u201cHe had makeup smeared on his face, he was super dirty, he was so thin already, so thin.\u201d Over the days that followed, Jordan got Evan food, a shower, a bed. They walked and talked. <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-evan-b-harris-art-and-recovery?attribution_id=sl:d2dd6e4b-5aa5-40c6-874a-d247e7f655d8&amp;utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;utm_source=copy_link\">Jordan filmed Evan</a>, documenting his strange transformation. \u201cHe was bouncing between these three personalities and telling these wild, deep stories that he was making up essentially on the spot,\u201d Jordan recalls. \u201cIt was like a Tolkien novel. It was like his incredible imagination, his gift, got turned on him.\u201d</p> <p>At some point Jordan asked a question: \u201cWould you want this to stop? What if we could get you off the street, get you into a house with a bed? What if we can get you comfortable?\u201d</p> <p>He drove them to a mental health facility and left Evan in the car park while he went inside to explain the situation to the staff. \u201cI need everyone to treat this with kid gloves,\u201d he told them. \u201cIf we are calm and cool and Fonzie about this, we may actually help this person. If not, he\u2019s going to walk right out that door.\u201d</p> <p>They were three-quarters of the way through the paperwork when Evan got spooked and left. Jordan and four members of staff followed him into the parking lot, but there was nothing they could do. The facility staff explained that there were only three phrases that could get Evan admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018I want help\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m going to hurt myself\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to hurt somebody else\u2019,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, what do you want me to do? I leave here in four hours.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He bought Evan camping supplies, a torch and a mobile phone. He wrote his telephone number on \u201c700 things\u201d in the hope of keeping in touch, then flew back to Pennsylvania. The phone was stolen within 48 hours.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was July when Jordan returned, and this time he had brought a cheque for $5,000 to admit Evan to a private facility out of town. He knew his friend needed not only shelter, but antipsychotic medication, a diagnosis and treatment plan. \u201cIf the public health system\u2019s not going to do it, I will pay,\u201d he decided. This time, Evan was amenable, but the day before he was to be admitted, the facility called. \u201cThey said, \u2018Sorry, it sounds too severe, we don\u2019t have the beds, we\u2019re not going to take him.\u2019\u201d It was very upsetting, Jordan says. \u201cAnd I did not have a back-up plan.\u201d</p> <p>Once again, he bought Evan a mobile phone, camping equipment and food. But this time there was a sense of futility. He knew the phone would soon be gone, and the sleeping bag ruined. \u201cHe hugged me, and I just cried all my way to the airport because I thought, that\u2019s it, the next thing I\u2019m going to hear is this person\u2019s dead. What is the other outcome? Look at this place, it\u2019s a war zone.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Substance abuse affects somewhere between 58% and 88% of those living on the streets in the US. Over the past decade, an increasing number of those users have begun taking fentanyl, a pharmaceutical drug prescribed to treat severe pain, which is also manufactured and sold illegally by criminal gangs.</p> <p>Fentanyl is up to 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. It is both ludicrously addictive and hideously dangerous. In 2010, fewer than 40,000 people died from drug overdoses in the US, and less than 10% of those deaths were related to fentanyl, but by 2015, this had begun to shift. Last year, there were about 107,000 fatal overdoses, the majority linked to fentanyl. The drug is now the leading killer of people under the age of 50 in the US.</p> <p>The country is in the grip of what is described as the \u201cfourth wave\u201d of the fentanyl crisis. In this wave, there is a growing trend for mixing fentanyl with other stimulant drugs such as methamphetamine or cocaine. As fentanyl is so cheap to manufacture, dealers also use it to cut other drugs, including heroin and MDMA.</p> <p>Last year, fatal fentanyl overdoses rose by over 50% in Portland. At least a quarter of those fatalities were homeless people, most of them white and male.</p> <p>Evan had been living on the streets for a year when somebody offered him drugs. \u201cOther than smoking pot, I never used anything before being on the streets \u2013 especially with my mom\u2019s use of drugs, I really steered clear,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you can\u2019t sleep, it\u2019s freezing outside, and someone\u2019s like, \u2018Here, smoke this, you\u2019ll feel better, you\u2019ll have energy, you can get up and move.\u2019 So I tried crystal meth for the first time and it did, it gave me energy to move around, but it also made everything that was going on inside my head way worse.\u201d</p> <p>The real problem came when Evan inherited his share of his father\u2019s estate \u2013 $170,000. He used some of the money to rent an apartment. \u201cBut I had extreme schizophrenia and I just filled it with trash because I was so out of my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI was seeing faces dripping down the walls, I couldn\u2019t even be in there.\u201d He returned to live on the streets and began giving the money away, buying homeless friends clothes, tents and drugs. \u201cIn my mind, that money was cursed, because it was all my dad talked about,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought if I gave it away, it would be better karma.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We were just like this disgusting eyesore of trash people on the corner. Commuters would yell and spit at us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One day, in the throes of a particularly severe mental health episode, someone he knew offered him new drugs. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call it fentanyl, I didn\u2019t know what it was, but he said, \u2018If you smoke this, those voices and all that stuff in your head will go away.\u2019 And I was just like, OK, I\u2019ll do anything. And it made the voices go away, because it just takes away everything.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Evan to describe what freebasing fentanyl feels like. \u201cYou feel euphoria, just complete relaxation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes away all thoughts, you\u2019re just in the moment, present, relaxed. You get put into a trance and you\u2019re just out. You\u2019re bent over, drooling on yourself.\u201d</p> <p>The high does not last long, so your days become spent in its constant pursuit. \u201cOnce I was hooked on fentanyl it was game over, because that drug is just so addictive. I mean, your life changes.\u201d</p> <p>For the next six months, Evan barely left his tent. On several occasions he overdosed. The first time was when he tried \u201cfeddy\u201d \u2013 the term used for pure fentanyl in powder form, rather than the small blue pills with which he was familiar. \u201cSmoke this!\u201d someone told him. \u201cThis is better, it\u2019s stronger!\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, the next thing you know, you\u2019re waking up with people who just brought you back to life.\u201d</p> <p>In late 2020, Oregon had begun a pioneering experiment with drug decriminalisation. It made the possession of illegal drugs, including fentanyl, heroin and methamphetamine, punishable by a ticket and a maximum $100 fine, and intended to direct hundreds of millions of legalised cannabis tax dollars towards creating an addiction services infrastructure. The problem was that Oregon\u2019s existing infrastructure, and its access to behavioural and mental health services, had been among the worst in the nation, and its health authority was already struggling to deal with the effects of the pandemic \u2013 even hiring counsellors was proving difficult. Simultaneously, homelessness was growing across the state, as was fentanyl addiction. Those who had supported the experiment began to recoil from it when faced with homeless encampments, open-air drug use and visibly mentally ill people on the streets.</p>    <p>By 2022, Evan was living in a camp on a vacant lot off Burnside, Portland\u2019s main thoroughfare. \u201cWe lived in a pile of trash, pretty much,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd people hated us so much because it was on a commute, so people would ride down this street on their bicycles to go to work and we were just like this disgusting eyesore of trash people on the corner, and they\u2019d yell at us and spit at us, and it was a terrible, terrible, terrible time.</p> <p>\u201cPortland was a very scary place. I saw dead bodies on the street. Just lying there. If someone ODed, they\u2019d roll them up in a sleeping bag and roll them over to the curb and just leave them there.\u201d There was a lot of crime and a lot of violence. A woman he knew was murdered and one time, a man who had been going through the camp robbing people showed up and attacked him. \u201cI hate even talking about this, but I stabbed him with a knife because he tried to kill me,\u201d he says. His attacker survived but, fearing reprisal, Evan left the camp and moved in with a woman who was living in a \u201cwet house\u201d \u2013 a community where drug addicts live together.</p> <p>One snowy evening, the woman locked him out and Evan, barefoot in just yoga pants and a T-shirt, was forced to walk back to the camp. Finding it was now abandoned, he climbed through piles of rubbish to get to his tent. It was then that he learned an important lesson: \u201cThe last thing you should do is light a fire inside the tent,\u201d he says, and for a moment I glimpse the humour of the old Evan. The fire was inside a metal grate where he had once burned candles, intended to keep him warm. \u201cAnd the wax started dripping, and it dripped fire on to objects on the ground, on to the tent itself, so it started catching on fire, too. The fire just kept spreading, spreading on everything, and I couldn\u2019t breathe. I barely made it out with my life.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>In Pennsylvania, Jordan and his wife, Kristin, were trying to find news of Evan. They scoured the internet for any mention of him. Jordan even left his telephone number with the police to call him in the event of Evan\u2019s arrest. But it had been six months since they had heard anything and they feared the worst.</p> <p>Jordan was standing in their kitchen one Wednesday morning when he received a message from the owner of the Coppertail brewery. It was a screengrab of an email from Evan: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with mental health and drug abuse for the last two years,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI got myself off the streets, I\u2019m in this halfway house, and I\u2019m trying to find a way to earn some money.\u201d At the end of the message, he had left a phone number. \u201cI just cried in my kitchen by myself,\u201d Jordan says.</p> <p>When he called the number, Evan explained how in desperation he had crawled his way through the streets of Portland to the same rehab facility Jordan had first taken him to. In the intervening years he had visited the facility \u201cprobably 10 to 20 times\u201d, Evan tells me now. \u201cThey give you drugs that help you sleep, they give you food, you get warmed up.\u201d The idea is you will then be assigned a caseworker, but on previous visits the system was so stretched that none could be found.</p> <p>This time it was different. \u201cThey finally had someone who could work with me and get me into a programme where I could detox and stabilise,\u201d he says. </p> <p>By now Evan was identifying as a trans woman named Cass \u2013 something he at the time regarded as the culmination of becoming everything his father was not, though he has since decided he no longer identifies as Cass. He was able to gain admission to a programme run by the charity Bridges to Change. \u201cI stayed in a house that was for trans people and women,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was more of a nurturing, loving environment than the places where it was all males. You want to hear terrible stories about what life is like on the streets? Mine is nothing compared with what the women have to go through.\u201d</p> <p>He lived in the house for eight months. The conditions of the programme required him to be clean and sober, and perform household chores, and to go to group therapy five days a week. For the first time in his life, Evan was able to begin unpacking his history.</p>    <p>Slowly, he began to feel better, and to gain some perspective on his fentanyl addiction. \u201cSome people start out as heavy drug users, then end up on the streets; others, like me, found drugs when they were on the streets,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people, they always have that urge and they have to constantly fight that feeling. Now I\u2019m off of everything, I don\u2019t have any urge to use again, ever. I just remember it as being awful and miserable.\u201d</p> <p>Once they were back in touch, Jordan and Evan spoke most evenings. One day, Jordan asked where he would be expected to go after Bridges to Change. The next step, Evan told him, was a wet house. \u201cHe sounded really scared, really shaky,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cLook, how about if you just come here?\u201d Jordan suggested. He admits he had not fully run the idea past his wife at that point. Across the screen, he looks sheepish. \u201cI may have jumped the gun on that.\u201d</p> <p>Kristin Jordan teaches at a school not far from the home she shares with Jordan, three dogs, 12 chickens and their daughter, Evie. Although for a long time his artwork had hung all over the family\u2019s house, Kristin had met Evan only once, seven years earlier, for a couple of hours over dinner.</p> <p>Still, when her husband suggested they bring him from Portland to live with them, she was surprisingly open to the idea. Jordan had asked her a question that had stuck with her, she says: \u201cWhat kind of world do you want our daughter to live in \u2013 the kind of world where people do this, or where they don\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>Evie was 11 then. Jordan sat her down and explained his conundrum. \u201cI said to her, \u2018Listen, your safety, your happiness, that is my first responsibility. And we could bring this person here, and he could leave, he could die, he could relapse. Think about the mental health toll that could take on our family, especially you.\u2019\u201d What do we do, he asked her. \u201cAnd she thought about it for a minute, and she said, \u2018You know, I think I would feel worse if we did nothing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Evan eventually moved to live with the family in the summer of 2023. Kristin, then on her summer break from teaching, began sorting Evan\u2019s practicalities. \u201cHe needed medication, which meant he needed a doctor, which meant he needed health insurance, which meant he needed to apply for benefits, and in order to do that he had to become a resident of Pennsylvania,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a lot of paperwork.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Evan began weaning himself off Suboxone, the drug administered for opiate addiction. \u201cIt was horrendous,\u201d Kristin says. \u201cHe would be shaking and throwing up, and his legs were seizing up. We had him in the emergency room a couple of times because of the side-effects. It was so hard to watch.\u201d</p> <p>By November last year he was clean and for a time he seemed together. He moved out of the family\u2019s spare room and into an apartment they had built above the garage. But by spring, they were starting to worry. \u201cSome of the face paint was coming back,\u201d Jordan recalls. \u201cAnd weird behaviour, not making sense, talking to himself. Clearly the voices were louder and louder and louder.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/14/fentanyl-deaths-high-school\">\u2018They died because they tried it once\u2019: a US high school was ravaged by fentanyl - and came back from the brink</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In June, Kristin received a call at work. It was Evan. \u201cJordan\u2019s trying to kill me!\u201d he screamed. There had been a verbal altercation and Jordan had called the police and an ambulance. She drove home immediately and spotted Evan walking out of the neighbourhood. \u201cI got him in the car, and he just sat with me till the ambulance came,\u201d she says. \u201cI will never forget the look on his face. It was terror.\u201d</p> <p>Kristin sat with Evan in the emergency room for 12 hours, until he was finally able to get a schizophrenia diagnosis and the medication he needed. When he returned to the family home, he gradually seemed to settle into himself again. \u201cThe jewellery came off, the makeup came off. And he was Evan.\u201d</p> <p>There is something striking, I say to Kristin, in the fact that Evan, who lost his mother at the age of 11, should be taken in by the parents of an 11-year-old child. \u201cI think about who he was as a little kid all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stories he tells me, my heart breaks for that.\u201d For her part, she had always imagined having a big family, but later learned this would not be possible. \u201cI told Evan, I think this was meant to be. I know it sounds cheesy, but I have all of this love to give and this person comes into my life that needs me as a mother.\u201d</p> <p>Evie and Evan are now the greatest of friends. They watch anime movies together and look after Evie\u2019s pet rats. Having seen at close range the complexities of navigating recovery and mental health services, Evie now hopes to become a psychologist. \u201cIt\u2019s just been inspirational,\u201d Kristin says. \u201cI teach kids all the time: all families look different. And our family is complete with Evan as a part of it.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It is a Monday when I next speak to Evan. He has spent the weekend watching baking shows and working on a new commission from an old client. We talk a lot about the past, then the future. \u201cI definitely think about how I want my life to go now,\u201d he says. More than anything, he would like to help people. \u201cI\u2019d like to give back, not only on the streets with drug addiction, but with mental health awareness.\u201d</p> <p>Portland has changed again, too. In January, a 90-day state of emergency was declared to address the fentanyl crisis in the city. It allowed state, county and city employees to coordinate strategies to tackle the spiralling drug problem. \u201cOur country and our state have never seen a drug this deadly and addictive,\u201d said Oregon\u2019s governor, Tina Kotek. As of September, the state also re-criminalised the possession of hard drugs.</p> <p>Evan has not been back to Portland. He is no longer in touch with his wife, or his brother, or his friends from before, or the people he met when he lived on the street. Sometimes he thinks back to all the things that went wrong. How he changed. How the city changed. </p> <p>I tell him how much he still seems like the Evan I knew. Still, I am surprised that he would want to speak about everything that happened. \u201cI feel it\u2019s an important thing because it shows redemption,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt shows people can be seen to be so far gone, and in the darkness, and there\u2019s no help for that person. But that person can still always be helped.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "The summer I met Evan B Harris, Portland was in the midst of a heatwave. People sat hot and listless on their porches, and took trips out to Crater Lake. In the backyard of my rental house, the grass grew dry and yellowed. One evening, a friend invited me to an art opening across town. Inside, Ben Gibbard from Death Cab for Cutie was playing an acoustic set, but most of us were out in the yard, drinking beer in the lowering sun. I remember Evan, heavily tattooed and wearing a wide-brimmed hat. He asked how I was enjoying the exchange rate \u2013 in those days two dollars to the pound \u2013 and I joked I\u2019d bought so much vintage clothing I was thinking I would have to buy a house to keep it all in. Portland, a midsize city in north-west Oregon, was affordable back then. Not just for visiting Britons, but for artists, musicians and writers. When I began to spend time there, in the mid-2000s, the city was not without corporate influence \u2013 it was home to the HQ of Nike, Adidas and Intel. But its character seemed more marked by its dive bars and thrift stores, its art galleries, coffee shops and cooperative groceries. There was a rich LGBTQ community, a Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Camp for Girls and a feminist bookstore. There were craft breweries, artisanal goods and farm-to-table restaurants. It was all of the things that would be affectionately skewered some years later by the TV series Portlandia, and was perhaps best summed up by a line from the show: \u201cPortland is a place where young people go to retire.\u201d Evan was an artist. Not long before we met, he had completed a mural in the stairwell of the city\u2019s newly opened Ace hotel \u2013 the second in what would later become an international hipster chain. His work was beautiful: old-fashioned and intricate folk art, filled with sea creatures, jays and foxes, with moths and mermaids, sailors and sweethearts. I saw Evan quite a few times that summer, and on subsequent trips to Portland. It was not romantic \u2013 I simply liked Evan the way I liked Portland itself; in a way that felt easy and creative and joyous. One time we drove out to Astoria, through the Clatsop forest. I remember the logging museum where we stopped for coffee, and the family of deer that crowded the road. It was a beautiful drive, but a solemn one: Evan\u2019s younger brother had experienced some serious mental health issues and he was awaiting news of a diagnosis. Until then, I had known little of Evan\u2019s past, but as we drove, he told me about his upbringing: how his mother was a schizophrenic and a heroin addict who often paid for her drug habit with sex. They were homeless, moving constantly. Often she would head off for days at a time, leaving Evan with friends or relatives, or sometimes on his own, without food. When he was 11, she took her own life and he went to live with his father and his new family; a situation little better than the one he had left. That anyone should not only overcome such a terrible start but reach adulthood unscathed struck me as an achievement. That he should be such a warm and generous person, seemingly so beloved in his city, was remarkable. * * * For the next decade, life took me off in other directions. It had been a long time since I\u2019d been to Portland and I knew the city had changed. In part, it had become a victim of its own success: its reputation as a cultural hotspot with a high standard of living meant that between 2000 and 2014, its population grew by 90,000. House prices rose exponentially. Homelessness figures followed suit. In May 2020, the murder of George Floyd prompted more than 100 days of protest in Portland: clashes ensued, federal agents were deployed, and the city began a reckoning with its past. Still, I thought of my time there fondly. Sometimes I would look up at my bookshelves and see the painting Evan had once given me \u2013 a bird in a waistcoat \u2013 and I would seek him out on Instagram. He was always busy: there were gallery shows and artwork for breweries, bands and feature films. I saw he had married, settled in a new art studio and seemed content. I noticed when he stopped posting in the spring of 2021 and was curious, but not particularly worried. He\u2019d told me once he\u2019d be happy living quietly, making art by the sea, so when he disappeared from view I imagined that was where he was, and felt happy for him. Then in June this year, Evan returned to social media, posting a picture of himself with a friend. He looked different now. He was wearing garish makeup, several kinds of animal print and many rings and necklaces. \u201cI can\u2019t thank Jordan, Kristin and Evie enough for welcoming me into their hearts and home,\u201d the caption began. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for them I would either be back to being homeless on the streets of Portland or dead from a fentanyl overdose.\u201d The post made no sense. I could not fathom how the person I had known \u2013 so bright and talented and popular \u2013 had ended up in this situation. So I got back in touch with Evan, and we had long conversations that would eventually branch out into equally long conversations with others who know him. His story is by turns horrifying and hopeful. To understand what happened to my friend is also, I think, to understand what happened to Portland, and to many cities across the US and beyond; a story of opiate addiction, mental health crisis and a homelessness epidemic; a lesson in how we care for our most vulnerable. * * * It is strange, after so many years, to see Evan through a screen. He is sitting in Jordan and Kristin\u2019s house in Pennsylvania, next to one of their dogs. There is a slowness and fragility to him that feels new; as if he is finding his footing as he walks me through the events that led him here. It was a few years ago that Evan\u2019s father began to suffer with mental health issues. By the time the pandemic arrived, he was in full crisis, using drugs and worried enough about Covid that he had locked himself inside his house. For a week, Evan stayed with him, and they shuttled back and forth to hospital as his father experienced mounting phobias and suicidal thoughts, but refused treatment. At the end of that week, his father took his own life. Over the years, Evan had experienced periods of depression and anxiety, but he had never fully addressed them, or the loss of his mother, or considered the impact of his early life. \u201cI just buried these problems, this grief that I had,\u201d he says. But the loss of his father unmoored him. \u201cI had already lost my mom to suicide, and to lose another parent the same way, it was just too much,\u201d he says. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know how to process it.\u201d He began isolating himself from friends and family. Previously an occasional weed smoker, he now started consuming large quantities of pot. He brought his father\u2019s extensive antiques collection to the house he shared with his wife and sat among it with his thoughts. \u201cI was surrounded by his stuff, and this grief and sadness,\u201d he says. \u201cI was overwhelmed, and my mind just broke.\u201d When he first began to hear voices, Evan was unsettled. It was different from an internal dialogue. Instead the voice appeared to be standing outside of him, talking over his shoulder and whispering in his ear. \u201cIn my brain it was my dad\u2019s ghost talking to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought his soul was trying to enter my body.\u201d More voices came, then hallucinations. He saw faces everywhere. In trees. In the pattern of a carpet. He took these to be ghosts, too. When he also began hearing strange sounds, he believed it was because he was being programmed by passing cars. Meanwhile, the thoughts of what happened to his father played constantly in his head. \u201cAnd it just absolutely spiralled from there.\u201d It was hard to explain to anyone what was going on inside his mind. He grew paranoid, and believed his wife and her family were trying to trick him. He pushed away his brother and his friends, and started to alter both his appearance and his personality. \u201cI was so afraid of looking like my dad, or being like him, that I started just destroying my persona,\u201d he explains. He gave away the antiques and abandoned painting. Those who knew him were scared of the person he had become. No longer able to live with his wife, Evan moved into his car. When the car was written off in an accident, the only place he could think to go was Lone Fir Cemetery, a 30-acre plot of 25,000 graves in the south-east of the city. \u201cI figured everyone else would be too scared to live in there,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I climbed over the fence and I lived in a bush in the graveyard for a year.\u201d It was around this time Evan began painting his face white. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look at my face because it reminded me of my dad,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even look in a mirror any more.\u201d His mind fractured further. \u201cI thought I was possessed by ghosts, so one day I\u2019d be a man, one day a woman, one day a kid, speaking in different accents. I mean, I was just so far gone. I was terrifying to people.\u201d He had no money. His ID and mobile phone were stolen. The pandemic was at its height and people walked around wearing masks. He recognised no one. Meanwhile, Portland was recovering from the recent riots. \u201cSo the city was destroyed,\u201d Evan recalls. An influx of homeless people also brought change: \u201cThere were homeless camps on every corner, fentanyl and crystal meth had flooded the streets. It looked like someone had dropped a bomb in Portland.\u201d The scene was so apocalyptic, Evan believed the world had ended. He ate out of trash cans and slept in his clothes. \u201cAnd when my clothes would get too wet and ruined, I\u2019d just take whatever I could from the boxes of free clothes people would leave out. But it was hard to sleep because it was so cold, and in Portland it rains all the time.\u201d One of the few items Evan had in his possession was a guitar, and it was through playing music that he met Michael, who lived in a homeless camp close to the cemetery. Michael was a meth addict, and the camp he lived in was cobbled together \u201clike a Mad Max fort\u201d from furniture left out on the street. Evan joined the camp and found a kind of camaraderie with its residents. \u201cFor the most part we were all hallucinating because we all had some form of schizophrenia,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I would spend all day saying, \u2018Do you see that thing right there?\u2019 And they\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh yeah I see that.\u2019 We kind of created this world within a world.\u201d * * * A record number of people are now homeless in the US. The 2023 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report found that on a single night in January, 653,104 people were without a home \u2013 up more than 12% on the previous year. Over the course of that same year, nearly a million people experienced homelessness for the first time, the majority forced to live rough for want of affordable housing. In Portland, an estimated 6,300 people are now homeless. As is the case nationally, many of the city\u2019s homeless experience mental health issues \u2013 63%, according to a 2021 study by the Oregonian newspaper. There is a lack of facilities, a lack of qualified workers, a lack of money to help those who need it. It is not that people didn\u2019t try to help Evan. His wife, his brother, his friends all did what they could. A mutual friend tells me of meeting for coffee one day and finding Evan \u201cout there. His personality had totally changed. He had painted his face and was drinking large amounts of THC\u201d \u2013 tinctures infused with cannabis. \u201cHe was fucked up. I said, \u2018Let\u2019s go and get you some help.\u2019\u201d The friend took him to an in-patient clinic, but was told Evan needed out-patient care. Knowing he had nowhere to go, he paid for a hotel room and helped him set up a GoFundMe page, but Evan grew paranoid and accused the friend of taking advantage of him. At a later date, the same friend went to find him in the cemetery. \u201cI told him, \u2018This isn\u2019t you, Evan.\u2019 He said, \u2018That Evan\u2019s dead.\u2019\u201d He grew angry and abusive. \u201cHe started shouting, \u2018You\u2019re a paedophile!\u2019 and got really violent.\u201d It was deeply distressing. \u201cFor months after that I would see him around the corners of the city, and I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d For several years before his psychotic break, Evan had designed labels for Coppertail, a brewery in Tampa, Florida, and it was through this work that he had met a Pennsylvania film-maker named Jordan. The pair had become fast friends, and when Jordan noticed that Evan was no longer replying to his messages, he contacted his wife, and was bewildered by the story she told him: the mental health crisis, the makeup, the move to the cemetery. There was little he could do from the other side of the country, so in May 2021 he took a trip to Oregon to try to find Evan. On his first evening in Portland he paced the perimeter of the cemetery, calling Evan\u2019s name. The following evening, he was sitting on the kerb, eating a slice of pizza, when he looked down the street and saw Evan looking through some bushes. \u201cAnd that was the start of something really, really difficult and heartbreaking for a long time,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cI didn\u2019t consider the emotional toll of this. I maybe had the bravado of, \u2018I\u2019m going to fix this right now!\u2019 I was like, \u2018How complicated could this be?\u2019\u201d It was scary to see his friend in such bad shape. \u201cHe had makeup smeared on his face, he was super dirty, he was so thin already, so thin.\u201d Over the days that followed, Jordan got Evan food, a shower, a bed. They walked and talked. Jordan filmed Evan, documenting his strange transformation. \u201cHe was bouncing between these three personalities and telling these wild, deep stories that he was making up essentially on the spot,\u201d Jordan recalls. \u201cIt was like a Tolkien novel. It was like his incredible imagination, his gift, got turned on him.\u201d At some point Jordan asked a question: \u201cWould you want this to stop? What if we could get you off the street, get you into a house with a bed? What if we can get you comfortable?\u201d He drove them to a mental health facility and left Evan in the car park while he went inside to explain the situation to the staff. \u201cI need everyone to treat this with kid gloves,\u201d he told them. \u201cIf we are calm and cool and Fonzie about this, we may actually help this person. If not, he\u2019s going to walk right out that door.\u201d They were three-quarters of the way through the paperwork when Evan got spooked and left. Jordan and four members of staff followed him into the parking lot, but there was nothing they could do. The facility staff explained that there were only three phrases that could get Evan admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018I want help\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m going to hurt myself\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to hurt somebody else\u2019,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, what do you want me to do? I leave here in four hours.\u2019\u201d He bought Evan camping supplies, a torch and a mobile phone. He wrote his telephone number on \u201c700 things\u201d in the hope of keeping in touch, then flew back to Pennsylvania. The phone was stolen within 48 hours. * * * It was July when Jordan returned, and this time he had brought a cheque for $5,000 to admit Evan to a private facility out of town. He knew his friend needed not only shelter, but antipsychotic medication, a diagnosis and treatment plan. \u201cIf the public health system\u2019s not going to do it, I will pay,\u201d he decided. This time, Evan was amenable, but the day before he was to be admitted, the facility called. \u201cThey said, \u2018Sorry, it sounds too severe, we don\u2019t have the beds, we\u2019re not going to take him.\u2019\u201d It was very upsetting, Jordan says. \u201cAnd I did not have a back-up plan.\u201d Once again, he bought Evan a mobile phone, camping equipment and food. But this time there was a sense of futility. He knew the phone would soon be gone, and the sleeping bag ruined. \u201cHe hugged me, and I just cried all my way to the airport because I thought, that\u2019s it, the next thing I\u2019m going to hear is this person\u2019s dead. What is the other outcome? Look at this place, it\u2019s a war zone.\u201d * * * Substance abuse affects somewhere between 58% and 88% of those living on the streets in the US. Over the past decade, an increasing number of those users have begun taking fentanyl, a pharmaceutical drug prescribed to treat severe pain, which is also manufactured and sold illegally by criminal gangs. Fentanyl is up to 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. It is both ludicrously addictive and hideously dangerous. In 2010, fewer than 40,000 people died from drug overdoses in the US, and less than 10% of those deaths were related to fentanyl, but by 2015, this had begun to shift. Last year, there were about 107,000 fatal overdoses, the majority linked to fentanyl. The drug is now the leading killer of people under the age of 50 in the US. The country is in the grip of what is described as the \u201cfourth wave\u201d of the fentanyl crisis. In this wave, there is a growing trend for mixing fentanyl with other stimulant drugs such as methamphetamine or cocaine. As fentanyl is so cheap to manufacture, dealers also use it to cut other drugs, including heroin and MDMA. Last year, fatal fentanyl overdoses rose by over 50% in Portland. At least a quarter of those fatalities were homeless people, most of them white and male. Evan had been living on the streets for a year when somebody offered him drugs. \u201cOther than smoking pot, I never used anything before being on the streets \u2013 especially with my mom\u2019s use of drugs, I really steered clear,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you can\u2019t sleep, it\u2019s freezing outside, and someone\u2019s like, \u2018Here, smoke this, you\u2019ll feel better, you\u2019ll have energy, you can get up and move.\u2019 So I tried crystal meth for the first time and it did, it gave me energy to move around, but it also made everything that was going on inside my head way worse.\u201d The real problem came when Evan inherited his share of his father\u2019s estate \u2013 $170,000. He used some of the money to rent an apartment. \u201cBut I had extreme schizophrenia and I just filled it with trash because I was so out of my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI was seeing faces dripping down the walls, I couldn\u2019t even be in there.\u201d He returned to live on the streets and began giving the money away, buying homeless friends clothes, tents and drugs. \u201cIn my mind, that money was cursed, because it was all my dad talked about,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought if I gave it away, it would be better karma.\u201d One day, in the throes of a particularly severe mental health episode, someone he knew offered him new drugs. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call it fentanyl, I didn\u2019t know what it was, but he said, \u2018If you smoke this, those voices and all that stuff in your head will go away.\u2019 And I was just like, OK, I\u2019ll do anything. And it made the voices go away, because it just takes away everything.\u201d I ask Evan to describe what freebasing fentanyl feels like. \u201cYou feel euphoria, just complete relaxation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes away all thoughts, you\u2019re just in the moment, present, relaxed. You get put into a trance and you\u2019re just out. You\u2019re bent over, drooling on yourself.\u201d The high does not last long, so your days become spent in its constant pursuit. \u201cOnce I was hooked on fentanyl it was game over, because that drug is just so addictive. I mean, your life changes.\u201d For the next six months, Evan barely left his tent. On several occasions he overdosed. The first time was when he tried \u201cfeddy\u201d \u2013 the term used for pure fentanyl in powder form, rather than the small blue pills with which he was familiar. \u201cSmoke this!\u201d someone told him. \u201cThis is better, it\u2019s stronger!\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, the next thing you know, you\u2019re waking up with people who just brought you back to life.\u201d In late 2020, Oregon had begun a pioneering experiment with drug decriminalisation. It made the possession of illegal drugs, including fentanyl, heroin and methamphetamine, punishable by a ticket and a maximum $100 fine, and intended to direct hundreds of millions of legalised cannabis tax dollars towards creating an addiction services infrastructure. The problem was that Oregon\u2019s existing infrastructure, and its access to behavioural and mental health services, had been among the worst in the nation, and its health authority was already struggling to deal with the effects of the pandemic \u2013 even hiring counsellors was proving difficult. Simultaneously, homelessness was growing across the state, as was fentanyl addiction. Those who had supported the experiment began to recoil from it when faced with homeless encampments, open-air drug use and visibly mentally ill people on the streets. By 2022, Evan was living in a camp on a vacant lot off Burnside, Portland\u2019s main thoroughfare. \u201cWe lived in a pile of trash, pretty much,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd people hated us so much because it was on a commute, so people would ride down this street on their bicycles to go to work and we were just like this disgusting eyesore of trash people on the corner, and they\u2019d yell at us and spit at us, and it was a terrible, terrible, terrible time. \u201cPortland was a very scary place. I saw dead bodies on the street. Just lying there. If someone ODed, they\u2019d roll them up in a sleeping bag and roll them over to the curb and just leave them there.\u201d There was a lot of crime and a lot of violence. A woman he knew was murdered and one time, a man who had been going through the camp robbing people showed up and attacked him. \u201cI hate even talking about this, but I stabbed him with a knife because he tried to kill me,\u201d he says. His attacker survived but, fearing reprisal, Evan left the camp and moved in with a woman who was living in a \u201cwet house\u201d \u2013 a community where drug addicts live together. One snowy evening, the woman locked him out and Evan, barefoot in just yoga pants and a T-shirt, was forced to walk back to the camp. Finding it was now abandoned, he climbed through piles of rubbish to get to his tent. It was then that he learned an important lesson: \u201cThe last thing you should do is light a fire inside the tent,\u201d he says, and for a moment I glimpse the humour of the old Evan. The fire was inside a metal grate where he had once burned candles, intended to keep him warm. \u201cAnd the wax started dripping, and it dripped fire on to objects on the ground, on to the tent itself, so it started catching on fire, too. The fire just kept spreading, spreading on everything, and I couldn\u2019t breathe. I barely made it out with my life.\u201d * * * In Pennsylvania, Jordan and his wife, Kristin, were trying to find news of Evan. They scoured the internet for any mention of him. Jordan even left his telephone number with the police to call him in the event of Evan\u2019s arrest. But it had been six months since they had heard anything and they feared the worst. Jordan was standing in their kitchen one Wednesday morning when he received a message from the owner of the Coppertail brewery. It was a screengrab of an email from Evan: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with mental health and drug abuse for the last two years,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI got myself off the streets, I\u2019m in this halfway house, and I\u2019m trying to find a way to earn some money.\u201d At the end of the message, he had left a phone number. \u201cI just cried in my kitchen by myself,\u201d Jordan says. When he called the number, Evan explained how in desperation he had crawled his way through the streets of Portland to the same rehab facility Jordan had first taken him to. In the intervening years he had visited the facility \u201cprobably 10 to 20 times\u201d, Evan tells me now. \u201cThey give you drugs that help you sleep, they give you food, you get warmed up.\u201d The idea is you will then be assigned a caseworker, but on previous visits the system was so stretched that none could be found. This time it was different. \u201cThey finally had someone who could work with me and get me into a programme where I could detox and stabilise,\u201d he says. By now Evan was identifying as a trans woman named Cass \u2013 something he at the time regarded as the culmination of becoming everything his father was not, though he has since decided he no longer identifies as Cass. He was able to gain admission to a programme run by the charity Bridges to Change. \u201cI stayed in a house that was for trans people and women,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was more of a nurturing, loving environment than the places where it was all males. You want to hear terrible stories about what life is like on the streets? Mine is nothing compared with what the women have to go through.\u201d He lived in the house for eight months. The conditions of the programme required him to be clean and sober, and perform household chores, and to go to group therapy five days a week. For the first time in his life, Evan was able to begin unpacking his history. Slowly, he began to feel better, and to gain some perspective on his fentanyl addiction. \u201cSome people start out as heavy drug users, then end up on the streets; others, like me, found drugs when they were on the streets,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people, they always have that urge and they have to constantly fight that feeling. Now I\u2019m off of everything, I don\u2019t have any urge to use again, ever. I just remember it as being awful and miserable.\u201d Once they were back in touch, Jordan and Evan spoke most evenings. One day, Jordan asked where he would be expected to go after Bridges to Change. The next step, Evan told him, was a wet house. \u201cHe sounded really scared, really shaky,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cLook, how about if you just come here?\u201d Jordan suggested. He admits he had not fully run the idea past his wife at that point. Across the screen, he looks sheepish. \u201cI may have jumped the gun on that.\u201d Kristin Jordan teaches at a school not far from the home she shares with Jordan, three dogs, 12 chickens and their daughter, Evie. Although for a long time his artwork had hung all over the family\u2019s house, Kristin had met Evan only once, seven years earlier, for a couple of hours over dinner. Still, when her husband suggested they bring him from Portland to live with them, she was surprisingly open to the idea. Jordan had asked her a question that had stuck with her, she says: \u201cWhat kind of world do you want our daughter to live in \u2013 the kind of world where people do this, or where they don\u2019t?\u201d Evie was 11 then. Jordan sat her down and explained his conundrum. \u201cI said to her, \u2018Listen, your safety, your happiness, that is my first responsibility. And we could bring this person here, and he could leave, he could die, he could relapse. Think about the mental health toll that could take on our family, especially you.\u2019\u201d What do we do, he asked her. \u201cAnd she thought about it for a minute, and she said, \u2018You know, I think I would feel worse if we did nothing.\u2019\u201d Evan eventually moved to live with the family in the summer of 2023. Kristin, then on her summer break from teaching, began sorting Evan\u2019s practicalities. \u201cHe needed medication, which meant he needed a doctor, which meant he needed health insurance, which meant he needed to apply for benefits, and in order to do that he had to become a resident of Pennsylvania,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a lot of paperwork.\u201d Meanwhile, Evan began weaning himself off Suboxone, the drug administered for opiate addiction. \u201cIt was horrendous,\u201d Kristin says. \u201cHe would be shaking and throwing up, and his legs were seizing up. We had him in the emergency room a couple of times because of the side-effects. It was so hard to watch.\u201d By November last year he was clean and for a time he seemed together. He moved out of the family\u2019s spare room and into an apartment they had built above the garage. But by spring, they were starting to worry. \u201cSome of the face paint was coming back,\u201d Jordan recalls. \u201cAnd weird behaviour, not making sense, talking to himself. Clearly the voices were louder and louder and louder.\u201d In June, Kristin received a call at work. It was Evan. \u201cJordan\u2019s trying to kill me!\u201d he screamed. There had been a verbal altercation and Jordan had called the police and an ambulance. She drove home immediately and spotted Evan walking out of the neighbourhood. \u201cI got him in the car, and he just sat with me till the ambulance came,\u201d she says. \u201cI will never forget the look on his face. It was terror.\u201d Kristin sat with Evan in the emergency room for 12 hours, until he was finally able to get a schizophrenia diagnosis and the medication he needed. When he returned to the family home, he gradually seemed to settle into himself again. \u201cThe jewellery came off, the makeup came off. And he was Evan.\u201d There is something striking, I say to Kristin, in the fact that Evan, who lost his mother at the age of 11, should be taken in by the parents of an 11-year-old child. \u201cI think about who he was as a little kid all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stories he tells me, my heart breaks for that.\u201d For her part, she had always imagined having a big family, but later learned this would not be possible. \u201cI told Evan, I think this was meant to be. I know it sounds cheesy, but I have all of this love to give and this person comes into my life that needs me as a mother.\u201d Evie and Evan are now the greatest of friends. They watch anime movies together and look after Evie\u2019s pet rats. Having seen at close range the complexities of navigating recovery and mental health services, Evie now hopes to become a psychologist. \u201cIt\u2019s just been inspirational,\u201d Kristin says. \u201cI teach kids all the time: all families look different. And our family is complete with Evan as a part of it.\u201d * * * It is a Monday when I next speak to Evan. He has spent the weekend watching baking shows and working on a new commission from an old client. We talk a lot about the past, then the future. \u201cI definitely think about how I want my life to go now,\u201d he says. More than anything, he would like to help people. \u201cI\u2019d like to give back, not only on the streets with drug addiction, but with mental health awareness.\u201d Portland has changed again, too. In January, a 90-day state of emergency was declared to address the fentanyl crisis in the city. It allowed state, county and city employees to coordinate strategies to tackle the spiralling drug problem. \u201cOur country and our state have never seen a drug this deadly and addictive,\u201d said Oregon\u2019s governor, Tina Kotek. As of September, the state also re-criminalised the possession of hard drugs. Evan has not been back to Portland. He is no longer in touch with his wife, or his brother, or his friends from before, or the people he met when he lived on the street. Sometimes he thinks back to all the things that went wrong. How he changed. How the city changed. I tell him how much he still seems like the Evan I knew. Still, I am surprised that he would want to speak about everything that happened. \u201cI feel it\u2019s an important thing because it shows redemption,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt shows people can be seen to be so far gone, and in the darkness, and there\u2019s no help for that person. But that person can still always be helped.\u201d",

On 6 November, the number of people booking vasectomy appointments at Planned Parenthood health centers spiked by 1,200%, IUD appointments by more than 760% and birth control implant appointments by 350%, according to a statement provided to the Guardian by Planned Parenthood. Traffic to Planned Parenthood\u2019s webpages on tubal ligation, vasectomies and IUDs has also surged by more than 1,000% for each.</p> <p>After the election, the Guardian heard from dozens of people in the US reconsidering whether to have children. Most pointed to fears over the future of reproductive healthcare, the economy and the climate in explaining their concerns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Since Trump won, I\u2019ve decided not to have more children and have destroyed my remaining embryos just in case the government gets any crazy ideas about them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI hesitate to bring more children into a world with an uncertain ecological future, assuming that the incoming administration pulls out of the Paris climate accord and ceases to support green energy transition,\u201d a 34-year-old Minnesota mother of one wrote to the Guardian in response to a callout inviting readers to share their thoughts about post-election family planning. Trump pulled the US out of the historic agreement during his first administration; doing so again \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/climate/trump-climate-cop-negotiations.html\">Trump has promised to do</a> \u2013 could \u201ccripple\u201d the it, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/01/a-trump-presidency-could-cripple-the-paris-climate-agreement-warns-un-chief-antonio-guterres\">UN secretary general</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWe have two children and I have desperately wanted a third \u2013 but now I am fearful of being able to get adequate care if I get pregnant,\u201d wrote another woman who lives in Louisiana. \u201cI can\u2019t risk leaving my two children behind if [I] die because I can\u2019t get adequate care here. It feels like a dystopian novel, and yet here we are.\u201d</p> <p>These worries are not necessarily new. In 2023, a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/07/25/the-experiences-of-u-s-adults-who-dont-have-children/\">Pew Research Center survey</a> found that 47% of 18- to 49-year-old US adults say they are unlikely to ever have kids \u2013 a steep jump from 2018, when 37% said the same. Of the people who are unlikely to have kids, 38% said \u201cconcerns about the state of the world\u201d were a major part of their decision-making. Roughly a quarter pointed to fears about the environment.</p> <p>Working in disaster relief, Catherine regularly sees the effects of the climate crisis up close. \u201cI\u2019m in Washington DC right now and flowers are blooming. It\u2019s November. This should not be happening,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWhile I have always wanted kids, that choice has become tinged with a level of despair and anger that I didn\u2019t have two years ago.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cWhy would I bring a child into this world that is dying?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, Catherine got a copper IUD, which can block pregnancy for more than a decade.</p> <p>Like developed countries around the world, the United States is in the midst of a fertility slump. In 2023, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2024/20240525.htm\">US fertility rate</a> fell by 3% and reached a historic low.</p> <p>But this decline<strong> </strong>is not evenly distributed across the political spectrum. After Trump won the presidency in 2016, births in <a href=\"https://today.ucsd.edu/story/the-trump-baby-bump-among-republicans-after-the-2016-election\">Republican-leaning counties</a> rose sharply compared to those that leaned Democratic. Today, Democrats are likelier than Republicans to be childfree \u2013 a trend that, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/02/data-childless-cat-ladies/\">Washington Post</a> has hypothesized, is likely also related to the rightward drift of big-family white Protestants.</p> <p>That the outcome of the 2024 election has spurred such fear and hesitation around having children is apt \u2013 not only are US political parties on diverging paths when it comes to babies, but the election itself was in many ways a referendum on families and fertility. While Kamala Harris made support for abortion rights a key plank in her platform, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5060348/user-clip-trump-baby-boom\">promised</a> \u201cbaby booms\u201d and pledged to give people \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d. Trump\u2019s vice-president-elect, JD Vance, has built his political brand on pronatalism, a movement that urges people to have babies to benefit the greater good. Vance has a track record of deriding<strong> </strong>\u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d and raising the alarm about the US fertility rate.</p> <p>\u201cWe want more babies because children are good,\u201d Vance once said. \u201cAnd we believe children are good, because we are not sociopaths.\u201d</p> <p>M, a Texan mother of three who asked to go by her first initial because she feels stigmatized for voting for Trump, hopes that Trump\u2019s victory will improve the economy to the point that she and her husband can afford to have a fourth child.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We want to be able to dream of having a family the way we want to, on our terms</p> <footer> <cite>Ruth</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI still have a child in childcare now \u2013 like daycare \u2013 and just seeing those costs rise year after year since 2020, it\u2019s been really hard for our family to consider having another baby,\u201d M said. \u201cThe possibility of that being alleviated through better economic policy or even just those costs being taken away somewhere else \u2013 whether it\u2019s groceries or utilities to whatever it is \u2013 that really makes it possible for us to consider having another kid.\u201d</p> <p>M, who opposes abortion, feels confident that she would be able to get adequate care if she had a miscarriage. (Since Roe v Wade fell, at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/texas-porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-abortion-ban\">three women have died in Texas</a> after doctors reportedly<strong> </strong>delayed treating them for miscarriages or gave them inadequate miscarriage care.)

Ruth, who has a newborn at home and is married to an undocumented person, fears abortion bans and her husband being deported \u2013 but still wants to keep the conversation about having a second kid alive.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to be able to dream of having a family the way we want to, on our terms,\u201d said Ruth, who lives in Florida and asked to be identified by her middle name due to her husband\u2019s immigration status. \u201cMy husband being an immigrant \u2013 we feel that it shouldn\u2019t foreclose our options to build a family. We have just as much of a right to build a family on our terms as anyone else.\u201d</p>",

Peterson is terrified of what is to come, and that his wife might not be able to get the medical care she needs if they decide to conceive again. \u201cWe should be happy thinking about expanding our family,\u201d said Peterson, who is, like his wife, in his late 30s. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be worried that we\u2019re going to have medical complications and I might end up being a single father.\u201d Peterson is not the only American who, in the weeks after the US election, is rethinking plans around having children. On 6 November, the number of people booking vasectomy appointments at Planned Parenthood health centers spiked by 1,200%, IUD appointments by more than 760% and birth control implant appointments by 350%, according to a statement provided to the Guardian by Planned Parenthood. Traffic to Planned Parenthood\u2019s webpages on tubal ligation, vasectomies and IUDs has also surged by more than 1,000% for each. After the election, the Guardian heard from dozens of people in the US reconsidering whether to have children. Most pointed to fears over the future of reproductive healthcare, the economy and the climate in explaining their concerns. \u201cI hesitate to bring more children into a world with an uncertain ecological future, assuming that the incoming administration pulls out of the Paris climate accord and ceases to support green energy transition,\u201d a 34-year-old Minnesota mother of one wrote to the Guardian in response to a callout inviting readers to share their thoughts about post-election family planning. Trump pulled the US out of the historic agreement during his first administration; doing so again \u2013 which Trump has promised to do \u2013 could \u201ccripple\u201d the it, according to the UN secretary general. \u201cWe have two children and I have desperately wanted a third \u2013 but now I am fearful of being able to get adequate care if I get pregnant,\u201d wrote another woman who lives in Louisiana. \u201cI can\u2019t risk leaving my two children behind if [I] die because I can\u2019t get adequate care here. It feels like a dystopian novel, and yet here we are.\u201d These worries are not necessarily new. In 2023, a Pew Research Center survey found that 47% of 18- to 49-year-old US adults say they are unlikely to ever have kids \u2013 a steep jump from 2018, when 37% said the same. Of the people who are unlikely to have kids, 38% said \u201cconcerns about the state of the world\u201d were a major part of their decision-making. Roughly a quarter pointed to fears about the environment. Working in disaster relief, Catherine regularly sees the effects of the climate crisis up close. \u201cI\u2019m in Washington DC right now and flowers are blooming. It\u2019s November. This should not be happening,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWhile I have always wanted kids, that choice has become tinged with a level of despair and anger that I didn\u2019t have two years ago.\u201d She continued: \u201cWhy would I bring a child into this world that is dying?\u201d Earlier this year, Catherine got a copper IUD, which can block pregnancy for more than a decade. Like developed countries around the world, the United States is in the midst of a fertility slump. In 2023, the US fertility rate fell by 3% and reached a historic low. But this decline is not evenly distributed across the political spectrum. After Trump won the presidency in 2016, births in Republican-leaning counties rose sharply compared to those that leaned Democratic. Today, Democrats are likelier than Republicans to be childfree \u2013 a trend that, the Washington Post has hypothesized, is likely also related to the rightward drift of big-family white Protestants. That the outcome of the 2024 election has spurred such fear and hesitation around having children is apt \u2013 not only are US political parties on diverging paths when it comes to babies, but the election itself was in many ways a referendum on families and fertility. While Kamala Harris made support for abortion rights a key plank in her platform, Donald Trump promised \u201cbaby booms\u201d and pledged to give people \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d. Trump\u2019s vice-president-elect, JD Vance, has built his political brand on pronatalism, a movement that urges people to have babies to benefit the greater good. Vance has a track record of deriding \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d and raising the alarm about the US fertility rate. \u201cWe want more babies because children are good,\u201d Vance once said. \u201cAnd we believe children are good, because we are not sociopaths.\u201d M, a Texan mother of three who asked to go by her first initial because she feels stigmatized for voting for Trump, hopes that Trump\u2019s victory will improve the economy to the point that she and her husband can afford to have a fourth child. \u201cI still have a child in childcare now \u2013 like daycare \u2013 and just seeing those costs rise year after year since 2020, it\u2019s been really hard for our family to consider having another baby,\u201d M said. \u201cThe possibility of that being alleviated through better economic policy or even just those costs being taken away somewhere else \u2013 whether it\u2019s groceries or utilities to whatever it is \u2013 that really makes it possible for us to consider having another kid.\u201d M, who opposes abortion, feels confident that she would be able to get adequate care if she had a miscarriage. (Since Roe v Wade fell, at least three women have died in Texas after doctors reportedly delayed treating them for miscarriages or gave them inadequate miscarriage care.) The climate crisis worries M less than making sure her kids have access to clean water and healthy, chemical-free food. Not everyone reconsidering having kids has totally ruled it out. N, a 26-year-old from New York, is for now only delaying her plans to have kids until after Trump leaves office. (She asked to go by her first initial because she previously had an abortion.) Ruth, who has a newborn at home and is married to an undocumented person, fears abortion bans and her husband being deported \u2013 but still wants to keep the conversation about having a second kid alive. \u201cWe want to be able to dream of having a family the way we want to, on our terms,\u201d said Ruth, who lives in Florida and asked to be identified by her middle name due to her husband\u2019s immigration status. \u201cMy husband being an immigrant \u2013 we feel that it shouldn\u2019t foreclose our options to build a family. We have just as much of a right to build a family on our terms as anyone else.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m going to get a glass of wine, will you have one?\u201d John Banville asks. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re OK, it\u2019s just about noon.\u201d We\u2019re sitting in Banville\u2019s upstairs living room in the harbour village of Howth, just outside Dublin. The low, deep house is in a terrace that rises up behind the seafront. There used to be a good view across the bay from these top windows, he says, but he had to sell the parcel of land across the street and now they are building \u201ca monstrosity\u201d on it. The novelist has lived here since the early 1980s; it is where he has written nearly all of his books \u2013 including the 2005 Booker prize winner <em>The Sea</em>. For someone who, it is said, has spent eight to 10 hours a day writing for all of his adult life, Banville insists he is no lover of solitude. \u201cYou\u2019re not really alone when you are writing,\u201d he says, \u201cand anyway there has always been a sense of someone else.\u201d</p> \n<p>These days he shares this house with his 51-year-old son. His sometime estranged wife, the textile artist Janet Dunham, died three years ago and he is still, he says, in a \u201cfugue state\u201d of grief. It didn\u2019t help that it happened during the pandemic. \u201cShe was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer,\u201d he says, \u201cand got Covid five days after, and died four days after that.\u201d He couldn\u2019t write for months and remains, he says, not himself. \u201cI now realise that there are only two kinds of people in the world. People who are bereaved and those who are yet to be bereaved,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no comfort really that you know it happens to every [couple]. Because those other people, they didn\u2019t lose the person you loved.\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the strangest things was that for about a year after Dunham died, he says, \u201cI threw something out every day. I don\u2019t know why, it was just every day I had to throw something out. And now I go round the house looking for things muttering \u2018where\u2019s that fucken thing?\u2019</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The partition took away that wonderful Protestant dissenter tradition and the 26 counties were left to the priests</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy my own company,\u201d he says. \u201cI always feel there\u2019s somebody missing. My wife used to say, \u2018I bet that you were a twin, and your twin died, and your mother didn\u2019t tell you.\u2019 And I do actually wonder if that is true.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the past month, Banville has been testing his capacity for solitude in Madrid, where he has been writer in residence at the Prado museum \u2013 the ostensible reason for our interview. In many ways, he was the perfect choice for the gig. His writing \u2013 particularly the breakthrough trilogy that began with <em>The Book of Evidence</em> in 1989 \u2013 has always been intrigued by the lives of artists; his first ambition was to be a painter himself.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the fourth writer to be asked by the Prado,\u201d he says, \u201cJM Coetzee was first. I had an apartment about three minutes away, all sponsored by the <a href=\"https://www.loewe.com/eur/en/stories-projects/writing-the-prado.html\">Loewe Foundation</a>. And all I had to do was one public event and then write a piece of fiction, 7,000 words.\u201d He was reminded of a magazine assignment he once did, staying alone in Gianni Versace\u2019s house in Miami, after the designer had been murdered. \u201cI kept, you know, expecting to be presented with the bill\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>He knew the museum well but the opportunity to visit paintings such as Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s masterpiece <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/03/velazquez-vanishing-man-laura-cumming-john-snare\">Las Meninas</a></em> after hours or before the museum opened seemed like a special gift. In the event, he says, he got very spooked in the gallery without crowds. \u201cI\u2019d go to see <em>Las Meninas</em> and it was very eerie to be there alone, you know, with Vel\u00e1zquez looking back at you from behind his canvas saying: \u2018Look what I did. What are you going to do?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>And does he know what he is going to write in his fictional response?</p> \n<p>\u201cI have a broad outline that somebody is in the Prado doing something like me, but he\u2019s troubled, he doesn\u2019t like the fact that the eyes of the paintings keep following him, and he begins to wonder if he is having a breakdown. There\u2019s a painting by Rubens called <em><a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-garden-of-love/8c9e39be-c70c-403a-a386-e7609e7af236\">The Garden of Love</a></em> there, in which there are two almost identical women. They\u2019re looking at him and I think they come to help him. Something like that.\u201d He smiles. \u201cYou know, I make it up as I go.\u201d</p> \n<p>At 78, Banville has been making things up for longer than he can remember. He grew up in Wexford in south-east Ireland where his father worked in a garage. Writing seems to have been curiously ingrained in the family \u2013 both his elder brother and sister have published books. Where did that shared impulse come from?</p> \n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cmy father\u2019s side of the family were all fantasists.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the sense of being good storytellers?</p> \n<p>\u201cNo, all just slightly mad. I remember my aunt, my father\u2019s twin. She used to claim that her relative had been the lady-in-waiting for Queen Mary. And she\u2019d tell us that when Queen Mary died, her coffin was on a barge going down the Thames, and it went under a bridge and when it came out the other side it was covered all over in white lilies. She\u2019d tell these stories and my mother would look at me and I would look at her. It was all like that. I guess I must have got that gene. At least three times a week I look up at my desk and I say to myself: \u2018What on earth do you think you are doing?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>How does he answer that question?</p> \n<p>\u201cOh I don\u2019t. I just get back to work.\u201d The compulsion began, he says, when his sister, who was four years older, gave him a copy of James Joyce\u2019s <em>Dubliners</em> when he was 12. \u201cHere was a book that was not a wild west yarn. Not a detective story. Not about boys in English public schools getting up to japes. It was just about life. I immediately started writing hideous imitations. It\u2019s a cliche, but the Irish are just in love with words. And we have to be very careful, because, you know, words are&nbsp;intoxicating.\u201d</p> \n<p>He reaches for his glass, and pops downstairs to fetch the bottle.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p> I thought when I was this age, I\u2019d have nothing but time. But I find you\u2019re running around like a blue-arsed fly</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>When he returns we talk a little about the connections between Ireland and Spain. Banville first went to the Prado in the early 1960s when Madrid was still Franco\u2019s capital. \u201cIn some ways it was a very dark place, police everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut of course, you know, for me, coming from my grey corner of Ireland, the colour, the heat, the food, the wine were just incredible. I was telling them in Spain last month that when I was a little boy, every house in Ireland had a small bottle of olive oil, but it was never in the kitchen. You would heat a teaspoon of it soaked in cotton wool and stick it in your ears.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both societies back then obviously lived in the shadow of the Catholic church, but Banville believes it was more oppressive in his home country.</p> \n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d he says, \u201cwe were entirely brainwashed. We were so poor, you know, poor economically, and poor in spirit. I\u2019m just reading a book about the great famine in the 1840s. The English did what all great powers do. They reduced the people to serfdom, and then made fun of them for being serfs. We lived a long time with that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Within the fierce internecine rivalries of Irish writing, Banville has sometimes been characterised, he has suggested, as a \u201cwest Brit\u201d, too anglophile in his sensibility. His early historical novels \u2013 though often about revolutionaries such as Kepler or Copernicus \u2013 refused to engage directly in the politics of the Troubles. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d he says, \u201cI haven\u2019t got an atom of nationalism in my makeup anywhere. I don\u2019t understand allegiance to a country.\u201d</p> \n<p>He has a typically contrarian view of Irish history. \u201cThe war of independence and the civil war were disastrous for us,\u201d he says. \u201cThe bad people took over. The partition took away that Protestant dissenter tradition and the 26 counties were left to the priests. I remember as a little boy walking along Main Street in Wexford. A long, long pavement, and a priest coming towards me in all his splendour. Between us was a pregnant woman struggling with a pram and a toddler, and I watched as she got off the pavement to let the priest stride past. I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\u201d</p> \n<p>I say to him that I remember the writer Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn once suggesting to me that the abrupt loss of the confessional in Ireland, which followed the abandonment of the church among younger generations, helps to explain the boom in Irish fiction: secrets needed an outlet.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice theory,\u201d Banville says. \u201cBut maybe it\u2019s the other way around. We were storytellers and that\u2019s why we took to the confessional.\u201d</p> \n<p>Did he have to go when he was a kid?</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah, I hated it. I mean, you were shut in this box each week with an elderly man breathing hard. And it was all lies. My mother was very devout. She went to confession once and told the priest that she read <em>Woman\u2019s Own</em> magazine, you know, recipes for plum pudding, and stories about the Queen\u2019s corgis. \u2018Cross-channel literature!\u2019 the priest told her, \u2018Stop that at once!\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Banville has come a long way since Wexford, without ever quite losing that sense of being an outsider, of not always being given his due for a body of work to rival any writer in Europe. When he won the Booker prize there was a bit of controversy because he had given a withering review in the <em>New York Review of Books</em> to another of that year\u2019s potential winners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/22/bookerprize2005.bookerprize\">Ian McEwan\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/22/bookerprize2005.bookerprize\">Saturday</a></em>. Banville wound up any detractors further by suggesting in his acceptance speech, with a twinkle, that \u201cart had won\u201d. He received something of a comeuppance, those detractors might have said, when in 2019 he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/12/dont-buy-the-champagne-booker-prize-winner-targeted-by-phone-hoax\">was hoaxed by a call</a> purporting to be from the Swedish Academy informing him he had won the Nobel prize. By the time he found out the truth, Banville had been ringing around friends and rivals. He had to make a second series of calls: \u201cDon\u2019t buy the champagne, stop throwing your hats in the air.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Which of my books disgust me least? I suppose The Infinities and The Singularities. I came as close as I\u2019ll get in those books</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A couple of times as we talk he bemoans the fact that he has never been a fixture on bestseller lists at home. There are compensations. He has been variously honoured on the continent; at the end of his time in Madrid he was invited to stay for a weekend with King Felipe VI, who has been a friend since Banville won Spain\u2019s prestigious Asturias prize in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he says, \u201cI have a bigger reputation in Spain than I have in Ireland; people there sometimes stop me in the street. Or they say to my publisher: \u2018How did you persuade the famously reclusive Banville to come over?\u2019\u201d The publisher, he says, obviously replies: \u2018Banville? Give him a free flight and a glass of wine and he\u2019ll go anywhere.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking of which, he says, \u201cshall we have another little one, and then we might go down to the harbour and get a bit of lunch\u201d.</p> \n<p>On the walk down to the seafront, we compare notes about our respective newspapers. Banville was first a subeditor (\u201cchanging other people\u2019s words and coming home in the dark\u201d as it was once described to him by a reporter) and then, for many years, literary editor of the <em>Irish Times</em>. He was made redundant from the paper in the millennium year.</p> \n<p>What, I wonder, can they have been thinking of, in getting rid of him?</p> \n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI had been books editor for a decade or so, and the editor called me in one day and said I\u2019ll give you a good deal: keep the same money and write for us instead. I had a wonderful time for about 18 months. And then I got called in again.\u201d It\u2019s always the same with newspapers, he suggests: the folk who can\u2019t write are \u201calways waiting to put the hatchet in\u201d.</p> \n<p>This harbour area has changed dramatically since he first moved here. He would bring his two sons down in their double buggy. \u201cWe\u2019d watch fishermen in wooden clogs filling barrels of salted herring, like something out of Brueghel,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen all the boats were in harbour during a storm they used to say you could walk from one side to the other, on the boats.\u201d That is all gone now \u2013 \u201cwe got the common agricultural policy instead\u201d \u2013 and the harbourfront has become the site of commuters\u2019 apartment buildings and cafes.</p> \n<p>Banville doesn\u2019t really eat lunch \u2013 bread and olives and a couple of glasses of wine. We talk about his most recent big novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/04/the-singularities-by-john-banville-review-theoretical-physics-meets-playful-storytelling\">The Singularities</a></em>, which was published in 2022, and which involved, in a typical conceit, the characters from many of his previous novels meeting in a country house, a device enabled by an ongoing meditation on the possibilities of theoretical physics \u2013 from all of which tricksiness he managed to conjure a fabulous yarn. That book ended with the words \u201ca last stab, to mark a full, an infinitely full, stop\u201d. At the time, with that Beckett-like finale, he said he would write no more \u201cserious\u201d books and would concentrate instead on his enjoyable side hustle in crime fiction. Does he still feel that way?</p> \n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m writing something else, a memoir, at the moment. It\u2019s a pack of lies,\u201d he says, with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s called <em>Out of True</em>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Has he had that title up his sleeve for a while?</p> \n<p>\u201cA friend of mine suggested it. It\u2019s perfect because everything is slightly wrong. The truth is I had two ideas for books: one was this autobiography, and the other an idea to write a book about the last man. You know: a pandemic, a bomb, whatever, it\u2019s killed everybody, and there is one survivor and it just happens to be me. I thought at my age I wouldn\u2019t get the two books done, so I combined them. The last man is now writing his autobiography. But of course it turns out he\u2019s not the last \u2013 there\u2019s a woman too. So they sort of stalk each&nbsp;other\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>How far into it is he?</p> \n<p>Oh, only just 8,000 words. I thought when I was this age, I\u2019d have nothing but time. But I find you\u2019re running around like a blue-arsed fly. And I can only manage to write from about 10 until two. The question arises: what do you do then? One thing is you have to avoid the drink.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We had a lunch, 13 civilised men in a room. I remember thinking, this room of only men is my idea of hell, if this just went on for all eternity</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We reach for our wine glasses. It would be fair to say that Banville\u2019s memoir will not be without the complications of love. He and his late wife, with whom he had two sons, stayed close after the breakdown in their marriage following the revelation in the papers of Banville\u2019s longstanding relationship with another woman, the mother of his two adult daughters. Despite reports that he and Dunham had separated, he insists that they were reconciled. \u201cI had two relationships and I eventually had to choose one,\u201d he says now.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I was in the midst of this my wife used to say to me: \u2018This is one of your best plots ever \u2013 I hope you are enjoying it, you bastard.\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cMy trouble always was,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I really like women. I remember I was at the university in Lyon, years ago, doing a talk. We had a lunch afterwards, 13 civilised French men in a room. I remember thinking, this room of only men is my idea of hell, if this just went on for all eternity.\u201d</p> \n<p>He warms to the theme. \u201cThe only woman that I\u2019ve ever known who I don\u2019t see any more is a girl that I fell in love with when I was 11. Her family used to come from Liverpool, to the seaside where my family took our holidays. She and I fell in love at 11. We\u2019d see each other for four weeks every year and write to each other in between. I made the mistake of going and staying with her the Christmas I turned 17. She broke up with me on Christmas Eve. I\u2019d just bought my first copy of <em>Ulysses</em> and it still has these little blisters of tears on the opening page.\u201d</p> \n<p>For a profoundly cerebral writer, Banville is in thrall to the romance of his vocation. He was part of a male literary generation in the 1980s and 90s that enjoyed its perceived glamour.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says of that time, \u201cwhen Martin Amis and I met first, I was books editor at the <em>Times</em> and we had lunch in Notting Hill. We did some small talk for about 10 minutes. And then I said: \u2018Look, Martin, let\u2019s put our cards on the table. If you win a prize I will really hate you. And if I win a prize \u2013 you will hate me. If you get a half-page glowing review in the <em>Sunday Times</em> then I\u2019ll really loathe you.\u2019 He said yes, fair enough, and we shook on it. Friends for life.\u201d</p> \n<p>It must give him a sense of satisfaction when he looks back on the books he\u2019s written, the shelves filled with&nbsp;work?</p> \n<p>\u201cUp to recently,\u201d he says, \u201cI felt nothing but embarrassment at all these failures. But in the last year or two, especially when I\u2019ve have had a drink, if I come across one of my sentences, I might think: that\u2019s not half bad. But I never go beyond that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Which books is he most proud of?</p> \n<p>\u201cYou mean which ones disgust me least?\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose <em>The Infinities</em> and <em>The Singularities</em>. I came as close as I\u2019ll get in those books. And the next one of course. As Iris Murdoch used to say: \u2018This one will exonerate me for all the ones that went&nbsp;before.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b32b7427-313d-4228-b71a-56f725a9a292\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>\u2022 Doctor Copernicus</i> (1976), that year\u2019s winner of the James Tait Black memorial prize, is an imagined life of the great astronomer.

The story was very loosely inspired by the notorious case of double-murderer Malcolm Edward Macarthur.

The setting was based on Banville\u2019s own childhood memories of holidays at Rosslare. It was made into a <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/film/2014/apr/20/the-sea-review-john-banville-booker-adaptation\">film in 2013</a> starring Ciar\u00e1n Hinds and Sin\u00e9ad Cusack.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>\u2022 Snow</i> (2020) is perhaps the most successful of the series of crime novels originally written under the nom de plume Benjamin Black, featuring the Dublin pathologist Garret Quirke and a young detective called St John Stafford. Banville began writing the books after being inspired by Georges Simenon (whom he thinks of as \u201cone of the great writers of the 20th century\u201d).

It was a black night in January. I got home about half past four in the morning. Janet had been asleep for hours and the house was in total darkness, so I didn\u2019t turn any lights on. I just got undressed and crept into bed beside her, this lovely, warm body. And she turned over and things got amorous, as they do. Given the circumstances, it was quite quick and quiet, you know.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m going to get a glass of wine, will you have one?\u201d John Banville asks. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re OK, it\u2019s just about noon.\u201d We\u2019re sitting in Banville\u2019s upstairs living room in the harbour village of Howth, just outside Dublin. The low, deep house is in a terrace that rises up behind the seafront. There used to be a good view across the bay from these top windows, he says, but he had to sell the parcel of land across the street and now they are building \u201ca monstrosity\u201d on it. The novelist has lived here since the early 1980s; it is where he has written nearly all of his books \u2013 including the 2005 Booker prize winner The Sea. For someone who, it is said, has spent eight to 10 hours a day writing for all of his adult life, Banville insists he is no lover of solitude. \u201cYou\u2019re not really alone when you are writing,\u201d he says, \u201cand anyway there has always been a sense of someone else.\u201d These days he shares this house with his 51-year-old son. His sometime estranged wife, the textile artist Janet Dunham, died three years ago and he is still, he says, in a \u201cfugue state\u201d of grief. It didn\u2019t help that it happened during the pandemic. \u201cShe was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer,\u201d he says, \u201cand got Covid five days after, and died four days after that.\u201d He couldn\u2019t write for months and remains, he says, not himself. \u201cI now realise that there are only two kinds of people in the world. People who are bereaved and those who are yet to be bereaved,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no comfort really that you know it happens to every [couple]. Because those other people, they didn\u2019t lose the person you loved.\u201d One of the strangest things was that for about a year after Dunham died, he says, \u201cI threw something out every day. I don\u2019t know why, it was just every day I had to throw something out. And now I go round the house looking for things muttering \u2018where\u2019s that fucken thing?\u2019 \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy my own company,\u201d he says. \u201cI always feel there\u2019s somebody missing. My wife used to say, \u2018I bet that you were a twin, and your twin died, and your mother didn\u2019t tell you.\u2019 And I do actually wonder if that is true.\u201d For the past month, Banville has been testing his capacity for solitude in Madrid, where he has been writer in residence at the Prado museum \u2013 the ostensible reason for our interview. In many ways, he was the perfect choice for the gig. His writing \u2013 particularly the breakthrough trilogy that began with The Book of Evidence in 1989 \u2013 has always been intrigued by the lives of artists; his first ambition was to be a painter himself. \u201cI\u2019m the fourth writer to be asked by the Prado,\u201d he says, \u201cJM Coetzee was first. I had an apartment about three minutes away, all sponsored by the Loewe Foundation. And all I had to do was one public event and then write a piece of fiction, 7,000 words.\u201d He was reminded of a magazine assignment he once did, staying alone in Gianni Versace\u2019s house in Miami, after the designer had been murdered. \u201cI kept, you know, expecting to be presented with the bill\u2026\u201d He knew the museum well but the opportunity to visit paintings such as Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s masterpiece Las Meninas after hours or before the museum opened seemed like a special gift. In the event, he says, he got very spooked in the gallery without crowds. \u201cI\u2019d go to see Las Meninas and it was very eerie to be there alone, you know, with Vel\u00e1zquez looking back at you from behind his canvas saying: \u2018Look what I did. What are you going to do?\u2019\u201d And does he know what he is going to write in his fictional response? \u201cI have a broad outline that somebody is in the Prado doing something like me, but he\u2019s troubled, he doesn\u2019t like the fact that the eyes of the paintings keep following him, and he begins to wonder if he is having a breakdown. There\u2019s a painting by Rubens called The Garden of Love there, in which there are two almost identical women. They\u2019re looking at him and I think they come to help him. Something like that.\u201d He smiles. \u201cYou know, I make it up as I go.\u201d At 78, Banville has been making things up for longer than he can remember. He grew up in Wexford in south-east Ireland where his father worked in a garage. Writing seems to have been curiously ingrained in the family \u2013 both his elder brother and sister have published books. Where did that shared impulse come from? \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cmy father\u2019s side of the family were all fantasists.\u201d In the sense of being good storytellers? \u201cNo, all just slightly mad. I remember my aunt, my father\u2019s twin. She used to claim that her relative had been the lady-in-waiting for Queen Mary. And she\u2019d tell us that when Queen Mary died, her coffin was on a barge going down the Thames, and it went under a bridge and when it came out the other side it was covered all over in white lilies. She\u2019d tell these stories and my mother would look at me and I would look at her. It was all like that. I guess I must have got that gene. At least three times a week I look up at my desk and I say to myself: \u2018What on earth do you think you are doing?\u2019\u201d How does he answer that question? \u201cOh I don\u2019t. I just get back to work.\u201d The compulsion began, he says, when his sister, who was four years older, gave him a copy of James Joyce\u2019s Dubliners when he was 12. \u201cHere was a book that was not a wild west yarn. Not a detective story. Not about boys in English public schools getting up to japes. It was just about life. I immediately started writing hideous imitations. It\u2019s a cliche, but the Irish are just in love with words. And we have to be very careful, because, you know, words are intoxicating.\u201d He reaches for his glass, and pops downstairs to fetch the bottle. When he returns we talk a little about the connections between Ireland and Spain. Banville first went to the Prado in the early 1960s when Madrid was still Franco\u2019s capital. \u201cIn some ways it was a very dark place, police everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut of course, you know, for me, coming from my grey corner of Ireland, the colour, the heat, the food, the wine were just incredible. I was telling them in Spain last month that when I was a little boy, every house in Ireland had a small bottle of olive oil, but it was never in the kitchen. You would heat a teaspoon of it soaked in cotton wool and stick it in your ears.\u201d Both societies back then obviously lived in the shadow of the Catholic church, but Banville believes it was more oppressive in his home country. \u201cHere,\u201d he says, \u201cwe were entirely brainwashed. We were so poor, you know, poor economically, and poor in spirit. I\u2019m just reading a book about the great famine in the 1840s. The English did what all great powers do. They reduced the people to serfdom, and then made fun of them for being serfs. We lived a long time with that.\u201d Within the fierce internecine rivalries of Irish writing, Banville has sometimes been characterised, he has suggested, as a \u201cwest Brit\u201d, too anglophile in his sensibility. His early historical novels \u2013 though often about revolutionaries such as Kepler or Copernicus \u2013 refused to engage directly in the politics of the Troubles. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d he says, \u201cI haven\u2019t got an atom of nationalism in my makeup anywhere. I don\u2019t understand allegiance to a country.\u201d He has a typically contrarian view of Irish history. \u201cThe war of independence and the civil war were disastrous for us,\u201d he says. \u201cThe bad people took over. The partition took away that Protestant dissenter tradition and the 26 counties were left to the priests. I remember as a little boy walking along Main Street in Wexford. A long, long pavement, and a priest coming towards me in all his splendour. Between us was a pregnant woman struggling with a pram and a toddler, and I watched as she got off the pavement to let the priest stride past. I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\u201d I say to him that I remember the writer Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn once suggesting to me that the abrupt loss of the confessional in Ireland, which followed the abandonment of the church among younger generations, helps to explain the boom in Irish fiction: secrets needed an outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice theory,\u201d Banville says. \u201cBut maybe it\u2019s the other way around. We were storytellers and that\u2019s why we took to the confessional.\u201d Did he have to go when he was a kid? \u201cYeah, I hated it. I mean, you were shut in this box each week with an elderly man breathing hard. And it was all lies. My mother was very devout. She went to confession once and told the priest that she read Woman\u2019s Own magazine, you know, recipes for plum pudding, and stories about the Queen\u2019s corgis. \u2018Cross-channel literature!\u2019 the priest told her, \u2018Stop that at once!\u2019\u201d Banville has come a long way since Wexford, without ever quite losing that sense of being an outsider, of not always being given his due for a body of work to rival any writer in Europe. When he won the Booker prize there was a bit of controversy because he had given a withering review in the New York Review of Books to another of that year\u2019s potential winners, Ian McEwan\u2019s Saturday. Banville wound up any detractors further by suggesting in his acceptance speech, with a twinkle, that \u201cart had won\u201d. He received something of a comeuppance, those detractors might have said, when in 2019 he was hoaxed by a call purporting to be from the Swedish Academy informing him he had won the Nobel prize. By the time he found out the truth, Banville had been ringing around friends and rivals. He had to make a second series of calls: \u201cDon\u2019t buy the champagne, stop throwing your hats in the air.\u201d A couple of times as we talk he bemoans the fact that he has never been a fixture on bestseller lists at home. There are compensations. He has been variously honoured on the continent; at the end of his time in Madrid he was invited to stay for a weekend with King Felipe VI, who has been a friend since Banville won Spain\u2019s prestigious Asturias prize in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he says, \u201cI have a bigger reputation in Spain than I have in Ireland; people there sometimes stop me in the street. Or they say to my publisher: \u2018How did you persuade the famously reclusive Banville to come over?\u2019\u201d The publisher, he says, obviously replies: \u2018Banville? Give him a free flight and a glass of wine and he\u2019ll go anywhere.\u2019\u201d Speaking of which, he says, \u201cshall we have another little one, and then we might go down to the harbour and get a bit of lunch\u201d. On the walk down to the seafront, we compare notes about our respective newspapers. Banville was first a subeditor (\u201cchanging other people\u2019s words and coming home in the dark\u201d as it was once described to him by a reporter) and then, for many years, literary editor of the Irish Times. He was made redundant from the paper in the millennium year. What, I wonder, can they have been thinking of, in getting rid of him? \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI had been books editor for a decade or so, and the editor called me in one day and said I\u2019ll give you a good deal: keep the same money and write for us instead. I had a wonderful time for about 18 months. And then I got called in again.\u201d It\u2019s always the same with newspapers, he suggests: the folk who can\u2019t write are \u201calways waiting to put the hatchet in\u201d. This harbour area has changed dramatically since he first moved here. He would bring his two sons down in their double buggy. \u201cWe\u2019d watch fishermen in wooden clogs filling barrels of salted herring, like something out of Brueghel,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen all the boats were in harbour during a storm they used to say you could walk from one side to the other, on the boats.\u201d That is all gone now \u2013 \u201cwe got the common agricultural policy instead\u201d \u2013 and the harbourfront has become the site of commuters\u2019 apartment buildings and cafes. Banville doesn\u2019t really eat lunch \u2013 bread and olives and a couple of glasses of wine. We talk about his most recent big novel, The Singularities, which was published in 2022, and which involved, in a typical conceit, the characters from many of his previous novels meeting in a country house, a device enabled by an ongoing meditation on the possibilities of theoretical physics \u2013 from all of which tricksiness he managed to conjure a fabulous yarn. That book ended with the words \u201ca last stab, to mark a full, an infinitely full, stop\u201d. At the time, with that Beckett-like finale, he said he would write no more \u201cserious\u201d books and would concentrate instead on his enjoyable side hustle in crime fiction. Does he still feel that way? \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m writing something else, a memoir, at the moment. It\u2019s a pack of lies,\u201d he says, with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s called Out of True.\u201d Has he had that title up his sleeve for a while? \u201cA friend of mine suggested it. It\u2019s perfect because everything is slightly wrong. The truth is I had two ideas for books: one was this autobiography, and the other an idea to write a book about the last man. You know: a pandemic, a bomb, whatever, it\u2019s killed everybody, and there is one survivor and it just happens to be me. I thought at my age I wouldn\u2019t get the two books done, so I combined them. The last man is now writing his autobiography. But of course it turns out he\u2019s not the last \u2013 there\u2019s a woman too. So they sort of stalk each other\u2026\u201d How far into it is he? Oh, only just 8,000 words. I thought when I was this age, I\u2019d have nothing but time. But I find you\u2019re running around like a blue-arsed fly. And I can only manage to write from about 10 until two. The question arises: what do you do then? One thing is you have to avoid the drink.\u201d We reach for our wine glasses. It would be fair to say that Banville\u2019s memoir will not be without the complications of love. He and his late wife, with whom he had two sons, stayed close after the breakdown in their marriage following the revelation in the papers of Banville\u2019s longstanding relationship with another woman, the mother of his two adult daughters. Despite reports that he and Dunham had separated, he insists that they were reconciled. \u201cI had two relationships and I eventually had to choose one,\u201d he says now. \u201cWhen I was in the midst of this my wife used to say to me: \u2018This is one of your best plots ever \u2013 I hope you are enjoying it, you bastard.\u2019 \u201cMy trouble always was,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I really like women. I remember I was at the university in Lyon, years ago, doing a talk. We had a lunch afterwards, 13 civilised French men in a room. I remember thinking, this room of only men is my idea of hell, if this just went on for all eternity.\u201d He warms to the theme. \u201cThe only woman that I\u2019ve ever known who I don\u2019t see any more is a girl that I fell in love with when I was 11. Her family used to come from Liverpool, to the seaside where my family took our holidays. She and I fell in love at 11. We\u2019d see each other for four weeks every year and write to each other in between. I made the mistake of going and staying with her the Christmas I turned 17. She broke up with me on Christmas Eve. I\u2019d just bought my first copy of Ulysses and it still has these little blisters of tears on the opening page.\u201d For a profoundly cerebral writer, Banville is in thrall to the romance of his vocation. He was part of a male literary generation in the 1980s and 90s that enjoyed its perceived glamour. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says of that time, \u201cwhen Martin Amis and I met first, I was books editor at the Times and we had lunch in Notting Hill. We did some small talk for about 10 minutes. And then I said: \u2018Look, Martin, let\u2019s put our cards on the table. If you win a prize I will really hate you. And if I win a prize \u2013 you will hate me. If you get a half-page glowing review in the Sunday Times then I\u2019ll really loathe you.\u2019 He said yes, fair enough, and we shook on it. Friends for life.\u201d It must give him a sense of satisfaction when he looks back on the books he\u2019s written, the shelves filled with work? \u201cUp to recently,\u201d he says, \u201cI felt nothing but embarrassment at all these failures. But in the last year or two, especially when I\u2019ve have had a drink, if I come across one of my sentences, I might think: that\u2019s not half bad. But I never go beyond that.\u201d Which books is he most proud of? \u201cYou mean which ones disgust me least?\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose The Infinities and The Singularities. I came as close as I\u2019ll get in those books. And the next one of course. As Iris Murdoch used to say: \u2018This one will exonerate me for all the ones that went before.\u2019\u201d We look out to the harbour. Does he still love embarking on these new voyages of self-discovery? \u201cI used to say to my wife at the start of a book: \u2018You know, it seems to be going really well.\u2019 And she\u2019d look at me and say: \u2018I know, and a year and a half from now, you\u2019ll be in tears on the ground.\u2019\u201d He laughs at the memory. \u201cShe was always brilliant at taking the wind out of my sails. I\u2019ll tell you one last story,\u201d he says, and leans forward. \u201cIn the early 70s,\u201d he says, \u201cwe lived right at the top of the hill over there and I was on the late shift at the paper. It was a black night in January. I got home about half past four in the morning. Janet had been asleep for hours and the house was in total darkness, so I didn\u2019t turn any lights on. I just got undressed and crept into bed beside her, this lovely, warm body. And she turned over and things got amorous, as they do. Given the circumstances, it was quite quick and quiet, you know. And afterwards there was a bit of a pause, and then, with her superb sense of comic timing, my wife said: \u2018John, is that you?\u2019\u201d Writing the Prado is a joint initiative between the Prado, the Loewe Foundation and Granta",

That is unprecedented.\u201d</p> <p>Levin suggested that Trump could order Bead funding to be withheld indefinitely as soon as he takes office, even though Congress has authorized the funding.</p> <p>Doing so would violate the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, a law Trump fell afoul of in his first term that ultimately resulted in one impeachment. But Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who will co-lead the commission to reduce the size of the federal government, argued in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020?mod=trending_now_opn_3\">Wall Street Journal editorial</a> last week that Trump should pursue impoundment when he deems it necessary.</p> <p>\u201cMr Trump has previously suggested this statute is unconstitutional, and we believe the current supreme court would likely side with him on this question,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>Any move like this would tie the program in legal knots as lawsuits abound, Levin said. But the delay is the point. \u201cWhile states and others could file legal actions to stop such a pause, we think most courts would be reluctant to enjoin or otherwise stop the administration from reconsidering some elements of the program. Even actions of dubious legality can benefit Starlink through delay or through litigation.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Musk had set his sights on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) long before Trump\u2019s victory. The NTIA administers federal grant funding for the Bead program.</p> <p>Without a government subsidy, rolling fiber optic lines down country roads to serve a handful of houses at a time is usually too cost-prohibitive for an internet service provider. But to companies like AT&amp;T or Verizon, a government subsidy to a local internet service provider also looks like the government funding the competition.</p> <p>Big telecom companies and the FCC argued long and loud about what parts of the country had access to high-speed service, and thus didn\u2019t need government money. But the definition of \u201chigh speed\u201d used by industry and the government was often slow by many standards.</p> <p>After years of negotiation, lawsuits and politicking, the FCC and the NTIA settled on a modern definition for broadband service: 100 megabits per second (Mbps) download speeds, 20Mbps upload speeds, with less than 100 milliseconds of latency.</p> <p>Right now, Starlink <a href=\"https://www.ookla.com/articles/us-satellite-performance-q3-2023\">doesn\u2019t meet that standard</a>. It has been getting slightly slower over time even as more people sign up for service, according to internet performance testing service Ookla\u2019s speed tests. In 2022, the FCC rescinded a $900m grant from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to Starlink to connect rural communities to the internet, <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-23-105A1_Rcd.pdf\">citing</a> its failure to meet the speed and latency standards and declining network performance.</p>    <p>Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1734715088529953103\">erupted</a> on an X post.</p> <p>\u201cStarlink is the only company actually solving rural broadband at scale! They should arguably dissolve the program and return funds to taxpayers, but definitely not send it those who aren\u2019t getting the job done,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201dWhat actually happened is that the companies that lobbied for this massive earmark (not us) thought they would win, but instead were outperformed by Starlink, so now they\u2019re changing the rules to prevent SpaceX from competing.\u201d</p> <p>In June, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1803453396382580982\">described</a> the Bead program, which began rolling out grants to states this year, as \u201can outrageous waste of taxpayer money and is utterly failing to serve people in need\u201d.</p> <p>A month later, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1812256998588662068?lang=en\">endorsed</a> Trump and began a $100m spending campaign in support of his candidacy.</p> <p>After Musk started to gain Trump\u2019s ear \u2013 and particularly after Musk\u2019s endorsement and Starlink\u2019s deployment of satellite terminals to areas hit by Hurricane Helene, which Trump praised regularly on the campaign trail \u2013 Trump\u2019s language about rural broadband began to shift in Musk\u2019s direction.</p> <p>Trump described Starlink as \u201cbetter than the wires\u201d, when talking with Joe Rogan in the much-watched podcast interview. \u201cWe\u2019re spending a trillion dollars to get cables all over the country, right, up to upstate areas where you have like two farms \u2026 They haven\u2019t hooked up one person.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last year, the FCC commissioner \u2013 and Trump\u2019s newly named FCC chair \u2013 Brendan Carr has also echoed Musk\u2019s position, arguing that the public might be better off by subsidizing the cost of Starlink terminals instead of fiber optic broadband.</p> <p>After Trump\u2019s election, Carr said the FCC is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/incoming-fcc-chair-says-unlikely-commission-could-reinstate-starlink-subsidy-2024-11-21/\">unlikely to revisit</a> its rescission of Starlink\u2019s grant, citing procedural hurdles. But Carr, who <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-28.pdf\">authored the FCC chapter of Project 2025</a>, has suggested that as much as a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/18/elon-musk-brendan-carr-fcc-starlink-00184260\">third of Bead funding</a> could go to satellite internet providers.</p> <p>Republican senators have also been agitating for changes to the Bead program. Senator Ted Cruz, poised to take over the Senate committee overseeing telecommunications, sent a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/C32B6A16-3088-437E-A227-6F72650A081C\">letter</a> last week lambasting the NTIA administrator, Alan Davidson, for alleged waste and administrative bloat in the Bead program.</p> <p>\u201cFortunately, as president-elect Trump has already signaled, substantial changes are on the horizon for this program,\u201d Cruz wrote. \u201cCongress will review the Bead program early next year, with specific attention to NTIA\u2019s extreme technology bias in defining \u2018priority broadband projects\u2019 and \u2018reliable broadband service\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa sent Musk and Ramaswamy a <a href=\"https://www.ernst.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/doge_trillion_dollar_blue_print_letter_-_elon_vivek.pdf\">letter</a> on Tuesday with a roadmap for cost-cutting. The Bead program was on her target list.</p> <p>Davidson responded to earlier inquiries by Cruz, noting that the NTIA \u201chas obligated over $28bn to states and territories, all of whom also received planning grants through the program\u201d.</p> <p>The program \u201calso creates room for all strategies, and the NTIA expects states and territories will use a mix of technologies to connect their unserved and underserved locations\u201d, Davidson wrote.</p> <p>The NTIA announced earlier this year that Starlink could qualify for some Bead funding for services in extremely remote locations. In areas without broadband service from a landline operator, Starlink is often the only option. Project Kuiper by Amazon is also a low-Earth-orbit satellite internet service, which Amazon says will begin consumer offerings next year. </p> <p>***</p> <p>SpaceX and its Starlink subsidiary are private companies that do not regularly disclose their finances. But analysts have argued that, until recently, Starlink had been losing money despite the success of SpaceX.</p> <p>That has changed over the last year as Starlink\u2019s 6,000-plus low-Earth satellite network has come online and courted business in developing countries. Analysts from Quilty, a space industry intelligence firm, suggest that Starlink\u2019s revenue has exploded, from $1.4bn in 2022 to $6.6bn in 2024.</p> <p>SpaceX and Tesla have about $15.4bn in government contracts, according to a recent New York Times analysis. Starlink is also competing with 15 other companies for US space force contracts worth nearly $1bn.</p> <p>Starlink did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p> <p>Despite the obvious interest in government contracts, Musk and biotech entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Ramaswamy\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d will be tasked with reducing the federal government headcount and cutting costs, which could include the Bead program.</p> <p>\u201cStarlink and Bead are seeking to provide broadband to the same population: those living in low-density America,\u201d Levin said. \u201cWhile Starlink already has a network that covers the entire country, spectrum constraints and its relative functionalities compared to wired broadband service providers mean that the primary market for Starlink is in low-density America.\u201d</p> <p>Starlink benefits from any delay in Bead funding, Levin said. \u201cEvery day Starlink is signing up customers in low-density America. Today, those in unserved and underserved locations likely believe that if they want a baseline broadband service, they have no choice but to subscribe to the Starlink service. The longer it takes for an alternative provider to come online with a similar or better service, the better it is for Starlink, as its sales process benefits from the current lack of broadband alternatives.\u201d</p> <p>Reallocating funding from fiber to satellite would put money in Starlink\u2019s pocket at the direct expense of terrestrial competitors.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there are other technology options for high-speed connectivity, the most reliable, efficient and future-proof solution is fiber optic technology to the home or business,\u201d said Tom Dailey, head of regulatory and government affairs at Brightspeed, an internet service provider competing for Bead funds.</p> <p>\u201cSatellite broadband is a costly option that does not provide the same level of reliability or speed that fiber optic technology provides \u2026 We don\u2019t anticipate that the Bead program will be eliminated. In fact, we believe it will continue and there is strong bias for fiber technology as the main means of connectivity given its superior speed and bandwidth capabilities.\u201d</p>",

After years of negotiation, lawsuits and politicking, the FCC and the NTIA settled on a modern definition for broadband service: 100 megabits per second (Mbps) download speeds, 20Mbps upload speeds, with less than 100 milliseconds of latency. Right now, Starlink doesn\u2019t meet that standard. It has been getting slightly slower over time even as more people sign up for service, according to internet performance testing service Ookla\u2019s speed tests. In 2022, the FCC rescinded a $900m grant from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to Starlink to connect rural communities to the internet, citing its failure to meet the speed and latency standards and declining network performance. Musk erupted on an X post. \u201cStarlink is the only company actually solving rural broadband at scale! They should arguably dissolve the program and return funds to taxpayers, but definitely not send it those who aren\u2019t getting the job done,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201dWhat actually happened is that the companies that lobbied for this massive earmark (not us) thought they would win, but instead were outperformed by Starlink, so now they\u2019re changing the rules to prevent SpaceX from competing.\u201d In June, Musk described the Bead program, which began rolling out grants to states this year, as \u201can outrageous waste of taxpayer money and is utterly failing to serve people in need\u201d. A month later, Musk endorsed Trump and began a $100m spending campaign in support of his candidacy. After Musk started to gain Trump\u2019s ear \u2013 and particularly after Musk\u2019s endorsement and Starlink\u2019s deployment of satellite terminals to areas hit by Hurricane Helene, which Trump praised regularly on the campaign trail \u2013 Trump\u2019s language about rural broadband began to shift in Musk\u2019s direction. Trump described Starlink as \u201cbetter than the wires\u201d, when talking with Joe Rogan in the much-watched podcast interview. \u201cWe\u2019re spending a trillion dollars to get cables all over the country, right, up to upstate areas where you have like two farms \u2026 They haven\u2019t hooked up one person.\u201d Over the last year, the FCC commissioner \u2013 and Trump\u2019s newly named FCC chair \u2013 Brendan Carr has also echoed Musk\u2019s position, arguing that the public might be better off by subsidizing the cost of Starlink terminals instead of fiber optic broadband. After Trump\u2019s election, Carr said the FCC is unlikely to revisit its rescission of Starlink\u2019s grant, citing procedural hurdles. But Carr, who authored the FCC chapter of Project 2025, has suggested that as much as a third of Bead funding could go to satellite internet providers. Republican senators have also been agitating for changes to the Bead program. Senator Ted Cruz, poised to take over the Senate committee overseeing telecommunications, sent a letter last week lambasting the NTIA administrator, Alan Davidson, for alleged waste and administrative bloat in the Bead program. \u201cFortunately, as president-elect Trump has already signaled, substantial changes are on the horizon for this program,\u201d Cruz wrote. \u201cCongress will review the Bead program early next year, with specific attention to NTIA\u2019s extreme technology bias in defining \u2018priority broadband projects\u2019 and \u2018reliable broadband service\u2019.\u201d Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa sent Musk and Ramaswamy a letter on Tuesday with a roadmap for cost-cutting. The Bead program was on her target list. Davidson responded to earlier inquiries by Cruz, noting that the NTIA \u201chas obligated over $28bn to states and territories, all of whom also received planning grants through the program\u201d. The program \u201calso creates room for all strategies, and the NTIA expects states and territories will use a mix of technologies to connect their unserved and underserved locations\u201d, Davidson wrote. The NTIA announced earlier this year that Starlink could qualify for some Bead funding for services in extremely remote locations. In areas without broadband service from a landline operator, Starlink is often the only option. Project Kuiper by Amazon is also a low-Earth-orbit satellite internet service, which Amazon says will begin consumer offerings next year. *** SpaceX and its Starlink subsidiary are private companies that do not regularly disclose their finances. But analysts have argued that, until recently, Starlink had been losing money despite the success of SpaceX. That has changed over the last year as Starlink\u2019s 6,000-plus low-Earth satellite network has come online and courted business in developing countries. Analysts from Quilty, a space industry intelligence firm, suggest that Starlink\u2019s revenue has exploded, from $1.4bn in 2022 to $6.6bn in 2024. SpaceX and Tesla have about $15.4bn in government contracts, according to a recent New York Times analysis. Starlink is also competing with 15 other companies for US space force contracts worth nearly $1bn. Starlink did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Despite the obvious interest in government contracts, Musk and biotech entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Ramaswamy\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d will be tasked with reducing the federal government headcount and cutting costs, which could include the Bead program. \u201cStarlink and Bead are seeking to provide broadband to the same population: those living in low-density America,\u201d Levin said. \u201cWhile Starlink already has a network that covers the entire country, spectrum constraints and its relative functionalities compared to wired broadband service providers mean that the primary market for Starlink is in low-density America.\u201d Starlink benefits from any delay in Bead funding, Levin said. \u201cEvery day Starlink is signing up customers in low-density America. Today, those in unserved and underserved locations likely believe that if they want a baseline broadband service, they have no choice but to subscribe to the Starlink service. The longer it takes for an alternative provider to come online with a similar or better service, the better it is for Starlink, as its sales process benefits from the current lack of broadband alternatives.\u201d Reallocating funding from fiber to satellite would put money in Starlink\u2019s pocket at the direct expense of terrestrial competitors. \u201cWhile there are other technology options for high-speed connectivity, the most reliable, efficient and future-proof solution is fiber optic technology to the home or business,\u201d said Tom Dailey, head of regulatory and government affairs at Brightspeed, an internet service provider competing for Bead funds. \u201cSatellite broadband is a costly option that does not provide the same level of reliability or speed that fiber optic technology provides \u2026 We don\u2019t anticipate that the Bead program will be eliminated. In fact, we believe it will continue and there is strong bias for fiber technology as the main means of connectivity given its superior speed and bandwidth capabilities.\u201d",

Archive image: courtesy of Troy Deeney<em><br></em></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Birmingham in 1988, Troy Deeney grew up in Chelmsley Wood on one of the biggest housing estates in Europe. Now a football&nbsp;pundit and campaigner, he spent 11 years at Watford as striker and then captain; before retiring, he was the player-manager of Forest Green Rovers. His brother, Ellis, was a semi-professional footballer and former captain of Aston&nbsp;Villa\u2019s academy team. In 2021, Troy published Redemption: My Story, a memoir about his upbringing and his turbulent relationship with his adoptive father, Paul. Troy has set up <a href=\"https://footballfactorymidlands.com/\">Vision Football Factory</a>, a youth initiative in the Birmingham area.</p> <h2><strong>T</strong><strong>roy</strong></h2> <p>Nan took this photo. Whenever there was a party at her house, every adult ended up on that swing. It broke a lot. Me, Mum and my brother and sister lived in a small flat, so Nan\u2019s garden was like being at Wembley. She also had the good chocolate bars \u2013 KitKats and Jaffa Cakes.</p> <p>I would describe our childhood as dream-like. We had a lot of laughs. There were some tough moments that felt like a bad dream, but I knew one day we\u2019d get to where we wanted. For the most part it was genuinely fun. Especially with me and Ellis. We loved football. Everything was a challenge, a&nbsp;competition. Dad wanted us to play football with the older kids, so we got street smart, and were well accustomed to being roughed up from a young age.</p> <p>I never liked confrontation or arguing. I am a people-pleaser. I\u2019ve always been the funny kid. After the incident with Dad [aged nine, Troy and his mother experienced domestic abuse], my mentality changed. Dad got nicked. From then on, he was around, but he didn\u2019t live with us. Instead, I&nbsp;became the man of the house.</p> <p>When I was 11, I started working, just glass collecting in the pub. Mum worked three jobs, so I would have to skip the end of school to collect Ellis and [my sister] Sasha from their school. I\u2019d get them both home, trying to make the journey as fun as possible, then make Ellis beans on toast before he went to Aston Villa.</p> <p>To this day, one of my proudest moments was when I collected my brother and sister, and I gave them both my coat and jumper so they wouldn\u2019t get wet in the rain. I got soaked in just my T-shirt, but they were OK, and that\u2019s all that mattered.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s annoying having a little brother that is so good at everything </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dad had this aura, and up until we buried him in 2012, I didn\u2019t know he was my size. To me, he was 8ft 10. He&nbsp;was the strongest, fittest, loudest person you\u2019ve ever met. He was very ambitious for us \u2013 not just with football, but everything. He was adamant we were not going to be like him, so we didn\u2019t have his last name for that reason. Dad knew I was smart, but I was never the best at football. I\u2019d&nbsp;always get picked fifth at school, whereas Ellis was No 1. It\u2019s annoying having a little brother that is so good at everything. There\u2019s nothing he\u2019s bad at, physically.</p> <p>By comparison, I was the class clown. I found school easy and boring. I\u2019d do the work in 15 minutes and have another 45 minutes to entertain myself and the rest of the class. As a result, I broke the record for the most detentions in one year; 202 in total. Just for being a twat. Still now, everything\u2019s a joke to me, even if it\u2019s a horrible situation. Emotions make me feel weird; I want to get out of feeling them as quickly as possible, so I just try to be lighthearted.</p> <p>When I got into my teens, I started drinking. I had all this built-up aggression that I didn\u2019t know how to&nbsp;deal with. No one was talking about&nbsp;mental health or trauma. It wasn\u2019t impressive to be the funny one&nbsp;any more; it was better to be the tough one. </p> <p>I got married this summer and in Mum\u2019s speech she said: \u201cNow that you\u2019re retired, I hope everyone gets to see more of Troy and less of Troy Deeney.\u201d I morphed into this character for a while. I was getting more money, fame and notoriety. To this day, I still think someone\u2019s going to turn around and take everything from me, so I burn the candle at both ends. It\u2019s how I survive: I\u2019ve become used to living in fight or flight. I\u2019d be more comfortable if the house was burning down than if everything was fine and the bills were paid on time. Normal is scary, which is a bit sad, really.</p> <p>There\u2019s a love between brothers that can never be matched. Even if me and Ellis didn\u2019t speak for 20 years, our childhood, the good and bad, and our fundamental core values, mean we\u2019ll always come back to each other.</p> <h2><strong>E</strong><strong>llis</strong></h2> <p>I used to think Nan\u2019s house was a mansion. There were loads of good hiding places. Once, me and my cousins forgot to find Troy and went to play football instead. An hour later, he came to get us: \u201cWhat, are you not still looking for me any more?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Troy was the golden child.

I would come downstairs and try to listen in on the conversation, but they\u2019d find out and I\u2019d get sent to bed.</p> <p>I always looked up to Troy. He was smart and could talk to anyone \u2013 whereas I used to stutter and am probably dyslexic. He was cooler than&nbsp;me, and knew how to dress especially when he got a bit of money. We were very different people: I have to be active all the time. I played football, basketball, tennis and ice&nbsp;hockey; anything boisterous and adrenalised I was interested in, and I&nbsp;was more of a rebel.

When it bleeds into his family life, when he\u2019s acting differently at home, we have to have words, but I&nbsp;understand. We\u2019re from a council estate, we\u2019re from nothing, and while&nbsp;that doesn\u2019t define us, it\u2019s who we are. When someone earns millions&nbsp;and has everything all of a sudden, when nobody tells you \u201cno\u201d,&nbsp;how can you not change? Nobody tells you how to deal with&nbsp;fame and success.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump raised eyebrows earlier this month when he announced he was selling a line of $11,000 guitars \u2013 the musical instrument becoming the latest item in a string of Trump-endorsed products that include sneakers, a Bible and a \u201cvictory cologne\u201d. Billed as \u201cthe only guitar officially endorsed by President Donald J Trump\u201d, the acoustic and electric axes bear all the gaudy insignia of Trump\u2019s political campaigns, and have been developed \u201cwith the help of a master luthier\u201d. The guitars have the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d embossed on the neck, and an eagle in front of an American flag on the body. The headstock has the number \u201c45\u201d \u2013 Trump was the 45th president \u2013 surrounded by a lot of stars. An autographed electric version costs $11,750, the acoustic $10,250. Trump announced the move in a post on Truth Social, and the associated Trump Guitars website shows a photograph of Trump, mouth agape, holding a pen to the frame of one of the instruments. But as quickly as Trump attempted to get the music going, it was potentially silenced: Gibson told Guitar World this week that it issued a cease and desist order to Trump Guitars owner 16 Creative over the use of its single-cut electric guitar model, \u201cas the design infringes upon Gibson\u2019s exclusive trademarks, particularly the iconic Les Paul body shape\u201d. Entering into guitar sales is a left-field choice for Trump, whose most notable connection to the guitar is his ability to get bands that use the instrument to order him to stop playing their music. But throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has made it clear that he will endorse almost anything, as long as there is profit to be made. Trump owes more than $500m in legal penalties related to his defamation of E Jean Carroll, a writer who a civil trial found had been sexually abused by the president-elect, and to financial fraud stretching over a decade. An eclectic range of product endorsements has been helpful to Trump in raising at least some of that money. The \u201cNever-Surrender High-Top Sneaker\u201d was initially announced in February, and is a pair of shiny gold high-top shoes that sneaker enthusiasts described as \u201ctacky\u201d and \u201clook[ing] like a knockoff shoe produced by Temu\u201d. The website established to sell the sneakers has since expanded into other markets.

The debate was marked by sobriety and the welcome absence of partisan bickering. MPs approached the issue with humility, showing respect for every contribution, regardless of stance.</p> <p>The central tension between individual autonomy and societal responsibility was clearly highlighted by the discussion.

Imagine, in other words, if their actions then had matched their fine words now.</p> <p>I don\u2019t doubt the strength of feeling behind this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/29/mps-vote-for-assisted-dying-in-england-and-wales\">vote in favour of legalising assisted dying</a> in England and Wales, but as someone who has cared for thousands of people with terminal illnesses, I have to wonder at its sincerity. Because every prime minister over the last 20 years \u2013 and every MP for that matter \u2013 knows full well that much (though not all) of the pain and misery of dying can be alleviated with good palliative care. </p> <p>They also know how much suffering at the end of life is caused by basic NHS, social and palliative care simply not being there for patients. Wes Streeting went one step further. The health secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/13/assisted-dying-law-nhs-cuts-wes-streeting\">cited the threadbare realities</a> of our underfunded, patchy, palliative care services as his primary reason for voting against the bill, stating (correctly) that the postcode lottery in care denies many patients a genuine choice at the end of life.</p> <p>And he\u2019s absolutely right. I see them daily, the dying patients that British society fails. They arrive sometimes in A&amp;E, stricken with pain, desperate with fear, having begged for help and support that never materialised. After a few days of input from our team \u2013 the first palliative care they\u2019ve ever received \u2013 their symptoms, their outlook and their hopes for the future can often be radically transformed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/30/good-palliative-care-can-alleviate-the-pain-of-dying-this-bill-means-labour-must-fund-it\">Good palliative care can alleviate the pain of dying \u2013 this bill means Labour must fund it | Rachel Clarke</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674ad5188f088c7046fe0241\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-elgot\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-30T10:00:06.536Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It is hard to think of a better MP to take on the cause of assisted dying than Kim Leadbeater. She is energetic, engaging, persuasive and speaks like a normal human being. She has no tribal reputation, so there is no barrier to winning over Conservatives, and she has experience of horrifying personal tragedy: her sister, the MP Jo Cox, was murdered.</strong></p> <p>But it would be wrong to say it was Leadbeater who won this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/29/mps-vote-for-assisted-dying-in-england-and-wales\">initial push to legalise assisted dying</a>. Under the surface, the most important contribution has been the one made by ordinary people, an experiment in participatory democracy by stealth. In the end, that was what delivered such a comprehensive victory for the change at this stage.</p> <p>Downing Street may sneer at the idea of citizens\u2019 assemblies, but there have been small-scale ones happening all the same. Hundreds of MPs were undecided at the start of this process. So invitations were sent out in constituencies for people to meet their MPs and tell their stories \u2013 in pubs, libraries, community halls.</p> <p>The meetings were packed, MPs said. There were tears of anger and frustration, of reliving the worst moments of their lives, of anguished fear over what awaits if people are already ill, or of how a loved one might feel like a burden.</p> <p>On equal marriage, it was often said that parliament was ahead of public opinion. On assisted dying, parliament has seemed to lag behind. Two-thirds of those polled back assisted dying. Equal marriage or abortion are comparable moments of a fundamental societal shift.

Campaigners in favour of the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill said it was a significant move towards giving people more choice over the way they die, after the Commons backed the bill by 330 votes for to 275 against. Brought by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, the bill would give terminally ill adults with less than six months to live the right to die once the request has been signed off by two doctors and a high court judge. MPs on both sides of the debate over assisted dying have called for improvements to palliative care, regardless of whether parliament eventually enacts legalisation. Layla Moran, who supported the bill at its second reading on Friday, and Diane Abbott, who did not, agreed that more funding was required to improve end-of-life care during a joint-interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI am very worried that vulnerable people will get swept up in the assisted dying route, when actually what they really need is access to hospice care and proper end-of-life care,\u201d Abbott said. While she said she had sympathy for the opposing view, the Labour MP said she wanted people to \u201cnot see supported suicide as the only option\u201d if they had concerns such as being a \u201cburden\u201d or worries about the family finances. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee, voted for the assisted dying bill in the House of Commons yesterday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said she has \u201clong believed, especially in the cases of terminally ill adults, that they should have that choice at the end of life\u201d. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve been moved by personal experiences, my best friend\u2019s mother contracted cancer about 20 years ago and we lived in Belgium at the time. She started the process but in fact died before she was able to complete the legal part of the process because the cancer was so aggressive. I saw how taking back that little bit of control in her life was important to her. Meanwhile, the government has thrown its weight behind a bill to crack down on puppy smuggling as part of a commitment to strengthening animal welfare. Ministers announced on Friday that they were supporting a private member\u2019s bill sponsored by Danny Chambers, a Liberal Democrat MP and veterinary surgeon, to crack down on the pet-smuggling trade. The move is intended to deliver on a Labour manifesto pledge to tackle puppy smuggling by closing loopholes in the law that are exploited by unscrupulous traders.

Meanwhile, the government has thrown its weight behind a bill to crack down on puppy smuggling as part of a commitment to strengthening animal welfare. Ministers announced on Friday that they were supporting a private member\u2019s bill sponsored by Danny Chambers, a Liberal Democrat MP and veterinary surgeon, to crack down on the pet-smuggling trade. The move is intended to deliver on a Labour manifesto pledge to tackle puppy smuggling by closing loopholes in the law that are exploited by unscrupulous traders. The bill will give the government powers to ban the import of puppies and kittens less than six months old, and dogs and cats that are mutilated or heavily pregnant. The animal welfare (import of dogs, cats and ferrets) bill will also make it more difficult and less profitable for traders to fraudulently import animals for sale by passing them off as pets travelling with their owners. The number of pets involved in \u201cnon-commercial\u201d moves to the UK rose from 100,000 in 2011 to more than 320,000 in 2023, triggering fears of fraudulent activity. Previous governments have sought to strengthen protections in the past but met obstacles. An animal welfare bill championed by Boris Johnson\u2019s government that would have imposed curbs on puppy imports was shelved in 2023. The Commons approved at second reading a bill to allow some terminally ill people to end their lives with medical assistance in England and Wales. As it was a free vote, there were no party positions and members from all parties voted for or against the motion. Find out how every MP voted, and search for your own here: On Friday, MPs voted to advance legislation on assisted dying in England and Wales, reflecting polling that shows widespread public support. However, a slim majority, of less than one-tenth of the House, should temper the confidence of its proponents. This is a profound, historic decision that demands careful consideration. Parliament was at its best in putting through the proposals to the next stage of deliberation. The debate was marked by sobriety and the welcome absence of partisan bickering. MPs approached the issue with humility, showing respect for every contribution, regardless of stance. The central tension between individual autonomy and societal responsibility was clearly highlighted by the discussion. MPs were right to allow for further detailed scrutiny, debate and potential amendments to ensure the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill addresses both ethical concerns and practical safeguards effectively. The desire to alleviate suffering is deeply compelling. The legislation proposes allowing mentally competent adults with a terminal diagnosis and less than six months to live to seek medical assistance to end their lives. Safeguards include independent assessments by two doctors, high court approval and a 14-day reflection period. Once the criteria have been met, a doctor may prescribe a self-administered life-ending medication. The succession of former prime ministers who lined up in recent days to assert their compassion for the dying was quite something. David Cameron, Theresa May, Liz Truss, Boris Johnson \u2013 all of them wanting us to know just how much they cared. Imagine if this roll call of political powerhouses \u2013 each of whom was better placed than anyone to improve the fate of those with terminal diagnoses \u2013 had used that power, while in office, to do something concrete, tangible, to alleviate the terminal suffering that allegedly touched them so deeply. Imagine, in other words, if their actions then had matched their fine words now. I don\u2019t doubt the strength of feeling behind this vote in favour of legalising assisted dying in England and Wales, but as someone who has cared for thousands of people with terminal illnesses, I have to wonder at its sincerity. Because every prime minister over the last 20 years \u2013 and every MP for that matter \u2013 knows full well that much (though not all) of the pain and misery of dying can be alleviated with good palliative care. They also know how much suffering at the end of life is caused by basic NHS, social and palliative care simply not being there for patients. Wes Streeting went one step further. The health secretary cited the threadbare realities of our underfunded, patchy, palliative care services as his primary reason for voting against the bill, stating (correctly) that the postcode lottery in care denies many patients a genuine choice at the end of life. And he\u2019s absolutely right. I see them daily, the dying patients that British society fails. They arrive sometimes in A&amp;E, stricken with pain, desperate with fear, having begged for help and support that never materialised. After a few days of input from our team \u2013 the first palliative care they\u2019ve ever received \u2013 their symptoms, their outlook and their hopes for the future can often be radically transformed. It is hard to think of a better MP to take on the cause of assisted dying than Kim Leadbeater. She is energetic, engaging, persuasive and speaks like a normal human being. She has no tribal reputation, so there is no barrier to winning over Conservatives, and she has experience of horrifying personal tragedy: her sister, the MP Jo Cox, was murdered. But it would be wrong to say it was Leadbeater who won this initial push to legalise assisted dying. Under the surface, the most important contribution has been the one made by ordinary people, an experiment in participatory democracy by stealth. In the end, that was what delivered such a comprehensive victory for the change at this stage. Downing Street may sneer at the idea of citizens\u2019 assemblies, but there have been small-scale ones happening all the same. Hundreds of MPs were undecided at the start of this process. So invitations were sent out in constituencies for people to meet their MPs and tell their stories \u2013 in pubs, libraries, community halls. The meetings were packed, MPs said. There were tears of anger and frustration, of reliving the worst moments of their lives, of anguished fear over what awaits if people are already ill, or of how a loved one might feel like a burden. On equal marriage, it was often said that parliament was ahead of public opinion. On assisted dying, parliament has seemed to lag behind. Two-thirds of those polled back assisted dying. Equal marriage or abortion are comparable moments of a fundamental societal shift. But they will never be personal to everyone \u2013 unlike death. MPs voted by 330 to 275 to approve the assisted dying bill at a second reading. But the bill is not yet law and still has to pass through several other steps. My colleague Kiran Stacey has compiled an excellent guide, outlining what comes next as the bill proceeds to committee stage. Read the full report here: Front pages in the UK on Saturday were dominated by the step taken by MPs toward legalising assisted dying in England and Wales by backing a bill that would give some terminally ill people the right to end their own lives. Here is a round-up of how the news has been reported this morning: Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott, mother of the house, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that she voted against the bill due to concerns that vulnerable people will \u201cget swept up in the assisted dying route\u201d. She said that a quarter of people who want to place family members into hospices are unable to, adding: If we are thinking about choice, we also have to think about the choice of people who if they could get support, could end their lives peacefully and happily but might find themselves either because they don\u2019t want to be a burden or they are worried about their family\u2019s finances being drained by the cost of care or even a few people who think they shouldn\u2019t be taking up a hospital bed. I think they should have a genuine choice and not see supported suicide as the only option. She said she thought \u201cvery hard about it\u201d but voted for \u201cvulnerable people who, perhaps for all the wrong reasons, were going to opt for assisted suicide\u201d. Meanwhile, Abbott said that tweaks to the bill at committee stage were unlikely to sway her and other MPs who voted against it further down the line. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee, voted for the assisted dying bill in the House of Commons yesterday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said she has \u201clong believed, especially in the cases of terminally ill adults, that they should have that choice at the end of life\u201d. She said: I\u2019ve been moved by personal experiences, my best friend\u2019s mother contracted cancer about 20 years ago and we lived in Belgium at the time. She started the process but in fact died before she was able to complete the legal part of the process because the cancer was so aggressive. I saw how taking back that little bit of control in her life was important to her. Parliament needs to take the arguments against the bill \u201cseriously\u201d though, she added, while saying that health secretary Wes Streeting should be taking a more proactive approach to the issue of palliative care. She said: I was disappointed. I was expecting an announcement from Wes Streeting yesterday to say \u2018look, we\u2019ve heard and we are going to do something\u2019 \u2026 immediate funding commitments and a view to making sure this is dealt with in the next year or two. I would argue that, whether this passes or not, that is one of the key messages that came out of the debate. Good morning and welcome to the UK politics live blog. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest news and views from Westminster over the next few hours. MPs have taken a historic step toward legalising assisted dying in England and Wales by backing a bill that would give some terminally ill people the right to end their own lives. Campaigners in favour of the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill said it was a significant move towards giving people more choice over the way they die, after the Commons backed the bill by 330 votes for to 275 against. Brought by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, the bill would give terminally ill adults with less than six months to live the right to die once the request has been signed off by two doctors and a high court judge. It still has further steps to go through before becoming law, and supporters believe assisted dying will not be an option for those with a terminal diagnosis for at least three years. The vote, which is the first on the issue for almost a decade, split the political parties and the cabinet. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves voted in favour alongside prominent opposition MPs such as Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt. Those voting against included Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister; Wes Streeting, the health secretary; Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader; and Nigel Farage, the Reform leader. During the five-hour debate, the Commons heard impassioned pleas on both sides. MPs recounted personal experiences of illness and death, and appeals they had heard from their constituents on assisted dying. Esther Rantzen, who galvanised the debate on assisted dying last December after revealing she had lung cancer, said the bill offered everyone \u201cequal choice\u201d. She said: Those who don\u2019t want an assisted death and don\u2019t want to take part in providing assisted dying can opt out of it, don\u2019t have to do it, don\u2019t choose to end their lives that way. So it offers everyone equal choice, whatever their religion. Kit Malthouse, who made an impassioned speech in favour of the legislation, said parliament had taken a \u201csignificant first step\u201d and called for the government to now dedicate more parliamentary time to consideration to the bill. According to recent polling, three-quarters of the public back a change in the law. For the full report on yesterday\u2019s historic vote, see here:",

      "bodyText": "1 Dec Paul Heaton Glasgow In support of the release of his 10th studio album The Mighty Several, Paul Heaton hits the arenas of the UK with his new sidekick, Rianne Downey. Alongside new material, the pair promise an array of Housemartins and Beautiful South hits, mapping the territories of British heartland pop with suitably wintery wit. JW OVO Hydro, and touring. 2 Dec Ruination London A five-star show from dance-theatre company Lost Dog. Ruination is based on the tragic myth of Medea \u2013 she murdered her children, if you remember \u2013 which is chirpy subject matter for the festive season. Yet in director Ben Duke\u2019s capable hands, it becomes a funny, moving, inventive and unexpected journey through Medea\u2019s story and the characters of the Underworld. LW Royal Opera House: Linbury theatre, 2 December to 4 January. 3 Dec The Three Musketeers Newcastle-under-Lyme The team at the New Vic know how to create a spectacle, and here assemble a cast made up of dazzling stage combat performers. Will D\u2019Artagnan impress the infamous Musketeers? Will they discover who is the spy in their midst? Expect swashbuckling scenes and daring duels in Theresa Heskins\u2019s new adaptation of Dumas\u2019 rip-roaring tale of friendship, cunning, and courage. KW New Vic theatre, to 25 January. 4 Dec The World of Tim Burton London This exhibition brings director Tim Burton\u2019s sweetly spooky vision to life in a goth funhouse environment worthy of his superstylised movies. Iconic costumes such as that of the suburban outcast Edward Scissorhands, models and movie set designs sit alongside works from Burton\u2019s personal archive. Drawings, sketchbooks and animations from childhood onwards map his lifelong love of oddball outsiders, from misunderstood kids to space aliens. SS Design Museum, to 21 April. 5 Dec The Human League &amp; Sophie Ellis-Bextor Cardiff Given that Don\u2019t You Want Me and Murder on the Dancefloor are both office party staples, HR managers across the nation could do a lot worse than sacking off the usual Christmas arrangements and taking the whole team to see the Human League, who have seen fit to offer great value on their arena tour by bringing along Sophie Ellis-Bextor (and 80s favourites T\u2019Pau) for the ride. JW Utilita Arena, and touring. 6 Dec Scottish Ballet\u2019s The Nutcracker Glasgow You\u2019ve got to have a bit of Nutcracker at Christmas, and Scottish Ballet\u2019s production delivers on all the essential elements. Snowflakes, sparkle and a bit of stage magic? Check. A land of sweets topped off by the Sugar Plum Fairy? Yep. Tchaikovsky\u2019s delightful music? Indeed, and played live, too. It\u2019s choreographed by company director Christopher Hampson and designed by Matthew Bourne collaborator Lez Brotherston, always good for some style and panache. LW Theatre Royal, 6 to 30 December, and touring. 7 Dec John Etheridge Nottingham Two diverse gigs in December confirm the gifts of the British guitarist John Etheridge, a vivacious virtuoso at ease in almost any idiom. Etheridge played on the exploratory rock fringes in the 1970s, but went on to work with stars from Soft Machine to French swing-violin legend St\u00e9phane Grappelli, and classical virtuoso John Williams. Hear him play funky guitar/organ blues at Nottingham. JF Peggy\u2019s Skylight, 7 December; East Side Jazz Club, London, 17 December. 8 Dec Art of Action Nationwide Action is a key genre in cinema, but one that doesn\u2019t always get its fair dues as a legitimate art form. This BFI season, playing in about 50 other venues around the UK, from Belfast to Brighton, looks to set the record straight, celebrating the actors, choreographers and stunt performers who do their best to pump adrenaline into the veins of big-screen entertainment. CB Cinemas nationwide, to end of December. 9 Dec Jacob Collier London With six Grammys and a host of big-name collaborations on his CV, multi-instrumentalist Jacob Collier might still be one of the UK\u2019s least spoken-about superstars. But even in a venue as big as the O2, audience participation will be a must; album series Djesse relies heavily on the belief that anyone can form a choir, adding a spontaneous feeling of gravitas that feels right in line with the spirit of the festive season. JW O2 Arena, and touring. 10 Dec Adam Riches and John Kearns Are \u2018Ball and Boe\u2019 London Riches and Kearns are two of British comedy\u2019s weirdest geniuses: the former is beloved for his terrifyingly interactive long-form sketches, while the latter performs observational comedy in a joke-shop wig and teeth. Naturally, they\u2019ve decided to team up to impersonate cheesy crooner duo Michael Ball and Alfie Boe for this festive extravaganza. Expect a pitch-perfect send-up of light entertainment balladry, with a ludicrously offbeat twist. RA Soho theatre, 10 December to 4 January. 11 Dec Treasure Island Edinburgh Looking for a voyage of discovery and danger? Seeking a boatload of sea shanties? The Lyceum brings Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s beloved classic to the stage in all its sea-salted, ragtag glory. It\u2019s Christmas Eve and a group of ex-seafarers are swapping their best tales. Adapted by Orkney playwright Duncan McLean, this playful production has all the makings of a good story: pirates, puffins and plenty of peril. KW The Royal Lyceum, to 4 January. 12 Dec From the Canyon to the Stars Manchester Olivier Messiaen\u2019s 12-movement suite, commissioned for the US bicentennial in 1976 and inspired by a visit to Utah, is a celebration of the desert landscapes of the American south-west. With its typical mix of Christian mysticism and awe for the wonders of the natural world, it\u2019s a panorama of birdsong, glowing instrumental colours and moments of apocalyptic grandeur. Ludovic Morlot conducts the BBC Philharmonic\u2019s performance. AC The Bridgewater Hall. 13 Dec Digging in Another Time: Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature Glasgow This exhibition looks back to 1989 when Jarman was detailing the creation of his now-famed garden in Dungeness, a Glasgow performance work and his film The Garden in his diaries. Shown alongside his own art, its pages have inspired new commissions that speak to Jarman\u2019s pervasive influence, including works by Luke Fowler, known for his elliptical documentaries of outsider figures, and Jade de Montserrat, who considers gender, race and class through a rural lens. SS Hunterian Art Gallery, to 4 May. 14 Dec Queer Nationwide Luca Guadagnino returns following tennis romp Challengers with this hotly anticipated Daniel Craig vehicle. Based on William Burroughs\u2019s 1985 novella, it\u2019s set in Mexico City and follows an American expat (Craig) who falls head over heels for a younger guy (Drew Starkey), a drug user who has been discharged from the navy. It continues Craig\u2019s veritable spree of creative leg-stretching after all that time as Bond, and more power to him. CB In cinemas from 13 December. 15 Dec The Holly King and the Oak King London Last Christmas, a wild wolf roamed the halls of Battersea Arts Centre. Glowing from the inside, he bewitched audience members who dashed across the seasonally shifting landscape created by gifted immersive artists Wild Rumpus. This year, the stage company returns with an old Celtic folk tale. A battle between the Oak King, leader of summer, and the Holly King, ruler of winter, has left the world out of kilter. Explore the magically designed world and help restore the natural balance. KW Battersea Arts Centre, to 24 December. 16 Dec Electric Dreams London Futurists and retro-heads alike will find plenty to switch on to in this international survey exploring how artists have put new tech to the test, be it early AI or virtual reality. It veers from lo-fi home computer experiments, such as Palestinian artist Samia Halaby\u2019s 1980s \u201cabstract paintings\u201d with whirring neon patterns that she developed on her Commodore Amiga, to German artist Otto Piene\u2019s immersive installations creating ballets with light. SS Tate Modern, to 1 June. 17 Dec AG Cook Manchester Raised to mainstream prominence off the back of his work on Charli xcx\u2019s year-defining album Brat, AG Cook\u2019s Britpop was one of the underrated releases of 2024, expanding the limits of the hyperpop genre. The giddy stimulation of the record might be a bit much for some, but in a live setting, the energy is likely to be infectious. JW New Century; also appearing at SWG3, Glasgow, 15 December, and Electric Brixton, London, 20 December. 18 Dec Hyde Park Comedy Club Christmas Special Leeds In a disused petrol station a mile outside Leeds city centre lies one of the UK\u2019s most important cultural hubs. Hyde Park Book Club was a formative venue both for this year\u2019s Mercury prize winners, indie band English Teacher, and the current holder of the Edinburgh comedy newcomer prize, Joe Kent-Walters. The latter returns for this bumper Christmas gig, alongside surrealist Tom Lawrinson, Christy Coysh \u2013 Wakefield\u2019s answer to Weird Al \u2013 and the charmingly confessional Alexandra Haddow. RA Hyde Park Book Club. 19 Dec Guy Barker\u2019s Big Band Christmas London This glitzy jazz Albert Hall show has become a regular Christmas jazz date for its celebration of accessibly multi-idiomatic music and the skills of its originator, the trumpeter, bandleader and composer Guy Barker. Backed by an A-list band, Barker shrewdly balances the shmalz of familiar Christmas music with a deep devotion to all forms of jazz from its earliest origins. Singer-songwriter Paloma Faith is one of a raft of star guests. JF Royal Albert Hall. 20 Dec The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim Nationwide The works of JRR Tolkien may have had a variable relationship with the art of animation, but there\u2019s no reason Tolkien is an inherently bad fit for inked adventures. This new adaptation has promising creative bona fides: produced by longtime Peter Jackson screenwriter Philippa Boyens and narrated by Miranda Otto (\u00c9owyn from Jackson\u2019s live action LOTR trilogy), this is a story set 183 years before the events of the War of the Ring, with Brian Cox voicing legendary hero of Rohan, Helm Hammerhand. CB In cinemas from 13 December. 21 Dec Christmas in Exeter Street Farnham Diana Hendry and John Lawrence\u2019s picture book captures the fizzy excitement of a house overflowing with friends, family and too many pets at Christmas. Farnham Maltings\u2019 new show translates that busy chaos from page to stage with 37 characters, seven animals and 10 instruments. As unexpected guests keep piling in, our gracious host, Maggie Mistletoe, makes room for them all \u2013 even if it means the baby sleeping in the kitchen sink. KW Farnham Maltings, 13 to 24 December. 22 Dec Louise Giovanelli Wakefield The feted young Manchester-based painter Louise Giovanelli channels the awe and mystery in Renaissance art\u2019s religious scenes into a modern world of movies and pop icons. Conjured in painstaking pointillist layers of pigment, her typical subjects include closeups of screen characters with a singular glamour and drawn curtains with their suspenseful promise of a secular rather than spiritual revelation: the longed-for star taking the stage. SS The Hepworth, to 21 April. 23 Dec Mufasa: The Lion King Nationwide Directed, rather surprisingly, by Moonlight film-maker Barry Jenkins, the big Christmas Disney picture of 2024 delves into the origins of Mufasa, Simba\u2019s dad from The Lion King (voiced here by British actor Aaron Pierre), and is animated in the same photorealistic style as the 2019 Lion King, with Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and Beyonc\u00e9 reprising the roles they made their own in that film. CB In cinemas from 20 December. 24 Dec Hansel and Gretel London In its most recent Covent Garden incarnation, Humperdinck\u2019s classic has become a regular Christmas favourite. Antony McDonald\u2019s production was intended as a show for all the family; the gruesome possibilities of the Grimm-inspired story are downplayed, and there are enough witty allusions \u2013 to Hitchcock movies and other fairytale characters \u2013 to keep all the generations happy. AC Royal Opera House, 22 December to 9 January.",

      "bodyText": "MPs on both sides of the debate over assisted dying have called for improvements to palliative care, regardless of whether parliament eventually enacts legalisation. Layla Moran, who supported the bill at its second reading on Friday, and Diane Abbott, who did not, agreed that more funding was required to improve end-of-life care during a joint-interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI am very worried that vulnerable people will get swept up in the assisted dying route, when actually what they really need is access to hospice care and proper end-of-life care,\u201d Abbott said. While she said she had sympathy for the opposing view, the Labour MP said she wanted people to \u201cnot see supported suicide as the only option\u201d if they had concerns such as being a \u201cburden\u201d or worries about the family finances. \u201cIf we\u2019re thinking about choice, we also have to think about the choice of people who, if they could get support, could end their life peacefully and happily,\u201d Abbott added. But, she said, many could find themselves pushed towards assisted dying \u201ceither because they don\u2019t want to be a burden, or they\u2019re worried about their families\u2019 finances being drained by the cost of care\u201d. She said some may even be concerned about \u201ctaking up the hospital bed\u201d. Abbott added: \u201cI think they should have a genuine choice and not see supported suicide as the only option.\u201d During the parliamentary debate on Friday, Moran called on the health secretary, Wes Streeting, to \u201cput firm commitments on palliative care on the table\u201d, telling the Commons the government had so far offered only \u201cwoolly words about how they are actually going to tackle this\u201d. The chair of the health and social care committee said: \u201cI say to the secretary of state, who is in his place: the gauntlet has been thrown down.\u201d Speaking to Radio 4 on Saturday, she said she was disappointed not to have heard any such policy announcement from Streeting. Explaining her decision to vote for the bill, which attracted the support of a majority of MPs on Friday, the Liberal Democrat MP said: \u201cI\u2019ve been moved by personal experiences. My best friend\u2019s mother contracted cancer about 20 years ago \u2026 I saw how taking that little bit back of control in her life was so important to her. \u201cBut I would also say that, while I voted for it, I think all of us want this to be a good bill. I would hope colleagues across the house \u2013 especially those who voted for it \u2013 reserve the right to vote no at further stages, and those who are against it, those who made arguments against it, we need to take those extraordinarily seriously.

      "body": "<p>I travel through Europe by rail in all seasons and all weathers, and my more memorable journeys are often in that slack period between Epiphany (on 6 January) and Easter. Fewer travellers are on the move. Empty trains and plentiful accommodation make a winning combo for those who relish spontaneous travel. And winter weather often lends a special hue to landscape, be it creeping dusk as a slow train rattles through the forests of Bohemia or a sudden snow shower cutting off the far horizons of Flanders.</p> <p>Interrail passes often offer the best deals for European rail trips. And the big news is that passes are currently <a href=\"https://www.interrail.eu/en\">on sale</a> with a hefty 25% discount through to 17 December. This makes for a fine opportunity to plan a winter adventure across Europe by train, so here are three trips worth making in early 2025. Buy a digital Interrail pass during the current promo and it can be used any time in the next 11 months.</p> <h2><strong>Moselle and Rhine, Germany</strong></h2>    <p>The Moselle and Rhine rivers enjoy some protection from the worst winter weather and are easy to reach by rail from Britain. Eurostar will speed you from London to Brussels in two hours. From there, it is a shade over four hours by train via Luxembourg to Trier in Germany. This city by the Moselle makes a mellow base for off-season rambles through vineyards and riverside villages. Bernkastel-Kues and Bullay, respectively reached by bus or train from Trier, are lovely.</p> <p>Mary Shelley deemed the Moselle inferior to \u201cthe prouder and more romantic glories of the Rhine\u201d but I find real midwinter appeal in the softer, gentler landscapes of the Moselle valley. Judge for yourself as, after a couple of days in Trier, you take the slow train through the valley to reach the Rhine at Koblenz.</p> <p>You can do better than actually staying in Koblenz by continuing to K\u00f6nigswinter, a handsome town on the right bank of the Rhine opposite Bonn. It\u2019s a lovely spot for winter getaways and easily repays two or three-night stays.</p> <p>Take the cog railway from K\u00f6nigswinter up to the cragged summit of the Drachenfels (Dragon\u2019s Rock) to discover a landscape full of Wagnerian splendour and a quirky monument to the composer. A day trip to Bonn is a must. The city that improbably became West Germany\u2019s capital in 1949 has real small-town appeal, its status enhanced by its association with Beethoven, who was born here.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Aachen\u2019s cosy back streets are especially atmospheric on a winter evening</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This stretch of the Rhine was in the premier league of destinations for English travellers in the 19th century, who usually toured with their sketch pads, recording Rhenish landscapes with varying degrees of competence. Not all were as good as JMW Turner, whose sketches of Drachenfels Castle helped inscribe this region on the romantic imagination.</p> <p>From K\u00f6nigswinter take the train following the Rhine downstream to Cologne for a quick peek at the city\u2019s awesome gothic cathedral. Round off your German trip with a night or two in Aachen, one-time hub of the Frankish empire. Check out the cathedral with Charlemagne\u2019s imperial throne and make time to explore Aachen\u2019s cosy back streets, which are especially atmospheric on a winter evening. Return home by train via Brussels to London.</p> <p><em>London-Trier-K\u00f6nigswinter-Aachen-London can be done with a </em><em>four-day <a href=\"https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/global-pass\">Interrail pass</a></em><em>, valid for four travelling days in a month. Prices (with current promotion): \u00a3</em><em>181</em><em> adult, \u00a3</em><em>135</em><em> youth (</em><em>under 28</em><em>), family \u00a3</em><em>362</em><em> (</em><em>two adults and two children under 12</em><em>). </em><em>Add about </em><em>\u00a326pp each way</em><em> for Interrail </em><em>pass holder supplements on Eurostar</em></p> <h2><strong>Via the Alps to Trieste</strong></h2>    <p>Winter is a time to hunker down in cosy cafes, as I discovered in February when I visited Vienna and Trieste. With a week to spare, you can easily make a winter tour of the Alps that takes in the Austrian capital and the Adriatic port so evocatively captured by the late Jan Morris in her book Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere.</p> <p>Start with a Eurostar to Brussels, to connect with the Nightjet to Vienna. (From mid-December this train changes its operating days, running from Belgium on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings). A night in Vienna is the prelude to a daytime journey to Trieste using the direct Eurocity train. <br>This was a rail route nurtured by imperial ambition, linking the Austrian capital to the most important commercial port in the Habsburg Empire.</p>    <p>It\u2019s a brilliant nine-hour ride from Vienna to Trieste, taking in the remarkable Unesco-listed <a href=\"https://www.eurail.com/en/plan-your-trip/trip-ideas/trains-europe/scenic-train-routes/semmering-line\">Semmering Railway</a> through the Austrian Alps, slipping through Ljubljana in Slovenia at lunchtime and then traversing the limestone karst to reach the Adriatic.</p> <p>After a couple of days in Trieste, take the morning Frecciarossa from Trieste (at 09.39) to Verona, where you have a good connection, with 30 minutes to wait, on to a direct Railjet to Innsbruck. This gives a fine run over&nbsp;the Brenner Pass, getting into Innsbruck while it is still light. </p> <p>Make enough time to ride the <a href=\"https://nordkette.com/top-of-innsbruck/hungerburgbahn/\">Hungerburgbahn</a> up into the mountains north of town and enjoy the fine tram route south up the Stubai valley. From Innsbruck take the Nightjet, which leaves every evening for Amsterdam, an overnight journey of 13 hours, from where it\u2019s an easy onward journey back to London on the&nbsp;Eurostar, albeit with a change in Brussels for the next couple of months. Direct trains from Amsterdam to London resume on 10 February.<br><br><em>London-Vienna-Trieste-Innsbruck-London is ideal with a five-day <a href=\"https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/global-pass\">Interrail pass</a>, valid for five travelling days in&nbsp;a&nbsp;month. Prices (with current promotion): \u00a3199 adult, \u00a3152 youth (under 28), family \u00a3404 (two adults and two&nbsp;children under 12). Add about \u00a326pp each way for Interrail pass holder supplements on&nbsp;Eurostar to&nbsp;Brussels</em></p> <h2><strong>Provincial France</strong></h2>    <p>The seaward end of the Loire valley benefits from a benign winter climate that makes it ideal for off-season visits. This is a chance to explore three delightful smaller French cities, taking advantage of regional rail routes where Interrailers don\u2019t need to&nbsp;bother with seat reservations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Chartres has an intimate feel well suited to a winter stay</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is something special about the delicate beauty of this route. In Paris, transfer to Montparnasse station for the regional train to Chartres, just an hour south-west. Chartres has an intimate feel well suited to a winter stay, then continue next day to Saumur in the Loire valley, changing in Le Mans and Angers, the latter most definitely worth a stop to see the remarkable 14th-century tapestries displayed in the castle.

      "bodyText": "I travel through Europe by rail in all seasons and all weathers, and my more memorable journeys are often in that slack period between Epiphany (on 6 January) and Easter. Fewer travellers are on the move. Empty trains and plentiful accommodation make a winning combo for those who relish spontaneous travel. And winter weather often lends a special hue to landscape, be it creeping dusk as a slow train rattles through the forests of Bohemia or a sudden snow shower cutting off the far horizons of Flanders. Interrail passes often offer the best deals for European rail trips. And the big news is that passes are currently on sale with a hefty 25% discount through to 17 December. This makes for a fine opportunity to plan a winter adventure across Europe by train, so here are three trips worth making in early 2025. Buy a digital Interrail pass during the current promo and it can be used any time in the next 11 months. Moselle and Rhine, Germany The Moselle and Rhine rivers enjoy some protection from the worst winter weather and are easy to reach by rail from Britain. Eurostar will speed you from London to Brussels in two hours. From there, it is a shade over four hours by train via Luxembourg to Trier in Germany. This city by the Moselle makes a mellow base for off-season rambles through vineyards and riverside villages. Bernkastel-Kues and Bullay, respectively reached by bus or train from Trier, are lovely. Mary Shelley deemed the Moselle inferior to \u201cthe prouder and more romantic glories of the Rhine\u201d but I find real midwinter appeal in the softer, gentler landscapes of the Moselle valley. Judge for yourself as, after a couple of days in Trier, you take the slow train through the valley to reach the Rhine at Koblenz. You can do better than actually staying in Koblenz by continuing to K\u00f6nigswinter, a handsome town on the right bank of the Rhine opposite Bonn. It\u2019s a lovely spot for winter getaways and easily repays two or three-night stays. Take the cog railway from K\u00f6nigswinter up to the cragged summit of the Drachenfels (Dragon\u2019s Rock) to discover a landscape full of Wagnerian splendour and a quirky monument to the composer. A day trip to Bonn is a must. The city that improbably became West Germany\u2019s capital in 1949 has real small-town appeal, its status enhanced by its association with Beethoven, who was born here. This stretch of the Rhine was in the premier league of destinations for English travellers in the 19th century, who usually toured with their sketch pads, recording Rhenish landscapes with varying degrees of competence. Not all were as good as JMW Turner, whose sketches of Drachenfels Castle helped inscribe this region on the romantic imagination. From K\u00f6nigswinter take the train following the Rhine downstream to Cologne for a quick peek at the city\u2019s awesome gothic cathedral. Round off your German trip with a night or two in Aachen, one-time hub of the Frankish empire. Check out the cathedral with Charlemagne\u2019s imperial throne and make time to explore Aachen\u2019s cosy back streets, which are especially atmospheric on a winter evening. Return home by train via Brussels to London. London-Trier-K\u00f6nigswinter-Aachen-London can be done with a four-day Interrail pass, valid for four travelling days in a month. Prices (with current promotion): \u00a3181 adult, \u00a3135 youth (under 28), family \u00a3362 (two adults and two children under 12). Add about \u00a326pp each way for Interrail pass holder supplements on Eurostar Via the Alps to Trieste Winter is a time to hunker down in cosy cafes, as I discovered in February when I visited Vienna and Trieste. With a week to spare, you can easily make a winter tour of the Alps that takes in the Austrian capital and the Adriatic port so evocatively captured by the late Jan Morris in her book Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere. Start with a Eurostar to Brussels, to connect with the Nightjet to Vienna. (From mid-December this train changes its operating days, running from Belgium on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings). A night in Vienna is the prelude to a daytime journey to Trieste using the direct Eurocity train. This was a rail route nurtured by imperial ambition, linking the Austrian capital to the most important commercial port in the Habsburg Empire. It\u2019s a brilliant nine-hour ride from Vienna to Trieste, taking in the remarkable Unesco-listed Semmering Railway through the Austrian Alps, slipping through Ljubljana in Slovenia at lunchtime and then traversing the limestone karst to reach the Adriatic. After a couple of days in Trieste, take the morning Frecciarossa from Trieste (at 09.39) to Verona, where you have a good connection, with 30 minutes to wait, on to a direct Railjet to Innsbruck. This gives a fine run over the Brenner Pass, getting into Innsbruck while it is still light. Make enough time to ride the Hungerburgbahn up into the mountains north of town and enjoy the fine tram route south up the Stubai valley. From Innsbruck take the Nightjet, which leaves every evening for Amsterdam, an overnight journey of 13 hours, from where it\u2019s an easy onward journey back to London on the Eurostar, albeit with a change in Brussels for the next couple of months. Direct trains from Amsterdam to London resume on 10 February. London-Vienna-Trieste-Innsbruck-London is ideal with a five-day Interrail pass, valid for five travelling days in a month. Prices (with current promotion): \u00a3199 adult, \u00a3152 youth (under 28), family \u00a3404 (two adults and two children under 12). Add about \u00a326pp each way for Interrail pass holder supplements on Eurostar to Brussels Provincial France The seaward end of the Loire valley benefits from a benign winter climate that makes it ideal for off-season visits. This is a chance to explore three delightful smaller French cities, taking advantage of regional rail routes where Interrailers don\u2019t need to bother with seat reservations. There is something special about the delicate beauty of this route. In Paris, transfer to Montparnasse station for the regional train to Chartres, just an hour south-west. Chartres has an intimate feel well suited to a winter stay, then continue next day to Saumur in the Loire valley, changing in Le Mans and Angers, the latter most definitely worth a stop to see the remarkable 14th-century tapestries displayed in the castle. They depict scenes from the Apocalypse of Saint John. From Angers, it\u2019s a short hop on a local train to Saumur, an amiable small town, whose cosy centre is at its most appealing in the quieter winter months. It\u2019s a chance to taste Loire wines and relax for a day or two. I especially like the village of Langeais, just east of Saumur, which has a picture-perfect main street. It can be reached on a local train from Saumur in as little as 20 minutes. Leaving Saumur, continue to your third and final stay in Bourges, using local trains and changing in Tours along the way.

From Bourges, there are direct regional trains back to Paris, taking just over two hours, where you switch to Eurostar for a high-speed return to London. \u2022 London-Chartres-Saumur-Bourges-London needs a four-day Interrail pass, as per the Germany itinerary.

The audience was the same as it always was: friends, family and a smattering of followers I had picked up over the years. But a tug from my subconscious told me, this time, something was wrong. I scrolled back up and there it was: an account I had never seen before. Their profile photo was a selfie I had taken in a bookshop basement years ago.</p> <p>Have you ever walked by an unexpected mirror and jumped at your own reflection? That\u2019s how it felt as I stared back at myself, unnerved by my sudden appearance.</p> <p>I brought the screen close to my face. The photo was old, from 2016, but it was a day I remembered well. I had just handed in my university dissertation and I was enjoying my newfound freedom. I had been ambling through Cardiff and had taken a snapshot in a mirror to mark the moment. My gold iPhone 5 looked tiny in my hand and I was wearing my favourite flannel shirt. These were familiar fragments of my life back then. Now, someone had seemingly come along and picked them up out of the bin.</p> <p>Was it just a glitch? A strange Meta mess-up that would reset if I clicked on their account? I would feel silly but relieved, then settle into bed with the world returned to how it was. But when I visited their page the image remained. According to Instagram, it now belonged to someone named Pawe\u0142 Sibilski.</p> <p>Pawe\u0142 had 691 followers and he was following more than 2,600 people. I couldn\u2019t see who they were, or the four posts he had shared, because his profile was private. In his bio, written in Polish, he described himself as a developer and investor. There was a Facebook link beneath it. I tapped it with a curiosity that swelled into horror.</p> <p>Pawe\u0142\u2019s Facebook was like a shrine devoted to my face. His profile photo was a selfie I had taken outside a pub in 2018. His cover photo, directly above it, was a shot of me wearing a hoodie on a frosty day in 2016. There was another photo where I was mid-expression, my hair blown sideways; I couldn\u2019t even remember when that was taken. It was like watching footage of myself sleepwalking; there I was, all over his account, with no memory of how I got there.</p> <p>Panic set in. The account was mostly private, but I pieced together what I could. Every photo (besides a stock image of an empty bar) was a different closeup of me. Pawe\u0142 had been uploading them since 2020, but they spanned almost a decade of my life. Hundreds of people had liked and commented on them, and Pawe\u0142 had humbly thanked them. He was incredibly popular, with 4,600 Facebook friends (about six times more than I have on my own account) \u2013 and he had spent the last four years convincing them that he was really me.</p> <p>I thought of the hapless hero in Dostoevsky\u2019s novel The Double, when Golyadkin encounters his beguiling doppelganger. The duplicate charms his way into Golyadkin\u2019s life, wins over his colleagues and friends, and eventually replaces him. Golyadkin later loses grip of his identity and has a severe mental breakdown. I know this story because it was the subject of my dissertation, the same one I had handed in before taking that bookshop selfie. Did my impostor somehow know this? Had he read the book as well? What else were we sharing that I had once thought belonged only to me?</p> <p>Pawe\u0142\u2019s Facebook account had a longer bio, again written in Polish. I used Google to translate the top line. \u201cB\u0105d\u017a Zawsze Sob\u0105,\u201d it read. \u201cAlways be yourself.\u201d I couldn\u2019t decide if it was comical or violating. I was concerned, but also weirdly flattered. I couldn\u2019t help feeling slightly buoyed up by the fact that I had been selected; that my photos were considered worth stealing. But who was Pawe\u0142, why had he chosen me and what had he done with my identity?</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>My impostor was more protective of my personal details than I had been in my online life. In order to see what else he had hijacked, I had to become his Facebook friend. A fresh wave of paranoia made me wonder if we were already connected. I rushed back to my private account and scanned my friends list. How well did I really know these people?</p> <p>In recent months I had tightened my social media security, but in the past I had recklessly accepted all requests. I\u2019d had the same Facebook account for over 15 years, and Pawe\u0142 had clearly been watching me for about half a decade. I tried to view my profile as one of my current 800 \u201cfriends\u201d would see it. They would know the names of my family and pets, where I studied, where I worked, where my parents were buried, what my childhood looked like, where I lived, the places I had been and the places I was likely to visit again. It was a fraudster\u2019s cheat sheet, a stalker\u2019s dream.</p> <p>Pawe\u0142 was accepting compliments about my face beneath my reproduced photos and passing them off as his own. He was clearly a crafty catfish, an online con artist who takes someone else\u2019s images and pretends to be them to deceive others. I decided to give him the same treatment; I would make a fake account and try to catfish my own impostor.</p> <p>Creating an alias was harder than I expected. I didn\u2019t want to use a name that might belong to a real person, but the pseudonyms I came up with sounded ridiculous, like badly written 1950s detectives: would <em>you</em> accept a friend request from Eric Pistachio or Dirk Avalanche? I ended up using my middle name followed by the first syllable of my mother\u2019s maiden name.</p> <p>I typed \u201ccartoon character\u201d into Google and used a popular result as my profile photo: an image of the anime ninja Naruto. For a cover photo I went with a generic woodland. It was as easy as that: a fake name and a fake face, made real by the internet. Facebook suggested some strangers I should add, so I sent them all requests to make me look more legitimate. I was surprised when dozens immediately accepted. How easily they had just let a catfish into their lives. I clicked on some of their profiles: family photos, career updates and tagged locations \u2013 I had access to the lot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Most girls wanted to have sex with you,\u2019 he told me. \u2018I\u00a0got some nude photos and videos, it was so nice\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I sent Pawe\u0142 a friend request. It felt sticky and horrible, as if I was betraying myself and playing into his game. Here I was, dressed as a cartoon character while I asked a stranger for permission to look at myself. Everything was out of sync. I closed my laptop, laid down in bed and tried not to think about Golyadkin.</p> <p>The next morning I had 89 new friends, but Pawe\u0142 wasn\u2019t among them. He had either rejected or ignored my request. Had he somehow seen right through it? In a normal state I would have waited but I was too agitated for patience. I started drafting a message under my pseudonym. It was confrontational, so I dialled it back. I wanted answers, not to scare him off.</p> <p>I told him my name was Andrew, and that I knew he was using my photos, but I said I was more curious than annoyed and simply had some questions. I took a breath and clicked send. \u201cThis account can\u2019t receive your message because they don\u2019t allow new message requests from everyone.\u201d</p> <p>I had stooped to the level of a catfish for nothing. In frustration I copied and pasted my message beneath one of his (my) photos. I took screenshots of his accounts and posted them to my Instagram story, to warn my friends and family. Then I took a selfie and pointed accusingly at the camera. My finger loomed large, close to the lens; on the tip I wrote, \u201cGet your own face, Pawe\u0142.\u201d</p> <p>My followers reacted just like I had, with a mix of shock and laughter. It was surreal but funny, wasn\u2019t it? A troubling sort of compliment. I had so many messages that I almost missed one. It was sent in such a frantic state it was missing proper punctuation.</p> <p>\u201cHey do we know each other? Where do you know me from?\u201d it read.</p> <p>It was Pawe\u0142.</p> <p>The fake innocence riled me up, along with the subtle accusation that <em>I</em> was somehow bothering <em>him</em>. He had a new profile photo now, a stock image of a silhouetted concert crowd. I told him who I was and that I wanted answers. He read this straight away and then the chat went dead for 12 minutes.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s only fair, don\u2019t you?\u201d I followed up. \u201cYou have been using my photos for many years without my knowledge and befriending lots of people posing as me. All I\u2019m asking for is an explanation.\u201d</p>    <p>He started to type. He typed for a long time. The three dots promised some sort of closure, but his response when it came was disjointed and confusing \u2013 eight lines long without any full stops. Pawe\u0142 later revealed he was translating everything I\u2019d said into his native Polish, and I sensed he was also panicking. So I slowed down and asked him very basic questions.</p> <p>\u201cWould you be happy to share your real name, or your age or general location?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit ashamed,\u201d he replied, and seemed to mean it. He typed like an embarrassed child who had been caught stealing sweets.</p> <p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I tried again. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right, I\u2019m a man. I gave my age as 25 \u2013 I\u2019m generally a bit older.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much older than 25?\u201d He was being coy, but I felt as if I was getting somewhere.</p> <p>The chat went silent again for a few minutes.</p> <p>\u201cI live in Warsaw. I\u2019m 42 years old, I have a wife, two children and, as you can see, a double personality.\u201d</p> <p>I reeled back. I had assumed he was a young loner, not a family man. I imagined him now, messaging me while his kids played nearby. It creeped me out again. I tried to keep my questions straightforward and calm, so I didn\u2019t scare him into silence, and slowly he began to reveal what he had done with my identity.</p> <p>Pawe\u0142 said he initially created the account because he wanted to make money. He had some sort of scheme I didn\u2019t understand, but it involved selling products. He needed a photo of someone \u201chandsome\u201d to lure customers in. He had found me by chance as a Google result because of an old article I had written; then he had tracked down my social media. He had used my face because he thought no one would recognise it.</p> <p>\u201cPretty boy not very popular,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou are not a celebrity, you are not famous.\u201d I was now being <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/neg\">negged</a> by my impostor.</p> <p>Pawe\u0142 failed to make money from the account, but somewhere along the line he started to enjoy logging in as me. \u201cI could be free. I wasn\u2019t afraid of anyone,\u201d he wrote. I almost felt sorry for him as he explained how he would come home from a tough, physical job, start drinking alcohol and slip into his online identity.</p> <p>\u201cThen I opened up \u2013 I was you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI could feel like someone else for a moment and express my opinion without fear of persecution.\u201d</p> <p>This made me incredibly nervous. \u201cWhat sort of opinions did you express using my profile photo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGenerally you got nice opinions,\u201d he said, as if he was unable to separate the two of us in his mind. The exception, he said, would be in talking to \u201csomeone, mainly a woman, who overdid it with plastic surgery. Then I wrote honestly that she was ruining her appearance, and because you are so handsome, they wondered if they were doing the right thing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I have done nothing wrong to anyone. No one has reported me or anything, Can I still have your account for a while?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I felt a pang of helpless shock. Pawe\u0142 was dressing up as me and haranguing women. I had viewed him as a low-risk fantasist, but he clearly had a cruel streak.</p> <p>Over the following days we continued to message, and Pawe\u0142\u2019s revelations became more sinister.</p> <p>\u201cMost girls wanted to have sex with you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI also got some nude photos and videos, it was so nice.\u201d He said he had used the account to start simultaneous romantic relationships with women who all thought they were talking to me. These lasted for up to six months at a time and ended only because Pawe\u0142 refused to meet them in person. He said he still had their videos saved in a personal archive.</p> <p>\u201cDid you feel bad that the people sending you nude images thought they were sending them to someone else?\u201d I asked in disbelief, trying not to let my anger show.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly I didn\u2019t think about it, I was amused by the fact that they were so naive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMaybe something is wrong with my psyche?\u201d</p> <p>I had thought I was the main casualty of Pawe\u0142\u2019s deception, but now it was clear that the real victims were the women he had tricked. I felt sickened that he had involved me in this. I asked if his wife knew. He said she almost caught him on the fake account once, but he convinced her it belonged to a friend. She had no idea about his second life and the string of women he had manipulated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/28/how-did-deepfake-images-of-me-end-up-on-a-porn-site-nfbntw\">I felt numb \u2013 not sure what to do. How did deepfake images of me end up on a porn site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI feel guilty,\u201d Pawe\u0142 wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s good you caught me because I wanted to end it for a long time, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere you worried about being found out?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cI have done nothing wrong to anyone. On the contrary, [as] you see for yourself, so many years and no one has reported me or anything,\u201d he wrote, having recovered from his short-lived shame. \u201cCan I still have your account for a while as you?\u201d</p> <p>He claimed he was using the catfish account for \u201cgood\u201d and acting as a \u201cpsychologist\u201d for the people he had tricked, because he talked them through their problems. This just made them sound all the more vulnerable, and his actions all the more despicable.</p> <p>\u201cI would like you to tell anyone you are still speaking to that you are not really me, and to close the account,\u201d I wrote back.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I will do that,\u201d he replied finally.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Pawe\u0142 later told me he had deleted the profile, but I could see it was still intact. He had simply removed my images, leaving empty templates ready to be filled again. At one point Pawe\u0142 unashamedly liked all of my recent Instagram photos. Part of me feared he had saved them for future use, then I remembered something he had said about AI being so convincing these days that you could use that to make a fake account instead. This was hardly reassuring.</p> <p>I asked Pawe\u0142 if he would put me in touch with the women he had tricked. I didn\u2019t know what I would say to them even if he agreed; I suppose I just wanted to check they were OK. He ignored this request, then eventually said he didn\u2019t want them to know the truth. Without his help it was impossible to track them down; his friends and followers lists were still private. Even if I somehow gained access, he had amassed thousands of connections; I had no idea which of them, or how many, he had manipulated.</p> <p>I tried to shut Pawe\u0142\u2019s account down by reporting it to Meta. I received an automatic response in seconds that said his profile didn\u2019t go against their community standards so they wouldn\u2019t remove it. I emailed Facebook support and tried Meta\u2019s press office, asking about their stance on catfishing and what it would take to remove a fake account, but I received no response.</p> <p>I emailed the Metropolitan police, who advised me to report what had happened, but they told me they weren\u2019t sure where it would sit as a criminal case because the impostor seemingly lived in Poland. It felt as if there was nothing I could do to stop him. I asked Pawe\u0142 if he had a final comment about his actions.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is in life \u2013 we don\u2019t always do everything as it should be, it\u2019s important to admit the mistake and change for the better,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m busy with work now and I got bored of pretending to be someone else.\u201d</p> <p>Who knows if this, or anything he told me, was true. His Facebook account is still online. For years Pawe\u0142 secretly followed me; now our roles have been reversed. I find myself occasionally searching his name and keeping tabs on his page, making sure those images are still empty and not filled in with updated photos of my face, or that of someone else completely oblivious to his deception. </p>",

So I slowed down and asked him very basic questions. \u201cWould you be happy to share your real name, or your age or general location?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a bit ashamed,\u201d he replied, and seemed to mean it. He typed like an embarrassed child who had been caught stealing sweets. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d I tried again. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a man?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s right, I\u2019m a man. I gave my age as 25 \u2013 I\u2019m generally a bit older.\u201d \u201cHow much older than 25?\u201d He was being coy, but I felt as if I was getting somewhere. The chat went silent again for a few minutes. \u201cI live in Warsaw. I\u2019m 42 years old, I have a wife, two children and, as you can see, a double personality.\u201d I reeled back. I had assumed he was a young loner, not a family man. I imagined him now, messaging me while his kids played nearby. It creeped me out again. I tried to keep my questions straightforward and calm, so I didn\u2019t scare him into silence, and slowly he began to reveal what he had done with my identity. Pawe\u0142 said he initially created the account because he wanted to make money. He had some sort of scheme I didn\u2019t understand, but it involved selling products. He needed a photo of someone \u201chandsome\u201d to lure customers in. He had found me by chance as a Google result because of an old article I had written; then he had tracked down my social media. He had used my face because he thought no one would recognise it. \u201cPretty boy not very popular,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou are not a celebrity, you are not famous.\u201d I was now being negged by my impostor. Pawe\u0142 failed to make money from the account, but somewhere along the line he started to enjoy logging in as me. \u201cI could be free. I wasn\u2019t afraid of anyone,\u201d he wrote. I almost felt sorry for him as he explained how he would come home from a tough, physical job, start drinking alcohol and slip into his online identity. \u201cThen I opened up \u2013 I was you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI could feel like someone else for a moment and express my opinion without fear of persecution.\u201d This made me incredibly nervous. \u201cWhat sort of opinions did you express using my profile photo?\u201d \u201cGenerally you got nice opinions,\u201d he said, as if he was unable to separate the two of us in his mind. The exception, he said, would be in talking to \u201csomeone, mainly a woman, who overdid it with plastic surgery. Then I wrote honestly that she was ruining her appearance, and because you are so handsome, they wondered if they were doing the right thing.\u201d I felt a pang of helpless shock. Pawe\u0142 was dressing up as me and haranguing women. I had viewed him as a low-risk fantasist, but he clearly had a cruel streak. Over the following days we continued to message, and Pawe\u0142\u2019s revelations became more sinister. \u201cMost girls wanted to have sex with you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI also got some nude photos and videos, it was so nice.\u201d He said he had used the account to start simultaneous romantic relationships with women who all thought they were talking to me. These lasted for up to six months at a time and ended only because Pawe\u0142 refused to meet them in person. He said he still had their videos saved in a personal archive. \u201cDid you feel bad that the people sending you nude images thought they were sending them to someone else?\u201d I asked in disbelief, trying not to let my anger show. \u201cHonestly I didn\u2019t think about it, I was amused by the fact that they were so naive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMaybe something is wrong with my psyche?\u201d I had thought I was the main casualty of Pawe\u0142\u2019s deception, but now it was clear that the real victims were the women he had tricked. I felt sickened that he had involved me in this. I asked if his wife knew. He said she almost caught him on the fake account once, but he convinced her it belonged to a friend. She had no idea about his second life and the string of women he had manipulated. \u201cI feel guilty,\u201d Pawe\u0142 wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s good you caught me because I wanted to end it for a long time, thank you.\u201d \u201cWere you worried about being found out?\u201d I asked. \u201cI have done nothing wrong to anyone. On the contrary, [as] you see for yourself, so many years and no one has reported me or anything,\u201d he wrote, having recovered from his short-lived shame. \u201cCan I still have your account for a while as you?\u201d He claimed he was using the catfish account for \u201cgood\u201d and acting as a \u201cpsychologist\u201d for the people he had tricked, because he talked them through their problems. This just made them sound all the more vulnerable, and his actions all the more despicable. \u201cI would like you to tell anyone you are still speaking to that you are not really me, and to close the account,\u201d I wrote back. \u201cOK, I will do that,\u201d he replied finally. * * * Pawe\u0142 later told me he had deleted the profile, but I could see it was still intact. He had simply removed my images, leaving empty templates ready to be filled again. At one point Pawe\u0142 unashamedly liked all of my recent Instagram photos. Part of me feared he had saved them for future use, then I remembered something he had said about AI being so convincing these days that you could use that to make a fake account instead. This was hardly reassuring. I asked Pawe\u0142 if he would put me in touch with the women he had tricked. I didn\u2019t know what I would say to them even if he agreed; I suppose I just wanted to check they were OK. He ignored this request, then eventually said he didn\u2019t want them to know the truth. Without his help it was impossible to track them down; his friends and followers lists were still private. Even if I somehow gained access, he had amassed thousands of connections; I had no idea which of them, or how many, he had manipulated. I tried to shut Pawe\u0142\u2019s account down by reporting it to Meta. I received an automatic response in seconds that said his profile didn\u2019t go against their community standards so they wouldn\u2019t remove it. I emailed Facebook support and tried Meta\u2019s press office, asking about their stance on catfishing and what it would take to remove a fake account, but I received no response. I emailed the Metropolitan police, who advised me to report what had happened, but they told me they weren\u2019t sure where it would sit as a criminal case because the impostor seemingly lived in Poland. It felt as if there was nothing I could do to stop him. I asked Pawe\u0142 if he had a final comment about his actions. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is in life \u2013 we don\u2019t always do everything as it should be, it\u2019s important to admit the mistake and change for the better,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m busy with work now and I got bored of pretending to be someone else.\u201d Who knows if this, or anything he told me, was true. His Facebook account is still online. For years Pawe\u0142 secretly followed me; now our roles have been reversed. I find myself occasionally searching his name and keeping tabs on his page, making sure those images are still empty and not filled in with updated photos of my face, or that of someone else completely oblivious to his deception.",

An 80-year-old man is not going to be a changed person.<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>Eight years ago, Trump arrived in Washington as a political neophyte in need of a helping hand.

She is considered one of the most union-friendly Republicans in Congress, and her selection was viewed as a way for Trump to reward union members who voted for him.</p> <p>On foreign policy, Trump made a relatively conventional choice in Marco Rubio for secretary of state. The Florida senator has advocated in the past for a muscular foreign policy with respect to foes including China, Iran and Cuba. But the president-elect also intends to put Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat who has previously made <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/14/tulsi-gabbard-russia-director-national-intelligence-trump/\">statements sympathetic to Russia</a>, as director of national intelligence.</p> <p>Other picks include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/23/trump-picks-brooke-rollins-agriculture\">Brooke Rollins</a>, president of the America First Policy Institute thinktank, as agriculture secretary; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/doug-burgum-interior-department-trump\">Doug Burgum</a>, a wealthy former software company executive, as interior secretary; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/trump-nominates-linda-mcmahon-education-secretary\">Linda McMahon</a>, former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, as education secretary \u2013 overseeing an agency that Trump pledged to eliminate.</p> <p>Then there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr\">Robert Kennedy Jr</a>, an anti-vaccine activist and sceptic of established science. Kennedy\u2019s career as an environmental lawyer could put him at odds with Trump\u2019s \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d philosophy and figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/trump-appoint-lee-zeldin-epa-chief\">Lee Zeldin</a>, set to lead the Environmental Protection Agency with a mandate to slash environmental regulation.

And despite campaign trail denials, Trump has embraced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/project-2025\">Project 2025</a>, a controversial plan from the Heritage Foundation thinktank, by appointing figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/trump-russ-vought-budget\">Russell Vought</a> as director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p> <p>The person who will have to make sense of it all is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/susie-wiles-trump-profile\">Susie Wiles</a>, a longtime Florida political operative who will become the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. She will hope to avoid the fate of chiefs of staff who failed to last the course of Trump\u2019s first term as, like a sports coach, she seeks to make disparate players gel into a cohesive whole.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/us/politics/trump-cabinet-america-first.html\">analysis for the New York Times</a>, David Sanger, who has covered five US presidents, identified \u201ca revenge team\u201d, \u201ca calm-the-markets team\u201d and \u201ca government shrinkage team\u201d, commenting: \u201cHow these missions will mesh and where they will collide is one of the biggest unknowns of the incoming administration.\u201d</p> <p>But others argue that the cabinet\u2019s range of experiences and worldviews will pale into insignificance when set against their devotion to the Trump cult. <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/author/kurt-bardella/\">Kurt Bardella</a>, a Democratic strategist, said: <em>\u201c</em>Regardless of whatever individual ideological leanings these people have had at varying points in their adult lives, it\u2019s largely irrelevant because the only litmus test we have seen put forward is absolute fealty to Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cAs we have seen in the Republican party overall, absolute fealty to Donald Trump overshadows any ideological belief. We could take almost every issue that used to be a part of the Republican party and show how the party has moved to a diametrically opposite position. This is not a party governed by ideology any more. It is governed by personality. It is governed by loyalty to Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Bardella, a former Republican congressional aide, added: \u201cThey\u2019re all going to get in a room and they\u2019re just going to go: \u2018Here\u2019s what we think. What do you think, boss? Oh, OK, well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re all going to do.\u2019 The idea that there\u2019s going to be ideologically rooted debate, vigorous debate happening in the Trump administration is absurd.

And Trump\u2019s pick of Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a congresswoman from Oregon, as labor secretary could be one of the rare selections that draws bipartisan support. She is considered one of the most union-friendly Republicans in Congress, and her selection was viewed as a way for Trump to reward union members who voted for him. On foreign policy, Trump made a relatively conventional choice in Marco Rubio for secretary of state. The Florida senator has advocated in the past for a muscular foreign policy with respect to foes including China, Iran and Cuba. But the president-elect also intends to put Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat who has previously made statements sympathetic to Russia, as director of national intelligence. Other picks include Brooke Rollins, president of the America First Policy Institute thinktank, as agriculture secretary; Doug Burgum, a wealthy former software company executive, as interior secretary; and Linda McMahon, former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, as education secretary \u2013 overseeing an agency that Trump pledged to eliminate. Then there is Robert Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist and sceptic of established science. Kennedy\u2019s career as an environmental lawyer could put him at odds with Trump\u2019s \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d philosophy and figures such as Lee Zeldin, set to lead the Environmental Protection Agency with a mandate to slash environmental regulation. Kennedy has also been condemned by Mike Pence, the former vice-president, and other social conservatives for supporting abortion rights. Outside the cabinet, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d, while lacking official authority, signals a strong push for drastic budget cuts and deregulation. And despite campaign trail denials, Trump has embraced Project 2025, a controversial plan from the Heritage Foundation thinktank, by appointing figures such as Russell Vought as director of the Office of Management and Budget. The person who will have to make sense of it all is Susie Wiles, a longtime Florida political operative who will become the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. She will hope to avoid the fate of chiefs of staff who failed to last the course of Trump\u2019s first term as, like a sports coach, she seeks to make disparate players gel into a cohesive whole. In an analysis for the New York Times, David Sanger, who has covered five US presidents, identified \u201ca revenge team\u201d, \u201ca calm-the-markets team\u201d and \u201ca government shrinkage team\u201d, commenting: \u201cHow these missions will mesh and where they will collide is one of the biggest unknowns of the incoming administration.\u201d But others argue that the cabinet\u2019s range of experiences and worldviews will pale into insignificance when set against their devotion to the Trump cult. Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist, said: \u201cRegardless of whatever individual ideological leanings these people have had at varying points in their adult lives, it\u2019s largely irrelevant because the only litmus test we have seen put forward is absolute fealty to Donald Trump. \u201cAs we have seen in the Republican party overall, absolute fealty to Donald Trump overshadows any ideological belief. We could take almost every issue that used to be a part of the Republican party and show how the party has moved to a diametrically opposite position. This is not a party governed by ideology any more. It is governed by personality. It is governed by loyalty to Donald Trump.\u201d Bardella, a former Republican congressional aide, added: \u201cThey\u2019re all going to get in a room and they\u2019re just going to go: \u2018Here\u2019s what we think. What do you think, boss? Oh, OK, well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re all going to do.\u2019 The idea that there\u2019s going to be ideologically rooted debate, vigorous debate happening in the Trump administration is absurd. It\u2019s laughable.\u201d Notably, Trump\u2019s cabinet is more diverse than in his first term, although it again has only three people of colour in secretary positions. Rubio would be the first Latino to serve as America\u2019s top diplomat; Bessent could become the first openly gay Republican cabinet member confirmed by the Senate; Gabbard would be the first director of national intelligence from the Pacific Islander community. But seasoned Trump watchers detect no method in the madness and suspect that the former reality TV star will once again act on impulse and thrive on conflict. Chris Whipple, the author of The Gatekeepers, a book about White House chiefs of staff, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence that Trump has learned anything about governing since his first term. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wishful thinking among a lot of commentators that OK, he\u2019s had four years in office, he learned a lot, he\u2019s had all this time to plan with Project 2025 and the America First Policy Institute and he\u2019s got his act together. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t see any evidence that there\u2019s any sort of plan here other than \u2018this guy looks good for that job, and Robert F Kennedy Jr has got a cool last name\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Voters in Ireland have expressed dissatisfaction with the taoiseach, Simon Harris, despite a return of the current government being the most probable outcome of the election, according to an exit poll. Of those 5,000 voters surveyed after they placed their vote, 35% named Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s leader, Miche\u00e1l Martin, as their preferred new leader of the 34th D\u00e1il. But solidifying Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s place in the Irish political landscape and reflecting the popularity of its current leader, 34% said they wanted its president, Mary Lou McDonald, to lead the country \u2013 far ahead of Harris, the leader of Fine Gael, who came third in the exit poll with 27%. Although the electorate does not choose the taoiseach, the exit poll is sobering reading for the two main parties \u2013 59% of 18 to 34-year-olds said they preferred McDonald to lead the country and 56% of 25 to 34-year-olds backed her. With a coalition now the most likely outcome, the chance of a new government led by Sinn F\u00e9in is slim. Both Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il have ruled out forming a government with the party, the former political wing of the IRA in Northern Ireland. Harris, 38, who called the snap election three weeks ago, went into the campaign in a leading position but a series of slip-ups including an awkward encounter with a care-worker have damaged his brand. He appears to have come out with 21% of the first preference vote, just behind Sinn F\u00e9in at 21.1% and slightly edging Fianna F\u00e1il, which is predicted to come third with 19.5%. \u201cI think there was big momentum behind the idea of a left-of-centre alternative up until about a year, year and a half ago, and then it faltered,\u201d said Richard Boyd Barrett, the head of the People Before Profit collection of TDs (members of parliament) who are expected to take about 3.1% of the vote. The Fine Gael director of elections, Olwyn Enright, said the exit poll was a \u201cpositive\u201d prediction for the party, but that she was \u201csurprised\u201d with the response over preferences for the taoiseach. Jack Chambers, the departing Fianna F\u00e1il finance minister, said the result was \u201ctoo close to call\u201d. Elsewhere, the exit poll showed: Social Democrats (5.8%), Labour (5%), Greens (4%), Aont\u00fa (3.6%), People Before Profit-Solidarity (3.1%), and Independent Ireland (2.2%). Independents and other candidates were on 14.6%. There is a margin of error of 1.4%. Ballot boxes were opened at 9am on Saturday with the first results of the count of first preference votes not expected until late afternoon and the count not expected to conclude before Sunday night or Monday morning. The exit poll\u2019s examination of voters\u2019 second preferences put Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael at 20% each, with Sinn F\u00e9in at 17%. The inconclusive results mean that all eyes will now turn to the potential search for coalition partners. Government formation talks could take weeks, with no new government until January possible. With 87 seats needed for a clear majority in the 174 seat D\u00e1il, no party will be able to form a majority government on their own since the predicted vote share is expected to translate into 30-something seats for each of the three parties. The predicted results appear to buck the trend in Europe with incumbent parties returning and migration way down the list of priorities for voters, despite the unprecedented riots in Dublin a year ago. The housing crisis and homelessness emerged as the number one priority among voters with 28% citing it as the biggest influence on their decision after the cost of living, the economy and health, with immigration cited by just 6%. Unlike the UK, which operates a first-past-the-post system, Ireland has proportional representation, allowing voters to rank candidates who are then eliminated during descending vote transfer rounds. The Green party, which props up Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael in the incumbent government, is expected to lose some of its 12 seats on a predicted 4% of the vote with Labour slightly ahead at 5% and the Social Democrats in position to emerge as the fourth largest party at 5.8%. Another small party, the rightwing Aont\u00fa, appears to have doubled its vote and may end up with more seats than the Greens. Its leader, Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn, told RT\u00c9 they think Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, two parties that emerged from the ashes of the civil war in the 1920s, were \u201cbecoming one party in many ways\u201d with about 60% of the electorate voting for a smattering of other parties. The survey of about 5,000 voters who had cast their ballot during the day was carried out by Ipsos MRBI for RT\u00c9, the Irish Times, TG4 and Trinity College Dublin. It comes with two strong health warnings \u2013 it reflects first preference votes only and carries a margin of error.",

The same could not be said of January\u2019s rematch at the Etihad, which would go down as one of the Premier League\u2019s great contests. Liverpool arrived unbeaten, seven points above a wobbling City, who had lost three of their last five. The hosts simply had to win but at 0-0 John Stones\u2019 goalline clearance was the moment that defined the razor-thin margins of this title race: Liverpool <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/04/liverpool-manchester-city-brush-off-disappointment-defeat\">were 11.7mm from taking the lead</a>. Roberto Firmino did cancel out Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s opener but Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s clinical finish gave City the edge, despite wave upon wave of Liverpool pressure. The Reds eventually lost out by a solitary point, defeat at the Etihad also denying Klopp\u2019s side an unbeaten season.</p> <h2><strong>2019-</strong><strong>20</strong></h2> <p><strong>1.

Guardiola needed a result to keep Klopp\u2019s unbeaten side in touching distance but they were swept aside in a frantic, bad-tempered battle. Fabinho\u2019s long-range strike set the hosts on their way to a three-goal lead and while Guardiola raged at refereeing decisions, it did not make much difference to the result, or the title race. By the time Liverpool lost a league game \u2013 to Watford in February \u2013 they were 22 points clear of City, the title a formality. And then, Covid came. After a three-month shutdown, the season was played out behind closed doors, and by the time Liverpool visited an empty Etihad in July, the title was already theirs. City breezed to a 4-0 victory that stood in stark contrast to the white-hot intensity of the reverse fixture; in doing so, they did at least help stop Liverpool from passing their 100-point record haul, set in 2018.</p> <h2><strong>2021-</strong><strong>22</strong></h2> <p><strong>1.

The title battle was reignited, even if Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea actually sat top after the draw in October. When Liverpool went to the Etihad in April, the chasing pack were in the distance as City led by a point.

After an even and entertaining first half, clinical goals from Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland took Guardiola\u2019s side top. Arsenal kept fighting but a run of three draws gave City the upper hand, and April\u2019s dominant 4-1 home win, led by Kevin De Bruyne, was a decisive shift in momentum.

      "body": "<p>A woman claims she was conned by a convicted criminal, and another householder says he was threatened by a self-styled hitman after hiring traders through the recommendation website Checkatrade.</p> <p>One of the UK\u2019s largest trader marketplaces, Checkatrade promises customers \u201cguaranteed\u201d traders, \u201crigorous checks\u201d and \u201crecommendations you can rely&nbsp;on\u201d.</p> <p>However, householders are losing thousands of pounds to accredited members because of inadequate vetting procedures, according to some customers and&nbsp;employees.</p> <p>One customer discovered that the workman who pocketed \u00a35,000&nbsp;for a botched roof repair had&nbsp;previously been jailed for violent assault and had an outstanding county court judgment against&nbsp;him. </p> <p>\u201cI was able to discover these things with a simple search using the business owner\u2019s name and address,\u201d said the woman, who preferred not to be named. \u201cHe had advertised his company as a family firm with 25 years\u2019 experience, but it turned out it had only been incorporated five months before and was one of a string of companies he\u2019s set up and dissolved. It was devastating to discover I\u2019d let a violent criminal into my home.\u201d</p> <p>Checkatrade initially paid her \u00a31,000 under its guarantee scheme. Its surveyor costed the repairs for the damage caused by poor workmanship at \u00a35,900 and it later agreed to fund the full sum. She claims her negative feedback of her Checkatrade experience on the review website Trustpilot was removed after the platform reported it as fake.</p> <p>Checkatrade told the Guardian a \u201crare human error\u201d had omitted two of the 12 vetting checks on the trader, and confirmed that his company\u2019s membership had been terminated. It said it only removes customer reviews that contain inaccuracies.</p> <p>Another Checkatrade user claims he was doorstepped by a stranger who threatened unspecified repercussions unless he removed a negative review of a roofing firm he had recruited through the website and that failed to complete the&nbsp;job.</p> <p>\u201cI felt I had no choice but to remove the review and later found that the roof work that had been done was dangerously substandard,\u201d said the customer, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cI complained to Checkatrade but months later the firm was still being&nbsp;listed with a Checkatrade score of nine out of 10 based on customer reviews.\u201d</p> <p>Checkatrade said it had put the trader on immediate probation after the complaint and had since removed it from the platform. It has also paid the customer \u00a31,000 under its guarantee after the Guardian questioned its response. However, he said he was facing a bill of several thousand pounds to complete and repair the botched roofing work.</p> <p>Recommendation platforms were recently ordered to do more to protect customers from cowboy builders by the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority&nbsp;(CMA). The CMA took action after a \u201chigh number\u201d of complaints against traders recruited through sites such as Checkatrade that advertise \u201ctrustworthy\u201d firms. </p>    <p>It is estimated that about 775,500 UK households are left out of pocket by an average of \u00a31,800 each after signing up cowboy traders to improve their homes. Research into unspecified recommendation sites by the CMA found a failure to remove fake reviews, inadequate vetting procedures and a failure to sanction rogue traders.</p> <p>In guidance published this month, it says it expects platforms to comply with consumer law, including investigating and removing recommended traders who prove substandard.</p> <p>Disreputable roofers feature frequently in complaints sent to the Guardian.

      "bodyText": "A woman claims she was conned by a convicted criminal, and another householder says he was threatened by a self-styled hitman after hiring traders through the recommendation website Checkatrade. One of the UK\u2019s largest trader marketplaces, Checkatrade promises customers \u201cguaranteed\u201d traders, \u201crigorous checks\u201d and \u201crecommendations you can rely on\u201d. However, householders are losing thousands of pounds to accredited members because of inadequate vetting procedures, according to some customers and employees. One customer discovered that the workman who pocketed \u00a35,000 for a botched roof repair had previously been jailed for violent assault and had an outstanding county court judgment against him. \u201cI was able to discover these things with a simple search using the business owner\u2019s name and address,\u201d said the woman, who preferred not to be named. \u201cHe had advertised his company as a family firm with 25 years\u2019 experience, but it turned out it had only been incorporated five months before and was one of a string of companies he\u2019s set up and dissolved. It was devastating to discover I\u2019d let a violent criminal into my home.\u201d Checkatrade initially paid her \u00a31,000 under its guarantee scheme. Its surveyor costed the repairs for the damage caused by poor workmanship at \u00a35,900 and it later agreed to fund the full sum. She claims her negative feedback of her Checkatrade experience on the review website Trustpilot was removed after the platform reported it as fake. Checkatrade told the Guardian a \u201crare human error\u201d had omitted two of the 12 vetting checks on the trader, and confirmed that his company\u2019s membership had been terminated. It said it only removes customer reviews that contain inaccuracies. Another Checkatrade user claims he was doorstepped by a stranger who threatened unspecified repercussions unless he removed a negative review of a roofing firm he had recruited through the website and that failed to complete the job. \u201cI felt I had no choice but to remove the review and later found that the roof work that had been done was dangerously substandard,\u201d said the customer, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cI complained to Checkatrade but months later the firm was still being listed with a Checkatrade score of nine out of 10 based on customer reviews.\u201d Checkatrade said it had put the trader on immediate probation after the complaint and had since removed it from the platform. It has also paid the customer \u00a31,000 under its guarantee after the Guardian questioned its response. However, he said he was facing a bill of several thousand pounds to complete and repair the botched roofing work. Recommendation platforms were recently ordered to do more to protect customers from cowboy builders by the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA took action after a \u201chigh number\u201d of complaints against traders recruited through sites such as Checkatrade that advertise \u201ctrustworthy\u201d firms. It is estimated that about 775,500 UK households are left out of pocket by an average of \u00a31,800 each after signing up cowboy traders to improve their homes. Research into unspecified recommendation sites by the CMA found a failure to remove fake reviews, inadequate vetting procedures and a failure to sanction rogue traders. In guidance published this month, it says it expects platforms to comply with consumer law, including investigating and removing recommended traders who prove substandard. Disreputable roofers feature frequently in complaints sent to the Guardian. One woman faced a \u00a313,000 bill to repair damage done to her roof by two sets of cowboy builders, one of them recommended by Checkatrade. She was eventually compensated by Checkatrade for her full loss after our intervention. Checkatrade was launched by a homeowner in 1998 as a register of personally vetted traders after a spate of rogue builders targeted his neighbourhood. It was bought in 2017 by Homeserve, which was taken over by the Canadian asset management group Brookfield in a \u00a34bn deal in 2022. It has 50,000 member traders who pay a membership fee and have to pass 12 checks, including verification of address and qualifications, to be listed. Employees of Checkatrade have claimed on the employer review website Glassdoor that since the takeover a focus on growth above service quality has led to unreliable automated checks on firms and a failure to remove poorly performing operators. Checkatrade denied the allegations and said it had removed 1,000 substandard traders in the past 12 months. It admitted that roofing was a particular challenge requiring industry-wide action and said new and stricter vetting procedures meant it had rejected more than a quarter of membership applications by roofers so far this year. A Checkatrade spokesperson said: \u201cNo platform is immune from our industry\u2019s problem with rogue operators. Checkatrade is still the best way to find a trusted tradesperson. \u201cOur vetting and protections are industry-leading: we monitor and verify more than 600,000 reviews a year and, in the very rare event that something doesn\u2019t go to plan, we offer a guarantee of up to \u00a31,000.

It is a source of immense pride to them that they are from Wales. It should be.

Tight communities, coming together in the face of obstacles that would shatter the morale of all but the most resilient. But after more than 16 years of calling Wales home and covering it as a journalist, I am struck by a great paradox. Though the people of Wales will go 12 rounds with anyone who scorns their country, there is deep down a seeming acceptance among many that it is Wales\u2019s lot to be perpetually treated as less of a nation than Scotland.</p> <p>There are obvious symbolic issues. Wales is the only UK nation not to have any representation on the union flag. And why would it? For all intents and purposes, for much of the past half of a millennium Wales was simply part of England.

Even the very currency in our hands underlines our perceived lesser nationhood. The royal coat of arms (which is everywhere) is <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/coats-arms\">divided into four quadrants</a>: one containing the harp of Ireland, one showing the lion of Scotland and the other two both containing the three lions of England. For Wales, See England indeed.</p> <p>In addition to the symbols are the small insults that Welsh citizens ignore. We routinely get secretaries of state who aren\u2019t Welsh (imagine how the Scots would react to that). There are repeated refusals to name St David\u2019s Day a bank holiday (St Andrew\u2019s has been one since 2006). While the Scots are allowed devolution of justice, policing and rail, the Welsh are deemed not quite grown up enough to control these areas.</p> <p>In July, when our first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/16/vaughan-gething-resigns-first-minister-wales\">Vaughan Gething, was forced to resign</a>, the coverage in the UK news took a back seat to the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/16/gareth-southgate-resigns-as-england-manager-after-euro-2024-final-defeat\">Gareth Southgate had tendered his resignation</a> to the English FA (whose patron is inexplicably the \u201cPrince of Wales\u201d).

Wales has significantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/14/which-uk-nation-has-got-the-longest-nhs-waiting-list\">longer NHS waiting lists</a> than Scotland and England and the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-67616536\">worst education results</a> in the UK.

      "body": "<p>It was a live radio broadcast that made Maggie O\u2019Farrell realise she finally had to tackle her stammer. In 2010, she was just about to appear on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s2n11\">Woman\u2019s Hour</a> when she was unexpectedly asked to read from her Costa prize-winning novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/29/hand-held-mine-maggie-ofarrell\">The Hand That First Held Mine</a>. \u201cI thought, God, I don\u2019t know if I can,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says when we meet in Edinburgh, where she lives with her family. Ever since childhood, O\u2019Farrell has had a stammer. To get through readings at literary events she always sticks to a meticulously rehearsed passage, chosen to make sure it doesn\u2019t include any verbal trip-hazards. But this time she was caught off guard.</p> <p>\u201cJenni Murray looked at me over her half-moon spectacles and then she turned and looked at the producer through the glass,\u201d O\u2019Farrell recalls of her hesitation. To make matters worse, her protagonist was called Elina, which she couldn\u2019t say. \u201cWhy the hell did I call her that?\u201d she remembers thinking. In her panic she decided to refer to Elina as \u201cshe\u201d. To her, the pause felt like an hour, but only her husband, novelist William Sutcliffe, listening nervously at home, noticed. She survived the interview but decided it was time to seek help. She finally started speech therapy in her late 30s.</p> <p>Her latest children\u2019s book, When the Stammer Came to Stay, is all about growing up with a speech disorder. Like her previous two publications for children, Where Snow Angels Go and The Boy Who Lost His Spark, it is gorgeously illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theartworksinc.com/artist/daniela-terrazzini/\">Daniela Jaglenka Terrazzini</a>, whose Flower Fairies-style watercolours give the books a nostalgic feel.</p> <p>Min and her sister Bea are opposites: one messy and chatty, the other neat and thoughtful \u2013 O\u2019Farrell\u2019s working title was The Tidy and Untidy Room. The two sisters are modelled on Maggie (Min) and her younger sister Bridget (Bea), with whom she shared a bedroom. The middle of three girls, O\u2019Farrell was born in Derry, but the family moved to Wales and then Scotland when she was 12. She gave Terrazzini an old photo album from childhood, and Min is illustrated with a mop of curls. \u201cThey are a kind of mixture, they\u2019re both of us, but also neither of us at the same time,\u201d she explains of the characters. One morning, in the story, Min finds she just can\u2019t get her words out properly. Like the two little bears in the AA Milne poem, the sisters are more similar than they thought. \u201cI wanted to write about the idea that everybody lives with difficulties, some more visible than others,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says. \u201cAnd maybe you can actually turn them to your advantage.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be a writer, if I hadn\u2019t also been a stammerer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are in her favourite local cafe, rather than at her home as planned, because her husband and two of her three children have come down with Covid. \u201cIt\u2019s a plague house,\u201d she jokes. Of course, O\u2019Farrell is now famous as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/27/maggie-ofarrell-severe-illness-refigures-you-its-like-passing-through-a-fire\">author of Hamnet</a>, a breathtaking fictionalisation of the death of Shakespeare\u2019s only son from the bubonic plague. It won the Women\u2019s prize for fiction in 2020, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/13/hamnet-review-slick-adaptation-shakespeares-maggie-o-farrell-hamlet\">made into a play</a> by the Royal Shakespeare Company, and is soon to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/30/paul-mescal-and-jessie-buckley-to-star-in-chloe-zhaos-hamnet-maggie-o-farrell\">released as a film</a> starring Jessie Buckley alongside Paul Mescal (of Normal People fame) as Will. In short, it is huge. \u201cGod, no! Not at all,\u201d O\u2019Farrell replies modestly when I ask if her life has been upturned by its success, although that might be about to change when the film comes out next year.</p> <p>She co-wrote the screenplay with the director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao. Filming only finished in September and though she turned down the chance of a cameo appearance, she loved being on set. \u201cIt was really, really fun. I\u2019d be watching the monitor and suddenly I would hear someone say a line and think: \u2018That\u2019s weird, I wrote that.\u2019\u201d People \u2013 well, women, she clarifies \u2013 keep asking her if they can meet Mescal. \u201cHe\u2019s not moving in with me!\u201d she exclaims, laughing.</p> <p>Talking to her over a cinnamon tea, you wouldn\u2019t guess O\u2019Farrell has a stammer. \u201cYou never quite get rid of it,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one really understands why some people do it and why others don\u2019t.\u201d When she was eight she nearly died from encephalitis and spent two years off school. She was told she might never be able to walk again, and still has problems with balance and co-ordination. Although not directly related, the stammer began at around this time. More even than the illness, it is \u201cthe most defining feature of my life\u201d, she says. \u201cIt sort of decided who I could be friends with, what kind of jobs I could do.\u201d</p> <p>As a child with a stammer you become highly attuned to grammar and meaning, she explains. \u201cYou turn into your own editor. You\u2019re doing it all the time in the back of your mind. You think: I can\u2019t say that, so I\u2019m going to have to flip that clause or find a synonym.\u201d She can instantly spot a fellow stammerer. \u201cYou can recognise the strategies and their processing and their thinking. They\u2019ve got all those coping mechanisms.\u201d</p>    <p>In his partly autobiographical novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/29/fiction.davidmitchell\">Black Swan Green</a>, David Mitchell, who also has a stammer, gives his 13-year-old narrator an imaginary hangman in his head who blocks words, so he has to come up with alternatives before anyone thinks he is stupid. For O\u2019Farrell, the danger words are those beginning with L, P, B and, most unhelpfully, M. \u201cYou can call me Maggie,\u201d she taught herself to say, or \u201cI\u2019ve lived in London for 10 years\u201d, when people asked where she was based. (After going to Cambridge University, she worked as a journalist for the newly established Independent on Sunday.)</p> <p>At school she would be bursting with frustration at not being able to read out loud in English classes, and teachers were often surprised at how well she did in exams, because she had been unable to speak up during lessons. She made up for it on the page: \u201cIf you can\u2019t express yourself verbally, or you can\u2019t rely on your spoken voice, having a written voice is like a gift,\u201d she says. \u201cJust watching your pen move and the words come out, it\u2019s like magic.\u201d</p> <p>One of the ideas behind When the Stammer Came to Stay is that disabilities can also give you special powers. Unlike the DayGlo positivity of so many contemporary children\u2019s books, O\u2019Farrell espouses a more old-fashioned \u201cyou\u2019ve got to play the cards you\u2019re dealt\u201d philosophy. She is reluctant to use the word \u201cupside\u201d, but one compensation for her dysfluency is \u201can unerring eye\u201d for jerks. \u201cMy stammer is a divining rod for people who aren\u2019t as kind or as nice as they might be,\u201d she confides. If she started stuttering on a date, for example, it was an immediate red flag. It still happens if someone makes her feel uncomfortable. \u201cThere are things I\u2019ve learned from it that made me into the person I am today,\u201d she says. \u201cCertainly, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be a writer, if I hadn\u2019t also been a stammerer.\u201d</p> <p>Since her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/17/cxxcx-maggie-ofarrell-on-after-youd-gone\">After You\u2019d Gone,</a> was published in 2000, O\u2019Farrell has written nine novels and one memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/23/maggie-o-farrell-17-brushes-with-death-memoir-i-am-i-am-i-am-interview\">I Am, I Am, I Am</a>, a collection of personal essays recalling her \u201c17 brushes with death\u201d. She followed up on the career-defining success of Hamnet with another historical novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/26/the-marriage-portrait-by-maggie-ofarrell-review-a-dark-renaissance-fable\">The Marriage Portrait,</a> in 2022. Set in Renaissance Italy, it tells the story of Lucrezia de\u2019 Medici (the inspiration for Robert Browning\u2019s My Last Duchess) who was possibly poisoned by her husband when she was only 16.</p> <p> She has also turned her hand to writing children\u2019s books, with three in the last four years. Each is dedicated to one of her three children. As lavishly illustrated as a picture book, but with the narrative complexity of a chapter book, they fill what O\u2019Farrell saw as a gap for children between five and 10, to be read aloud or alone by early readers. Why should children stop wanting pictures as soon as they start to read?</p>    <p>Combining magical or supernatural creatures \u2013 angels, noukas and dibbuks \u2013 with everyday childhood worries such as being ill, moving house or having a&nbsp;stammer, O\u2019Farrell\u2019s children\u2019s books don\u2019t shy away from troubling material. Much classic children\u2019s literature, The Tales of Beatrix Potter, for example, is more grim than we remember, she points out. \u201cIf you look at picture books, some of them deal with incredibly dark and challenging themes. I think children need that. They don\u2019t just need butterflies and unicorns and rainbows. Our brains are wired to use narrative to understand things about ourselves and the world.\u201d And she believes young readers can cope with unfamiliar language, recalling Potter\u2019s description of \u201cthe soporific\u201d effects of lettuce on the Flopsy Bunnies. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful word, so why not give children those really beautiful words?\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Farrell believes metaphor is one of the best ways to explain frightening things to children. Her eldest was born with an immunology disorder that means she can have extreme allergic reactions. On one occasion, in the back of an ambulance, O\u2019Farrell comforted her daughter, who was freezing cold (a&nbsp;symptom of anaphylactic shock), by telling her it was just a snow angel putting his wings around her. The snow angel took flight in the family imagination and inspired her first book for children.</p> <p>Although her daughter is now 15, her condition is no less terrifying today. (One of the chapters in I Am, I Am, I Am recalls a harrowing race to A&amp;E on holiday in rural Italy.) \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s harder, because you can\u2019t keep teenagers in the house,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says. \u201cLiving life when there are multiple things in your everyday environment that could potentially kill you is hard, and will always be hard.\u201d</p> <p>The frightening dibbuk that Min sees in the mirror in the new book is a more child-friendly version of Jewish folklore\u2019s malicious Dybbuk (Sutcliffe is Jewish). It is another metaphor for the mortal danger running throughout O\u2019Farrell\u2019s fiction: \u201cthe sense that we\u2019ve all got this scary thing on our shoulder\u201d, she says. O\u2019Farrell\u2019s second book for children, The Boy Who Lost His Spark, was written alongside The Marriage Portrait during lockdown. \u201cWe all lost so much of our spark,\u201d she says now. \u201cWe all had to try to find it again, to embrace life again.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this foray into children\u2019s fiction, she considers herself \u201ca novelist, first and foremost. That\u2019s what I feel is in my DNA.\u201d Having abandoned 20,000 words of a manuscript that she had spent a long time researching but felt \u201cwasn\u2019t actually a novel\u201d, she is deep into another. \u201cThe best book you\u2019re always going to write is the one you can\u2019t not write,\u201d she says. \u201cThe one that\u2019s shouting its name.\u201d All she will say is that it\u2019s \u201cturning out to be long and rather hefty\u201d. She never tells anyone what she is writing about, even her husband. Fed up with the novelist\u2019s habit of spending years alone with a laptop, Sutclifffe has recently qualified as a psychotherapist. He is forbidden from practising at home. In conversation the other day, he asked: \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d O\u2019Farrell tells me, appalled at the therapy speak.</p> <p>The old potting shed in which she wrote Hamnet \u2013 pacing around the garden during the most traumatic scenes \u2013 blew down in a storm shortly after she finished. During lockdown she resorted to hiding in her daughter\u2019s wendy house to write. The shed has been replaced by a smart reconstructed greenhouse with no internet connection. After years of working around small children and school hours, she has trained herself to write in short bursts, and is strict about devoting her mornings to writing. \u201cAll books are written against impossible odds,\u201d she says. \u201cThe odds just change.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>When the Stammer Came to Stay by Maggie O\u2019Farrell, illustrated by Daniela Jaglenka Terrazzini, is published by Walker.

Why should children stop wanting pictures as soon as they start to read? Combining magical or supernatural creatures \u2013 angels, noukas and dibbuks \u2013 with everyday childhood worries such as being ill, moving house or having a stammer, O\u2019Farrell\u2019s children\u2019s books don\u2019t shy away from troubling material. Much classic children\u2019s literature, The Tales of Beatrix Potter, for example, is more grim than we remember, she points out. \u201cIf you look at picture books, some of them deal with incredibly dark and challenging themes. I think children need that. They don\u2019t just need butterflies and unicorns and rainbows. Our brains are wired to use narrative to understand things about ourselves and the world.\u201d And she believes young readers can cope with unfamiliar language, recalling Potter\u2019s description of \u201cthe soporific\u201d effects of lettuce on the Flopsy Bunnies. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful word, so why not give children those really beautiful words?\u201d O\u2019Farrell believes metaphor is one of the best ways to explain frightening things to children. Her eldest was born with an immunology disorder that means she can have extreme allergic reactions. On one occasion, in the back of an ambulance, O\u2019Farrell comforted her daughter, who was freezing cold (a symptom of anaphylactic shock), by telling her it was just a snow angel putting his wings around her. The snow angel took flight in the family imagination and inspired her first book for children. Although her daughter is now 15, her condition is no less terrifying today. (One of the chapters in I Am, I Am, I Am recalls a harrowing race to A&amp;E on holiday in rural Italy.) \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s harder, because you can\u2019t keep teenagers in the house,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says. \u201cLiving life when there are multiple things in your everyday environment that could potentially kill you is hard, and will always be hard.\u201d The frightening dibbuk that Min sees in the mirror in the new book is a more child-friendly version of Jewish folklore\u2019s malicious Dybbuk (Sutcliffe is Jewish). It is another metaphor for the mortal danger running throughout O\u2019Farrell\u2019s fiction: \u201cthe sense that we\u2019ve all got this scary thing on our shoulder\u201d, she says. O\u2019Farrell\u2019s second book for children, The Boy Who Lost His Spark, was written alongside The Marriage Portrait during lockdown. \u201cWe all lost so much of our spark,\u201d she says now. \u201cWe all had to try to find it again, to embrace life again.\u201d Despite this foray into children\u2019s fiction, she considers herself \u201ca novelist, first and foremost. That\u2019s what I feel is in my DNA.\u201d Having abandoned 20,000 words of a manuscript that she had spent a long time researching but felt \u201cwasn\u2019t actually a novel\u201d, she is deep into another. \u201cThe best book you\u2019re always going to write is the one you can\u2019t not write,\u201d she says. \u201cThe one that\u2019s shouting its name.\u201d All she will say is that it\u2019s \u201cturning out to be long and rather hefty\u201d. She never tells anyone what she is writing about, even her husband. Fed up with the novelist\u2019s habit of spending years alone with a laptop, Sutclifffe has recently qualified as a psychotherapist. He is forbidden from practising at home. In conversation the other day, he asked: \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d O\u2019Farrell tells me, appalled at the therapy speak. The old potting shed in which she wrote Hamnet \u2013 pacing around the garden during the most traumatic scenes \u2013 blew down in a storm shortly after she finished. During lockdown she resorted to hiding in her daughter\u2019s wendy house to write. The shed has been replaced by a smart reconstructed greenhouse with no internet connection. After years of working around small children and school hours, she has trained herself to write in short bursts, and is strict about devoting her mornings to writing. \u201cAll books are written against impossible odds,\u201d she says. \u201cThe odds just change.\u201d \u2022 When the Stammer Came to Stay by Maggie O\u2019Farrell, illustrated by Daniela Jaglenka Terrazzini, is published by Walker.

      "body": "<p>A gauge of how Harborough Town\u2019s history-making run to the second round of the FA Cup has captured so many hearts is perhaps best illustrated by the assistant manager and his 11-year-old spaniel, Martha. \u201cI walk my dog every day and never before have people stopped me to say: \u2018Well done on your progress,\u2019\u201d David Staff says. On Sunday the lowest-ranked team left in the competition, 15th in the Southern League Premier Central, the seventh tier, will be backed at Reading by almost 3,500 supporters, about 15% of the Leicestershire market town. \u201cBecause I\u2019m enjoying the attention, she\u2019s getting more walks than ever,\u201d he says, breaking into laughter.</p> <p>The last time Staff received such acclaim was when he conquered the travelator to win the reboot of the TV show Gladiators, from which he has fond memories and a few mementos. \u201cDoom broke my nose in an event,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter I won, the next morning we were all having breakfast with Wolf at the hotel near Shepperton Studios. I\u2019ve got a couple of foam fingers in the loft, my leotard is up on the wall and the \u2018G\u2019 trophy in my office. I don\u2019t put it on work calls because I think it\u2019s a bit too much \u2013 I try to hide it at the bottom of the frame.\u201d</p>    <p>It is approaching 8pm and before running the squad through the plan for the next hour of training, Staff, who has lived in Market Harborough his entire life, is well-placed to discuss how interest has snowballed. \u201cThe Amazon driver is saying: \u2018Good luck at the weekend.\u2019 When we scored against Tonbridge [in the first round], I didn\u2019t want to be in the dugout, I wanted to be in the stand. I saw friends from school: Jimmy Burton, who supported us when 50 people were here.\u201d The queue from the foyer to the bar for the final 500 tickets is another giveaway. Some things never change, though: the co-chairman Peter Dougan will lay out the kit in the away dressing room, as he always does.</p> <p>Here, at the club\u2019s stadium on the edge of town, there are cupcakes in the home changing room to celebrate the goalkeeper Elliott Taylor\u2019s 27th birthday. The roulette wheel of fortune spins on the massage table, determining the next wave of punishments. Taylor, a landscape gardener whose days sometimes start before 5am, embodies a squad that includes bricklayers, project managers, finance brokers, a care worker and a gas fitter. The manager, Mitch Austin, runs a fibre optics company. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an intelligent back four,\u201d says Staff, who works in healthcare. Some players will work on Saturday before travelling south and staying overnight before the game.</p> <p>Harborough, who usually train twice a week, almost didn\u2019t get past the first qualifying round, fighting back from 2-0 down in a replay at eighth-tier Darlaston Town to win 3-2 courtesy of a 97th-minute penalty. In the clubhouse, which doubles up as the boardroom, players make a beeline for Dougan, whose association with the club goes back to 1986. He has played for the men\u2019s, veterans and walking football teams. \u201cChairman, are we getting the tickets today?\u201d asks the midfielder Ben Starkie. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve paid, yes,\u201d replies Dougan, smiling, as he sifts through the 685 tickets players have bought for friends and family.</p>      <p>Austin and Staff, a yin-yang pairing by their own admission, spent Tuesday night at Oakwell taking in Reading\u2019s draw at Barnsley. \u201cWe have a desire to be the best we can but also we cannot be too deluded, so we have to understand who we are and they are, the gap, but try and create more dreams,\u201d says Austin. The amount of video of Reading has helped Harborough do their homework but Taylor has employed another tactic. \u201cI go on Fifa [the video game] to get information, players\u2019 heights \u2013 it is quite useful to have a look.\u201d</p> <p>This run has generated about \u00a3140,000 for a club powered by volunteers, including Laurence Jones, the chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for a grassroots club,\u201d says Dougan. Since Austin, previously assistant at St Ives Town, took charge four years ago he has won two promotions, the second in May, and there has been a seven-fold increase in attendances. \u201cI\u2019ve come from the bottom,\u201d says the 36-year-old of his coaching journey. \u201cYou can\u2019t go any lower than I was: games without linesmen, at Woodford United. I was the third-team manager at Bugbrooke St Michaels \u2026 it was the best job in the world.\u201d</p> <p>The cup run has turned players and staff into local celebrities. Last weekend Austin switched on the Christmas lights in the town. As per Football Association regulations, this week the club held a pre-match press conference. The trip to Reading, the captain Ben Williams says, is the talk of the town, everywhere from his child\u2019s nursery to his barbers. \u201cDean Rushby, the head steward here, a taxi driver, picked up an 80-year-old lady the other week and she said: \u2018Harborough Town, aren\u2019t they doing well?\u2019\u201d says Dougan.</p>        <p>Williams, also a Harborough lad, is the longest-serving player after a dozen years on the books. \u201cLife sentence,\u201d he grins. \u201cI was here when it was a grass pitch and 40 fans.\u201d Now their base comprises two artificial pitches and nine grass pitches, home to 65 teams, from under-fives to disability and girls\u2019 teams. Every weekend more than 900 kids represent Harborough. \u201cOn Sundays, we can have 25 youth matches here,\u201d Jones says proudly. \u201cIt used to be a three-sided pitch on a hill \u2026 there was more grass off the pitch than on it. Now this place is in use seven days a week, a thriving community club. We touch a lot of people\u2019s lives in this town.\u201d</p> <p>Harborough have Bermuda and Tanzania internationals in Jutorre Burgess and Starkie respectively, the latter kicking off the calendar year against Egypt and Mohamed Salah in a warmup game for the Africa Cup of Nations in Cairo.

      "bodyText": "A gauge of how Harborough Town\u2019s history-making run to the second round of the FA Cup has captured so many hearts is perhaps best illustrated by the assistant manager and his 11-year-old spaniel, Martha. \u201cI walk my dog every day and never before have people stopped me to say: \u2018Well done on your progress,\u2019\u201d David Staff says. On Sunday the lowest-ranked team left in the competition, 15th in the Southern League Premier Central, the seventh tier, will be backed at Reading by almost 3,500 supporters, about 15% of the Leicestershire market town. \u201cBecause I\u2019m enjoying the attention, she\u2019s getting more walks than ever,\u201d he says, breaking into laughter. The last time Staff received such acclaim was when he conquered the travelator to win the reboot of the TV show Gladiators, from which he has fond memories and a few mementos. \u201cDoom broke my nose in an event,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter I won, the next morning we were all having breakfast with Wolf at the hotel near Shepperton Studios. I\u2019ve got a couple of foam fingers in the loft, my leotard is up on the wall and the \u2018G\u2019 trophy in my office. I don\u2019t put it on work calls because I think it\u2019s a bit too much \u2013 I try to hide it at the bottom of the frame.\u201d It is approaching 8pm and before running the squad through the plan for the next hour of training, Staff, who has lived in Market Harborough his entire life, is well-placed to discuss how interest has snowballed. \u201cThe Amazon driver is saying: \u2018Good luck at the weekend.\u2019 When we scored against Tonbridge [in the first round], I didn\u2019t want to be in the dugout, I wanted to be in the stand. I saw friends from school: Jimmy Burton, who supported us when 50 people were here.\u201d The queue from the foyer to the bar for the final 500 tickets is another giveaway. Some things never change, though: the co-chairman Peter Dougan will lay out the kit in the away dressing room, as he always does. Here, at the club\u2019s stadium on the edge of town, there are cupcakes in the home changing room to celebrate the goalkeeper Elliott Taylor\u2019s 27th birthday. The roulette wheel of fortune spins on the massage table, determining the next wave of punishments. Taylor, a landscape gardener whose days sometimes start before 5am, embodies a squad that includes bricklayers, project managers, finance brokers, a care worker and a gas fitter. The manager, Mitch Austin, runs a fibre optics company. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an intelligent back four,\u201d says Staff, who works in healthcare. Some players will work on Saturday before travelling south and staying overnight before the game. Harborough, who usually train twice a week, almost didn\u2019t get past the first qualifying round, fighting back from 2-0 down in a replay at eighth-tier Darlaston Town to win 3-2 courtesy of a 97th-minute penalty. In the clubhouse, which doubles up as the boardroom, players make a beeline for Dougan, whose association with the club goes back to 1986. He has played for the men\u2019s, veterans and walking football teams. \u201cChairman, are we getting the tickets today?\u201d asks the midfielder Ben Starkie. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve paid, yes,\u201d replies Dougan, smiling, as he sifts through the 685 tickets players have bought for friends and family. Austin and Staff, a yin-yang pairing by their own admission, spent Tuesday night at Oakwell taking in Reading\u2019s draw at Barnsley. \u201cWe have a desire to be the best we can but also we cannot be too deluded, so we have to understand who we are and they are, the gap, but try and create more dreams,\u201d says Austin. The amount of video of Reading has helped Harborough do their homework but Taylor has employed another tactic. \u201cI go on Fifa [the video game] to get information, players\u2019 heights \u2013 it is quite useful to have a look.\u201d This run has generated about \u00a3140,000 for a club powered by volunteers, including Laurence Jones, the chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for a grassroots club,\u201d says Dougan. Since Austin, previously assistant at St Ives Town, took charge four years ago he has won two promotions, the second in May, and there has been a seven-fold increase in attendances. \u201cI\u2019ve come from the bottom,\u201d says the 36-year-old of his coaching journey. \u201cYou can\u2019t go any lower than I was: games without linesmen, at Woodford United. I was the third-team manager at Bugbrooke St Michaels \u2026 it was the best job in the world.\u201d The cup run has turned players and staff into local celebrities. Last weekend Austin switched on the Christmas lights in the town. As per Football Association regulations, this week the club held a pre-match press conference. The trip to Reading, the captain Ben Williams says, is the talk of the town, everywhere from his child\u2019s nursery to his barbers. \u201cDean Rushby, the head steward here, a taxi driver, picked up an 80-year-old lady the other week and she said: \u2018Harborough Town, aren\u2019t they doing well?\u2019\u201d says Dougan. Williams, also a Harborough lad, is the longest-serving player after a dozen years on the books. \u201cLife sentence,\u201d he grins. \u201cI was here when it was a grass pitch and 40 fans.\u201d Now their base comprises two artificial pitches and nine grass pitches, home to 65 teams, from under-fives to disability and girls\u2019 teams. Every weekend more than 900 kids represent Harborough. \u201cOn Sundays, we can have 25 youth matches here,\u201d Jones says proudly. \u201cIt used to be a three-sided pitch on a hill \u2026 there was more grass off the pitch than on it. Now this place is in use seven days a week, a thriving community club. We touch a lot of people\u2019s lives in this town.\u201d Harborough have Bermuda and Tanzania internationals in Jutorre Burgess and Starkie respectively, the latter kicking off the calendar year against Egypt and Mohamed Salah in a warmup game for the Africa Cup of Nations in Cairo. Then there is Sandro, a shock signing this month. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it, but I don\u2019t mind it,\u201d smiles Starkie. \u201cIf fit and he can pass the ball five yards, the beast will be playing,\u201d Austin says of handing the former Tottenham midfielder a debut. \u201cMatch fitness, he\u2019s lacking, but we\u2019re talking a 17-cap Brazil international.\u201d The story goes that Austin, a Spurs season-ticket holder, floated the idea after meeting the 35-year-old, who is based in Portugal and joined his teammates at training for the first time on Wednesday, in a hospitality box at the north London derby in September.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago I went on a pilgrimage to West Lulworth in Dorset. My wife, Linda, came with me. I stood on the shore beside the geographically fascinating <a href=\"https://englandscoast.com/en/listing/stair-hole-jurassic-coast\">Stair Hole</a> and shouted: \u201cCandice Marie, you are standing on sedimentary limestone!\u201d To which Linda, who had walked up to the top of the cliff, duly replied: \u201cI can\u2019t hear you, Keith.\u201d After which we went to Corfe Castle and had a theatrical row about who got to hold the guidebook before going in search of the dungeons.</p> <p>To be clear, this was no marital tiff \u2013 rather, it was a reenactment of one of our favourite movies, Mike Leigh\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/nuts-in-may-1976\">Nuts in May</a></strong> (Internet Archive). The story of a would-be idyllic camping holiday that turns into a social nightmare for pompous Keith Pratt (Roger Sloman) and his infantalised wife, Candice Marie (Alison Steadman), <em>Nuts in May</em>, first broadcast as a BBC <em>Play for Today</em> in January 1976, is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Linda bought me a copy on VHS after I\u2019d had back surgery in the 90s and could do nothing but lie on the floor. I laughed so hard I nearly put myself back in hospital.</p>    <p>Born in 1943, raised in Salford and as productive as ever in his 80s, Leigh has created work as diverse as the Palme d\u2019Or-winning family drama <em>Secrets &amp; Lies</em> (1996) and the grand-scale historical epic <strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/peterloo\">Peterloo</a></strong> (2018), running the gamut from side-splitting comedy to heartbreaking tragedy and all points in between. Take his latest film, <em>Hard Truths</em> (2024), which opens in the UK in the new year. The last feature to be shot by Leigh\u2019s longtime cinematographer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/29/dick-pope-obituary\">Dick Pope</a>, who died in October, it focuses on Pansy focuses on Pansy \u2013 brilliantly played by Marianne Jean-Baptiste \u2013 a tortured soul whose bitterness and anger are gradually revealed to be symptoms of an underlying trauma and deep-seated depression.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The director has retained a surprisingly optimistic enthusiasm for humanity. \u2018I like making people laugh,\u2019 he once told me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pansy plays like the flip side of Sally Hawkins\u2019s relentlessly upbeat Poppy in <strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/happy-go-lucky\">Happy-Go-Lucky</a></strong> (2008); indeed, <em>Hard Truths</em> could have been called Unhappy-Go-Unlucky. Yet both films share the same humanist traits that run through all of Leigh\u2019s work, depicting three-dimensional characters whose circumstances and situations have been meticulously thought through by the director and his cast.</p> <p>Leigh\u2019s creative method, for which he originally used the term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/devised-and-directed-by-mike-leigh-9781501307256/\">devised and directed</a>\u201d rather than \u201cwritten and directed\u201d, is a singular process that involves assembling a group of actors and getting them to research and develop their characters in detail, guided by the writer-director. Gradually, Leigh discovers, or perhaps uncovers, the story and dialogue of the film \u2013 a writing process that has resulted in a string of perfectly crafted dramas with an uncanny element of verisimilitude. Each player is completely immersed in their role, and each turn of events provokes reactions that are utterly believable.</p>    <p>When Timothy Spall played JMW Turner in <strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/mr-turner\">Mr Turner</a></strong> (2014), his research involved reading everything he could find on the nature of light, and learning to paint \u2013 something that has since become a passion. Similarly, when creating the Venice Golden Lion-winning <strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/vera-drake\">Vera Drake</a></strong> (2004), in which Imelda Staunton plays a 1950s woman who performs illegal abortions, none of the cast members playing Vera\u2019s family knew the true subject of the drama until they workshopped a scene in which the police unexpectedly arrive to arrest Vera. The sense of shock was, apparently, palpable.</p> <p>The breadth of Leigh\u2019s films is remarkable. Who else could have gone from the intimate double-act drama of <strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/career-girls/umc.cmc.qyu2p492haladqae5m6ukbkk\">Career Girls</a></strong> (1997; Apple TV+), with stellar performances by Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman, to the vast musical-theatre period canvas of <em>Topsy-Turvy </em>(1999), and then back to the smaller-scale modern-day troubles of <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Nothing-Timothy-Spall/dp/B09L3QLD4N\">All or Nothing</a></strong> (2002; Amazon Prime Video) without ever losing that crucial sense of authenticity? And who else could have drawn from David Thewlis the defining nihilistic role of Johnny in <strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/naked-1993\">Naked</a></strong><em> </em>(1993), a film that harks back to some of the darkest themes of Leigh\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/meantime/umc.cmc.6kor2wlihrw2zfpojx85agpwt\">Meantime</a></strong> (1983; Apple TV+), while prophetically looking forward to a vituperative strain of disenfranchised masculinity that has since proliferated in the modern world?</p>    <p>Over the years I\u2019ve interviewed Leigh several times, and we\u2019ve talked about films that deal with poverty, bereavement, depression, abortion, even historical massacres. Yet through it all, the director has retained a surprisingly optimistic enthusiasm for humanity. \u201cI like making people laugh,\u201d he once told me cheekily when we were deep in a discussion about his intense dramatic process. He was teasing me, but he <em>has </em>made me laugh so much over the years; from the toe-curling farce of the 1977 classic <strong><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/abigails-party-1977\">Abigail\u2019s Party</a></strong><em> </em>(\u201cTony, d\u2019you like olives? No, they\u2019re horrible, aren\u2019t they?\u201d), available on Internet Archive, to the menu of the Regret Rien restaurant \u2013 Liver in Lager; Prune Quiche; Pork Cyst \u2013 in 1990\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Sweet-Stephen-Rea/dp/B011BUAVPG\">Life Is Sweet</a></strong><em> </em>(Amazon Prime) and the deranged driving instructor of <em>Happy-Go-Lucky</em> (\u201cEn Ra Ha! EN RA HA!\u201d).</p> <p>As Leigh has always understood, comedy and tragedy are real-life bedfellows. In his films we find both, truthfully intertwined.</p> <ul> <li><p>All titles in bold are widely available to stream unless otherwise specified.</p></li> </ul> <h2>What I\u2019m also enjoying</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00255dq/cheaters-series-2-episode-1\">Cheaters</a> <br></strong>(BBC One/iPlayer)<br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/13/actor-susan-wokoma-emma-thompson-chewing-gum-never-have-i-ever-chichester-theatre\">Susan Wokoma</a> is fabulous in the second series of this compellingly frank relationship comedy, all eight episodes of which I binged in a single sitting. Unshackled from their previous partners, Fola and Josh face up to life without the cheating \u2013 with very different results. Bite-size episodes make this addictively moreish viewing.</p>    <p><strong>Layla <br></strong>(in UK and Irish cinemas now)<strong><br></strong>Amrou Al-Kadhi\u2019s sparkling feature debut may be a very personal tale but it has universal appeal, touching on themes that will resonate regardless of age, race, gender or sexuality. Bilal Hasna tears it up as the non-binary British-Palestinian drag artist whose life is turned upside down through an unexpected liaison with Louis Greatorex\u2019s more \u201cconventional\u201d Max. Pizzazz with depth.</p>",

When Timothy Spall played JMW Turner in Mr Turner (2014), his research involved reading everything he could find on the nature of light, and learning to paint \u2013 something that has since become a passion. Similarly, when creating the Venice Golden Lion-winning Vera Drake (2004), in which Imelda Staunton plays a 1950s woman who performs illegal abortions, none of the cast members playing Vera\u2019s family knew the true subject of the drama until they workshopped a scene in which the police unexpectedly arrive to arrest Vera. The sense of shock was, apparently, palpable. The breadth of Leigh\u2019s films is remarkable. Who else could have gone from the intimate double-act drama of Career Girls (1997; Apple TV+), with stellar performances by Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman, to the vast musical-theatre period canvas of Topsy-Turvy (1999), and then back to the smaller-scale modern-day troubles of All or Nothing (2002; Amazon Prime Video) without ever losing that crucial sense of authenticity? And who else could have drawn from David Thewlis the defining nihilistic role of Johnny in Naked (1993), a film that harks back to some of the darkest themes of Leigh\u2019s Meantime (1983; Apple TV+), while prophetically looking forward to a vituperative strain of disenfranchised masculinity that has since proliferated in the modern world? Over the years I\u2019ve interviewed Leigh several times, and we\u2019ve talked about films that deal with poverty, bereavement, depression, abortion, even historical massacres. Yet through it all, the director has retained a surprisingly optimistic enthusiasm for humanity. \u201cI like making people laugh,\u201d he once told me cheekily when we were deep in a discussion about his intense dramatic process. He was teasing me, but he has made me laugh so much over the years; from the toe-curling farce of the 1977 classic Abigail\u2019s Party (\u201cTony, d\u2019you like olives? No, they\u2019re horrible, aren\u2019t they?\u201d), available on Internet Archive, to the menu of the Regret Rien restaurant \u2013 Liver in Lager; Prune Quiche; Pork Cyst \u2013 in 1990\u2019s Life Is Sweet (Amazon Prime) and the deranged driving instructor of Happy-Go-Lucky (\u201cEn Ra Ha! EN RA HA!\u201d). As Leigh has always understood, comedy and tragedy are real-life bedfellows. In his films we find both, truthfully intertwined. All titles in bold are widely available to stream unless otherwise specified. What I\u2019m also enjoying Cheaters (BBC One/iPlayer) Susan Wokoma is fabulous in the second series of this compellingly frank relationship comedy, all eight episodes of which I binged in a single sitting. Unshackled from their previous partners, Fola and Josh face up to life without the cheating \u2013 with very different results. Bite-size episodes make this addictively moreish viewing. Layla (in UK and Irish cinemas now) Amrou Al-Kadhi\u2019s sparkling feature debut may be a very personal tale but it has universal appeal, touching on themes that will resonate regardless of age, race, gender or sexuality. Bilal Hasna tears it up as the non-binary British-Palestinian drag artist whose life is turned upside down through an unexpected liaison with Louis Greatorex\u2019s more \u201cconventional\u201d Max. Pizzazz with depth.",

Armitage\u2019s haiku, Web, celebrates the silky but deadly threads that spiders \u201cdarn\u201d in the hedges at the Lost Gardens of Heligan and was unveiled together with an illuminated 2-metre recreation of a walnut orb-weaver spider as part of a midwinter night trail.

      "body": "<p>When it comes to beauty, we\u2019re living in an era of contradictions. We\u2019re constantly told to love ourselves and embrace our \u201cflaws\u201d, yet it\u2019s never been more normalised to tweak the bits of our faces we don\u2019t like that much. Public figures are regularly shamed for getting more and more work done, yet beauty standards increasingly demand we all look younger and smoother and more symmetrical.</p> <p>Is this messing with our self-image? What does it actually even mean to be beautiful now? Eleven public figures \u2013 from an aesthetician and a drag queen, to a makeup artist and an academic \u2013 open up about what they see when they look in the mirror, and get candid about the products, treatments and procedures it\u2019s taken to get them to this point.</p>    <h2><strong>\u2018It took three rounds with a doctor to dissolve all my filler\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Ashley Stob</em><em>art, 34, podcaster</em></p> <p>I\u2019ve spent more than \u00a3135,000 on my face. I was 22 when I got my first surgery \u2013 my nose. That was actually quite cheap, \u00a33,500! And I hit peak filler around 25. Back then, I worked in sales for a cosmetic surgery company, and if there was filler left over at the end of the day, it would be like: \u201cRight, who\u2019s next?\u201d I was getting treatments every month. I didn\u2019t know filler wouldn\u2019t disappear. I just thought I\u2019m having it done and it\u2019s going to go away, and then I\u2019ll get more.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until my last pregnancy that I truly saw what all those injections had done. Pregnancy meant no treatments, and with the water retention, my face was massive. The hyaluronic acid that fillers are made of attracts water, and my face was so swollen I barely recognised myself. Seeing my reflection was a shock. I thought: <em>\u201cWhat have you done? You\u2019re so stupid.\u201d</em> I decided right then: I was done with fillers, for good.</p> <p>It took three rounds with the doctor to get it all dissolved. I was left with loose skin around my jaw and mouth \u2013 you could pull four centimetres of it away from my face. So I decided to get a facelift. Some surgeons told me that, at 34, I was \u201ctoo young\u201d, but finally I found one who would do it. It took nine hours, and despite my dissolving sessions he was still picking bits of old filler out of my face, green balls of it. Thinking about it is horrendous.</p> <p>If you saw me nine years ago, when I was in my filler phase, you\u2019d probably think I was just some bimbo. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t get certain jobs or attracted the wrong kind of people. Now, I\u2019m happy with my face. I feel I look more natural. I would love to see what I\u2019d look like if I hadn\u2019t had anything done, but we will never know. Maybe my kids do look like me \u2013 I don\u2019t know!</p> <p>Having children has changed my perspective a bit. I don\u2019t just have myself to think about, so my focus is mainly my health these days \u2013 to be able to run around with my kids and live longer. I take a lot of supplements and do a lot of cold therapy. I still love procedures and treatments, though. There\u2019s this misconception that people get surgery because they\u2019re unconfident or unhappy, but for me, it\u2019s just for fun. I\u2019ve had an eyebrow lift, upper eyelid lifts, polynucleotide injections (yes, salmon sperm) \u2026 I\u2019ll admit it, I\u2019m vain. I will be getting laser even on my toes and knees at some point, because I just don\u2019t want to age gracefully. I want to look young for ever.

I get Botox and I have a little bit of filler in my mid-face, jawline, chin and around my smile lines. It\u2019s where the bone, as you age, tends to recess, and the filler maintains volume. I\u2019ve done lots of laser facials. I\u2019ve had Morpheus8 microneedling to tighten the skin. I\u2019ve injected Profhilo (hyaluronic acid) to moisturise, and DNA from salmon sperm, which helps with crinkliness under the eyes.</p> <p>I inject most things myself \u2013 I don\u2019t find it weird, I used to operate on people and see their insides, so I\u2019m not very squeamish. The one treatment I don\u2019t do on myself is filler, because what you see in the mirror isn\u2019t necessarily what someone looking at you might see. It\u2019s a nightmare for anybody injecting me. I\u2019m always paranoid that they\u2019re going to do something wrong.</p>    <p>I\u2019ve never been hung up on my facial features. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the best looking person ever and I\u2019m comfortable with that. Before I started doing aesthetics, I didn\u2019t even use a moisturiser. Now, being in the field, I\u2019m more exposed to treatments than your regular person. I can inject a wee bit of something on a Friday night; I have an interventional attitude. I was losing my hair a lot after the lockdown \u2013 it had started to really bother me. I looked so much older and less attractive \u2013 and I didn\u2019t think twice about having a hair transplant.</p> <p>I do worry<strong> </strong>about teenagers now. There are unrealistic ideals pushed on social media. I think that some clinicians and injectors are to blame for this. The industry needs to focus on looking after the health of your skin rather than being so looks-focused. I think that a lot of people come into working in this industry because they have unresolved issues with body dysmorphia. I think they see their clients through that dysmorphic eye.</p> <p>I like to think I have quite a good eye with people. I\u2019d also like to think that I\u2019d be able to tell if <em>I</em> was looking overly done. But every year you go to the same aesthetics conference and you see practitioners becoming more and more filled and more alien \u2013 that is quite terrifying.</p>    <h2><strong>Most used</strong><strong> products</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://formnutrition.com/plant-based-nutrition/radiant-vegan-collagen-support/\">Form Radiant Hair Skin </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://formnutrition.com/plant-based-nutrition/radiant-vegan-collagen-support/\">&amp; Nails supplement</a></strong>, \u00a339 for 60 capsules; <strong><a href=\"https://onlyskincare.com/obagi-elastiderm-eye-cream\">Obagi Elastiderm Eye Cream</a></strong>, \u00a376, 15ml.

I look up and down and pretend to smile, to keep my muscles taut. Other than that, I don\u2019t think much about my face. I\u2019m lucky that I have high cheekbones, and people admire my eyes. I rarely even bother with makeup. I suppose my cheeks are much thinner at 96 than they were when I was 25, and I have more lines \u2013 but I like some of those changes. I\u2019ve had a lot of experience, and you can see that in my face. I\u2019ve got frowning lines and smiling lines. Hopefully more of the latter.</p>    <p>I modelled in my early 20s, but then I gave it up to have children. When I was 70, I was scouted on the street, and that\u2019s when my career really took off. At a time when most women become invisible, I suddenly got a lot of attention \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s why I don\u2019t have a problem with the ageing process. But I also think my lack of concern has to do with the way I was raised. Gazing in the mirror all the time was seen as vain and silly when I was young. It was considered rather shameful to be constantly thinking about yourself. When I catch myself fretting about the way I look, I tell myself firmly to \u201cget on with it\u201d. I only ever look in the mirror to brush my teeth these days. I\u2019m also losing my eyesight, so I can\u2019t see properly when I do attempt to do a bit of gazing. Perhaps that\u2019s for the best!</p> <p>I would never have Botox or any kind of plastic surgery. Quite apart from anything else, I don\u2019t have the money for that sort of thing. But even if I was offered a free facelift, I would turn it down, because you have to accept what life has given you. I\u2019ve seen people with facelifts, and they lose all expression. I\u2019d hate that. I can\u2019t even be bothered to put lots of different creams on my face. It\u2019s too much effort.</p> <p>The only \u201ctreatment\u201d I ever get done regularly is to get the hairs plucked out of my chin. I have a few, now I\u2019m in my 90s, and they\u2019re very annoying. My daughter helps me pluck them out. The only problem is she lives far away from me, so I can\u2019t get hold of her very often. I have another daughter who lives closer to me, but she\u2019s not so handy with the tweezers.<br><em>Interview: Kitty Drake</em></p>    <h2><strong>Most used products</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/nivea-creme-200ml-10000734\">Nivea moisturiser</a></strong>, \u00a35.99, 200ml</p> <h2><strong>Treatments </strong></h2> <p><strong>None</strong></p> <h2><strong>Procedures</strong></h2> <p><strong>None</strong></p>    <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s so defemini</strong><strong>sing having your skin peel off\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Aramid</em><em>\u00e9 Onashoga</em><em>, </em><em>33</em><em>, model and eczema advocate</em></p> <p>When my eczema flares up on my face, I feel ugly. It presents as severe, painful rashes that then turn into flaking skin. It\u2019s so defeminising having your skin peel off, dark patches and thickened skin. It is something that you\u2019re just always conscious of, because you cannot hide your face. And it\u2019s so sore.</p> <p>People lack empathy about it, because it\u2019s not something they\u2019ve experienced. And I think having a skin condition on dark skin brings unique problems. Your melanin helps disguise it. It makes it hard for people to understand. For example, you might know your face is flared up, and then someone might start analysing your appearance, commenting: \u201cOh, you look so much darker than the last time I saw you. Every time I see you, you look darker and darker.\u201d Bro, my skin condition is flaring up!</p>    <p>It\u2019s why I started modelling: I was looking up pictures of black skin with eczema on Google and nothing was coming up. Now my passion is doing shoots that capture and highlight my eczema. They build my self-confidence and provide representation for many others dealing with skin conditions. Me being on a set in the first instance teaches clients how to manage models with skin conditions, increasing understanding of invisible disabilities in the industry.</p> <p>I do love trying beauty treatments. I\u2019ve had PRP (platelet-rich plasma injections), where they take blood out of your arm, spin it to separate the platelets, and then inject the concentrated platelets back into you to help with skin regeneration. And I had HA fillers (hyaluronic acid) injected into my lips for cellular hydration. I had severe dryness there and it helped with that.</p> <p>I saw a big change in my beauty regime about five years ago. I had been taking steroids as a sticking paster for my eczema. But they don\u2019t treat the root cause, and they\u2019re only supposed to be used in the short term. I\u2019d used them for years. They were actually making everything worse. I had a health scare: all my lymph nodes were swollen. It took two years to come off the steroids. Now my focus is wellbeing rather than aesthetics. I try to avoid stress, I eat healthily. I\u2019ve learned my triggers. I actually understand my condition now. And I\u2019ve accepted it\u2019s part of who I am.</p>    <h2><strong>Most used products</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/bioderma-sensibio-cleansing-micellar-water-sensitive-skin-250ml-10202361\">Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water</a></strong>, \u00a313, 250ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/the-inkey-list-hyaluronic-acid-serum-30ml/14272886/\">The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum</a></strong>, gifted, \u00a39, 30ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/byoma-brightening-serum-30ml/13521360/\">Byoma Brightening Serum</a></strong>, \u00a312.99, 30ml; <strong>Shea Butter With Evening Primrose Oil</strong>, \u00a310 to \u00a315; <strong><a href=\"https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/topicals-slick-salve-mint-lip-balm-15ml\">Topicals Slick Salve Mint Lip Balm</a></strong>, \u00a314, 15ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/the-ordinary-alpha-arbutin-2-ha-60ml/13280238/\">The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA</a></strong>, \u00a318.50, 60ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/the-inkey-list-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/14272887/\">The Inkey List Vitamin C Serum</a></strong>, \u00a312, 30ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/la-roche-posay-anthelios-uvmune-400-dermo-pediatrics-invinsible-spray-kids-spf-50-200ml/15082973/\">La Roche-Posay Anthelios </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/la-roche-posay-anthelios-uvmune-400-dermo-pediatrics-invinsible-spray-kids-spf-50-200ml/15082973/\">SPF50+</a></strong>, \u00a323.90, 200ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/supergoop-unseen-sunscreen-spf30-50ml/15237904/\">Supergoop!

Some people say I have a large nose, but in my family, it\u2019s the smallest, so I feel quite good about that. In the 70s, I shaved my eyebrows off, and they never came back. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019d microblade. If it looks too dark, you\u2019re stuck, so I just paint them in.</p> <p>I get excited by skincare. I have two bathrooms in London full of products \u2013 I love trying out new things. About four years ago, I started having facials. I used to think they were overrated, but they\u2019ve changed my life. I thought my skin was good, but then I saw what happens with a hydrating facial, or even just a great lymphatic drainage massage.</p>    <p>I had filler in my cheeks, but didn\u2019t like it \u2013 I looked like a chipmunk. Just before the pandemic, an aesthetician convinced me to try lip filler. I knocked on my best friend\u2019s door, and she went: \u201cOh, my God, what have you done? You\u2019ve got a trout pout!\u201d It looked awful. Thank God for masks in lockdown; they got me through those six months.</p> <p>These days, I get Profhilo injections in my face for volume, and about a month before I do Glow Up, I get a little Botox around my eyes and in my \u201cdivorce line\u201d on my forehead \u2013 it just makes me look a bit friendlier. Otherwise I have resting bitch face. Before the pandemic I was getting Botox every three months, but I do it less and less now because I quite like the movement in my face and I feel as if I don\u2019t need it, although I am getting older so I probably do.</p> <p>I love being the age that I am, because I\u2019ve got so much experience behind me. I\u2019m not fearful like I was in my 20s. I like wearing makeup and I like not wearing makeup. I remember going on Instagram with no makeup once. Some friends said: \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d But we don\u2019t live in a super-airbrushed world.

I feel quite exposed. But it\u2019s also quite liberating. And it was nice not having to arrive at the photoshoot three hours early to get into makeup.</p>    <p>For me it\u2019s this armour that allows me to be a heightened, more confident version of myself. I was a chubby, round kid. It was makeup that helped me learn to love myself. I was 14 when I first bought some and obsessed with watching America\u2019s Next Top Model. I loved my high cheekbones, I still do \u2013 although there\u2019s a little bit of filler in there now \u2026</p> <p>I\u2019ve had filler in my lips, jawline and chin too. I\u2019ve got composite veneers. My eyebrows I shave off for work. I have transfer tattoo eyebrows on, I buy them in bulk from Ali Express. I started Botox when I was 19. I think the sooner you start the better \u2013 do it before the wrinkles even get a chance to form!</p> <p>When you\u2019ve had lots of procedures people feel like they\u2019re allowed to comment on your appearance. Somebody messaged me on a dating app the other day and said, \u201cOh, you look so much better without your lips.\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cWell, the lips are for me. They\u2019re not for you, darling. Everything I do is for myself, my own enjoyment.\u201d </p>    <p>Most of the time, the way I look at beauty, I feel like a canvas. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/25/pete-burns-obituary\">Pete Burns</a> took it to the extreme, but he\u2019s an absolute icon of mine and his attitude was, \u201cIt\u2019s no one else\u2019s business.

It\u2019s not that I was ever unhappy with my face, it\u2019s more, \u201cOoh, this cheekbone could be a bit bigger.\u201d And because it\u2019s mainly fillers, most can be dissolved in a day. I\u2019ll ruin what I want to ruin, it\u2019s mine. The one treatment I did get because of an insecurity was my hair transplant. This sounds dramatic, but losing your hair feels like being stripped of your identity. People say, \u201cGo bold and embrace it\u201d, but you wouldn\u2019t say that to a woman, would you? </p> <p>Right now, my focus is skincare. I\u2019m starring in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and sometimes have two shows a day. My poor face goes through it because I have to shave every day, sometimes twice a day on a two-show day, and I\u2019m wearing so much makeup. I play two characters, so I have makeup changes in the show as well. I have to go heavy on the moisturiser. Sometimes I wonder what I\u2019d look like if I didn\u2019t take care of my skin. <br><em>The Vivienne is playing </em><em>the Childcatcher in a nationwide tour of </em><em>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</em></p>    <h2><strong>Most used products</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/clarins-super-restorative-day-cream-all-skin-types--50ml-10314952\">Clarins Super Restorative Day Cream</a></strong>, \u00a382, 50ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/clarins-multi-active-night-cream-all-skin-types--10339792\">Clarins Multi-Active Night Cream</a></strong>, \u00a352, 50ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/clarins-double-serum-30ml-10350700\">Clarins Double Serum</a></strong>, \u00a365, 30ml; <strong><a href=\"https://lpa.london/product/complexion-renewal-pads\">ZO Skin Health</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://lpa.london/product/complexion-renewal-pads\"> Complexion Renewal Pads</a></strong>, \u00a345.10 for 60 pads; <strong><a href=\"https://www.montclairelondon.co.uk/product-page/exfoliating-polish\">ZO Skin Health </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.montclairelondon.co.uk/product-page/exfoliating-polish\">Exfoliating Polish</a></strong>, \u00a355, 65g; <strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/elemis-pro-collagen-cleansing-balm-100g-10321086\">Elemis Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm</a></strong>, \u00a349, 100g; <strong>Biotin </strong><strong>supplements for hair</strong>, \u00a35 to \u00a315 a month; <strong><a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007335833077.html\">eyebrow </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007335833077.html\">tattoo stickers</a></strong>, about \u00a31 for 10 sets</p> <h2><strong>Treatments </strong></h2> <p><strong>Sophia Bailey hydrofacials</strong>, gifted, \u00a3120, monthly; <strong>LVL lash lift</strong>, \u00a380, occasionally</p> <h2><strong>Procedures</strong></h2> <p><strong>Botox</strong>, gifted, \u00a3200, every six months; <strong>fillers in lips, chin, jaw, nose, cheeks</strong>, gifted, \u00a3600 to \u00a3800, every six months; <strong>hair transplant</strong> at Hair Transplant Liverpool, gifted, about \u00a36,000; <strong>composite veneers</strong>, gifted, \u00a35,000</p>    <h2><strong>\u2018My forehead reduction left me with bruising all over my face\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Meryl Williams, </em><em>28</em><em>, digital creator and </em><em>winner of The Traitors season one</em></p> <p>I used to be so self-conscious of my forehead. I hated getting photographs taken. I wouldn\u2019t even wash my face in front of anyone, because I would have to pull my hair back to do it. Even when I watched myself back on The Traitors, all I could think was: \u201cOh my God, my forehead.\u201d I hyper-fixated on it and thought it was all anyone thought about when they talked to me.</p>    <p>It is a symptom of a condition I have called achondroplasia, which also causes me to have shorter arms and legs. Having this condition, I\u2019ve had to accept there are things that I can\u2019t change. It\u2019s not like I can wake up and magically be 5ft 5in. But when I won nearly \u00a335,000 on the reality show and discovered I could get surgery to make my forehead smaller, I saw it as an opportunity to alter something that made me insecure and that I<em> could </em>change about myself.</p> <p>It took three weeks for me to heal after my forehead reduction. It\u2019s done by removing a strip of skin to lower the hairline<strong> </strong>and it left me with bruising all over my face. It looked as if I\u2019d fallen down a hill! Recovery from that was nothing compared with other facial surgery I\u2019ve had for my condition though. I got double jaw surgery when I was 22, because my teeth didn\u2019t close. Doctors broke the jaw, and then they removed part of the bones, put metal plates on the top and bottom jaw, and fused it back together. When I woke up after surgery, my mouth was wired closed. It was gruesome. I wouldn\u2019t get it done ever again.</p> <p>I get some negative comments on social media about the forehead reduction from people who think I\u2019ve not accepted myself or my condition. I have. It was just this one aspect of my face I didn\u2019t like. The result is probably barely noticeable to anyone else, but it has really helped improve my confidence.</p> <p>I think when it comes to beauty standards things are obviously better now than they were when I was growing up. There\u2019s so much advancement in the way people view disabilities, but I think people still find dwarfism \u201cfunny\u201d. Every day someone will stare, point or laugh at me. It\u2019s really embarrassing and frustrating. Most of the time I can brush it off \u2013 I\u2019ve dealt with it my whole life and I\u2019ll probably have to deal with it for the rest of my life. But it makes me sad. I feel as if I\u2019m in a losing battle. I hope that society can become more accepting.<br><em>Meryl Williams is </em><em>cohost of the podcast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClAQbGu0YVbFaU0M2EQyt3A\">You </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClAQbGu0YVbFaU0M2EQyt3A\">&amp; Me</a></em></p>    <h2><strong>Most used products</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.clinique.co.uk/product/1673/106898/skin-care/cleansers-makeup-removers/take-the-day-offtm-charcoal-cleansing-balm\">Clinique Take </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.clinique.co.uk/product/1673/106898/skin-care/cleansers-makeup-removers/take-the-day-offtm-charcoal-cleansing-balm\">the Day Off Charcoal Cleansing Balm</a></strong>, \u00a334, 125ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/pixi-glow-tonic-glycolic-acid-toner-250ml/11200055/\">Pixi Glow Tonic</a></strong>, \u00a318, 250ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/simple-kind-to-skin-replenishing-rich-moisturiser-23279011\">Simple moisturiser</a></strong>, \u00a32.50, 125ml</p> <h2><strong>Treatments </strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/veet-face-hair-removal-kit-sensitive-skin-2x50ml-10205668\">Veet Pure Hair Removal Kit </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/veet-face-hair-removal-kit-sensitive-skin-2x50ml-10205668\">for Face</a> </strong>used on upper lip, \u00a37.49, 2 x 50ml; <strong>micropeeling and hydrating facials</strong>, gifted, about \u00a3100</p> <h2><strong>Procedures</strong></h2> <p><strong>Forehead reduction</strong>, \u00a37,500; <strong>jaw realignment</strong>, free on NHS; <strong>Botox in </strong><strong>forehead</strong> (not for ageing, but required after the forehead reduction), about \u00a3150 to \u00a3175, every three to six months; <strong>lip</strong><strong> filler</strong>, 2 sets of 1.5ml, \u00a3150</p>    <h2><strong>\u2018I can\u2019t be anyone other than myself\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Dr Radha Modgil, </em><em>45</em><em>, Radio </em><em>1 doctor and broadcaster</em></p> <p>I remember the first time someone, for TV, put a lot of makeup on me, straightened my hair and made me look like \u201ceverybody else\u201d. I looked in the mirror and thought: \u201cOh my God, who is this?\u201d</p>    <p>I trained as a doctor, and sort of fell into doing TV and broadcasting. For me, it was going into this new world where everyone was aesthetically driven. I was around a lot of people who looked much slimmer than me, had much more makeup on, had more procedures, and their hair was really slick and tidy, and mine was really crazy and fluffy. For the first four or five years, and probably even now to a degree, I\u2019d look at other people and think: \u201cI wish I looked like them.\u201d And I\u2019ve been encouraged to try to look like them, too: \u201cCan you calm your hair down?\u201d</p> <p>What I\u2019ve learned as I\u2019ve gotten older is that even if I was to put 365 days of the year into trying, I couldn\u2019t look like these other people. So what is the point in trying? I can\u2019t be anyone other than myself. And I think it\u2019s important for me to show up authentically. A lot of the work I do, and a lot of what needs to change in the industry, is to allow people to see reality. If I\u2019m showing up to do that orange and shiny, I\u2019m part of the problem.</p> <p>There\u2019s a danger that beauty has become a template \u2013 \u201cYou must look like this to be beautiful\u201d, in terms of eyebrows, face shape, you know, different products used. I have moments when I think about my nose being too big or worry about my asymmetrical eyebrows. I get angry about it all sometimes, how the beauty industry encourages low self-esteem in order to sell products, how young people are bombarded with these images of \u201cperfect\u201d people. It\u2019s such an insidious thing. We grow up with an idea of beauty, we believe it, we try to follow it, and then, if we\u2019re lucky, we have to unlearn it. It seems like such a waste of time. And it\u2019s very difficult to step out of the box and say: \u201cThis is who I am. I\u2019m not going to conform to what you tell me I should be doing when it comes to being beautiful\u201d.</p>    <h2><strong>Most used products</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/garnier-micellar-water-facial-cleanser-for-sensitive-skin-200ml-10291528\">Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water</a></strong>, \u00a34.99, 200ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/simple-kind-to-skin-biodegradable-cleansing-wipes-25-pc-10307131\">Simple Cleansing </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/simple-kind-to-skin-biodegradable-cleansing-wipes-25-pc-10307131\">Wipes</a></strong>, \u00a32 for 25 wipes; <strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/clarins-double-serum-30ml-10350700\">Clarins Double Serum</a></strong>, \u00a365, 30ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.clarins.co.uk/skincare-face-moisturisers-1/\">Clarins moisturisers</a></strong>, complimentary samples with other purchases; <strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/clarins-comfort-scrub-50ml-10266940\">Clarins Comfort Nourishing Oil Scrub</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/clarins-comfort-scrub-50ml-10266940?cm_mmc=bmm-buk-google-ppc-_-LIAs-_--_-pmax_premiumbeauty__gg_shopping__lia___pmedia&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA88a5BhDPARIsAFj595i475vY2dzTsR2t2cCGzvvfQSgBrs4I4ijREQ_uapDd0cfVXgLkH6kaAlKDEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">,</a> \u00a327, 50ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/skin/face-skin-care/pore-strips-blackhead-remover/biore-ultra-pore-strips/p/407651\">Bior\u00e9</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/skin/face-skin-care/pore-strips-blackhead-remover/biore-ultra-pore-strips/p/407651\"> Ultra Pore Strips</a></strong>, \u00a38.99 for six</p> <h2><strong>Treatments </strong></h2> <p><strong>Relaxing facial</strong>, \u00a340, twice a year; <strong>eyebrow threading</strong>, \u00a322, monthly</p> <h2><strong>Procedures</strong></h2> <p>None</p>    <h2><strong>\u2018I don\u2019t believe in the concept of flaws\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Emma Dabiri</em><em>, </em><em>45</em><em>, </em><em>historian</em><em>, </em><em>author and contributing beauty editor at Elle magazine</em></p> <p>When I was growing up in Ireland in the 1980s, lots of people had never seen a black person before. I was used to people staring at me, commenting on my appearance, touching me. That made me very self-conscious. I was very aware my features were different from everybody around me. I felt as if they were too big, <em>I </em>was too big. Makeup became a mask I was hiding behind. The idea of going out without heavy foundation was unimaginable. I hated anyone seeing my lips without lipstick. I didn\u2019t like the colour of them.</p>    <p>I was taught growing up that, as young women, our primary importance was our appearance. As a teenager, I was looking for validation. Now I don\u2019t care what strangers think of me. My validation comes from other places. It\u2019s not dependent on the whims of random men. That shift has come from finding my purpose and learning that <em>that </em>is my primary contribution to the world, not how I look. How did I learn that? Growing up, experiencing life, realising that even if people do think you\u2019re pretty that\u2019s all they think about you. It doesn\u2019t translate to being well treated. </p> <p>When I was researching my book Disobedient Bodies, I learned there have been cultures and societies that value all these things that are not visible \u2013 character and essence and integrity \u2013 more than a person\u2019s outward appearance. I found it liberating.</p> <p>I often wear no makeup at all now. Part of that is because of my attitude to beauty. But it\u2019s also because I\u2019ve taken practical steps to make it easier, such as getting my eyebrows microbladed to fill in the gaps I lost tweezing them in my 20s, or using good moisturisers so my skin looks glowing. That said, I don\u2019t believe in the concept of flaws because what exactly is the standard the flaw is preventing someone from achieving? Who has created that standard?</p> <p>I\u2019ve had periods when I\u2019ve felt that I couldn\u2019t accept that I can do the work I do as an academic and wear makeup and enjoy clothes. Like the two are mutually exclusive. Now I think that\u2019s bollocks. Our body is our interface with the world. Rituals, like beauty practices, are an important part of the human experience. And the beauty treatments I get and makeup I choose to wear are very much based on autonomy. One day I will wear no makeup. The next day it will be high-octane glamour. I\u2019ll do whichever I want, based on how I feel.</p>    <h2><strong>Most used products </strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://uk.qmsmedicosmetics.com/products/collagen-recovery\">QMS Medicosmetics Derma Expert Collagen Recovery Cream</a></strong>, gifted for review, \u00a3170, 50ml; <strong><a href=\"https://uk.qmsmedicosmetics.com/products/collagen-day-serum\">QMS Medicosmetics Collagen Day Serum</a></strong>, gifted for review, \u00a390, 30ml; <strong><a href=\"https://uk.qmsmedicosmetics.com/products/gentle-cleansing-milk\">QMS Medicosmetics Cleanse System</a></strong>, gifted for review, \u00a350, 200ml; <strong><a href=\"https://uk.qmsmedicosmetics.com/products/hydrating-toner\">QMS Medicosmetics </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://uk.qmsmedicosmetics.com/products/hydrating-toner\">Hydrating Toner</a></strong>, gifted for review, \u00a350, 200ml; <strong><a href=\"https://111skin.com/products/rose-gold-mask-single-fragrance-free-2022-version?variant=42704493052057\">111 </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://111skin.com/products/rose-gold-mask-single-fragrance-free-2022-version?variant=42704493052057\">Skin Rose Gold Brightening Facial Treatment Mask</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://111skin.com/products/rose-gold-mask-single-fragrance-free-2022-version?variant=42704493052057\">s</a></strong>, \u00a395 for five</p> <h2><strong>Treatments </strong></h2> <p><strong>Facials</strong>, from about \u00a340 each, occasionally</p> <h2><strong>Procedures</strong></h2> <p><strong>Eyebrow microblading</strong>, \u00a3500</p>    <h2><strong>\u2018Strangers called me pizza face\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Georgia Toffolo</em><em>, </em><em>30</em><em>, broadcaster, entrepreneur and author</em></p> <p>I like my face. The only thing I\u2019ve ever had an issue with is my acne. It started 15 years ago. I was the first person out of my friends to get spots. I kept thinking: \u201cOh, this is puberty. It\u2019ll go,\u201d but it didn\u2019t. It kept getting worse and worse. And while the acne got worse, so did the marks it was leaving behind.</p> <p>In a week, I probably have three \u201cgood\u201d skin days, like today, where I\u2019m able to cover up the redness with foundation. (Although I will always have quite severe scarring.) On a bad skin day, where there\u2019ll be sore, open wounds and it can be very crusty. Inside, I\u2019m really bubbly, but when my skin is bad, I turn into someone who\u2019s scared and ashamed. I find it sad that that could be dictated by a few spots.</p>    <p>I got terribly trolled for my acne when I went on I\u2019m a Celebrity in 2017, even though they let me take my foundation in. I got women my age commenting things like \u201cpizza face\u201d or \u201cshe thinks she\u2019s covering it, but you can see\u201d. I think they were projecting, but it was still cruel. It confirmed to me that I was right to be self-conscious about it.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t spent lots of money on my face because I\u2019m nervous about doing too much and flaring the acne up. Of course, I\u2019ve taken lots of antibiotics. I\u2019ve been on Accutane twice. I\u2019ve tried all the gut health stuff. I really love dermaplaning (I just buy a cheap Tweezerman razor and shave off my peach fuzz as I think those tiny hairs make my acne look worse). But it\u2019s only really the scarring you can throw money at. The cost is more to my mental capacity; all the time I\u2019ve lost when I could have been doing something more useful than worrying about my spots.</p> <p>Since I started opening up about my acne, I get fewer negative comments. People do still comment on my appearance, though. People often think I\u2019ve had filler, which I\u2019ve not. I\u2019ve just got chubby cheeks. It pisses me off. They\u2019re like: \u201cOh, your face looks funny\u201d, or \u201cWhat has she done to her face?\u201d And I think: \u201cThat\u2019s just my face!\u201d I can\u2019t go out and say I haven\u2019t had anything done though, because I have had Botox in my masseter muscles to ease clicking and soreness I have in my jaw. And I feel ready to start baby Botox. It\u2019s my time, I\u2019m 30.</p>    <h2><strong>Most used products</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.paiskincare.com/products/light-work-rosehip-cleansing-oil\">Pai Light Work Rose</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.paiskincare.com/products/light-work-rosehip-cleansing-oil\">hip Cleansing Oil</a></strong>, \u00a333, 100ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.dermalogica.co.uk/collections/cleansers/products/ultracalming-cleanser?selling_plan=786071744\">Dermalogica Ultra</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.dermalogica.co.uk/collections/cleansers/products/ultracalming-cleanser?selling_plan=786071744\">calming Cleanser</a></strong>, \u00a365, 500ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.dermalogica.co.uk/collections/exfoliants/products/daily-milkfoliant?selling_plan=1192362176\">Dermalogica Daily Milkfolient</a></strong>, \u00a365, 74g; <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/medik8-c-tetra-serum-30ml/11795619/\">Medi</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/medik8-c-tetra-serum-30ml/11795619/\">k8 C-Tetra</a></strong>, \u00a339, 30ml; <strong><a href=\"https://www.weleda.co.uk/shop/skin-food-body-care/\">Weleda Skin Food</a></strong>, \u00a314.95, 75ml</p> <h2><strong>Treatments </strong></h2> <p><strong>Dermaplaning</strong><strong> at home with razor</strong>, \u00a318 for <a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/tweezerman-facial-razor/12873712/\">Tweezerman razor</a>; <strong>Potenza microneedling acne scar treatment</strong>, gifted, but cost about \u00a3450 each, four sessions; <strong>Accutane acne medication</strong>, \u00a340 to \u00a360 a month, for two six\u2011month periods</p> <h2><strong>Procedures</strong></h2> <p><strong>Masseter Botox</strong> (for pain in the temporomandibular joint), \u00a3250, every three months</p>    <h2><strong>\u2018Once a year I fly to Korea for the day to get laser facials\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Thuy Le, 3</em><em>2</em><em>, beauty creator</em></p> <p>When I was younger, I used to be insecure about my features. I didn\u2019t like my nose. I had wider nostrils. I also had something called proptosis. It\u2019s where one of the muscles in your eyelid isn\u2019t as strong as the other one and it goes a bit droopy. That was always a big insecurity. I remember looking at photos of Angelina Jolie \u2013 they say that she\u2019s the most beautiful person in the world because her face is so symmetrical \u2013 and I remember looking in the mirror and thinking: \u201cMy face is definitely not symmetrical.\u201d</p> <p>I flew to Malaysia to get my nose and eyes fixed. (I\u2019m Asian, and when it comes to anything surgical, I always think that you should find a doctor that does your face shape day in and day out.) I had a rhinoplasty to make my nostrils smaller and give me more of a nose bridge, and I had double eyelid surgery, which is very common over there. People get it done in their lunchtime.</p>    <p>I paid for those procedures, but I\u2019m lucky to be able to have treatments done for free now because of my job: my beauty social media channels have 3.5 million followers in total. I have a whole room of beauty products I\u2019ve been sent. I\u2019ve had fillers and Botox gifted to me. Once a year I fly to Korea for the day to get facial laser treatments \u2013 I get something like 10 at once \u2013 to document on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@xThuyLe\">YouTube channel</a>. My skin looks rough for a couple of weeks after, but then it\u2019s like <em>glass.</em></p> <p>Having so much access to treatments does mean it\u2019s easy to take things too far. I fell into that trap when I first started out. I\u2019ve damaged my skin barrier before by trying too many harsh products. I went through a stage of getting lots of filler to change my features. Now my focus is face-balancing, so I keep things more subtle. Being a creator, you\u2019re constantly looking at videos and photos of yourself. It\u2019s easy to start to pick yourself apart. These days I\u2019ve dissolved a lot of fillers. I don\u2019t need them to feel confident any more. I\u2019ve done a lot of inner work. The only procedure I regret is Botox in my chin. I have a lot of dimples and it\u2019s supposed to stop that. It actually ended up paralysing my lip for a few months.</p> <p>Do I think beauty influencers are to blame for setting high beauty standards? I think there\u2019s always going to be pressures: before us, it was celebrities that people compared themselves with. At least with beauty influencers we\u2019re more open about what we\u2019re getting done. Sometimes, I\u2019m targeted as someone who\u2019s \u201cpromoting\u201d procedures, but really I just want to be honest about what a lot of people do but don\u2019t have the balls to talk about online.<br><em>Thuy Le posts content at </em><em>xThuyLe on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@xThuyLe\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@xthuyle?lang=en\">TikTok</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/xthuyle/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></em></p>    <h2><strong>Most used products</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.dermalogica.co.uk/products/daily-microfoliant-exfoliator?variant=36242187681945&amp;amp;selling_plan=797245632\">Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant</a></strong>, gifted, \u00a365, 74g;

      "bodyText": "When it comes to beauty, we\u2019re living in an era of contradictions. We\u2019re constantly told to love ourselves and embrace our \u201cflaws\u201d, yet it\u2019s never been more normalised to tweak the bits of our faces we don\u2019t like that much. Public figures are regularly shamed for getting more and more work done, yet beauty standards increasingly demand we all look younger and smoother and more symmetrical. Is this messing with our self-image? What does it actually even mean to be beautiful now? Eleven public figures \u2013 from an aesthetician and a drag queen, to a makeup artist and an academic \u2013 open up about what they see when they look in the mirror, and get candid about the products, treatments and procedures it\u2019s taken to get them to this point. \u2018It took three rounds with a doctor to dissolve all my filler\u2019 Ashley Stobart, 34, podcaster I\u2019ve spent more than \u00a3135,000 on my face. I was 22 when I got my first surgery \u2013 my nose. That was actually quite cheap, \u00a33,500! And I hit peak filler around 25. Back then, I worked in sales for a cosmetic surgery company, and if there was filler left over at the end of the day, it would be like: \u201cRight, who\u2019s next?\u201d I was getting treatments every month. I didn\u2019t know filler wouldn\u2019t disappear. I just thought I\u2019m having it done and it\u2019s going to go away, and then I\u2019ll get more. It wasn\u2019t until my last pregnancy that I truly saw what all those injections had done. Pregnancy meant no treatments, and with the water retention, my face was massive. The hyaluronic acid that fillers are made of attracts water, and my face was so swollen I barely recognised myself. Seeing my reflection was a shock. I thought: \u201cWhat have you done? You\u2019re so stupid.\u201d I decided right then: I was done with fillers, for good. It took three rounds with the doctor to get it all dissolved. I was left with loose skin around my jaw and mouth \u2013 you could pull four centimetres of it away from my face. So I decided to get a facelift. Some surgeons told me that, at 34, I was \u201ctoo young\u201d, but finally I found one who would do it. It took nine hours, and despite my dissolving sessions he was still picking bits of old filler out of my face, green balls of it. Thinking about it is horrendous. If you saw me nine years ago, when I was in my filler phase, you\u2019d probably think I was just some bimbo. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t get certain jobs or attracted the wrong kind of people. Now, I\u2019m happy with my face. I feel I look more natural. I would love to see what I\u2019d look like if I hadn\u2019t had anything done, but we will never know. Maybe my kids do look like me \u2013 I don\u2019t know! Having children has changed my perspective a bit. I don\u2019t just have myself to think about, so my focus is mainly my health these days \u2013 to be able to run around with my kids and live longer. I take a lot of supplements and do a lot of cold therapy. I still love procedures and treatments, though. There\u2019s this misconception that people get surgery because they\u2019re unconfident or unhappy, but for me, it\u2019s just for fun. I\u2019ve had an eyebrow lift, upper eyelid lifts, polynucleotide injections (yes, salmon sperm) \u2026 I\u2019ll admit it, I\u2019m vain. I will be getting laser even on my toes and knees at some point, because I just don\u2019t want to age gracefully. I want to look young for ever. It\u2019s my passion.

I get Botox and I have a little bit of filler in my mid-face, jawline, chin and around my smile lines. It\u2019s where the bone, as you age, tends to recess, and the filler maintains volume. I\u2019ve done lots of laser facials. I\u2019ve had Morpheus8 microneedling to tighten the skin. I\u2019ve injected Profhilo (hyaluronic acid) to moisturise, and DNA from salmon sperm, which helps with crinkliness under the eyes. I inject most things myself \u2013 I don\u2019t find it weird, I used to operate on people and see their insides, so I\u2019m not very squeamish. The one treatment I don\u2019t do on myself is filler, because what you see in the mirror isn\u2019t necessarily what someone looking at you might see. It\u2019s a nightmare for anybody injecting me. I\u2019m always paranoid that they\u2019re going to do something wrong. I\u2019ve never been hung up on my facial features. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the best looking person ever and I\u2019m comfortable with that. Before I started doing aesthetics, I didn\u2019t even use a moisturiser. Now, being in the field, I\u2019m more exposed to treatments than your regular person. I can inject a wee bit of something on a Friday night; I have an interventional attitude. I was losing my hair a lot after the lockdown \u2013 it had started to really bother me. I looked so much older and less attractive \u2013 and I didn\u2019t think twice about having a hair transplant. I do worry about teenagers now. There are unrealistic ideals pushed on social media. I think that some clinicians and injectors are to blame for this. The industry needs to focus on looking after the health of your skin rather than being so looks-focused. I think that a lot of people come into working in this industry because they have unresolved issues with body dysmorphia. I think they see their clients through that dysmorphic eye. I like to think I have quite a good eye with people. I\u2019d also like to think that I\u2019d be able to tell if I was looking overly done. But every year you go to the same aesthetics conference and you see practitioners becoming more and more filled and more alien \u2013 that is quite terrifying.

I look up and down and pretend to smile, to keep my muscles taut. Other than that, I don\u2019t think much about my face. I\u2019m lucky that I have high cheekbones, and people admire my eyes. I rarely even bother with makeup. I suppose my cheeks are much thinner at 96 than they were when I was 25, and I have more lines \u2013 but I like some of those changes. I\u2019ve had a lot of experience, and you can see that in my face. I\u2019ve got frowning lines and smiling lines. Hopefully more of the latter. I modelled in my early 20s, but then I gave it up to have children. When I was 70, I was scouted on the street, and that\u2019s when my career really took off. At a time when most women become invisible, I suddenly got a lot of attention \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s why I don\u2019t have a problem with the ageing process. But I also think my lack of concern has to do with the way I was raised. Gazing in the mirror all the time was seen as vain and silly when I was young. It was considered rather shameful to be constantly thinking about yourself. When I catch myself fretting about the way I look, I tell myself firmly to \u201cget on with it\u201d. I only ever look in the mirror to brush my teeth these days. I\u2019m also losing my eyesight, so I can\u2019t see properly when I do attempt to do a bit of gazing. Perhaps that\u2019s for the best! I would never have Botox or any kind of plastic surgery. Quite apart from anything else, I don\u2019t have the money for that sort of thing. But even if I was offered a free facelift, I would turn it down, because you have to accept what life has given you. I\u2019ve seen people with facelifts, and they lose all expression. I\u2019d hate that. I can\u2019t even be bothered to put lots of different creams on my face. It\u2019s too much effort. The only \u201ctreatment\u201d I ever get done regularly is to get the hairs plucked out of my chin. I have a few, now I\u2019m in my 90s, and they\u2019re very annoying. My daughter helps me pluck them out. The only problem is she lives far away from me, so I can\u2019t get hold of her very often. I have another daughter who lives closer to me, but she\u2019s not so handy with the tweezers.

It presents as severe, painful rashes that then turn into flaking skin. It\u2019s so defeminising having your skin peel off, dark patches and thickened skin. It is something that you\u2019re just always conscious of, because you cannot hide your face. And it\u2019s so sore. People lack empathy about it, because it\u2019s not something they\u2019ve experienced. And I think having a skin condition on dark skin brings unique problems. Your melanin helps disguise it. It makes it hard for people to understand. For example, you might know your face is flared up, and then someone might start analysing your appearance, commenting: \u201cOh, you look so much darker than the last time I saw you. Every time I see you, you look darker and darker.\u201d Bro, my skin condition is flaring up! It\u2019s why I started modelling: I was looking up pictures of black skin with eczema on Google and nothing was coming up. Now my passion is doing shoots that capture and highlight my eczema. They build my self-confidence and provide representation for many others dealing with skin conditions. Me being on a set in the first instance teaches clients how to manage models with skin conditions, increasing understanding of invisible disabilities in the industry. I do love trying beauty treatments. I\u2019ve had PRP (platelet-rich plasma injections), where they take blood out of your arm, spin it to separate the platelets, and then inject the concentrated platelets back into you to help with skin regeneration. And I had HA fillers (hyaluronic acid) injected into my lips for cellular hydration. I had severe dryness there and it helped with that. I saw a big change in my beauty regime about five years ago. I had been taking steroids as a sticking paster for my eczema. But they don\u2019t treat the root cause, and they\u2019re only supposed to be used in the short term. I\u2019d used them for years. They were actually making everything worse. I had a health scare: all my lymph nodes were swollen. It took two years to come off the steroids. Now my focus is wellbeing rather than aesthetics. I try to avoid stress, I eat healthily. I\u2019ve learned my triggers. I actually understand my condition now. And I\u2019ve accepted it\u2019s part of who I am.

Some people say I have a large nose, but in my family, it\u2019s the smallest, so I feel quite good about that. In the 70s, I shaved my eyebrows off, and they never came back. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019d microblade. If it looks too dark, you\u2019re stuck, so I just paint them in. I get excited by skincare. I have two bathrooms in London full of products \u2013 I love trying out new things. About four years ago, I started having facials. I used to think they were overrated, but they\u2019ve changed my life. I thought my skin was good, but then I saw what happens with a hydrating facial, or even just a great lymphatic drainage massage. I had filler in my cheeks, but didn\u2019t like it \u2013 I looked like a chipmunk. Just before the pandemic, an aesthetician convinced me to try lip filler. I knocked on my best friend\u2019s door, and she went: \u201cOh, my God, what have you done? You\u2019ve got a trout pout!\u201d It looked awful. Thank God for masks in lockdown; they got me through those six months. These days, I get Profhilo injections in my face for volume, and about a month before I do Glow Up, I get a little Botox around my eyes and in my \u201cdivorce line\u201d on my forehead \u2013 it just makes me look a bit friendlier. Otherwise I have resting bitch face. Before the pandemic I was getting Botox every three months, but I do it less and less now because I quite like the movement in my face and I feel as if I don\u2019t need it, although I am getting older so I probably do. I love being the age that I am, because I\u2019ve got so much experience behind me. I\u2019m not fearful like I was in my 20s. I like wearing makeup and I like not wearing makeup. I remember going on Instagram with no makeup once. Some friends said: \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d But we don\u2019t live in a super-airbrushed world. This is real life!

I feel quite exposed. But it\u2019s also quite liberating. And it was nice not having to arrive at the photoshoot three hours early to get into makeup. For me it\u2019s this armour that allows me to be a heightened, more confident version of myself. I was a chubby, round kid. It was makeup that helped me learn to love myself. I was 14 when I first bought some and obsessed with watching America\u2019s Next Top Model. I loved my high cheekbones, I still do \u2013 although there\u2019s a little bit of filler in there now \u2026 I\u2019ve had filler in my lips, jawline and chin too. I\u2019ve got composite veneers. My eyebrows I shave off for work. I have transfer tattoo eyebrows on, I buy them in bulk from Ali Express. I started Botox when I was 19. I think the sooner you start the better \u2013 do it before the wrinkles even get a chance to form! When you\u2019ve had lots of procedures people feel like they\u2019re allowed to comment on your appearance. Somebody messaged me on a dating app the other day and said, \u201cOh, you look so much better without your lips.\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cWell, the lips are for me. They\u2019re not for you, darling. Everything I do is for myself, my own enjoyment.\u201d Most of the time, the way I look at beauty, I feel like a canvas. Pete Burns took it to the extreme, but he\u2019s an absolute icon of mine and his attitude was, \u201cIt\u2019s no one else\u2019s business. This is my body, what I want to do with it is what I\u2019ll do with it.\u201d That\u2019s what I believe. It\u2019s not that I was ever unhappy with my face, it\u2019s more, \u201cOoh, this cheekbone could be a bit bigger.\u201d And because it\u2019s mainly fillers, most can be dissolved in a day. I\u2019ll ruin what I want to ruin, it\u2019s mine. The one treatment I did get because of an insecurity was my hair transplant. This sounds dramatic, but losing your hair feels like being stripped of your identity. People say, \u201cGo bold and embrace it\u201d, but you wouldn\u2019t say that to a woman, would you? Right now, my focus is skincare. I\u2019m starring in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and sometimes have two shows a day. My poor face goes through it because I have to shave every day, sometimes twice a day on a two-show day, and I\u2019m wearing so much makeup. I play two characters, so I have makeup changes in the show as well. I have to go heavy on the moisturiser. Sometimes I wonder what I\u2019d look like if I didn\u2019t take care of my skin.

I hated getting photographs taken. I wouldn\u2019t even wash my face in front of anyone, because I would have to pull my hair back to do it. Even when I watched myself back on The Traitors, all I could think was: \u201cOh my God, my forehead.\u201d I hyper-fixated on it and thought it was all anyone thought about when they talked to me. It is a symptom of a condition I have called achondroplasia, which also causes me to have shorter arms and legs. Having this condition, I\u2019ve had to accept there are things that I can\u2019t change. It\u2019s not like I can wake up and magically be 5ft 5in. But when I won nearly \u00a335,000 on the reality show and discovered I could get surgery to make my forehead smaller, I saw it as an opportunity to alter something that made me insecure and that I could change about myself. It took three weeks for me to heal after my forehead reduction. It\u2019s done by removing a strip of skin to lower the hairline and it left me with bruising all over my face. It looked as if I\u2019d fallen down a hill! Recovery from that was nothing compared with other facial surgery I\u2019ve had for my condition though. I got double jaw surgery when I was 22, because my teeth didn\u2019t close. Doctors broke the jaw, and then they removed part of the bones, put metal plates on the top and bottom jaw, and fused it back together. When I woke up after surgery, my mouth was wired closed. It was gruesome. I wouldn\u2019t get it done ever again. I get some negative comments on social media about the forehead reduction from people who think I\u2019ve not accepted myself or my condition. I have. It was just this one aspect of my face I didn\u2019t like. The result is probably barely noticeable to anyone else, but it has really helped improve my confidence. I think when it comes to beauty standards things are obviously better now than they were when I was growing up. There\u2019s so much advancement in the way people view disabilities, but I think people still find dwarfism \u201cfunny\u201d. Every day someone will stare, point or laugh at me. It\u2019s really embarrassing and frustrating. Most of the time I can brush it off \u2013 I\u2019ve dealt with it my whole life and I\u2019ll probably have to deal with it for the rest of my life. But it makes me sad. I feel as if I\u2019m in a losing battle. I hope that society can become more accepting.

I looked in the mirror and thought: \u201cOh my God, who is this?\u201d I trained as a doctor, and sort of fell into doing TV and broadcasting. For me, it was going into this new world where everyone was aesthetically driven. I was around a lot of people who looked much slimmer than me, had much more makeup on, had more procedures, and their hair was really slick and tidy, and mine was really crazy and fluffy. For the first four or five years, and probably even now to a degree, I\u2019d look at other people and think: \u201cI wish I looked like them.\u201d And I\u2019ve been encouraged to try to look like them, too: \u201cCan you calm your hair down?\u201d What I\u2019ve learned as I\u2019ve gotten older is that even if I was to put 365 days of the year into trying, I couldn\u2019t look like these other people. So what is the point in trying? I can\u2019t be anyone other than myself. And I think it\u2019s important for me to show up authentically. A lot of the work I do, and a lot of what needs to change in the industry, is to allow people to see reality. If I\u2019m showing up to do that orange and shiny, I\u2019m part of the problem. There\u2019s a danger that beauty has become a template \u2013 \u201cYou must look like this to be beautiful\u201d, in terms of eyebrows, face shape, you know, different products used. I have moments when I think about my nose being too big or worry about my asymmetrical eyebrows. I get angry about it all sometimes, how the beauty industry encourages low self-esteem in order to sell products, how young people are bombarded with these images of \u201cperfect\u201d people. It\u2019s such an insidious thing. We grow up with an idea of beauty, we believe it, we try to follow it, and then, if we\u2019re lucky, we have to unlearn it. It seems like such a waste of time. And it\u2019s very difficult to step out of the box and say: \u201cThis is who I am. I\u2019m not going to conform to what you tell me I should be doing when it comes to being beautiful\u201d.

I was used to people staring at me, commenting on my appearance, touching me. That made me very self-conscious. I was very aware my features were different from everybody around me. I felt as if they were too big, I was too big. Makeup became a mask I was hiding behind. The idea of going out without heavy foundation was unimaginable. I hated anyone seeing my lips without lipstick. I didn\u2019t like the colour of them. I was taught growing up that, as young women, our primary importance was our appearance. As a teenager, I was looking for validation. Now I don\u2019t care what strangers think of me. My validation comes from other places. It\u2019s not dependent on the whims of random men. That shift has come from finding my purpose and learning that that is my primary contribution to the world, not how I look. How did I learn that? Growing up, experiencing life, realising that even if people do think you\u2019re pretty that\u2019s all they think about you. It doesn\u2019t translate to being well treated. When I was researching my book Disobedient Bodies, I learned there have been cultures and societies that value all these things that are not visible \u2013 character and essence and integrity \u2013 more than a person\u2019s outward appearance. I found it liberating. I often wear no makeup at all now. Part of that is because of my attitude to beauty. But it\u2019s also because I\u2019ve taken practical steps to make it easier, such as getting my eyebrows microbladed to fill in the gaps I lost tweezing them in my 20s, or using good moisturisers so my skin looks glowing. That said, I don\u2019t believe in the concept of flaws because what exactly is the standard the flaw is preventing someone from achieving? Who has created that standard? I\u2019ve had periods when I\u2019ve felt that I couldn\u2019t accept that I can do the work I do as an academic and wear makeup and enjoy clothes. Like the two are mutually exclusive. Now I think that\u2019s bollocks. Our body is our interface with the world. Rituals, like beauty practices, are an important part of the human experience. And the beauty treatments I get and makeup I choose to wear are very much based on autonomy. One day I will wear no makeup. The next day it will be high-octane glamour. I\u2019ll do whichever I want, based on how I feel.

The only thing I\u2019ve ever had an issue with is my acne. It started 15 years ago. I was the first person out of my friends to get spots. I kept thinking: \u201cOh, this is puberty. It\u2019ll go,\u201d but it didn\u2019t. It kept getting worse and worse. And while the acne got worse, so did the marks it was leaving behind. In a week, I probably have three \u201cgood\u201d skin days, like today, where I\u2019m able to cover up the redness with foundation. (Although I will always have quite severe scarring.) On a bad skin day, where there\u2019ll be sore, open wounds and it can be very crusty. Inside, I\u2019m really bubbly, but when my skin is bad, I turn into someone who\u2019s scared and ashamed. I find it sad that that could be dictated by a few spots. I got terribly trolled for my acne when I went on I\u2019m a Celebrity in 2017, even though they let me take my foundation in. I got women my age commenting things like \u201cpizza face\u201d or \u201cshe thinks she\u2019s covering it, but you can see\u201d. I think they were projecting, but it was still cruel. It confirmed to me that I was right to be self-conscious about it. I haven\u2019t spent lots of money on my face because I\u2019m nervous about doing too much and flaring the acne up. Of course, I\u2019ve taken lots of antibiotics. I\u2019ve been on Accutane twice. I\u2019ve tried all the gut health stuff. I really love dermaplaning (I just buy a cheap Tweezerman razor and shave off my peach fuzz as I think those tiny hairs make my acne look worse). But it\u2019s only really the scarring you can throw money at. The cost is more to my mental capacity; all the time I\u2019ve lost when I could have been doing something more useful than worrying about my spots. Since I started opening up about my acne, I get fewer negative comments. People do still comment on my appearance, though. People often think I\u2019ve had filler, which I\u2019ve not. I\u2019ve just got chubby cheeks. It pisses me off. They\u2019re like: \u201cOh, your face looks funny\u201d, or \u201cWhat has she done to her face?\u201d And I think: \u201cThat\u2019s just my face!\u201d I can\u2019t go out and say I haven\u2019t had anything done though, because I have had Botox in my masseter muscles to ease clicking and soreness I have in my jaw. And I feel ready to start baby Botox. It\u2019s my time, I\u2019m 30.

I didn\u2019t like my nose. I had wider nostrils. I also had something called proptosis. It\u2019s where one of the muscles in your eyelid isn\u2019t as strong as the other one and it goes a bit droopy. That was always a big insecurity. I remember looking at photos of Angelina Jolie \u2013 they say that she\u2019s the most beautiful person in the world because her face is so symmetrical \u2013 and I remember looking in the mirror and thinking: \u201cMy face is definitely not symmetrical.\u201d I flew to Malaysia to get my nose and eyes fixed. (I\u2019m Asian, and when it comes to anything surgical, I always think that you should find a doctor that does your face shape day in and day out.) I had a rhinoplasty to make my nostrils smaller and give me more of a nose bridge, and I had double eyelid surgery, which is very common over there. People get it done in their lunchtime. I paid for those procedures, but I\u2019m lucky to be able to have treatments done for free now because of my job: my beauty social media channels have 3.5 million followers in total. I have a whole room of beauty products I\u2019ve been sent. I\u2019ve had fillers and Botox gifted to me. Once a year I fly to Korea for the day to get facial laser treatments \u2013 I get something like 10 at once \u2013 to document on my YouTube channel. My skin looks rough for a couple of weeks after, but then it\u2019s like glass. Having so much access to treatments does mean it\u2019s easy to take things too far. I fell into that trap when I first started out. I\u2019ve damaged my skin barrier before by trying too many harsh products. I went through a stage of getting lots of filler to change my features. Now my focus is face-balancing, so I keep things more subtle. Being a creator, you\u2019re constantly looking at videos and photos of yourself. It\u2019s easy to start to pick yourself apart. These days I\u2019ve dissolved a lot of fillers. I don\u2019t need them to feel confident any more. I\u2019ve done a lot of inner work. The only procedure I regret is Botox in my chin. I have a lot of dimples and it\u2019s supposed to stop that. It actually ended up paralysing my lip for a few months. Do I think beauty influencers are to blame for setting high beauty standards? I think there\u2019s always going to be pressures: before us, it was celebrities that people compared themselves with. At least with beauty influencers we\u2019re more open about what we\u2019re getting done. Sometimes, I\u2019m targeted as someone who\u2019s \u201cpromoting\u201d procedures, but really I just want to be honest about what a lot of people do but don\u2019t have the balls to talk about online.

The price of bitcoin has topped $97,000 (\u00a376,500), a new record high, as investors view Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House as a harbinger of crypto-friendly conditions that will legitimise them as mainstream assets. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has found 12% of UK adults own crypto. Many respondents said they had entered the crypto market within the past four years, with some using extra funds they had accumulated during Covid lockdowns to buy coins via apps and platforms that were more user friendly than the process of acquiring blockchain currencies had previously been. The responses also reflected a growing trend for professionals in jobs such as teaching, banking, nursing or IT investing, rather than the \u201ctech bros\u201d historically associated with the crypto sphere, claiming that such investments had been their best, or only, option to build up any meaningful personal wealth. Scores of middle-class respondents said they had lost trust in existing systems and had turned to crypto in the hope that it would help them reach life goals such as affording to have a child, buy a house or travel. Julian, 57, a draughtsman, homeowner and father of four from Nottingham, was one of several respondents who said they had bought into bitcoin to insure themselves against rocketing inflation. \u201cI was getting more and more alarmed that not only was there virtually zero interest paid on my savings, the value of every pound I owned was also reducing due to quantitative easing, as the government happily printed money to bail out the banks,\u201d he says. Julian decided to invest most of his savings. \u201cVery soon after, the price tanked and I was down 50% for over a year, but never once considered selling because I\u2019d done my homework and knew this was how it performed,\u201d he says. After four years of consistently \u201cbuying the dips\u201d, his stack of bitcoin has performed very well. \u201cI have no plans to sell, and view it as inheritance for the kids, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll keep on growing in value. How much bitcoin have I got? Not enough.\u201d Many armchair investors expressed hopes that bitcoin could reach record heights of $120,000 or more by the first quarter of 2025. \u201cIf the US adopts bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, the sky is the limit,\u201d says one solicitor from Dublin, whose \u20ac40,000 bitcoin investment reached a value of \u20ac62,000 last week. Silas Gunn, 18, from North Yorkshire, shared this confidence. Gunn made his first bitcoin purchase about three years ago, after he learned about it through YouTube. \u201cI\u2019ve put about \u00a35,000 into crypto, and I\u2019m currently sitting on a portfolio of about \u00a395,000,\u201d he says. Gunn hopes this will rise to \u00a3500,000 by the end of bitcoin\u2019s current four-year halving cycle, a phenomenon influencing price predictions and trading behaviour enormously. Many in the crypto community hope that Trump\u2019s incoming administration will end the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d approach to crypto industries over the past four years \u2013 the use of case-by-case legal actions against stakeholders in lieu of rule-making. Claire, 50, a nurse from New Zealand who started investing in crypto about 10 years ago, was among many respondents who felt uneasy about benefiting from Trump\u2019s election victory. \u201cTrump\u2019s re-election has led to quite a significant increase in my wealth. I feel a bit guilty, like it\u2019s almost dirty money,\u201d she says. Although Claire believes in crypto as a philosophical project of decentralised reorganisation and has always been confident about its success, she plans on cashing out soon. \u201cI\u2019ve had my fun with it. I really need to be a bit more sensible now, and might buy real estate instead,\u201d she says. The average crypto investor, Claire believes, has changed over time. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising how many doctors and nurses are investing in crypto. It\u2019s because it would be hard to make this kind of money in any other way today.\u201d While thousands of amateur investors such as Claire have reaped sizeable rewards in the crypto sphere, others have only lost money. Mark, a cycling instructor for children from the north of England, started buying crypto in 2013. \u201cThe gradual acceptance of bitcoin by the legacy financial world boosted my confidence in it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve made endless stupid mistakes, had crypto stolen, lost my faith in bitcoin and sold it, then bought in again at a higher price. I\u2019ve tried to trade and failed miserably. Since 2017, I\u2019ve just left it alone and it\u2019s the best financial decision I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d Many respondents felt that a thorough understanding of blockchain technology and the crypto market are essential for successful investing. Others assigned their crypto riches to \u201cnothing but dumb luck\u201d. Mitchell, from Minnesota, in his 30s and earning $100,000 annually in the tech industry, acquired 16,000 Dogecoin \u2013 touted by Elon Musk as the \u201cpeople\u2019s crypto\u201d \u2013 for $1,300 between 2021 and 2022. It is currently worth about $6,000. \u201cI figured if it ever reached $100 a coin, it was an easy million,\u201d he says. \u201cUnderstanding crypto better now, I know that Dogecoin will almost certainly never reach those heights.\u201d In December 2023, having watched house prices rise faster than he could save, Mitchell took \u201ca desperate gamble\u201d, he says, and bought a single bitcoin for $42,000. In just under a year that investment has more than doubled to $90,000. Mitchell now fears a \u201cmassive\u201d crypto crash in the near future, but has decided not to sell for now. \u201cI guess I\u2019m staying on this ride in the hope that analysts forecasting mid-$100,000s for bitcoin by the end of 2025 are right, though the biggest thing I\u2019ve learned in the last four years is that no one making those guesses has any idea what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they\u2019re right, though, maybe I can finally afford that house.\u201d",

Hop on a sleeper train and speed as far south as you can in the hope of finding some sunshine, or lean into the oncoming winter.</p> <p>With an October half-term holiday looming, our family decided to embrace the second option, planning a \u201cwinterrailing\u201d itinerary that would take us on a nine-day loop through central Europe, stopping off at cities that know a thing or two about hunkering down in the face of inclement weather and long, dark nights. We would watch the autumn colours unfurl from the comfort of a train carriage, spend our days visiting museums and galleries, refuel with coffee and cake in cosy cafes, and maybe even sneak in some early Christmas shopping.<em> </em>Not only would we dodge the sticky discomfort of sightseeing in&nbsp;the heat of summer, we would avoid the crowds and inflated prices that come with peak-season travel.</p>    <p>That was the plan, but it seems Strasbourg did not get the memo. Having downloaded our digital Interrail passes and boarded the Eurostar in London on a murky late October morning, my partner, our teenage daughter and I emerge from Strasbourg station six hours later (via a quick platform change on to the TGV at Lille Europe) into dazzling sunshine.

Winterrailing has its advantages. The trip was provided by Byway Travel. A similar nine-day bespoke itinerary costs from \u00a31,405pp, including Eurostar tickets, Interrail pass and accommodation. Hotel accommodation in Zurich was provided by Zurich Tourism",

What will you do now about those anguished, frail, pain-racked patients who sit and quake in death\u2019s proximity as they are failed by the NHS, social care and society at large?

Anne Puckridge is travelling 4,400 miles from her home in Canada to ask the UK government to change rules that campaigners say penalise almost half a million pensioners living overseas and leave many struggling financially. Many of them, including Puckridge, receive a state pension that is a fraction of what they would get if they had stayed in the UK or moved to one of a list of other countries. This is because although the UK state pension is payable overseas, it is not \u201cuprated\u201d annually unless there is a legal requirement to do so \u2013 for example, where there is a relevant reciprocal social security agreement in place. About 480,000 older Britons living abroad are affected by this \u201cfrozen pensions\u201d policy. Their state pensions do not increase each year, but stay at the level reached on the date the individual moved away if they had already retired, or became entitled to the payment if they were already living overseas. The rules apply to the old basic state pension and the new state pension introduced in 2016. The full basic state pension is now \u00a3169.50 a week, and, for many pensioners, will rise by 4.1% in April to reach \u00a3176.45. But those Britons who emigrated or retired to more than 100 countries including Australia, Canada and South Africa will not benefit from the increase. Some \u201cfrozen\u201d pensioners have missed years of rises and, as a result, receive as little as \u00a320 a week. Puckridge says she has been punished by the British government for deciding in 2001, at the age of 76, to move to Canada to be close to her daughter. She served as an intelligence officer during the second world war, and worked on codes across the army, RAF and navy. Puckridge then returned to the UK and brought up her family, working in administrative jobs and, later, as a lecturer in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Despite the fact she lived and worked in the UK for most of her life, making national insurance contributions throughout her career, her UK basic state pension is frozen at the 2001 level of \u00a372.50. Since then Puckridge has received \u00a350,000 less than had she spent the last 23 years in the UK. She says the pension freeze has affected \u201cvirtually every decision in my life\u201d. She adds: \u201cI can\u2019t remember when I bought anything new, and I have to limit even essential purchases to thrift and similar stores. Social activity and entertainment are mainly only memories, and festive seasons such as the approaching Christmas or birthdays are embarrassing rather than exciting events.\u201d The End Frozen Pensions campaign says the current regime is \u201ccruel and unnecessary\u201d. Puckridge is due to arrive in the UK on Sunday and had formally requested a meeting with Keir Starmer. Her call was backed by the actor Joanna Lumley and more than 30 UK parliamentarians, including the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. A petition on the Change.org website launched by Puckridge\u2019s daughter Gillian Mittins that urged Starmer to \u201cmeet with my 99-year-old second world war veteran mum\u201d had by Thursday received more than 130,000 signatures. However, it emerged on Thursday that Starmer had declined to see her, but had offered her a meeting with the pensions minister, Emma Reynolds. Puckridge says she is \u201cdeeply saddened and disappointed\u201d that the prime minister feels unable to meet her and hopes he will reconsider, but adds that she appreciates his offer of an alternative meeting with the minister. While in the UK, she will meet MPs, attend prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons and be hosted by the Canadian high commission in London. She says: \u201cI will be 100 years old in a few weeks\u2019 time, and the decision to take the journey back to the UK at this stage of my life is not one I have taken lightly \u2026 We feel our country has cruelly abandoned us.\u201d The frozen pensions policy has been in place for decades, and ministers have in the past conceded the rules are \u201cillogical\u201d. However, various governments have argued it would be too expensive to uprate those affected, saying that the priority should be targeting money at the poorest pensioners at home. Last year, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said changing the rules would cost more than \u00a34.5bn in total for the five years ending April 2028. But campaigners said a recent freedom of information (FoI) response from the DWP showed that the cost of meeting their demand for annual increases for all from now on \u2013 as opposed to a full retrospective uprating \u2013 would be \u00a355m in the first year. A government spokesperson said the figures in the FoI \u201chighlight the cost of a partial uprating only\u201d, and that to fully uprate people\u2019s pensions would cost nearly \u00a31bn a year. They added: \u201cWe understand people move abroad for many reasons, and we provide clear information on how this can impact their finances in retirement, with the policy on the uprating of the UK state pension for recipients living overseas a longstanding one.\u201d",

Its base and back are pink., 3:B - You could consider the sky as Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and it doesn\u2019t stop exactly, but air molecules become more separated the higher you go. Scientists use an imaginary boundary, the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, as the end of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, usually defined as 100km above Earth.

But it was nous that winkled out Williamson for 61, Woakes resuming&nbsp;from the Botanic Gardens End and beating the inside edge for a bloomin\u2019 good lbw.

      "bodyText": "There have been Australian cricket supporters in Christchurch this past week and not, word has it, to escape the sense of crisis that has engulfed their team back home. Apparently they were so taken by their experience during the 2-0 series win for their side in March, a return visit was swiftly booked. Who could blame them? As the red weed of franchise T20 continues its spread and a slightly dystopian landscape forms, this first Test between New Zealand and England has offered a decent counterpoint (even if there have, admittedly, been some depressingly small Test crowds in South Africa and Antigua). The third day here was another dollop of heavenly bliss, those enticing grass banks packed with spectators young and old who were captivated by the contest. At stumps, as they left to sample the local bars and restaurants, the English among them were eyeing the completion of a 1-0 lead in this series and singing the praises of Chris Woakes. Yes, Chris Woakes, whose overseas feats in Test cricket have long invited jokes about hiding his passport, and whose name got rather unfairly dragged into the debate about Jimmy Anderson\u2019s enforced retirement. The second of those gripes overlooked the seven-year age gap and solidity Woakes has long provided at No 8 \u2013 not that a loose drive to slip in the morning supported this. Having gone wicketless in the first innings, and then watched Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse plunder 48 and 33no, respectively, as England posted 499 all out \u2013 a 151-run lead built on Harry Brook\u2019s remarkable five-lived 171 from 197 balls \u2013 Woakes could have been forgiven for thinking he might be bowling for the continuation of his immediate Test career second time around. But 11 years of Test experience \u2013 even with that Jekyll &amp; Hyde record home and away \u2013 means he is not a flapper. As New Zealand slipped to 155 for six by the close, a lead of four, his figures of three for 39 were central. Bowling a fuller length, and extracting hitherto unseen nip from that unfriendly Kookaburra ball, he sent Tom Latham, Kane Williamson and Tom Blundell on their way. If the wicket of Latham, caught at second slip for one, levelled things up \u2013 next summer\u2019s Warwickshire teammate had held him in the cordon earlier \u2013 then the last two will have given him greater satisfaction. The ball was 35 overs old by this stage and while Carse \u2013 plus two botched cross-batted shots \u2013 had accounted for Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra, a partnership had formed. Williamson was steadying things with Daryl Mitchell and England were trying everything, even an attempt to prey on the former captain\u2019s nonexistent ego with the short ball. But it was nous that winkled out Williamson for 61, Woakes resuming from the Botanic Gardens End and beating the inside edge for a bloomin\u2019 good lbw. With Blundell then tickling his first ball \u2013 nipping away this time \u2013 behind, the Wizard\u2019s spell had turned 133 for three into five. It may be too soon to make predictions about those Australian tourists seeing a 36-year-old Woakes on their shores this time next year, even if Brendon McCullum is ruling nothing out. But one man who looks tailor-made for the trip is Carse. Fresh from a strong start to his Test career in Pakistan, he took his tally in the match to seven by replacing Woakes and knocking over Glenn Phillips for 19. This was a pretty unfortunate dismissal, induced by a vociferous appeal and shown to be clipping the leg bail by a whisker. Carse, three for 22, was not complaining. New Zealand \u2013 though not exactly known for it \u2013 could hardly chunter either, having been architects of their own downfall through the eight dropped catches that allowed England, 71 for four on day two, off the hook. It has been the chief difference here, England\u2019s superior out-cricket exemplified by Atkinson\u2019s athletic low catch at mid-on to remove Conway for eight \u2013 heavily scrutinised but deemed to be clean \u2013 or young Jacob Bethell holding a swirler with the sun in his eyes to pouch Ravindra on 24. Carse induced both dismissals through the catapult load-up that propels a seriously heavy ball. So much went back to England\u2019s first innings and a 141-run third morning. Five wickets down, 29 runs behind and with a new ball around the corner, they batted \u2013 as is their wont \u2013 like they were already heavily in credit.

      "body": "<p>The veteran British director Richard Eyre has said it is \u201cvery hard\u201d to get small-budget independent dramas made any more because studio bosses are obsessed with \u201cbankable\u201d celebrity names.</p> <p>Eyre, who has worked across film, theatre, TV and opera, winning five Olivier awards and a Bafta, also spoke of the importance of making drama that embraces social realism \u2013 especially in an era when the industry is increasingly reliant on superhero films and franchises to attract audiences.</p> <p>\u201cCulture should reflect our lives,\u201d Eyre, 81, told the Guardian. \u201cAt the heart of all art is the opportunity to see through other people\u2019s eyes. The most difficult invocation is to love thy neighbour as thyself, but it should be the cornerstone of every society. And drama helps us do that because it helps us understand each other.\u201d</p> <p>Eyre, whose films include Iris (2001) and Notes on a Scandal (2006), and whose extensive career is being celebrated in a new season at the British Film Institute (BFI) in December, said the creative industry was going after \u201ca safe bet\u201d these days.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get small-budget independent films on any subject made,\u201d he said. \u201cSo often, the sales agent will say: \u2018Well who\u2019s in it?\u2019 It\u2019s become about who is bankable, and it changes from day to day. Suddenly some star emerges and overnight you have to get them to get your film made.\u201d</p> <p>In the old days, he added, \u201cthe people in charge employed you because you had certain skills, including deciding who was the best actor for the part. Nobody said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to get X person\u2019, whereas now it\u2019s all sort of like old-fashioned Hollywood.\u201d</p> <p>Even the subsidised theatre sector had fallen victim to this, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exasperating, because when you do a piece of work that really has got value and force, it finds an audience regardless of who\u2019s in it. But the difficulty is getting someone to underwrite and trust you.\u201d</p> <p>The BFI celebration includes a conversation event with Eyre, and film introductions from his frequent collaborators Judi Dench and Jonathan Pryce. Titles playing include Play for Today: Just a Boys\u2019 Game (1979), Stage Beauty (2004) and The Dresser (2015).</p> <p>Eyre reminisced about what he called \u201cthe golden age of socially conscious TV\u201d which included \u201chugely influential\u201d shows such as Boys from the Blackstuff.</p> <p>\u201cThis hasn\u2019t entirely vanished today. Shows like Happy Valley and Sherwood are absolutely supreme. Although they\u2019re procedurals, they\u2019re so involved in talking about the society in which they\u2019re set and the relationships within them. The performances are brilliant \u2013 Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley is just magnificent.\u201d</p> <p>Eyre paid tribute to the actors he has worked with, crediting them with the success of his films and shows. Alongside Dench and Pryce, they include Cate Blanchett, the late Maggie Smith, and Colin Firth, whose first big role was in Eyre\u2019s 1988 BBC Falklands drama, Tumbledown.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s invariably the performances that make a good film or series. The human element is what draws you to something. If you think of the great series, like Sopranos and Breaking Bad, you identify with the leading characters,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not an auteur film-maker, actors are the medium through which I work. I both like and admire them. If they\u2019re good, they\u2019re invariably bright. Maggie Smith was one of the cleverest people I\u2019ve ever met, and also one of the best read. She was very articulate and devastatingly witty.\u201d</p> <p>Eyre started his career as the associate director of the Royal Lyceum theatre before becoming the artistic director of the National Theatre from 1987 to 1999.</p> <p>On television he has directed episodes of Play for Today, The Cherry Orchard, and King Lear \u2013 an adaptation starring Anthony Hopkins that garnered huge critical acclaim. He made his directorial film debut with The Ploughman\u2019s Lunch, in 1983, while his last film, Allelujah, about a geriatric ward of an NHS hospital threatened with closure, was released in 2022.</p> <p>Allelujah was made when the industry was suffering from the effects of the pandemic, from which Eyre said it was \u201cstill recovering\u201d. \u201cSo many projects piled up in Hollywood, and a lot of them are being cancelled because somehow the moment seems to have passed.\u201d</p> <p>The director is raising funds for his next feature, The Housekeeper. Written by the bestselling author Rose Tremain, it\u2019s a romance fictionalising the inspiration behind Daphne du Maurier\u2019s Rebecca, starring Hopkins, Uma Thurman and Phoebe Dynevor. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful matrix of relationships,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Personal relationships are a theme to which Eyre has consistently returned. \u201cMy favourite play is King Lear [Eyre also directed the National\u2019s landmark 1997 production] because I\u2019m fascinated by the dynamics of the family relationships. I guess it\u2019s because my family didn\u2019t knit together. For me, working in the theatre or working on film is always finding a surrogate family.\u201d</p> <p>The Devon-born director said he was \u201cquite surprised, extremely excited and very flattered\u201d by the BFI season.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought I have a career, because I\u2019ve never been strategic about it,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve never said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to do that and then I\u2019ll ascend to running the National Theatre, or make a movie for an American studio.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s all been accident, but it\u2019s one piece of work and then another. It\u2019s just wonderful to be paid for stuff you enjoy.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=richard-eyre\">Richard Eyre: Weapons of Understanding</a> </em><em>is at BFI Southbank from 1-29 December, including Sir Richard Eyre in Conversation on 8 December.</em><br></p></li> </ul>",

And drama helps us do that because it helps us understand each other.\u201d Eyre, whose films include Iris (2001) and Notes on a Scandal (2006), and whose extensive career is being celebrated in a new season at the British Film Institute (BFI) in December, said the creative industry was going after \u201ca safe bet\u201d these days. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get small-budget independent films on any subject made,\u201d he said. \u201cSo often, the sales agent will say: \u2018Well who\u2019s in it?\u2019 It\u2019s become about who is bankable, and it changes from day to day. Suddenly some star emerges and overnight you have to get them to get your film made.\u201d In the old days, he added, \u201cthe people in charge employed you because you had certain skills, including deciding who was the best actor for the part. Nobody said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to get X person\u2019, whereas now it\u2019s all sort of like old-fashioned Hollywood.\u201d Even the subsidised theatre sector had fallen victim to this, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exasperating, because when you do a piece of work that really has got value and force, it finds an audience regardless of who\u2019s in it. But the difficulty is getting someone to underwrite and trust you.\u201d The BFI celebration includes a conversation event with Eyre, and film introductions from his frequent collaborators Judi Dench and Jonathan Pryce. Titles playing include Play for Today: Just a Boys\u2019 Game (1979), Stage Beauty (2004) and The Dresser (2015). Eyre reminisced about what he called \u201cthe golden age of socially conscious TV\u201d which included \u201chugely influential\u201d shows such as Boys from the Blackstuff. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t entirely vanished today. Shows like Happy Valley and Sherwood are absolutely supreme. Although they\u2019re procedurals, they\u2019re so involved in talking about the society in which they\u2019re set and the relationships within them. The performances are brilliant \u2013 Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley is just magnificent.\u201d Eyre paid tribute to the actors he has worked with, crediting them with the success of his films and shows. Alongside Dench and Pryce, they include Cate Blanchett, the late Maggie Smith, and Colin Firth, whose first big role was in Eyre\u2019s 1988 BBC Falklands drama, Tumbledown. \u201cIt\u2019s invariably the performances that make a good film or series. The human element is what draws you to something. If you think of the great series, like Sopranos and Breaking Bad, you identify with the leading characters,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not an auteur film-maker, actors are the medium through which I work. I both like and admire them. If they\u2019re good, they\u2019re invariably bright. Maggie Smith was one of the cleverest people I\u2019ve ever met, and also one of the best read. She was very articulate and devastatingly witty.\u201d Eyre started his career as the associate director of the Royal Lyceum theatre before becoming the artistic director of the National Theatre from 1987 to 1999. On television he has directed episodes of Play for Today, The Cherry Orchard, and King Lear \u2013 an adaptation starring Anthony Hopkins that garnered huge critical acclaim. He made his directorial film debut with The Ploughman\u2019s Lunch, in 1983, while his last film, Allelujah, about a geriatric ward of an NHS hospital threatened with closure, was released in 2022. Allelujah was made when the industry was suffering from the effects of the pandemic, from which Eyre said it was \u201cstill recovering\u201d. \u201cSo many projects piled up in Hollywood, and a lot of them are being cancelled because somehow the moment seems to have passed.\u201d The director is raising funds for his next feature, The Housekeeper. Written by the bestselling author Rose Tremain, it\u2019s a romance fictionalising the inspiration behind Daphne du Maurier\u2019s Rebecca, starring Hopkins, Uma Thurman and Phoebe Dynevor. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful matrix of relationships,\u201d he said. Personal relationships are a theme to which Eyre has consistently returned. \u201cMy favourite play is King Lear [Eyre also directed the National\u2019s landmark 1997 production] because I\u2019m fascinated by the dynamics of the family relationships. I guess it\u2019s because my family didn\u2019t knit together. For me, working in the theatre or working on film is always finding a surrogate family.\u201d The Devon-born director said he was \u201cquite surprised, extremely excited and very flattered\u201d by the BFI season. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought I have a career, because I\u2019ve never been strategic about it,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve never said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to do that and then I\u2019ll ascend to running the National Theatre, or make a movie for an American studio.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s all been accident, but it\u2019s one piece of work and then another. It\u2019s just wonderful to be paid for stuff you enjoy.\u201d Richard Eyre: Weapons of Understanding is at BFI Southbank from 1-29 December, including Sir Richard Eyre in Conversation on 8 December.",

Add 500ml water, cover, and cook until the peel is tender \u2013 if using a pressure cooker, cook for 15 minutes, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; if using a regular saucepan, bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 45 minutes, or until the orange rind is soft, adding more boiling water if necessary. Transfer the tender peel to a blender and add 75ml of the cooking liquid, the olive oil, maple syrup and whole eggs. Blitz until smooth, then add the ground almonds, polenta, baking powder and unrefined sugar (or 100g more maple syrup), and blend again until well combined. Pour the mixture into a greased 20cm cake tin and bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for about 60 minutes, until the cake reaches a core temperature of 94C, or when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove and leave to cool, then slice and serve as it is, or top with pomegranate seeds and/or pistachios, if using. This is a very moist cake that can happily be eaten with no further accompaniment, but I like it with a big dollop of yoghurt, creme or fraiche or double cream. \u2022 This article was edited on 30 November 2024 to clarify that the oranges used in this cake should be unwaxed and ideally organic.",

If the Beyonc\u00e9 collaborator\u2019s set isn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s support from famed DJ Carl Craig, as well as a debut from DJ Lo Down Loretta Brown AKA Erykah Badu. <em>Michael Cragg</em></p> <p><strong>Vampire Weekend</strong><br><em>O2 Apollo, Manchester, 1 December</em><em>; touring to 11 Dec</em><em>ember</em><br>While April\u2019s knotty fifth album Only God Was Above Us failed to connect in the same way as their earlier output, New York indie poppers Vampire Weekend are still a live favourite.

In other words, he\u2019s an experimental practitioner of the style known as mannerism.

Pulpy thrills from director Edward Berger (All Quiet on the Western Front). Moana 2 Out now Set three years after the events of the first film, this time Moana reunites with the demigod Maui to break a curse on the hidden island of Motufetu. Animated sequel with voicework from Auli\u2019i Cravalho, Dwayne Johnson and Jemaine Clement. All We Imagine As Light Out now Exploring the friendships between three women in modern Mumbai, and starring Kani Kusruti (Girls Will Be Girls), Divya Prabha (Family) and Chhaya Kadam (Sister Midnight), this acclaimed drama from Payal Kapadia made history this year as the first film directed by an Indian woman to play in the main competition at Cannes. The Polar Express: 20th Anniversary Restoration Out now At the time of release it was plagued by criticisms that all its characters had something of the uncanny valley about them, but Robert Zemeckis\u2019s motion-capture animation has endured as a Christmas classic, proving to the naysayers that, actually, maybe people really quite like their festive faces with weird dead eyes. Catherine Bray * * * Going out: Gigs Caroline Shaw &amp; S\u014d Percussion Barbican Hall, London, 1 December Composer-vocalist Shaw and the four multi-instrumentalists of S\u014d Percussion perform songs from their second album together, released last June Rectangles and Circumstance, including settings of Christina Rossetti, Gertrude Stein and Emily Dickinson, and mixing sampling and minimalism, and ending with the group\u2019s take on Schubert\u2019s An die Musik. Andrew Clements The Hydra: Honey Dijon\u2019s House Nation Drumsheds, London, 6 December Chicago DJ, producer and trailblazer Honey Dijon brings her House Nation experience to London. If the Beyonc\u00e9 collaborator\u2019s set isn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s support from famed DJ Carl Craig, as well as a debut from DJ Lo Down Loretta Brown AKA Erykah Badu. Michael Cragg Vampire Weekend O2 Apollo, Manchester, 1 December; touring to 11 December While April\u2019s knotty fifth album Only God Was Above Us failed to connect in the same way as their earlier output, New York indie poppers Vampire Weekend are still a live favourite. In fact, nothing hits quite as perfectly in a cavernous venue than A-Punk\u2019s high-wire guitar intro. MC Shabaka Hutchings Royal Festival Hall, London, 30 November Reeds player Shabaka Hutchings and his band Sons of Kemet won a Mobo award back in 2013. He\u2019s since gone from strength to strength, traversed a swathe of poetic and cinematic soundscapes, with acoustic and hip-hop vibes crossing over on his imaginative new album Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace. John Fordham * * * Going out: Art Barbara Walker The Whitworth, Manchester, to 26 January Drawing is at the heart of this Turner-nominated artist\u2019s output. She does it with precision, yet with feeling. Her portraits put people sidelined from the history of western art at the centre of your gaze. Meanwhile, her takes on artistic masterpieces bring Black figures from the margin to the foreground. Electric Dreams Tate Modern, London, to 1 June Feed your head with this exhibition that promises a psychedelic feast of flashing lights, liquid crystal displays and many other ways artists experimented with science and technology between the 1950s and the birth of the internet. Brion Gysin, Gustav Metzger, Suzanne Treister and Jean Tinguely are among the maverick inventors. Parmigianino The National Gallery, London, 5 December to 9 March Quirky Renaissance genius Parmigianino has an explosive energy, distorting bodies, bending perspective and portraying himself as he looked in a convex mirror with a hugely distorted hand. In other words, he\u2019s an experimental practitioner of the style known as mannerism. Here, his restored The Vision of St Jerome is celebrated. Heroin Falls Sainsbury Centre, University of East Anglia, Norwich, to 27 April Magnum photographer Lindokuhle Sobekwa and Scottish-born snapper Graham MacIndoe show the reality of addicted lives in a show that is sure to be disturbing in its truths. Sobekwa\u2019s reportage reveals the wasted lives of young men on heroin in South Africa. MacIndoe\u2019s confessional photography portrays his own experience of addiction. Jonathan Jones * * * Going out: Stage The Glorious French Revolution (or: Why Sometimes it Takes a Guillotine to Get Anything Done) New Diorama theatre, London, to 14 December How to change the world? Might a decapitation or two help? Written and directed by Sam Ward, the playful theatre-maker who first made waves by bringing audience members up on stage for impromptu dates, this exploration of the French Revolution is a story of hunger, fury and protest. Kate Wyver I Wish Home, Manchester, to 8 December Feast on Le Gateau Chocolat\u2019s unparalleled voice in this musical Christmas adventure for the whole family, which takes inspiration from the most beloved fairytales. Rachel Bagshaw (artistic director of the Unicorn theatre) directs this magical adventure as our lead transforms into the Wish Giver, diving into an exploration of discovery and delight. KW Pitman Alnwick Playhouse, 6 &amp; 7 December The Ashington Group, better known as the Pitmen Painters thanks to Lee Hall\u2019s 2007 play, was an art group made up of miners, whose work became celebrated in the 1930s and 40s. To mark 90 years since the group\u2019s formation, Newcastle-based choreographer Eliot Smith revives Pitman, his piece telling their story. Lyndsey Winship Joel Kim Booster Leicester Square theatre, London, 5 December Brits may recognise Booster from his recent cameo in Industry, but across the pond the 36-year-old exudes main character energy \u2013 not least as the star of his 2022 romcom film Fire Island. Now he\u2019s bringing his latest standup show Rude Little Pig \u2013 about the complexities of being a gay Asian American \u2013 to London. Rachel Aroesti * * * Staying in: Streaming The Sticky Prime Video, 6 December It may sound like a knockabout parody, but the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist was a real crime that involved the theft of 3,000 tonnes of Canada\u2019s famed culinary export. This new series \u2013 exec produced by Jamie Lee Curtis, who also guest stars \u2013 fictionalises the 2011 robbery by putting desperate farmer Ruth Landy (Margo Martindale) at the story\u2019s centre. The Agency Paramount+, 30 November Based on the much-admired French series The Bureau, this London-set thriller from Jez Butterworth and his brother John-Henry features Michael Fassbender as an international spy. But don\u2019t expect any Bond-style levity; this undercover agent is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Richard Gere and Hugh Bonneville co-star. Black Doves Netflix, 5 December One week, two starry London-based thrillers about compromised spies by acclaimed British writers. Created by Joe Barton (Giri/Haji), Black Doves \u2013 which sees Sarah Lancashire and Ben Whishaw join Keira Knightley in her prestige TV debut \u2013 follows a secret agent whose affair leads to a reckoning with the capital\u2019s criminal underworld. Star Wars: Skeleton Crew Disney+, 3 December As ostensibly family-friendly franchise TV gets increasingly dark and disturbing (see: The Penguin), this new entry in the Star Wars canon bucks the trend with a coming-of-age tale about four children who find themselves lost in the galaxy \u2013 until force-user Jod Na Nawood (Jude Law) comes to their rescue. RA * * * Staying in: Games Marvel Rivals Out 5 December; Xbox, PS5, PC This latest entrant to the overcrowded \u201chero shooter\u201d genre takes that label more literally than most, pitting such spandex-supported superheroes as Captain America and Storm against one another in hectic 6 v 6 multiplayer bouts. Fantasian Neo Dimension Out 4 December; Xbox, PS4/5, PC, Switch The adorably old-school 2021 RPG from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi survives the transplant from phone gaming to TV screens with its luscious model-village visuals, and fiendishly obtuse difficulty, intact. Luke Holland * * * Staying in: Albums Michael Kiwanuka \u2013 Small Changes Out now Five years after his Mercury-winning third album, Kiwanuka, the north London singer-songwriter (below) returns with this intimate follow-up. Working again with Inflo and Danger Mouse, Small Changes builds delicate piano and strings round his soulful vocals. MC Leo Bhanji \u2013 Shell EP Out now LA-born, London-based Bhanji makes fragmented symphonies, pouring his emotions into lo-fi, homemade songs that sound as if he\u2019s whispering directly into your ear. Shell, his fourth EP for Dirty Hit, features the fluttering, electronic pulse of single Lung alongside Book 1\u2019s stripped-back minimalism. The Innocence Mission \u2013 Midwinter Swimmers Out now Pennsylvania\u2019s indie-folk veterans, who count the likes of Sufjan Stevens and Iron &amp; Wine as fans, release their 13th album. Anchored by Karen Peris\u2019s otherwordly voice, songs such as This Thread Is a Green Street serve as much-needed soothing balms. Mary J Blige \u2013 Gratitude Out now Released with little fanfare, Gratitude finds the rightfully crowned Queen of Hip-Hop Soul teaming up with producers Kaytranada and Rodney Jerkins, while the likes of Ferg and Jadakiss make guest appearances. But it\u2019s Blige\u2019s voice that shines, adding a sense of well-earned joy on the vibrant Beautiful People. * * * Staying in: Brain food The Rebuilding of Notre Dame de Paris BBC World Service, 5 December, 1.30pm Five years on from the catastrophic fire that threatened to destroy Notre Dame Cathedral (above), Agn\u00e8s Poirier presents a detailed two-part series following the efforts of craftspeople working to restore the building to its former glory.

There are lights on me, and I am very much at sea. My band has recorded a Christmas song to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and we are here to make the music video. As usual, the shoot consists of a group of young people ordering a group of old people to do mildly humiliating things while filming them, like a care home scandal drama set to music. Beyond the lights there\u2019s a small crowd of RNLI volunteers, their families and friends. They are dressed in festive knitwear with Christmas lights strung above their heads, even though it\u2019s November. The effect is a little dislocating, but that is not why I am at sea.

They are in a great position to beat New Zealand who beat India who beat Bangladesh who beat Pakistan who beat England.</p> <p>Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse, aka Chalk and Cheese, took three wickets apiece to reduce New Zealand to 155 for 6 on what remains a pretty good pitch. There were some poor shots but also some brilliant deliveries, most notably the beautiful nipbacker from Woakes to dismiss an ominous looking Kane Williamson for 61.</p> <p>Carse \u2013 if only Tony Greig was still with us to commentate on him \u2013 also hit three sixes in an unbeaten 33 that helped England to 499 all out.

      "bodyText": "Ali Martin is here with his report of a fantastic day three for England at Hagley Oval: 49th over: New Zealand 155-6 (Mitchell 31, Smith 1) A quiet end to a marvellous day for England, who look set to continue Test cricket\u2019s winter of the unexpected. They are in a great position to beat New Zealand who beat India who beat Bangladesh who beat Pakistan who beat England. Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse, aka Chalk and Cheese, took three wickets apiece to reduce New Zealand to 155 for 6 on what remains a pretty good pitch. There were some poor shots but also some brilliant deliveries, most notably the beautiful nipbacker from Woakes to dismiss an ominous looking Kane Williamson for 61. Carse \u2013 if only Tony Greig was still with us to commentate on him \u2013 also hit three sixes in an unbeaten 33 that helped England to 499 all out. Ben Stokes made 80, equalling his highest score since the Lord\u2019s Ashes rampage of 2023, and Gus Atkinson pumped 48 from only 36 balls. 48th over: New Zealand 155-6 (Mitchell 31, Smith 1) It\u2019s the end of a long day, but Carse continues to hit the pitch like he wants to hurt it. No joy in that over, with Mitchell defending very solidly, so Carse finishes another memorable day with figures of 12-3-22-3. There\u2019s time for one more over from Gus Atkinson. I guess if he takes a hat-trick England could claim the extra half-hour. 47th over: New Zealand 154-6 (Mitchell 31, Smith 0) Bashir off, Atkinson on. Mitchell continues to kick it down the road, defending or leaving everything. He\u2019s now made one run from 32 balls since the dismissal of Kane Williamson and Tom Blundell from successive deliveries. 46th over: New Zealand 153-6 (Mitchell 31, Smith 0) A wicket maiden from Carse, whose match figures are quite outstanding: 30-4-85-7. He also pumped 33 not out with the bat earlier in the day. The big man has struck again! Phillips, on the back foot, pushes around a sharp nipbacker and is hit on the back leg. It\u2019s close on height so Phillips reviews the decision \u2013 but it\u2019s umpire\u2019s call and Carse has his third wicket of the day. He is a revelation. 45th over: New Zealand 153-5 (Mitchell 31, Phillips 19) Phillips pulls Bashir firmly for three, with Crawley making another excellent save on the boundary edge. Those runs take New Zeland into the lead; like England they have a very short tail, so this game isn\u2019t necessarily a foregone conclusion. You\u2019d think they need a lead of at least 200 though. 44th over: New Zealand 148-5 (Mitchell 31, Phillips 14) After a game-breaking spell of 5-0-15-2, Woakes gives way to the indefatigable Carse. Phillips widens his eyes after the first delivery hits his defensive bat much harder than expected. Even when Carse\u2019s pace is nearer 80mph than 90 he seems to take batters by surprise. Mitchell, meanwhile, is playing for the close; since that Woakes double strike he\u2019s scored 1 run from 23 balls. 43rd over: New Zealand 147-5 (Mitchell 31, Phillips 13) Phillips moves back in his crease to punch Bashir square for four, a reminder that you don\u2019t need to take risks or go aerial to hit boundaries off the spinner. 42nd over: New Zealand 140-5 (Mitchell 31, Phillips 6) Since you asked, the last time Kane Williamson failed to convert two fifties in the same Test was against Sri Lanka in December 2015. That\u2019s a triumph for England because Williamson is as good as anyone in the world at turning fifties into hundreds. Woakes, the man who dismissed him, hustles through a fairly uneventful over. New Zealand trail by 11 and there\u2019s around half an hour\u2019s play remaining. 41st over: New Zealand 137-5 (Mitchell 30, Phillips 4) Ben Stokes dangles the carrot by bringing Shoaib Bashir back in place of Carse. He tosses a few deliveries up but Phillips and Mitchell are able to resist temptation, for now. 40th over: New Zealand 136-5 (Mitchell 30, Phillips 3) Another accurate, challenging over from Woakes, who has made the batters play at pretty much everything in this spell. In other news\u2026 It\u2019s far from ideal, as Josh Hazlewood was Australia\u2019s best player in the first Test, but it is an area in which they have decent cover. It\u2019s surely more palatable to lose Hazlewood than, say, Nathan Lyon or Travis Head. 39th over: New Zealand 135-5 (Mitchell 30, Phillips 2) England would love one more wicket tonight so that they are into the bowlers before the morning. New Zealand bat deep, with Southee at No10, but that burst from Woakes has made England huge favourites. It\u2019s barely 24 hours since they were 71 for 4 and in all sorts. Carse tries to york Mitchell, who plays it well and then receives a bit of a mouthful from Carse. 38th over: New Zealand 134-5 (Mitchell 30, Phillips 1) Phillips pulls Woakes smoothly for a single to get off the mark, then Mitchell is beaten by some extravagant seam movement from a good length. Woakes\u2019 spell, which started with Williamson almost goading him by steering successive boundaries to third man, now reads 3-0-11-2. 37th over: New Zealand 133-5 (Mitchell 30, Phillips 0) Stokes shows his sadistic side \u2013 towards both batters and bowler - by inviting Carse to bowl another spell of short stuff. Mitchell protects Phillips and plays out a maiden pretty comfortably. I\u2019m still reeling from those two wickets from Woakes. Both were outstanding deliveries but the Williamson LBW is one for the books. For a split-second, as he implored the umpire to raise the finger, Woakes was a 24-year-old hunting his first Test wicket. 36th over: New Zealand 133-5 (Mitchell 30, Phillips 0) Glenn Phillips defends the hat-trick ball. That\u2019s a beautiful moment for Woakes, who wasn\u2019t great in the first innings and might have been playing his last Test overseas had he struggled again in the second. Figures of 10-1-34-3, including the key wicket of Kane Williamson at a crucial time, do not constitute a struggle. Blundell is out! There was the thinnest outside edge through to Pope, so thin that Blundell didn\u2019t feel it, and Chris Woakes is on a hat-trick! It was another jaffa, this time straightening off the seam from a perfect length. Tom Blundell is given out caught behind first ball \u2013 but he\u2019s reviewed the decision straight away and that usually means the batter hasn\u2019t hit it. Woakes bowled a gorgeous nipbacker that beat Williamson\u2019s defensive push and hit him on the back leg. It was given out LBW and, though Williamson reviewed, his body language suggested he knew he was on his way. It was actually closer than it looked: the ball was hammering the stumps but the point of contact was umpire\u2019s call, so Rod Tucker\u2019s on-field decision was crucial. What a breakthrough for England! Chris Woakes has just experienced his greatest moment in an overseas Test! 35th over: New Zealand 132-3 (Williamson 61, Mitchell 29) Bashir is starting to get into his work and again concedes only one run from the over. You\u2019d expect him to continue but I\u2019d tempted to try either Carse or Stokes \u2013 who looked dangerous in a short two-over spell \u2013 at the other end. 34th over: New Zealand 131-3 (Williamson 61, Mitchell 28) Woakes returns to the attack and is immediately steered for four by Williamson. It was in the air and not far wide of backward point. To prove he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing, Williamson glides another boundary between keeper and slip. An affronted Woakes replies with a good delivery that nips back to take the inside edge. This is fascinating cricket. 33rd over: New Zealand 121-3 (Williamson 53, Mitchell 28) It would have been easy for Stokes to take Bashir off after he conceded 32 from his first four overs. That, emphatically, is not how he rolls so Bashir continues and bowls a better over that costs only one run. 32nd over: New Zealand 121-3 (Williamson 52, Mitchell 28) Williamson punches Atkinson off the back foot for three to reach a quietly dominant fifty from 74 balls. He\u2019s been immaculate. England cannot even acknowledge the concept of potential victory until they get rid of him. Mitchell, who is also playing really well, drives Atkinson through extra cover for four more. New Zealand trail by 30. 31st over: New Zealand 114-3 (Williamson 49, Mitchell 24) As expected, New Zealand are going after Bashir. Williamson thumps a boundary through extra cover, Mitchell chips another over midwicket and then reverse sweeps the third of the over. Inbetween those Mitchell deliveries he was beaten by a nice delivery that skidded straight on. Pope dropped it but I don\u2019t think there was an outside edge. Replays confirm as much. 30th over: New Zealand 101-3 (Williamson 44, Mitchell 16) Atkinson bowls a challenging over to Mitchell, probably his best in this innings. No runs off the bat, just a no-ball. 29th over: New Zealand 100-3 (Williamson 44, Mitchell 16) Williamson skids back in his crease to slap Bashir through the covers for two. I know I keep saying it but he looks in ominously touch from an England perspective \u2013 not just for this game but the rest of the series. 28th over: New Zealand 98-3 (Williamson 42, Mitchell 16) More classy strokeplay from Williamson, in this case a back-foot punch for three off Atkinson. England would to sub Matthew Potts in for a few overs; he has a head-to-head average of 1.00 against Williamson in Tests. 27th over: New Zealand 95-3 (Williamson 39, Mitchell 16) Ben Stokes changes tack and brings Shoaib Bashir back into the attack. Mitchell, who loves to take on the spinners, promptly reverse sweeps for four. Williamson also whips through midwicket for three in a productive over for New Zealand; nine runs from it. 26th over: New Zealand 86-3 (Williamson 35, Mitchell 11) Atkinson replaces Carse and has a field for orthodox bowling. His third ball is slightly too full and driven handsomely through mid-off for four by Mitchell. The rest of the over won\u2019t make the highlights. 25th over: New Zealand 82-3 (Williamson 35, Mitchell 7) Mitchell averages 70 in Tests against England, mainly because of a spectacular series in 2022, but his recent form isn\u2019t so good. Having scored five Test hundreds in his first 25 innings, he\u2019s hit none in the last 23. Woakes gets one to snarl back off the seam to rap him on the glove. There\u2019s no short leg \u2013 England have both a leg slip and leg gully \u2013 so the ball lands safely. 24th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Williamson 35, Mitchell 6) Carse, who is doing a fantastic job as Mark Wood\u2019s deputy, takes the role a bit too literally by falling over in hsi delivery stride. Next he\u2019ll be riding an imaginary horse. A couple of short balls to Williamson are called wide before Williamson pulls a legal delivery for a single. 23rd over: New Zealand 77-3 (Williamson 34, Mitchell 6) Woakes is back, presumably with the new batter Daryl Mitchell in mind. A nice outswinger is followed by a nipbacker that bounces over the stumps with Mitchell offering no stroke. After Pope does well to save four leg byes, Mitchell flicks riskily but also effectively past leg slip for four. 22nd over: New Zealand 73-3 (Williamson 34, Mitchell 2) Now Williamson gets in a bit of trouble against Carse, top-edging a hook well short of fine leg. There\u2019s no real need for New Zealand to take Carse\u2019s short stuff on, especially as they\u2019ve already lost a key wicket in both innings. Carse switches around the wicket for the last ball of the over and almost strikes when Williamson cuts on the bounce to backward point. He hasn\u2019t looked comfortable against Carse all game. 21st over: New Zealand 71-3 (Williamson 33, Mitchell 1) Stokes tries to york Williamson, who clips the ball to the right of mid-on. Carse saves three runs with a fine sprawling stop. But there\u2019s nowt anyone can do when Williamson places a back cut between gully and backward point for four. Beautiful batting. 20th over: New Zealand 64-3 (Williamson 27, Mitchell 0) Daryl Mitchell is greeted by a sharp lifter from Carse that rams into the glove and drops safely on the off side. I have only one question, your honour: how the hell does Brydon Carse have a first-class bowling average of 33? He looks terrific. Brydon Carse has burgled another wicket! Rachin Ravindra couldn\u2019t resist taking on the short ball but top-edged it high towards deep backwards square, where Jacob Bethell backpedalled smartly to take an awkward catch with aplomb. That\u2019s a precious breakthrough for England \u2013 and for Carse, who is making a sensational start to his Test career. 19th over: New Zealand 64-2 (Williamson 27, Ravindra 24) That\u2019s a promising start from Stokes, who is targeting the stumps \u2013 and occasionally the helmet \u2013 and gave the two batters nothing they could leave. 18.2 overs: New Zealand 62-2 (Williamson 26, Ravindra 23) Stokes\u2019 second ball zips off the surface to beat Williamson and thump into the helmet. Williamson was trying to pull but was hopelessly late on the shot, which tells a story given how much time he usually has. Stokes checks on Williamson, who is smiling and seems fine. There\u2019s a short break in play while he is checked for concussion. Ben Stokes is bringing himself on at the start of the evening session. England would love one of his force-of-personality breakthroughs right now, especially if it\u2019s Williamson. Only three of the other 18 players with at least 9,000 Test runs, only three have higher average than Kane Williamson. 57.40 Kumar Sangakkara 56.40 Steve Smith 55.37 Jacques Kallis 54.87 Kane Williamson 53.78 Sachin Tendulkar Is it possible to be an all-time great and still underrated? If so, Kumar Sangakkara\u2019s your man. 18th over: New Zealand 62-2 (Williamson 26, Ravindra 23) Williamson top-edges a hook off Atkinson for a single. It was safe enough, landing well short of fine leg, but that will encourage England. He did a false stroke! That run takes Williamson to 9,000 Test runs, a lovely milestone for the humblest genius in world cricket, maybe world sport. Ravindra almost falls to the last ball before tea, snapping his head round nervously after a defensive stroke off Atkinson bounces behind him. It missed the stumps so Ravindra and Williamson will resume their gracefest after tea. England did pretty well to winkle out the openers on what now looks a belter of a batting pitch. They lead by 89, which is handy but not necessarily decisive in the context of a high-scoring game, especially not while Williamson has an asterisk against his name. This match is beautifully poised. 17th over: New Zealand 59-2 (Williamson 24, Ravindra 22) Shoaib Bashir replaces Carse and will bowl to Ravindra, who he dismissed in the first innings. Ravindra starts round two with elegant authority, sweeping carefully to the fine leg boundary before collecting a pair of twos. New Zealand trail by 92. 16th over: New Zealand 50-2 (Williamson 24, Ravindra 14) Sound the Short Ball Ploy klaxon: Gus Atkinson is coming on for Woakes with a field set for some rough stuff. He has a fine leg, deep square leg, square leg, midwicket and mid-on for Ravindra, who jumps back to drop a single on the off side. It was only one run but mediocre players can\u2019t play a shot like that. Williamson deals with the rest of the over. Should be time for two more before the tea beak. 15th over: New Zealand 50-2 (Williamson 24, Ravindra 13) Ravindra clips and pulls Carse for a pair of twos. The second was a fine shot which again demonstrated how much time he has at the crease. This is starting to look like a big job for England on a pitch that has flattened out in the last 24 hours. For now Ben Stokes still has very attacking fields but that will change as the ball gets older. 14th over: New Zealand 45-2 (Williamson 24, Ravindra 8) Williamson plays a rare false stroke, a thick inside edge off Woakes for a single. Ravindra then times a lovely shot through mid-on for three. 13th over: New Zealand 41-2 (Williamson 23, Ravindra 5) One or two of the England cordon appeal for caught behind when Carse gets a bit of extra bounce to Ravindra. England missed a thin nick in the first innings, but not this time: there\u2019s nothing on UltraEdge. Carse is almost rewarded for a no-ball when the extra delivery beats Ravindra\u2019s defensive push. He was keen to discuss a review, the rest of the team not so much. Carse is bowling nicely, with good pace and the usual awkward bounce. A lot can happen in 12 months \u2013 look at the state of that banana \u2013 but right now he feels like a shoo-in for the Ashes squad. 12th over: New Zealand 39-2 (Williamson 22, Ravindra 5) Woakes changes ends to replace Atkinson (5-1-17-0). Ben Stokes still has three slips and a gully even though the new ball hasn\u2019t really done much; he knows the value of getting Williamson, who has a stunning conversion rate, before he reaches fifty. Williamson pushes a single to move to 22. Ravindra, another batter who seems to have so much time, forces a high-class boundary through extra cover. England have done well to take two early wickets because this pitch looks flatter than at any stage in the match. Don\u2019t be surprised if we see Shoaib Bashir before tea. 11th over: New Zealand 33-2 (Williamson 21, Ravindra 1) Carse gave Williamson some problems in the first innings so this should be an intriguing contest. He has a nice rhythm, with his pace just shy of 90mph, but Williamson still has plenty of time to wave a cut for three. Crawley did very well to save the boundary. Tell you what, Dame Fortune, Williamson looks in seriously good nick today. 10th over: New Zealand 28-2 (Williamson 17, Ravindra 0) A meek short ball from Atkinson is pulled classily for four by Williamson, who then takes a quick single on the off side. Atkinson\u2019s strongest suit is the only thing letting him down today. DO YOU HEAR THAT MOTHER CRICKET. 9th over: New Zealand 23-2 (Williamson 12, Ravindra 0) If there was any doubt, today has confirmed that Gus Atkinson is a three-dimensional cricketer. He belted 48 from 36 balls and how now taken a quite brilliant catch. Brydon Carse has struck in his first over! Conway pulled a shortish delivery towards mid-on, where Atkinson dived moved smartly to his left and dived forward to take a fantastic catch. It\u2019s being checked by the third umpire but I\u2019m pretty sure he got his hands under the ball. He did indeed: that is a marvellous catch! 8th over: New Zealand 21-1 (Conway 6, Williamson 12) Williamson, who looks in ominously good touch, drives Atkinson past the diving mid-off for four. He has a bit of a scare when a defensive stroke bounces behind him in the general direction of the stumps. Williamson tries to kick the ball away, misses and almost gives the off stump a whack instead. All\u2019s well that ends well. We mentioned this on the first day but it\u2019s worth reiterating just how formidable Williamson is on home soil. He averages 68 from 50 Tests in New Zealand, and in the last 20 games that averages rises to 88. That\u2019s one helluva cheat code. 7th over: New Zealand 16-1 (Conway 6, Williamson 8) Thanks Taha, morning everyone. This is a gripping arm-wrestle within an arm-wrestle: England trying to make Conway and Williamson play as much as possible; Conway and Williamson leaving whenever they can. Woakes\u2019s fourth over isn\u2019t the best, allowing as it does five leaves out of six. Not sure why I turned into Angus Deayton there. 6th over: New Zealand 15-1 (Williamson 7, Conway 6) Gorgeous from Atkinson, who finds some decent carry as he squares up Conway from around the wicket. That\u2019ll be all from me \u2013 Rob Smyth is in for the rest of the day. 5th over: New Zealand 15-1 (Williamson 7, Conway 6) Woakes brings the ball back into Williamson, but the little master judges his leave perfectly before punching the next ball into the covers for two. The over ends with the former Test captain driving through mid-off for four, a touch uppishly. 4th over: New Zealand 9-1 (Williamson 1, Conway 6) Conway gets properly going with a solid punch through mid-off for four. 3rd over: New Zealand 3-1 (Williamson 0, Conway 2) Woakes gets the ball to shoot past Kane Williamson\u2019s outside edge with a lush outswinger. The quick is finding his rhythm. Woakes strikes! He goes around the wicket with the wobble seam, forces Latham to play, and the outside edge is nabbed by Harry Brook, low at second slip. 2nd over: New Zealand 3-0 (Latham 1, Conway 1) Atkinson goes around the wicket to Conway, who he had caught and bowled in the first innings. Conway decides to play it slow, allowing the bowler a maiden \u2026 oops, no, Atkinson oversteps with the final ball. Conway leaves the re-bowled delivery alone. 1st over: New Zealand 2-0 (Latham 1, Conway 1) Chris Woakes takes the new ball against Tom Latham \u2026 and immediately has the ball zipping past the outside edge. The next ball is tucked away into the leg side for one. Woakes didn\u2019t look his sharpest in the first innings, going wicketless, still trying to prove his worth overseas. Conway tucks away for one himself. What a bizarre innings, with New Zealand dropping an obscene amount of chances. Henry finishes with 4-84 while O\u2019Rourke bowled brilliantly for figures of \u2026 1-138 from 25 overs. England lead by 151. WICKET! Bashir c Southee b Henry 5 (England 499 all out) Matt Henry finds Bashir\u2019s outside edge \u2026 but the ball flies past slip and away for four. Bashir ends the over with a slog \u2026 the ball flies high and Southee does very well, running to midwicket to hold on. 102nd over: England 495-9 (Carse 33, Bashir 1) Carse opts against singles early in the over, protecting Bashir from the wrath of O\u2019Rourke. The England fast bowler hits down the ground to pick up two before ending the over with a heave over long-on for six! England\u2019s tail are having a ball today. 101st over: England 487-9 (Carse 25, Bashir 1) I mean no disrespect to Shoaib Bashir, but there\u2019s quite a batting drop-off from Carse to him. The No 11 clips for one before Carse dabs into the off side for a single. There won\u2019t be a ton for Stokes. His cross-bat hit off Henry, the ball dug into the surface, finds Southee at long-on. 100th over: England 485-8 (Carse 24, Stokes 80) O\u2019Rourke wears a pained expression walking back to his mark, perhaps stunned by how he only has one wicket despite bowling well and creating several chances. The quick tests Carse out with an electric yorker, but the bat gets down in time. Carse then dabs the ball over the slip cordon for a boundary. And then six, with Carse walking across his stumps before launching over fine leg! 99th over: England 475-8 (Carse 14, Stokes 80) Carse is tested by Henry\u2019s short ball \u2026 and swings hard over fine leg for six! More bumpers follow but Carse doesn\u2019t get in any trouble. 98th over: England 466-8 (Carse 6, Stokes 79) Stokes shuffled across to the leg side numerous times in that first session, and he\u2019s up to the same after lunch, but can\u2019t make contact against O\u2019Rourke. New Zealand\u2019s giant quick peppers Stokes with the short ball, the England captain eventually getting himself a single before Carse is dropped! The No 10 swings hard and Glenn Phillips can\u2019t hold on, making plenty of ground from point. New Zealand\u2019s misery in the field continues. And we\u2019re back for the second session, Stokes and Carse the batters, O\u2019Rourke the bowler. Here\u2019s some fun stats stuff: Harry Brook\u2019s Test batting average against New Zealand is exactly 100 after five innings, with his strike rate 101.01. 97th over: England 459-8 (Stokes 78, Carse 5) The lead, I should state, has risen to three figures. Stokes punches for one to end the over and the session. It\u2019s been a fine one for England \u2013 they\u2019ve gone at six an over. Nathan Green makes a great point: \u201cIs this peak Bazball? England has a first class hundy at 10 but not at 3.\u201d 96th over: England 456-8 (Carse 5, Stokes 76) Brydon Carse is greeted with a quality yorker from Will O\u2019Rourke, which the No 10 somehow squeezes away to the boundary. Carse has two first-class tons and averages 30-odd in first-class cricket, by the way. Stokes shuffles to the leg side before pulling O\u2019Rourke away for four. Don\u2019t bowl short to him! Atkinson hooks Smith over fine leg for six to move to 44 off 34. He then shuffles to the leg side to slap Smith through extra cover for another boundary. But he won\u2019t get a 50 \u2026 Atkinson doesn\u2019t nail the pull this time round as Glenn Phillips does well to hold on at deep backward square. 95th over: England 445-8 (Carse 0, Stokes 70) 94th over: England 431-7 (Atkinson 35, Stokes 69) Atkinson hits the ball really hard. He cracks one to deep point for a single before Stokes shows off some finesse, punching O\u2019Rourke through mid-off for four. Stokes shuffles to the leg side twice to make room but O\u2019Rourke follows him with the ball to stop any damage. 93rd over: England 426-7 (Atkinson 34, Stokes 65) Stokes wants to match Atkinson, swinging wild against Smith, but has to settle for an edge that travels over slip to the boundary. 92nd over: England 421-7 (Atkinson 33, Stokes 61) Stokes is happy to take the singles so Atkinson can let loose, which is some compliment. And then another four, this time off O\u2019Rourke as Atkinson swings hard through the off side. There\u2019s a small appeal as a catch loops up to backward point, but the ball just slapped Stokes\u2019 thigh pad, not the bat. 91st over: England 413-7 (Atkinson 27, Stokes 60) Atkinson smashes Smith through the covers for four \u2013 he\u2019s going at better than a run a ball. Atkinson then plays another pull, this time along the carpet, behind square leg for four more. He\u2019s thriving against the bumper. 90th over: England 402-7 (Atkinson 17, Stokes 59) Atkinson pulls Matt Henry for six! He does have all-rounder potential. Another pull shot ends the over \u2026 with the ball not carrying to Rachin Ravindra in the deep. 89th over: England 395-7 (Atkinson 10, Stokes 59) Nathan Smith is back, replacing Southee. Stokes has curbed his adventure at the crease since Brook\u2019s dismissal, cutting out the skip down the pitch. He hits to mid-on for a single before Atkinson collects two with a leg-side clip. 88th over: England 390-7 (Atkinson 6, Stokes 58) Atkinson gets the forward defence out as Matt Henry thunders in. The over ends with the No 9 squirting the ball through point for another three. 87th over: England 387-7 (Atkinson 3, Stokes 58) Gus Atkinson, Test centurion, joins Stokes, with Southee getting the ball to hoop. Atkinson shows his batting chops with a leg-side clip for three. Southee strikes immediately after drinks, with Tom Latham getting rid of his catching blues with a low grab at second slip! Woakes pushed at the ball outside off. It goes up to the TV umpire to check the catch is clean \u2013 cue the awkwardness of the slo-mo replay which makes every grab look a little sketchy. Think he\u2019s OK here, though, and the umpire agrees. Out. 86th over: England 382-6 (Woakes 1, Stokes 56) Chris Woakes is up next and there\u2019s still a lot of work to do: the lead is hardly enormous. Stokes takes a blow to the arm after failing to middle a pull shot off Henry. Ouch. Sixth time lucky as New Zealand finally hold on! Brook tries to play that guide to third man again, but an outside edge travels into the hands of Tom Blundell. 85th over: England 381-5 (Brook 171, Stokes 56) Oh my days. Brook has sent Southee on to the roof, swatting away over the leg side for six. Then comes a delicate guide behind point for four. Get yourself a man who can do both. Krishnamoorthy v asks a pertinent question: \u201cWhat is the record for most dropped catches for one batsman. I do not recall 5 for a single player - this is qctually nuts.\u201d Don\u2019t think Cricinfo have a list for this kind of stuff. 84th over: England 370-5 (Brook 160, Stokes 56) Ben Stokes has his first 50 since the summer, and he wants more: out comes a shimmy down the pitch and slap through the covers for four \u2013 off Matt Henry. Stokes and Brook have put on 51 in 10 overs today. 83rd over: England 362-5 (Brook 159, Stokes 49) Brook moves to 152 with serious swagger, skipping down the pitch to thrash Southee through the off side for four. He then tries the scoop \u2026 but fails to make contact. The two batters exchange singles before Brook clips into the leg side for a couple. A leg-side swat from Brook to the ropes ends the over. The runs are flowing and these two are in a rush. 82nd over: England 350-5 (Brook 148, Stokes 48) Stokes doesn\u2019t lace his cover drive off Matt Henry, nearly offering Williamson a catch but the ball drops just short. The left-hander looks a bit fidgety, trying to force things with the bat. Guy Hornsby writes in: Doesn\u2019t Christchurch look like an absolutely beautiful place to watch cricket? Those panned back shots to games going on in the shadow of the ground are the best thing. Even better seeing girls playing. I went to those wonderful islands back in 2001, a truly great time it was, but late May wasn\u2019t the time for Test cricket, sadly. Perhaps the Black Caps fielders feel like getting on the bus themselves, rather then shell yet another catch. They really are giving so many lives to England. But it\u2019s new ball time, should be interesting! 81st over: England 350-5 (Brook 148, Stokes 48) Time for the second new ball, with England trailing by just one. Stokes skips down the pitch immediately, but doesn\u2019t connect with Tim Southee\u2019s inswinger. Stokes is dancing around his crease, making his intentions known: he wants to have a whack. He sneaks through a quick single before Brook does the same to produce a first-innings lead. 80th over: England 347-5 (Brook 147, Stokes 46) Stokes pulls Smith to claim a couple. TV replays show the five times Brook has been dropped in this innings \u2013 this is so unlike New Zealand. 79th over: England 340-5 (Brook 147, Stokes 41) O\u2019Rourke gets the ball to thud into Brook\u2019s front pad, though it\u2019s high and probably sliding down leg as well. A bumper follows and the six-foot-very-tall quick is still causing the guy on 147* problems \u2026 and then another drop! Brook looks up to the skies and smiles. He slashed outside off, it went to Glenn Phillips at gully, and it really should have been taken. Straight to him, but popped out. 78th over: England 340-5 (Brook 147, Stokes 41) Smith gets one to leap up towards the shoulder of Brook\u2019s bat, but the ball keeps low as it bisects the slip cordon. Brook then crunches a drive through extra cover for four; England are quicky making their way towards a lead. 77th over: England 332-5 (Brook 140, Stokes 41) Stokes nails a cover drive off O\u2019Rourke \u2026 but Kane Williamson pulls off a cracking dive to his right to collect before firing a throw at the striker\u2019s end. The England captain is forced to turn back and launch himself to make his ground. 76th over: England 329-5 (Brook 138, Stokes 41) Nathan Smith, very impressive on day two, is in from the other end. Brook is quick into his work, though, driving through point for his first boundary of the morning. Then comes the immaculate forward defence, quite possibly my favourite shot of his (a bit boring, I know). I reckon he could thrive at No 3. 75th over: England 324-5 (Brook 133, Stokes 41) Will O\u2019Rourke opens up, with six overs remaining until the second new ball is available. Brook is on strike and quickly off it, tucking behind square on the leg side for one. Stokes throws the bat at a wide one but only connects with the air; he leaves the next one well alone. I wonder if he\u2019s keen for a thrash before the new ball? He nails a pull shot for four to bring up a century stand. Ben Stokes and Harry Brook, all smiles, make their way out to the middle. Let\u2019s get going. \u201cMorning from a wet Auckland,\u201d writes Chris Pitts. \u201cAssuming England can push on this morning, what would be a lead?\u201d England would probably be very chuffed to get to 450, get themselves a 100-run lead? Considering where they were at lunch yesterday, any lead feels a fine achievement. TalkSport, providing radio comms on this series, have had their cameras nicked! William Lane writes in, offering some herbal wisdom: Sorry to hear you\u2019re under the weather. Can\u2019t go wrong with classic lemon lemsip, but I like to make my own lemon and ginger mix on the hob to stir the powdered stuff into. Tablespoon of honey in there too and you\u2019re onto a winner. Not much to say on the cricket itself to be honest, it\u2019s all a bit \u201cclassic England\u201d isn\u2019t it? Ride our luck to be in touching distance of the first innings score with a few wickets in hand, collapse, concede a sizeable 3rd innings score before an all-time great chase in the fourth innings. Yawn.... Mark Quinn\u2019s having a lovely time. As I crank up my electric heater, the jealousy grows. \u201cLongterm reader first time writer\u2026 Just thought I\u2019d drop you a line as we\u2019re on holidays in Christchurch. Watching test cricket barefoot sat on a grass bank was a real joy, and to top it off, it was a cracking day yesterday. The first session looked tricky yesterday but would be fantastic for Stokes to get a century in his birthplace\u2026\u201d Elsewhere in the Test game, there\u2019s this mad scorecard. Aside from the obvious \u2018Sri Lanka, what you doing?!?!?\u2019, it\u2019s worth noting that Temba Bavuma, a fine player who struggles to convert his fifties, has got his third Test ton. Where does Ollie Pope want Ollie Pope to bat? He\u2019s made it pretty clear, despite an impressive knock at No 6 on day two. New Zealand, England, the Hagley Oval, day three and it could end up being a tight game. This is how you do a Friday night, right? The hosts had a bit of a stinker in the field yesterday, dropping several catches, and Harry Brook took advantage to post his seventh Test hundred and sixth away from home, which is just a bit ridiculous. He remains unbeaten on 132, with Ben Stokes, searching for form, alongside him on 37. England trail by 29, with five wickets still in the bag. Feel free to drop me a line with your thoughts, queries, views on where Ollie Pope should bat, favourite Lemsip flavour (I\u2019m feeling a bit meh), whatever makes you happy.",

      "body": "<p>What a time it is to be a fan of spy shows. Slow Horses has just ended, there is a new remake of The Day of the Jackal, and we are only a few days away from seeing Keira Knightley\u2019s wildly anticipated new Netflix show Black Doves. Even to think about entering a market this crowded, you would have to have wild levels of confidence.</p> <p>Which brings us to The Agency, a new Paramount+ spy show that could measure its confidence in light years. It is based on the French series Le Bureau des L\u00e9gendes, a show that has been acclaimed as one of the best ever made. It has been adapted by the Butterworth brothers, who seem to do nothing except make hits. It is produced by George Clooney. The first two episodes are directed by Joe Wright. The cast features Michael Fassbender, Jodie Turner-Smith, Jeffrey Wright and Richard Gere. Paramount is promoting it less like a television programme and more like the second coming of Christ. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>As it turns out, a lot. On the basis of the first couple of episodes, it feels as if The Agency spent so much time amassing a murderers\u2019 row of prestigious names that it forgot to put any petrol in the tank. This is a slow, ambling show that, at times, feels as if it is collapsing under the weight of its own self-importance. Perhaps, like Le Bureau des L\u00e9gendes, we will be able to look back at it five years from now and marvel at its mastery of slowly tightening its grip on the audience. But as a way of introducing itself, The Agency moves with all the urgency of the recently tranquillised.</p> <p>Fassbender is the object around which all else orbits. He has been out of action for a while, popping up only in the slated Taika Waititi film Next Goal Wins and David Fincher\u2019s comprehensively unheralded The Killer. In The Agency, he plays an American spy who is brought back from a long-term undercover operation less cleanly than his superiors would have liked.

      "bodyText": "What a time it is to be a fan of spy shows. Slow Horses has just ended, there is a new remake of The Day of the Jackal, and we are only a few days away from seeing Keira Knightley\u2019s wildly anticipated new Netflix show Black Doves. Even to think about entering a market this crowded, you would have to have wild levels of confidence. Which brings us to The Agency, a new Paramount+ spy show that could measure its confidence in light years. It is based on the French series Le Bureau des L\u00e9gendes, a show that has been acclaimed as one of the best ever made. It has been adapted by the Butterworth brothers, who seem to do nothing except make hits. It is produced by George Clooney. The first two episodes are directed by Joe Wright. The cast features Michael Fassbender, Jodie Turner-Smith, Jeffrey Wright and Richard Gere. Paramount is promoting it less like a television programme and more like the second coming of Christ. What could possibly go wrong? As it turns out, a lot. On the basis of the first couple of episodes, it feels as if The Agency spent so much time amassing a murderers\u2019 row of prestigious names that it forgot to put any petrol in the tank. This is a slow, ambling show that, at times, feels as if it is collapsing under the weight of its own self-importance. Perhaps, like Le Bureau des L\u00e9gendes, we will be able to look back at it five years from now and marvel at its mastery of slowly tightening its grip on the audience. But as a way of introducing itself, The Agency moves with all the urgency of the recently tranquillised. Fassbender is the object around which all else orbits. He has been out of action for a while, popping up only in the slated Taika Waititi film Next Goal Wins and David Fincher\u2019s comprehensively unheralded The Killer. In The Agency, he plays an American spy who is brought back from a long-term undercover operation less cleanly than his superiors would have liked. He went abroad, fell in love, and failed to cut all contact with the object of his affection. Is that because love conquers all, or because the woman has a dark, ulterior motive? Presumably, at this rate, we will find out, seven or eight years from now. There is a sliver of good news. The fact that Le Bureau des L\u00e9gendes ran for so long means that, should it be recommissioned, The Agency is in good hands. It won\u2019t, to use a professional industry term, do a Homeland and go bananas the second it runs out of source material. The time will not come where Fassbender outlives his French counterpart and, stuck for what else to do with him, the showrunners decide to get him hooked on heroin in an Argentinian tower block. This, if nothing else, is worth clinging to. The larger thing hobbling The Agency is the fact that we are living in a post-Slow Horses world. Slow Horses is effortless. It seems to know the town in which it is set. It understands how to lighten the moment with a joke. It is built from the inside out, with characters driving the plot rather than the other way around. And it is staggering how much The Agency forgets to do any of this. Like Slow Horses, it is also set in London. But it is an incurious, touristy version of London that lacks authenticity. And unlike in Slow Horses, nobody here has any discernible personality. This goes double for Fassbender\u2019s character. Also \u2013 and I\u2019m aware this is a small thing in the bigger scheme of things \u2013 I am still not fully sure where his character is supposed to be from. I would like to hazard a guess that he is American. But then again, he is an Irish actor playing a character who lives in London, and his accent reflects this, at differing levels, from scene to scene. It is bizarre. Maybe these are early wobbles.

He appealed to any witnesses who may have been in the Cambridge Park area on Oxford Street early on Saturday morning or late on Friday night to come forward. Cantrell said he was aware of footage that had been circulating on social media. \u201cIt shows a male in the vicinity, the time is yet to be confirmed, but it is certainly a line of inquiry,\u201d he said. Cantrell said police had \u201cno intelligence to suggest that there is any further threat\u201d. Police urged anyone who may have dashcam or CCTV footage to come forward or contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.",

The four paintings were produced as part of a series by De Heem, who is considered to be a master of pronkstilleven \u2013 a style of ornate still life painting \u2013 during the Dutch golden age, depicting displays of sumptuous food and luxurious objects. Fruits and Rich Dishes on a Table (1640), is being loaned from the Louvre; Still Life with Boy and Parrots (1641), arrives from Brussels City Museum; and Still Life in a Palatial Setting (1642) is being loaned from a private collection. Banquet Still Life (1643) is the final painting in the series, has a value of about \u00a36m and has been on show at the Fitzwilliam since 2023. The show, which opens on 3 December and is called Picturing Excess, places the work in a historical context of rapid European expansion around the world, when the wealthy would flaunt their riches via the ostentatious displays painted by De Heem. The Fitzwilliam said the paintings exhibited the \u201cvast array of expensive and luxurious commodities\u201d, while also referring to \u201cexcess and abundance but also colonialism\u201d.
