We will give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime,\u201d he told his cabinet at a meeting today.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Egyptian president</strong> <strong>Abdel Fattah al-Sisi</strong> said that his government has proposed a two-day ceasefire in Gaza, after which talks should resume within 10 days in efforts to reach a permanent one. During the two days he suggested a swap of four hostages held in Gaza by Hamas for four Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

Israel\u2019s president, <strong>Issac Herzog,</strong> hailed the US \u2013 Israel\u2019s biggest arm supplier \u2013 as his country\u2019s \u201ctrue ally\u201d after the airstrikes.

Iran\u2019s mission to the UN said Israeli warplanes attacked several Iranian military and radar sites from Iraqi airspace, and blamed the US for what it called its \u201ccomplicity\u201d. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, <strong>Abbas Araghchi,</strong> described the Israeli attack as \u201creckless and cowardly\u201d, adding that his country was determined to defend itself.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Israeli strikes reportedly hit Iranian facilities used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles. </strong>Satellite images obtained by Reuters appear to confirm that the Israeli attacks hit buildings that Iran used for mixing solid fuel for ballistic missiles. Israel struck Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran, as well as Khojir, a sprawling missile production site near the Iranian capital, the news agency reported, citing two US researchers. Israel hit 12 \u201cplanetary mixers\u201d used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, which<strong> </strong>make up the bulk of Iran\u2019s missile arsenal, Israeli sources told Axios.

Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said it had a right to self-defence after Saturday\u2019s attack. The statement said Iranian radar sites were damaged but some were already under repair, and added that Israel used so-called \u201cstandoff\u201d missiles over Iraqi airspace to launch it attacks.

      "bodyText": "The United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has expressed his shock at the appalling straits the remaining residents stuck in northern Gaza are in. His spokesman released a statement, with the UN chief calling the dire situation there \u201cunbearable\u201d as citizens remain trapped in extreme danger and deprivation, under siege by the Israeli military. Guterres was \u201cshocked by the harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction in the north\u201d. The number of people reported injured when a truck rammed into a bus stop in Ramat Hasharon, north of Tel Aviv, in Israel earlier today has risen to \u201cabout 40\u201d, according to an agency citing Israeli police \u2013 and the authorities are saying they suspect it was deliberate. One person was killed in the incident, which took place near a military base. The police said the investigation\u2019s focus was on the suspicion that this was a terrorist attack. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said the Islamic Republican was not looking for war in the wake of air strikes on the country by Israel early on Saturday. \u201cWe do not seek war but we will defend the rights of our nation and country. We will give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime,\u201d he told his cabinet at a meeting today. Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said that his government has proposed a two-day ceasefire in Gaza, after which talks should resume within 10 days in efforts to reach a permanent one. During the two days he suggested a swap of four hostages held in Gaza by Hamas for four Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. This comes as preliminary talks tentatively resume in Qatar with hopes of reviving ceasefire negotiations in earnest. One person was killed and dozens of people were reported to have been injured after a truck hit a bus stop in Glilot, central Israel, near Tel Aviv. Many of those injured were reportedly elderly citizens who had disembarked from a bus ahead of a visit to a nearby IDF base. The driver of the truck was shot dead by a civilian at the scene. Israeli military strikes killed at least 45 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, most of them in the north of the enclave, Palestinian health officials said. At least 20 people were killed following an Israeli airstrike on houses in Jabalia, while an airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinian families in Shati camp in Gaza City killed nine people, medics said. Three local journalists were among those killed at the school in Shati. An Israeli airstrike on Sidon, a city in coastal south Lebanon, killed at least eight people and wounded 25 on Sunday, the country\u2019s health ministry said. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public comments since Israeli warplanes attacked military targets in Iran early on Saturday. He said the attack \u201cshould neither be downplayed nor exaggerated\u201d, without directly calling for a retaliation. He added that military officials would discuss Iran\u2019s next steps, suggesting any retaliation may not be imminent. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel\u2019s air attack on Iran was \u201cprecise and powerful\u201d and achieved all its goals. The directors of the CIA and Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence service will meet Qatar\u2019s prime minister in Doha later today to begin negotiations for a new short-term Gaza ceasefire deal, an official told Reuters. The Israeli military urged residents of 14 villages in southern Lebanon, where it says Hezbollah fighters are, to evacuate immediately and move north of the Awali river or risk being killed. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said Hezbollah and Hamas are no longer effective proxies for Iran. He also said \u201cpainful concessions\u201d are needed to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza, without specifying what these would be. The Middle East crisis live blog is now closing. Thanks for following along. In case you missed it earlier, approximately 70 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes in the past day, health officials in Gaza said, as Israel\u2019s renewed campaign in the north of the strip shows no sign of slowing despite the revival of ceasefire talks after a three-month-long hiatus. Separately, one person was killed when a truck rammed into a bus stop in Ramat Hasharon, north of Tel Aviv, on Sunday, in what Israeli police are treating as a suspected terrorist attack. About 40 people were injured to varying degrees, some seriously, and were taken to nearby hospitals, police said. The Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad praised the suspected attack but did not claim it. The driver of the truck was a Palestinian citizen of Israel, police said, and was \u201cneutralised\u201d by passersby carrying firearms. Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said a Palestinian man was killed after he tried to stab a group of soldiers in the occupied West Bank town of Hizma. Information about the situation in northern Gaza has become increasingly sporadic and difficult to verify as Israel\u2019s new ground and aerial assault focusing on Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun enters its fourth week. Internet and phone services have been down for hours at a time, and civil defence workers have been unable to reach the sites of recent strikes due to Israeli forces\u2019 ever-tightening siege and attacks on their crews. In Lebanon, the health ministry said that at least 21 people were killed today in Israeli strikes on three areas in the south of the country bordering Israel. Nine people were killed and 38 wounded in a strike on Haret Saida, near the port city of Sidon, the ministry said, with at least seven others, including a nurse and three rescuers, killed in the southern village of Ain Baal and five in Burj al-Shemali. Two more Palestinian journalists have been killed, Al Jazeera English has reported. The 24-hour news channel, based in Doha, the capital of Qatar, cited authorities in Gaza in saying that the latest deaths bring the total number of journalists reported killed to 182 in the war that Israel launched in Gaza after Hamas, which controls the Palestinian territory, led a surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October last year. The network said authorities have named the two journalists as Nadia Imad Al-Sayed and Abdul Rahman Samir al-Tanani. This reported toll comes in addition to the three journalists from the Hezbollah-affiliated TV stations Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar who were killed in southern Lebanon last Friday, in an Israeli airstrike on their press station in Hasbaya. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, UN secretary-general, continues to blast the Israeli stranglehold on northern Gaza and calls not only once again for an immediate ceasefire in Israel\u2019s war on Hamas but also \u201caccountability under international law.\u201d The UN cites Gaza\u2019s health ministry reporting that hundreds of people have been killed in recent weeks and more than 60,000 others were forced to flee, AFP reports. Guterres\u2019s spokesperson, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, has been issuing strong statements on behalf of the UN chief, earlier describing him as having said the harrowing levels of death and suffering are \u201cunbearable.\u201d Repeated efforts to deliver humanitarian supplies essential to survive - food, medicine and shelter - continue to be denied by the Israeli authorities, with few exceptions, putting countless lives in peril. In the name of humanity, the Secretary-General reiterates his calls for an immediate ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and accountability for crimes under international law,\u201d Dujarric said. The United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has expressed his shock at the appalling straits the remaining residents stuck in northern Gaza are in. The plight of Palestinian civilians trapped in North Gaza is unbearable,\u201d Guterres\u2019s spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric said today, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Israel, vowing to stop Hamas militants from regrouping in the north of the Palestinian territory, launched a major air and ground assault on 6 October this year. The UN spokesperson said that according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry, hundreds of people have been killed in recent weeks and more than 60,000 others were forced to flee. The Secretary-General is shocked by the harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction in the north, with civilians trapped under rubble, the sick and wounded going without life-saving health care, and families lacking food and shelter,\u201d Dujarric said. The situation in northern Gaza continues to be utterly dire for Palestinians, with residents describing death and famine as the Gazan authorities say about 100,000 people are still trapped there, besieged by the Israeli military. Israel, vowing to stop Hamas militants from regrouping in the north of the Palestinian territory, launched a major air and ground assault on 6 October this year, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports tonight. Gaza civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal slammed Israel\u2019s ongoing \u201csiege\u201d in Jabalia, Beit Hanun and Beit Lahia in northern Gaza. For 22 days, not a drop of water or bread has entered the northern Gaza Strip. The occupation forces kill anyone who tries to provide services to the residents of north Gaza,\u201d Bassal said in a statement. Beit Lahia resident Bilal al-Hajri, 25, said the siege was unleashing a \u201cfamine\u201d in the area. We are really dying under a tight siege and famine. None of us can leave our homes to even provide some food and drink ... anyone who leaves is targeted,\u201d he told AFP. An emergency United Nations Security Council meeting will take place on Monday at Iran\u2019s request, with Tehran calling for it to condemn the strikes by Israel early on Saturday which killed four Iranian soldiers. Switzerland, which holds the council\u2019s rotating presidency, said Russia, China and Algeria, the council\u2019s Arab representative, supported the request. The number of people reported injured when a truck rammed into a bus stop in Ramat Hasharon, north of Tel Aviv, in Israel earlier today has risen to \u201cabout 40\u201d, according to an agency citing Israeli police \u2013 and the authorities are saying they suspect it was deliberate. One person was killed and it was known earlier that dozens had been injured in the incident, which took place near a military base. Hamas and Islamic Jihad praised the suspected attack but did not claim it. The driver of the truck was a Palestinian citizen of Israel, police said, and was \u201cneutralised\u201d by passersby carrying firearms. Reuters has reported that Israeli police said about 40 people were injured to varying degrees, including some seriously, and were taken to nearby hospitals. All investigative directions are being examined with an emphasis on the suspicion that this is a terror attack. Initial investigations suggest that the truck driver, who was traveling near the Glilot base from north to south, veered off course and hit a bus and people waiting at the stop with the truck,\u201d police said. Israeli media reported that the attacker was an Israeli Arab from Qalansawe in central Israel. Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said today he had \u201creceived indications\u201d of an attack before Israel\u2019s strikes the day before. We had received indications since the evening about the possibility of an attack that night,\u201d Araghchi told reporters on Sunday, without specifying the nature of the indications, Agence France-Presse reports. British foreign secretary David Lammy spoke to Araghchi by phone earlier today, and made a separate phone call to his Israeli counterpart, warning that a wider war in the Middle East would be a catastrophe. Ehud Olmert is not an uncontroversial figure in Israel and internationally. He was convicted of corruption in 2014 and in 2016 became the first Israeli premier to be imprisoned, capping a years-long legal saga that forced him to resign in 2009 during an intense round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, then released early, in 2017. His appearance in London at a conference this weekend did not go down well with some. Here\u2019s Shane Darcey on X, a senior lecturer at the Irish Centre for Human Rights in the National University of Ireland Galway. Here is the 2009 article from the Guardian that he cites in the post. Ehud Olmert, prime minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009, and Nasser al-Kidwa, foreign affairs minister of the Palestinian National Authority from 2005 to 2006, who had not worked together previously, are promoting a two-state plan for peace. They wrote a joint article for the Washington Post earlier this month in which they said: \u201cThis peace must be based on the existence of the states of Israel and Palestine, living side by side on the basis of the June 4, 1967, borders.\u201d That\u2019s when Israel expanded massively after the Six Day War. Their plan includes land swaps. The piece begins: \u201cThe war in Gaza must end. The Israeli hostages held by Hamas must be returned to their families. And Israel will have to release the agreed number of Palestinian prisoners. Israel must also withdraw from Gaza. And the Palestinians must create a new, responsible and legitimate ruling entity in Gaza that is not composed of politicians from any of the Palestinian factions \u2026 organically linked to the Palestinian Authority but independent enough to gain the acceptance of the Palestinian people, the Arab neighbors and the international community.\u201d And they want the Old City of Jerusalem \u2013 the centre of the religious sites \u201cto be administered by a trusteeship of five states, including Israel and Palestine\u201d. Another view: Ehud Olmert, the former Israeli prime minister, said the Israeli opposition parties needed to show the guts to speak out in favour of a two-state solution since they know it is the only alternative to more blood and killing. He was speaking at a London conference organised by the Israel liberal newspaper Haaretz alongside Dr Nasser al-Kidwa, a former Palestinian foreign minister and nephew of Yasser Arafat. The two men have published a peace plan for the Palestinian conflict and it was the first time Kidwa had spoken at an Israeli-organised event. Olmert, who dodged questions about whether he was returning to frontline politics, said of the two-state solution \u201cno-one is prepared to say this publicly, openly because they do not have the guts to speak out. They know there is no other solution. Presently they are afraid to spell it out when soldiers are being killed on a daily basis\u201d. He said his job \u201cwas to say not what was popular, but what was true\u201d. Their joint proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, a full withdrawal of troops from Gaza and a release of all hostages held by Hamas. Also, Palestinian elections within 36 months, a temporary Arab security presence that would work with Palestinian forces to ensure stability. And they endorsed the \u201cterritorial solution\u201d land swaps of 4.4% of the disputed territory and the division of Jerusalem. Olmert said a ceasefire should have been implemented eight or nine months ago since no further military purpose is being served by continuing the fighting. He also questioned why world leaders gave Israel carte blanche to defend itself knowing the fighting would go on in some of the most densely populated land in the world, and the only possible ramifications would be mass killings. The joint opinion piece that Olmert and al-Kidwa wrote for the Washington Post is here. The conference where Ehud Olmert was speaking earlier also heard calls from Democratic party Knesset member Naama Lazimi for the UK to go further in clamping down on illegal settlements by Israel. Asked about the increasingly lively discussions inside the British government concerning imposing sanctions on Israeli ministers Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli legislator described them as violent settlers, and although she insisted on Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, she said she supported individual sanctions since the settlers were harming Israel. UK foreign secretary David Lammy said he had spoken to his Israeli and Iranian counterparts in separate calls on Sunday, seeking from talks with both a strategy to avoid escalation into a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d regional war after Israel struck Iranian military sites early on Saturday. Today I held important calls with Israeli FM (Israel Katz) and Iranian FM (Abbas Araghchi). The UK continues to press for de-escalation and an end to the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza. A regional war would be catastrophic and is in no one\u2019s interests,\u201d Lammy said in a statement, and Reuters reports. He also posted the same message on X, tagging his counterparts. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, has spoken with the foreign ministers of Israel and Iran today. He warned the tension and airstrikes between the two countries could escalate into a wider regional war. Lammy said a regional war in the Middle East would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and \u201cin no one\u2019s interests,\u201d Reuters reports. We\u2019ll bring you more on this very soon. The Israeli attack on Iran on Saturday damaged facilities at a secretive military base southeast of the Iranian capital that experts in the past have linked to Tehran\u2019s one-time nuclear weapons program and at another base tied to its ballistic missile program. Satellite photos are coming through that have been analysed earlier today by The Associated Press. Some of the buildings damaged sat in Iran\u2019s Parchin military base, the agency writes, where the International Atomic Energy Agency suspects Iran in the past conducted tests of high explosives that could trigger a nuclear weapon. Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an active weapons program up until 2003. The other damage could be seen at the nearby Khojir military base, which analysts believe hides an underground tunnel system and missile production sites. Iran\u2019s military has not acknowledged damage at either Khojir or Parchin from Israel\u2019s attack early Saturday, though it has said the assault killed four Iranian soldiers working in the country\u2019s air defense systems. Iran announced Sunday a civilian also had been killed, but provided no details. Here\u2019s another image. Iran is not looking for war but will give an \u201cappropriate response\u201d to Israel\u2019s recent attack, the country\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has just said, according to state media. We do not seek war but we will defend the rights of our nation and country. We will give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime,\u201d he told a meeting of the Iranian cabinet, Reuters reports. How the Islamic Republic chooses to respond to the unusually public Israeli aerial assault on its homeland could determine whether the region spirals further toward all-out war or holds steady at an already devastating and destabilising level of violence, the Associated Press says in an analysis. A strike of the magnitude that Israel delivered early on Saturday would typically be met with a forceful response. A likely option would be another round of the ballistic missile barrages that Iran has already launched twice this year. But a carefully worded statement from Iran\u2019s military on Saturday night appeared to offer some wriggle room for the Islamic Republic to back away from further escalation. It suggested that a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon was more important than any retaliation against Israel. Efforts are gradually resuming in Qatar to defuse the devastating war between Israel and Hamas that erupted just over a year ago. Intelligence chiefs from Israel and its chief ally, the United States, are participating, with the directors of the Mossad and the CIA taking part, Reuters reports. And Egypt is proposing a brisk, short ceasefire, leading to a full cessation. There was no immediate comment from Israel or Hamas to the Egyptian president\u2019s suggestion, but a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort told Reuters: I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza.\u201d An official briefed on the talks told Reuters earlier today that negotiations in Doha, the capital of Qatar, will seek a short-term ceasefire and the release of some hostages being held by Hamas in exchange for Israel\u2019s release of Palestinian prisoners. The objective, still elusive after multiple mediation attempts, is to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a halt in fighting for less than a month in the hope this would lead to a more permanent ceasefire. Here\u2019s a little more on the ceasefire proposal just mentioned by Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Speaking alongside the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, during a press conference in Cairo, Sisi also said that talks should resume within 10 days of implementing the temporary ceasefire in efforts to reach a permanent one. The leader of Egypt has suggested a very short ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to allow an exchange of people from each side and a path to talks for a permanent cessation. Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said moments ago that his government has proposed a two-day ceasefire in Gaza, Reuters reports. The immediate purpose would be to exchange four Israeli hostages \u2013 out of the 100+ still believed held since Hamas\u2019s attack on southern Israel last October and capture of hostages - with some Palestinian prisoners incarcerated in Israel. Egypt and Qatar have acted as mediators between Israel and Hamas in months of talks that broke down in August without an agreement to end fighting. A Hamas delegation, headed by chief negotiator and deputy Hamas Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya, reportedly arrived in Cairo, the Egyptian capital, last Thursday to meet with the head of the state\u2019s general intelligence agency, Hassan Mahmoud Rashad. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu said at that time that he welcomed Egypt\u2019s willingness to advance a deal. Here\u2019s Sisi last week at a meeting for the developing nations bloc known as BRICS. Israel dramatically escalated its airstrikes on Lebanon late last month before launching a ground offensive in the south of the country, killing many civilians and sparking a refugee and humanitarian crisis. Here are some of the latest images coming out of Lebanon from the newswires: One person was killed and dozens of people were reported to have been injured after a truck hit a bus stop in Glilot, central Israel, near Tel Aviv. Many of those injured were reportedly elderly citizens who had disembarked from a bus ahead of a visit to a nearby IDF base. The driver of the truck was shot dead by a civilian at the scene. Israeli military strikes killed at least 45 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, most of them in the north of the enclave, Palestinian health officials said. At least 20 people were killed following an Israeli airstrike on houses in Jabalia, while an airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinian families in Shati camp in Gaza City killed nine people, medics said. Three local journalists were among those killed at the school in Shati. An Israeli airstrike on Sidon, a city in coastal south Lebanon, killed at least eight people and wounded 25 on Sunday, the country\u2019s health ministry said. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public comments since Israeli warplanes attacked military targets in Iran early on Saturday. He said the attack \u201cshould neither be downplayed nor exaggerated\u201d, without directly calling for a retaliation. He added that military officials would discuss Iran\u2019s next steps, suggesting any retaliation may not be imminent. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel\u2019s air attack on Iran was \u201cprecise and powerful\u201d and achieved all its goals. The directors of the CIA and Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence service will meet Qatar\u2019s prime minister in Doha later today to begin negotiations for a new short term Gaza ceasefire deal, an official told Reuters. The Israeli military urged residents of 14 villages in southern Lebanon, where it says Hezbollah fighters are, to evacuate immediately and move north of the Awali river or risk being killed. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said Hezbollah and Hamas are no longer effective proxies for Iran. He also said \u201cpainful concessions\u201d are needed to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza, without specifying what these would be. Israeli forces have detained at least 12 Palestinians from the occupied West Bank over the last day, according to a joint statement by the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners Society. The detentions were reported by Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, as having occurred across various areas, including Hebron, Ramallah, and Jenin. It is estimated that over 11,400 Palestinians have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since last October. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the West Bank. They have described alleged abusive and humiliating treatment, including holding blindfolded and handcuffed detainees in cramped cages as well as beatings, intimidation and harassment. Israel\u2019s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, has responded to Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, calling on the UN security council to meet over Israel\u2019s air attack on Iran, which Araqchi described as \u201ca grave threat to international peace and security\u201d. Danon said that Iran was \u201ctrying to act against us in the diplomatic arena with the ridiculous claim that Israel has violated international law\u201d. \u201cAs we have stated time and time again, we have the right and duty to defend ourselves and will use all the means at our disposal to protect the citizens of Israel,\u201d he said. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres appealed \u201cto all parties to cease all military actions, including in Gaza and Lebanon, exert maximum efforts to prevent an all-out regional war and return to the path of diplomacy,\u201d his spokesperson said yesterday. As we have mentioned in a previous post, Iran has called for an urgent UN security council meeting to condemn Israel\u2019s airstrikes on the country yesterday. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, sent a letter to the UN chief and the head of the council \u201cdemanding an urgent meeting of the security council to take a decisive position in condemning this aggression\u201d, a ministry statement said. He said \u201cmost of the projectiles fired were intercepted by Iran\u2019s defence systems\u201d but the attack led to damage at \u201cthe target points\u201d, as well as the death of four soldiers. Araghchi said the Israeli attack was a \u201cclear violation of the sovereignty\u201d of Iran which \u201creserves the inherent right... to respond to this criminal aggression\u201d. The Israeli military said it hit Iranian missile factories, missile installations and other systems in several regions, and warned Tehran against responding. Iran has downplayed the attack, saying it caused \u201climited damage\u201d to a few radar systems, signalling what observers say is Tehran\u2019s reluctance to escalate further. Medics and police have said that at least person was killed after a man rammed his truck into a crowd at a bus stop in central Israel\u2019s Glilot, just north of Tel Aviv, on Sunday (see post at 10:00 for more details). The bus stop was at a major intersection near the Glilot military base and the headquarters of Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency. At least 29 people were injured, including several in serious condition, emergency service providers Magen David Adom said. Many of the injured were pensioners on a day trip to a nearby museum, according to reports. One of those injured died later of his injuries, said the hospital where he was taken for treatment. Police did not say whether it was an attack, but added that civilians at the scene \u201cshot the truck driver and neutralised him\u201d. In a statement, Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, said the ramming attack carried out near \u201cMossad headquarters \u2026 was in response to the crimes committed by the Zionist occupation\u201d against Palestinians. Details have emerged suggesting Israel used precision air and drone strikes in its unprecedented attack on Iran this weekend to target air defence systems protecting crucial oil and gas facilities, as well as military sites linked to Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme and ballistic missile production. Israel openly attacked Iran for the first time on Saturday in the latest direct confrontation between the regional enemies, bringing the Middle East another step closer to a full-scale conflagration. In the immediate aftermath, Iran appeared to downplay the airstrikes, which killed four soldiers. Fearing all-out war and shocks to the global oil industry, western leaders had urged Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, not to target oil or nuclear facilities in the widely anticipated response to an Iranian ballistic missile salvo on Tel Aviv and military bases on 1 October. Iranian officials had repeatedly warned attacks on nuclear or energy infrastructure would cross a \u201cred line\u201d. Satellite imagery of affected sites in Iran and details reported by the New York Times suggest the Israeli leader heeded allies\u2019 advice, but the locations of the strikes nonetheless signalled that Israel is capable of hitting high-value targets if the escalation continues. You can read the full story by my colleague Bethan McKernan here: Israeli military airstrikes have killed at least 45 Palestinian people across the Gaza Strip today, most of them in the north of the territory, Palestinian health officials said. At least 20 people were killed following an airstrike on houses in Jabalia, the largest of the Gaza Strip\u2019s eight historic refugee camps. An Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinian families in Shati camp in Gaza City killed nine people and injured 20 others, with many in critical condition, medics said. Three local journalists were reportedly among those killed at the school in Shati: Saed Radwan, head of digital media at Al-Aqsa television, Hanin Baroud and Hamza Abu Selmeya. Their deaths bring the total number of journalists killed in Gaza since last October to 180, according to Al Jazeera. Israeli forces began the devastating offensive in the north about three weeks ago with the declared aim of preventing Hamas fighters from regrouping. Residents, however, say the troops have besieged shelters, levelled civilian infrastructure, forced displaced people to leave with nowhere safe to go, while killing many civilians in deadly airstrikes. Medics say at least 800 Palestinians have been killed in northern Gaza since the renewed offensive was launched by the Israeli military early this month. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reported earlier today that about 1,000 Palestinian people had been killed by the Israeli military. We have some more details on Benjamin Netanyahu being heckled by bereaved families at a ceremony in Jerusalem put on in memory of the victims of the Hamas-led October 7 attacks last year, in which about 1,200 people were killed (see post at 12.58 for more details). The Israeli prime minister stood motionless at a lectern as audience members in the crowd shouted, interrupting him for more than a minute, according to a live broadcast of the speech. People were heard saying \u201cShame on you!\u201d One of the protesters repeatedly shouted: \u201cMy father was killed\u201d. Patrick Wintour is the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor Israel\u2019s reputation as a democracy will be \u201cdeeply harmed\u201d if the Israeli Knesset presses ahead with bills this week that would end all Israeli government cooperation with the Palestinian relief agency, Unrwa, Hamish Falconer, the Middle East minister, warned on Sunday. He said such a move at a time when the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is catastrophic and worsening would \u201cneither be in Israel\u2019s interest or realistic\u201d. His remarks are the strongest criticism made by a western minister of the legislation that could be voted on as early as this week unless the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu intervenes. Falconer also demanded more aid be allowed to enter Gaza and told Israel too many civilians are being killed in Israeli attacks on Hamas in Gaza. He was speaking to a conference in London convened by Haaretz newspaper and attended predominantly by more liberal minded Jews. Falconer insisted the measures taken by the Labour government so far did not indicate any decline in Labour support for the state of Israel, but his remarks were as sharp as any delivered by a Labour minister. He said: We are deeply concerned by legislation currently under consideration by the Israeli Knesset which would critically undermine Unrwa. It is neither in Israel\u2019s interest nor realistic. Given the agency\u2019s vital role in delivering aid and essential services at a time when more more aid should be getting into Gaza, it is deeply harmful to Israel\u2019s international reputation as democratic country that its lawmakers are taking steps that would make the delivering of food water medicines and healthcare more difficult. He said: \u201cThe international community are clear that Unrwa and other humanitarian organisations must be fully able to deliver aid.\u201d Many Israelis regard Unrwa too closely linked with Hamas, and also committed to the Palestinian refugees right of return. He said humanitarian access remains wholly inadequate, adding he had recently been on the Egyptian Gaza border. He said: I saw for myself thousands of trucks waiting to cross the border. Some had been there for months. There were warehouses full of life saving items - medical equipment sleeping bags, and tarpaulin for the winter. There have been repeated attacks on humanitarian convoys and the level of aid getting in is far too low. In an earlier post, we reported on a deadly Israeli airstrike that officials said killed at least two people near the southern Lebanese city of Sidon. Giving an updated death toll, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said at least eight people were killed and 25 others injured in the attack that hit a densely-populated area in a Sidon suburb that saw an influx of families displaced from areas further south. \u201cThe Israeli enemy\u2019s raid on Haret Saida resulted in a... toll of eight killed,\u201d the health ministry said. Lebanon\u2019s state run national news agency said a child was among the victims. Protesters disrupted a speech by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a ceremony on Sunday remembering the victims of Hamas\u2019 attack on southern Israel last year, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. People shouted \u201cshame on you\u201d and made a commotion, forcing Netanyahu to stop his speech shortly after it began. The major commemorative event is being broadcast live around the country. Many Israeli people blame Netanyahu for the failures that led to Hamas\u2019 7 October 2023 attack and hold him responsible for not yet bringing home the remaining hostages held by the militant group in Gaza. Iran reserves the right to respond to Israel\u2019s \u201ccriminal aggression\u201d, foreign minister Abbas Araqchi told the UN secretary-general in a letter calling for an urgent security council meeting, Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said on Sunday. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said at least two people were killed and 11 others injured on Sunday in an Israeli strike near the southern city of Sidon, where an Agence France-Presse (AFP) correspondent said a building was targeted. \u201cThe Israeli enemy\u2019s raid on Haret Saida resulted in an initial toll of two killed,\u201d the health ministry said, as an AFP correspondent said an apartment was destroyed in the strike on a building in the area that was targeted for the first time since Israel launched its assault on Lebanon last month. Hezbollah said it fired rockets at a military base in northern Israel on Sunday, a day after it declared several areas in the region a \u201clegitimate target\u201d due to the presence of Israeli troops. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group said it targeted a \u201cmilitary industries base north of Haifa (a northern city in Israel)... with a large rocket salvo\u201d, after it issued an evacuation warning on Saturday for large swathes of northern Israel. Dozens of people are reported to be injured after a truck hit a bus stop in Glilot, central Israel, near Tel Aviv. Many of those injured, according to local reports, were elderly citizens who had disembarked from a bus ahead of a visit to a nearby IDF base. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public comments since Israeli warplanes attacked military targets in Iran early on Saturday. He said the attack \u201cshould neither be downplayed nor exaggerated\u201d, without directly calling for a retaliation. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel\u2019s air attack on Iran was \u201cprecise and powerful\u201d and achieved all its goals. The directors of the CIA and Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence service will meet Qatar\u2019s prime minister in Doha later today to begin negotiations for a new short term Gaza ceasefire deal, an official told Reuters. The Israeli military urged residents of 14 villages in southern Lebanon, where it says Hezbollah fighters are, to evacuate immediately and move north of the Awali river or risk being killed. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said Hezbollah and Hamas are no longer effective proxies for Iran. He also said \u201cpainful concessions\u201d are needed to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza, without specifying what these would be. The directors of the CIA and Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence service will meet Qatar\u2019s prime minister in Doha today to begin negotiations for a new short term Gaza ceasefire deal and the release of some hostages by Hamas in exchange for Israel\u2019s release of Palestinian prisoners, an official has told Reuters. The official said the talks aim to get the two sides to agree to a ceasefire that would last less than a month but that will hopefully lead to a more permanent agreement afterwards. Israel and Hamas accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands over the summer and negotiations ground to a halt in August. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously been accused of blocking a ceasefire deal over his insistence on continued Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor, which separates Gaza from Egypt, and central Gaza\u2019s Netzarim corridor, a strategic route bisecting Gaza. Hamas has demanded a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Egypt has said that a heavy Israeli military presence on its border threatens the peace treaty between the countries. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has been speaking at a memorial ceremony in Jerusalem. \u201cNot all objectives can be achieved through military operations alone\u2026 to realise our moral duty to bring our hostages home, we will have to make painful concessions,\u201d he said in a speech. It is reported that 97 of the 251 hostages abducted by Hamas in the 7 October attacks last year remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 34 confirmed dead by the IDF. Gallant was also quoted as having said that Iran is no longer able to effectively use its ally Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group it backs, against Israel. \u201cOver the past year, the security establishment led by the Israel Defense Forces turned the tide of the war and had unprecedented achievements in all arenas of fighting,\u201d Gallant said. Gallant said Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, was no longer functioning as a military network in Gaza, while Hezbollah\u2019s senior command and most of its missile capabilities had been wiped out. He said both groups \u201care no longer an effective tool\u201d to be used by Iran. In other developments, Gallant briefed his American counterpart Lloyd Austin on the \u201csuccess\u201d of Israel\u2019s airstrikes on Iran and discussed \u201cstrategic opportunities\u201d that may have arisen, his office said in a statement. Gallant\u2019s office said: Gallant discussed initial assessments regarding the success of the strikes against missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air missile arrays and Iranian aerial capabilities. Minister Gallant also discussed the strategic opportunities that have risen as a result of operational achievements, in both the northern and southern arenas (referring to fighting in Lebanon and Gaza). Here is a video of the aftermath of a truck hitting a bus stop in Glilot, just north of Tel Aviv, which caused dozens of injuries, as we reported on in an earlier post: The Israeli military has urged residents of 14 villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately and move north of the Awali river, which flows from the western Bekaa valley into the Mediterranean. In a post on X, Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee claimed that Hezbollah elements, facilities or weapons are nearby, and those who stay risk being killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly issued evacuation orders during its assault on Lebanon over the last month. \u201cFor your own safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately and move to the north of the Awali River. To ensure your own safety, you must evacuate without delay,\u201d Adraee wrote in the post on X. \u201cYou are prohibited from going south. Any movement south could be dangerous to your life. We will inform you in due time to return to your homes as soon as the conditions are right.\u201d Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has commented on Israel\u2019s airstrikes on Iran, which the IDF said targeted missile factories and other sites near Tehran and western Iran on Saturday morning. In a speech, Netanyahu said: The air force attacked throughout Iran. We hit hard Iran\u2019s defence capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed at us. The attack in Iran was precise and powerful, and it achieved all its objectives. The Israeli airstrikes on Iran killed four Iranian soldiers, Iran\u2019s army said. As my colleague Patrick Wintour writes in this story, a debate has been set off inside Iran on whether the attack, more limited than some had predicted, warrants a military response and if the country will be seen as weak if it does nothing. Israel\u2019s airstrikes were in retaliation for the 1 October attack by Iran, which fired about 200 missiles at Israel, though most were intercepted by the country\u2019s air defences. \u201cIran attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles and this attack failed,\u201d Netanyahu added. At least three people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on Zawtar al-Sharkiya in southern Lebanon, the country\u2019s health ministry said. The ministry added that five people were killed an one injured after an Israeli airstrike targeted Marjayoun, also in southern Lebanon, on Saturday. Israel\u2019s medical service, Magen David Adom (MDA), says emergency workers \u201cevacuated\u201d about 20 \u201ccasualties\u201d, including six severely injured, following the truck-ramming at a bus stop in central Israel\u2019s Glilot, just north of Tel Aviv (see post at 08.39 for more details). Many of those injured, according to local reports, were elderly citizens who had disembarked from a bus ahead of a visit to a nearby IDF base in Glilot. Police said the truck driver rammed his vehicle into a crowd of people at a bus stop, injuring at least 24 people before he was \u201cshot and neutralised\u201d. The police did not say whether it was a terror attack or not. It did confirm that civilians at the site of the incident \u201cshot the truck driver and neutralised him\u201d. Of those injured, at least 16 people had been transported to nearby hospitals, MDA said in a statement. Tel Aviv\u2019s Ichilov hospital said one of the victims is in very serious condition. \u201cHis life is in danger and he is currently being treated in an operating room,\u201d the hospital said. Palestinian medics said an Israeli airstrike on a house in Jabalia, the largest of the Gaza Strip\u2019s eight historic refugee camps, killed several people and injured others this morning. Medics said the airstrike damaged several houses in Jabalia, the epicentre of a renewed Israeli assault on the northern part of the Strip in recent weeks, which the Israeli military claims was launched to stop Hamas fighters regrouping there. But the blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure have led to accusations that Israel is committing the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. Local health authorities told Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, that 1,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli assault on northern Gaza was launched early this month. The Israeli military said in a statement it \u201celiminated over 40 terrorists\u201d in the Jabalia area in the past 24 hours, as well as dismantling infrastructure and locating \u201clarge quantities of military equipment\u201d. The entirety of northern Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders. The Israeli army has ordered residents to flee towards the so-called \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d of al-Mawasi, even though it has been targeted in deadly airstrikes and is severely overcrowded. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed in fighting in southern Lebanon, the Israeli military said on Sunday, bringing to 36 the total number of Israeli soldiers killed since the start of the ground offensive in Lebanon on 30 September. The troops all served with the Alon Brigade\u2019s 8207th battalion. World leaders have called for restraint after the first open Israeli airstrikes on Iran were launched in the early hours of Saturday. The Israeli airforce struck about 20 military bases across Iran, including missile and drone manufacturing sites and air defence systems. Here is what we know about the attack (you can read the full story here): Israel struck military sites in Iran early on Saturday, saying it was in response to \u201cmonths of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel\u201d. The strikes were widely expected after Tehran\u2019s attacks on Israel this month. The Israeli public broadcaster Kan said dozens of fighter jets were involved. The attack killed four Iranian soldiers, Iran\u2019s army said. The Israeli military said on Saturday morning it hit missile manufacturing sites and aerial defences in several areas and had completed its \u201ctargeted\u201d air attacks, and that its planes had safely returned home. Israel\u2019s public broadcaster said three waves of strikes had been completed. The UK and US have warned against further escalation, while nations including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan have all condemned the attacks. Israel bears \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the escalation of conflict in the Middle East, the Pakistan foreign ministry has said, adding that the Israeli strikes \u201cundermine the path to regional peace and stability\u201d. Iran is \u201centitled and obligated to defend itself against external aggressive acts\u201d, its foreign ministry has said. The ministry called the Israeli attack a violation of international law and said Tehran \u201crecognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security\u201d. Iran said its air defence system successfully countered Israel\u2019s attacks on military targets in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam, with \u201climited damage\u201d to some locations. A semi-official Iranian news agency vowed a \u201cproportional reaction\u201d to Israeli moves against Tehran. In a post on X following the truck-ramming incident at the Glilot junction, near Tel Aviv, Magen David Adom said 10 injured people were being taken to Beilinson and Ichilov hospitals. Four people are seriously injured, two are in a \u201cmoderate condition\u201d and four are in a \u201cmild condition\u201d, the ambulance service said. Israel\u2019s medical service Magen David Adom has reported dozens of injuries after a suspected attack on a bus station in Glilot, central Israel, near Tel Aviv. Police say that officers are heading to the scene after a truck rammed into members of the public waiting at a bus stop, according to reports. The exact circumstances around the incident \u2013 which is under investigation - remain unclear. We will bring you the latest as we get it. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made his first public comments since the Israeli airstrikes on his country. He said that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran this weekend \u201cshould not be exaggerated nor downplayed,\u201d though he stopped short of calling for retaliation. Here is some of what he said in a meeting with the families of the four members of the armed forces who were killed in the attack: \u201cThe evil committed by the Zionist regime (Israel) two nights ago should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated\u201d, IRNA cited Khamenei as saying. He described the Israeli airstrikes as \u201cmalignant\u201d. \u201cThe calculation error of the Zionist regime must be disrupted. They do not know Iran, its youth, its nation. They have not yet been able to fully comprehend the power, capabilities, initiative and will of the Iranian nation, we must make them understand it,\u201d Al Jazeera quoted the Iranian supreme leader \u2013 the ultimate authority in Iran \u2013 as saying. \u201cIt would be wrong for us to say that it was nothing and it did not matter,\u201d Khamenei said, adding that Israel has tried to exaggerate the impact of the airstrikes. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Israel\u2019s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is expected to speak on Sunday about the airstrikes by Israel that saw waves of IDF fighter jets and drones attack military sites across the country, the New York Times reports. Saturday\u2019s attack focused on air defence, radar sites, and long-range missile production facilities and marked the first time Israel has openly attacked Iran after decades of shadow warfare. Four soldiers were killed, Iranian media said. At least 40 Palestinian people were killed and 80 others injured in Israeli airstrikes on several houses in northern Gaza\u2019s Beit Lahiya on Saturday, Palestinian news agency Wafa said on Sunday, citing medical sources. The attack targeted a block of at least five homes near the western roundabout in Beit Lahiya, according to Wafa journalists. Officials say it means that about 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed assault on northern Gaza launched by the Israeli military at the start of October. Here is a summary of the latest developments: \u201cI hope this is the end,\u201d the US President Joe Biden told reporters on Saturday after the Israeli airstrikes on Iran. Biden said Israel gave him a heads up and it appeared \u201cthey didn\u2019t hit anything but military targets\u201d in their attacks. Israel\u2019s president, Issac Herzog, hailed the US \u2013 Israel\u2019s biggest arm supplier \u2013 as his country\u2019s \u201ctrue ally\u201d after the airstrikes. The office of Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, denied a report that Israel initially planned to strike Iran\u2019s oil and natural gas facilities, but changed its plan to focus on Iranian military targets after pressure from the US. Four soldiers were killed in the Israeli airstrikes on Iran, Iranian media said. Iran said the airstrikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, causing \u201climited damage\u201d. Iran\u2019s mission to the UN said Israeli warplanes attacked several Iranian military and radar sites from Iraqi airspace, and blamed the US for what it called its \u201ccomplicity\u201d. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, described the Israeli attack as \u201creckless and cowardly\u201d, adding that his country was determined to defend itself. The Israeli strikes reportedly hit Iranian facilities used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles. Satellite images obtained by Reuters appear to confirm that the Israeli attacks hit buildings that Iran used for mixing solid fuel for ballistic missiles. Israel struck Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran, as well as Khojir, a sprawling missile production site near the Iranian capital, the news agency reported, citing two US researchers. Israel hit 12 \u201cplanetary mixers\u201d used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, which make up the bulk of Iran\u2019s missile arsenal, Israeli sources told Axios. The UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog (IAEA) said Iran\u2019s nuclear programme was not affected by Saturday\u2019s strikes. Iran\u2019s military suggested it would prioritise an agreement to end Israel\u2019s wars in Gaza and Lebanon over any retaliation against Israel. The carefully worded statement released on Saturday night suggests at least parts of Iran\u2019s government want to avoid further escalation. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said it had a right to self-defence after Saturday\u2019s attack. The statement said Iranian radar sites were damaged but some were already under repair, and added that Israel used so-called \u201cstandoff\u201d missiles over Iraqi airspace to launch it attacks. They had lighter warheads to travel to targets inside Iran. The strikes were restrained enough for Iranian officials to belittle the scale and effectiveness of the incursion and for Israeli hardliners to denounce their government for timidity. Israel\u2019s military could have \u201cexacted a higher price\u201d, opposition leader Yair Lapid said in a post on X after the bombing ended. National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said Saturday\u2019s attack was \u201can opening blow\u201d and strikes on the country\u2019s strategic assets \u201cmust be the next step\u201d. Israel\u2019s military announced it was easing some safety restrictions for residents in areas of northern Israel on Saturday, a possible indication that it does not expect any immediate large-scale attack from Iran or its proxies in the region. The decision followed a \u201csituational assessment\u201d, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Saturday. Israeli troops withdrew from the Kamal Adwan hospital in Jabalia on Saturday, after storming the medical facility and detaining dozens of its staff. Israeli forces seized 44 of the 70-strong team at the hospital, only 14 have since been released. Almost all male staff at the hospital had been taken away by Israeli forces, the head of the World Health Organsation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, describing the situation in the area as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. Among those missing is Dr Mohammed Obeid, an orthopedic surgeon working for Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about his safety. The UN\u2019s acting humanitarian chief, Joyce Msuya, called for an urgent halt to the devastating Israeli assault on north Gaza, attacks on health facilities and mass detentions there. \u201cThe entire population of northern Gaza is at risk of dying,\u201d she said. Israeli media reported that a drone attack \u2013 targeting a factory producing aviation components - in Karmiel in the north of the country has injured two people. The Israeli military said the drone was launched from Lebanese territory. The UN security council is expected to convene on Monday at the request of Iran to discuss the recent Israel airstrikes.",

Feathers flipping through the drop-down options of Norbot\u2019s personality: \u201cGrumpy \u2026 boorish \u2026 bit selfish.\u201d Magnificent bagpipes. A top nun gag. Surprisingly scabrous satire about police incompetence.</p> <p>Sophisticated tech-scepticism is now a staple of children\u2019s animation and Wallace and Gromit earn points for getting in early. Yet the high bar they set 35 years ago has been raised to dizzying levels by the likes of WALL-E and The Mitchells vs the Machines, so some of what transpires here when humans blithely let the machines take the strain here can feel creaky.

There is comfort and joy in the routine and delight in the details. Not just the thumb-smudges and dusty crockery (Wallace has become so reliant on smart tech that he keeps pressing the teapot lid, befuddled, in hope of a cuppa), but the more startling flights of fancy. Norbot gargling orgasmically as his battery is recharged. Feathers flipping through the drop-down options of Norbot\u2019s personality: \u201cGrumpy \u2026 boorish \u2026 bit selfish.\u201d Magnificent bagpipes. A top nun gag. Surprisingly scabrous satire about police incompetence. Sophisticated tech-scepticism is now a staple of children\u2019s animation and Wallace and Gromit earn points for getting in early. Yet the high bar they set 35 years ago has been raised to dizzying levels by the likes of WALL-E and The Mitchells vs the Machines, so some of what transpires here when humans blithely let the machines take the strain here can feel creaky. The never-never-land of post war West Wallaby Street is gloriously vintage; it can also feel plain old dated. Fowl isn\u2019t top-tier Aardman. There\u2019s just too much talk, and though Ben Whitehead does pitch-perfect Peter Sallis, you can grow weary of the codswallopping verbosity. It feels telling that the most compelling character is the one who remains mute and unreadable. What lingers after are the black eyes of Feathers, not Wallace\u2019s by-gum puns. Just as the finest Aardman film is entirely silent (Shaun the Sheep the Movie, an absolute masterpiece), so too Wallace and Gromit say it best when they say nothing at all. \u2022 Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl premieres at the AFI festival, Los Angeles, on 29 October, screens in the UK on BBC iPlayer and BBC One this Christmas and is on Netflix worldwide, outside the UK, on 3 January \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024. An earlier version misspelled Reece Shearsmith\u2019s first name.",

Carlos Sainz: \u201cIt was incredible. I really wanted this one. I wanted one more win before leaving Ferrari. I was just a bit annoyed at the start and Max is super difficult to pass and I knew I could make it.\u201d Lando Norris: \u201cIt was a very tough race. It was trying to stay in the race and avoid crashes. Congratulations to Carlos and Ferrari. I knew what to expect, I didn\u2019t want to expect as I respect Max, but not very clean driving in my opinion. I just keep my head down. That\u2019s all I can do for now.\u201d Charles Leclerc: \u201cIt was a difficult one, we did the best race. All weekend we have been on the back foot. Amazing race by Carlos today. We are working super well as a team. The constructors is our target and we are getting closer to it.\u201d Carlos Sainz is delighted. Charles Leclerc takes the fastest lap and the extra point to go along with his third place. After losing the pole position, he was able to take advantage of the carnage between Norris and Verstappen, whose 20-second penalty will take the headlines. Sainz takes first for Ferrari, Norris second for McLaren, Leclerc third for Ferrari, Hamilton in fourth in the Merc, Russell in fifth, Verstappen in sixth. 70/71 Norris is flying along, far quicker. Leclerc is going to go for fastest lap; that\u2019s currently held by Liam Lawson. 69/71 The debris from Liam Lawson\u2019s prang may yet cause problems. 68/71 Sainz has 6.8 seconds on Norris, surely unassailable. 67/71 Lawson and Colapinto clash, and Lawson\u2019s got damage to his wing. Two faces of the future. Both willing to race. \u201cI had nowhere to go,\u201d says the Kiwi. 66/71 Down the main straight, and at last, Hamilton takes Russell and fourth place. 65/71 Russell and Hamilton\u2026at it. Russell continuing to drive well and holding off Hamilton. 64/71 Piastri\u2019s hopes of getting at Verstappen slowed by Kevin Magnussen, driving a cracker. 63/71 That was nerve-wracking for Norris, Leclerc\u2019s mistake almost took them both off the road. Now, can Norris chase Sainz? The gap is up at 7.5 or so, with the fastest lap in Norris\u2019 hand. 62/71 Piastri is told to chase down Verstappen. Meanwwhile, Norris chases down Leclerc to try and win second place.\u2026..and Leclerc spins off to the side, and Norris takes second. 61/71 Russell and Hamilton drone on and on. Norris sets the fastest lap. 60/71 Norris has Leclerc in his sights. Discipline needed from both. Sainz sitting pretty, and able to keep the race in his grasp. 59/71 The last 10-12 laps should see Norris chase down Leclerc. \u201cWe need your best driving now, let\u2019s go,\u201d says the McLaren garage. 58/71 The Hamilton/Russell chase continues. Norris is down to 1/5 seconds. Now, can he pass his rival, like he failed to do last week? 57/71 Norris is down to 2.4 seconds down on Leclerc. 56/71 Russell was supposed to be on the older, less effective car but is keeping Hamilton at bay. Piastri into seventh, having started at 17th. 55/71 The Merc garage look on nervously. Russell is doing a fine blocking job. 54/71 Hamilton can\u2019t find a route beyond Russell but this race for fourth is the only show in town. 53/71 Mercedes battle is 30 seconds behind the leaders, as Martin Brundle reminds. Much work to do there for next season for Toto Wolff and Big Sir Jim. 52/71 Colapinto, who is such a talent, has the fastest lap. 51/71 Hamilton not able to chase Russell, but can\u2019t get close enough. Verstappen is 12 seconds back and little threat. 50/71 Hamilton has DRS in chasing Russell. These two like a ding-dong, and next year will be rivals. 49/71 Ferrari\u2019s fliers will soon meet the backmarkers. That\u2019s good news for Norris. 48/71 George Russell is told he\u2019s free to race Hamilton. 47/71 Verstappen in sixth, has 11 seconds to make up on Hamilton, who is closing on Russell. McLaren need Mercedes to do a blocking job on Verstappen. 46/71 Lando Norris has the fastest lap, and that\u2019s a point teams will be competing for. He has four seconds to catch Leclerc on. 45/71 It does look dank among the skyscrapers of Mexico City. Sainz has set his fastest lap of the race. 44/71 Leclerc has edged the gap on Sainz down to six seconds. Perez\u2019s stinker continues with a second pit. 43/71 It\u2019s getting cloudy in Mexico City. The winner couldn\u2019t be more clear. Verstappen is complaining about his tyres. Piastri goes up to 11th on his tyres. 42/71 Piastri chasing down the pack, his team want him to chase Verstappen. 41/71 \u201cIt\u2019s getting really dark,\u201d says moaning Max. Seems the weather might not hit this race. Dry tyres to be feared if it blows this way. 40/71 Piastri and Lawson pit, so Verstappen is into sixth. He\u2019s seven seconds behind Hamilton. Lawson drops to the back to be reacquainted with dear old Checo, who is having another shocker. 39/71 McLaren are struggling to get close to the Ferraris, so the constructors championship could be affected. 38/71 Verstappen in seventh, beyond the slowing Lawson. 37/71 Sainz has seven seconds on Leclerc. This has been an armchair ride for the Ferrari. 36/71 Verstappen up to eighth, past Colapinto. Lawson and Piastri are up ahead. Hamilton is still on his fastest lap. 35/71 Lawson gets overtaken by both Piastri and Hamilton. \u201cIf memory serves, M\u00e9xico DF was once considered the most polluted city in the world, which might explain the atmosphere in which the race is being held,\u201d says David Hepp. No clear skies here, and at an altitude, too. 34/71 Russell says \u201csurely we could do two laps more to the Mercedes garage\u201d. Piastri is stuck between Lawson and Hamilton, who is on a fastest lap. 33/71 Sainz pits and comes out ahead of Leclerc. Lawson, who hasn\u2019t pitted, is in fourth and fully enjoying himself. 32/71 Sainz is set to pit\u2026 31/71 Norris pits, and comes out in fourth, with loads of open road ahead of him, and Russell in third, yet to pit. 30/71 Verstappen is in 13th, now 12th. All should be easy enough until he gets to Hamilton. 29/71 Can Norris chase down the Ferraris. No Verstappen to get past now. 28/71 Hard tyres are the order of the day, Lewis Hamilton has gone in for some, and comes out ahead of Verstappen. 27/71 And so the Verstappen count comes, 20 seconds held, and he\u2019s on the hard tyre, his car cooled down, and he comes out in 15th. 26/71 Verstappen is heading into the pits. 25/71 \u201cMy tyres are not holding on, guys,\u201d says an unhappy Verstappen, who has Lando Norris on his tail. 24/71 Sainz and Leclerc continue to have it all their way for the Ferrari. 23/71 \u201cThat\u2019s silly, man,\u201d says Verstappen. That was him speaking this time, think that was Perez before. Anyway, he was diplomatic. 22/71 Piastri is taking on Colapinto, in a battle for 12th and 13th. Two faces of the future. \u201cWow,\u201d says Russell on news of that Verstappen penalty. 21/71 Let\u2019s await the Verstappen verdict. He always takes these things well. \u201cAre you ****ing serious,\u201d he says. Looks like dear old Checo is set for a penalty, too, 20/71 That\u2019s for the second one, more obviously his fault. That\u2019s 20 seconds. It would take him to 10th. Lando, the floor is yours. 19/71 Fernando Alonso has retired, his first DNF of the season. Something got snarled up in his engine. Perez is being chased by Lance Stroll. 18/71 At the back, Perez, cheered by the locals, tries to take on Liam Lawson, and Perez goes off the track. Liam Lawson stays ahead. The locals not happy. 17/71 In the Haas, Magnussen continues to chase down Hamilton and Russell in fifth and sixth. 16/71 No team orders at Ferrari; they are free to race each other. 15/71 Russell and Hamilton going at it, with Kevin Magnussen giving chase. Hamilton holds on. Leclerc has the fastest lap. 14/71 We await the response of Verstappen. Mercedes battle now \u2013 Russell and Hamilton are taking each other on. \u201c10, that\u2019s quite impressive,\u201d says Max. \u201cThere was a lot of whingeing,\u201d says the Red Bull boss, Christian Horner. 13/71 Leclerc is chasing after Sainz as the chasers get tangled up. Norris has two checks against him for going off the track. 12/71 Looks like Verstappen is in trouble and may have to give up a penalty. There\u2019s two incidents reported there. 11/71 That incident: Lando was ahead, then Verstappen brakes later, and then as Lando slows down, Verstappen runs them both off. Leclerc took advantage. And the Ferraris are in full control. 10/71 Norris attacks Verstappen now, and goes clear, though off the track. They get all tangled up and Leclerc flies through. \u201cThis guy is dangerous,\u201d says Lando of Verstappen. 9/71 Sainz sets the fastest lap then at turn one gets past Verstappen, who fights hard to stop the Spaniard, but as the Ferrari has DRS he flies onwards. Max is not happy. He\u2019s blaming the car. 8/71 Verstappen has the fastest lap. He\u2019s trying his best to ward off the threat of Sainz. 7/71 Verstappen goes into turn one in the lead. Ferrari look quick, very quick. No DRS available in this lap. 6/71 Perez gets a five-second penalty. The safety car is ending. So we go to a standing start. Verstappen slows, and then off he goes, and tries to get away from Sainz and Norris. 5/71 More safety car action. Max Verstappen is complaining that he is having to zig zag on his tyres. He\u2019s thirsty too. 4/71 Checo Perez is investigated for a bad start. He was too far forward. Things not going well for Red Bull\u2019s second man. 3/71 The safety car might be in for some use. Those crashes came at a difficult part of the track to clear. 2/71 There\u2019s debris all over the track, that was a spectacular crash. Tsunoda was OK, and was able to wave to the crowd as his car is rescued from the first turn. Albon\u2019s car is parked at the side of the track. Sainz had to go off the track in that fast start, Verstappen had left him with nowhere to go. Albon and Tsunoda saw them get squeezed out. These things happen. All eyes on that late-arriving first turn; Verstappen takes the lead, then Sainz goes back ahead but went off, and Sainz hands it back. Tsunoda went right off, and that\u2019s the race over for him. Here\u2019s the safety car, and it\u2019s Verstappen, Sainz and Norris, Leclerc, Hamilton and Russell. Albon had started from ninth and got taken out by Tsunoda. Into the formation lap they go, and it does look quite muggy out there, almost grey. The grandstand is hugely impressive. \u201cMax did a brilliant job yesterday, Checo has a lot of work to do,\u201d says Christian Horner. \u201cCheco just needs to go for it.\u201d Sergio Perez is down in 18th on his home GP. Fernando Alonso says he is \u201cready for the next 50 more\u201d, as he lines up to drive his 400th race. Here come the anthems; there is talk of rain at the end of the race. There are 71 laps of the 4.304-kilometre Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez track to come. It looks hot in Mexico City but is actually around 21 degrees. The Mercedes team are worried about the first turn, and think a one-stop strategy will be the way ahead today. It\u2019s cool. \u201cEvery start is different,\u201d says Max Verstappen as he makes his way to his car. It\u2019s rowdy in Mexico. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say we can win the race today.\" News that Esteban Ocon will be starting from the pit lane, having had to change his battery. And look toward\u2019s 2025\u2019s campaign, with an interview with Charles Leclerc. I am super excited to be working alongside him. To be, yes, learning from him but at the same time it\u2019s such an exciting challenge for me to be in the same car as such a successful driver and to be able to show what I am capable of. Both of us will want to beat each other, that\u2019s the way it is in F1, but I\u2019m sure it will be a healthy competition. It will be Fernando Alonso\u2019s 400th GP, and Giles Richards pays tribute. Norris v Verstappen can still become a close battle. Saturday\u2019s qualifying 1. Max Verstappen - 354pts 2. Lando Norris - 297pts 3. Charles Leclerc - 275pts 4. Oscar Piastri - 247pts 5. Carlos Sainz - 215pts 1. Carlos Sainz, Ferrari 2. Max Verstappen, Red Bull 3. Lando Norris, McLaren 4. Charles Leclerc, Ferrari 5. George Russell, Mercedes 6. Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes 7. Kevin Magnussen, Haas 8. Pierre Gasly, Alpine 9. Alex Albon, Williams 10. Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Haas 11. Yuki Tsunoda, RB 12. Liam Lawson, RB 13. Fernando Alonso, Aston Martin 14. Lance Stroll, Aston Martin 15. Valtteri Bottas, Sauber 16. Franco Colapinto, Williams 17. Oscar Piastri, McLaren 18. Sergio Perez, Red Bull 19. Esteban Ocon, Alpine 20. Zhou Guanyu, Sauber We\u2019re still in North America, and after last week\u2019s thriller in Austin, so much to play for. That Lando Norris and Max Verstappen battle was one for the ages, though the cannier driver won out in the end, and McLaren might have been cannier than take the penalty. Anyway, to Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez, where Carlos Sainz leads the field, ahead of Verstappen and Norris. Much to look out for at the start, with Charles Leclerc lurking in fourth. The race goes at 8pm UK time, that\u2019s 2pm Mexico time.",

      "bodyText": "John Farnham has opened up for the first time about his \u201cabusive\u201d relationship with his first manager, Darryl Sambell, accusing him of being \u201csexually aggressive\u201d towards him and controlling what he sang, wore and ate. In his new memoir, The Voice Inside, published in Australia on Wednesday, the 75-year-old singer reveals the extent of Sambell\u2019s abuse for the first time, writing that he \u201cused me like a piece of meat\u201d. \u201cAt times, in the early years, he was aggressively sexual with me,\u201d he writes. \u201cHe would try it on and I would say, \u2018Darryl, no. Just leave me alone,\u2019 or, \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019 I said it often enough that I can see now that this rejection turned his attraction into jealousy, hatred and a desire for control.\u201d Farnham was 17 when Sambell, then 21, spotted him performing in a bar in Cohuna, Victoria, in 1967. But after Farnham became famous with his hit Sadie the Cleaning Lady, Sambell controlled \u201cwhere and when I worked, what I sang, what I wore, what I ate. He isolated me from my friends and family, he tried to keep me away from [Farnham\u2019s now wife] Jill, he drugged me, and he made me believe that all my success, everything I had, was because of him.\u201d Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Sambell would work him long hours in an effort to isolate him, Farnham writes, and tried to break up his relationship with Jill by \u201cbullying\u201d her. Sambell would also drug Farnham with amphetamines to keep him working all night, then sleeping tablets to knock him out in the morning. \u201cHe drugged me for years, and I had no fucking idea,\u201d Farnham writes, adding that he had only discovered what Sambell was doing when he found a half-dissolved pill in his coffee. He still feels \u201cso ashamed of myself for not realising what Darryl was up to or speaking up more often\u201d, he writes: \u201cI still don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t react more.

These successful years have alternated with early-ish departures: <strong>Tameka Empson</strong>, <strong>Katie Piper</strong>, <strong>Katie McGlynn</strong>, <strong>Nikita Kanda </strong>and now <strong>Dr Punam</strong>.</p> <p>The pattern suggests that Gorka will be due a promising partner next year.

She deserved to go. However, <strong>Dr Punam Krishan</strong> departs with several GP surgeries full of new fans. Averaging 22 points, she was the lowest scorer left in the contest. She\u2019s been stuck near the bottom of the leaderboard and fortunate to escape the dance-off so far. She was always likely to leave when the red spotlight of doom did finally shine down on her.</p> <p>Her highlight came in Movie Week when she had the honour of dancing the first Couple\u2019s Choice of the series. Her Bollywood number with partner <strong>Gorka M\u00e1rquez</strong> was a milestone moment of representation for the South Asian community. Punam came alive during an infectiously fun and playful routine. It scored nine from the deeply moved <strong>Motsi Mabuse</strong> and a total of 33 points, Punam\u2019s best score by far, taking her to the dizzy heights of joint second on the leaderboard. Punam proudly dedicated the dance to her late grandfather, who passed away during the pandemic. A worthy Strictly legacy. The doctor did good.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-27T20:25:41.398Z\">at 8.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-671e9caf8f085a5821813b27\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-27T20:04:52.210Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Worst week yet for Chris</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In a fright night shocker, blind comedian <strong>Chris McCausland </strong>and<strong> Dianne Buswell</strong> finished joint bottom of the Saturday scoreboard.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for watching along with me, televisual trick-or-treaters. The right result, I think, but still bittersweet. Our 10 pairings now pass the contest\u2019s midway mark and move on to the seventh live show - a brand-new themed week celebrating \u201cmusic icons across the decades\u201d. The mind boggles. It airs next Saturday at 6.30pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to analyse all the sequin-spangled action and quibble about overuse of the word \u201cicon\u201d. In the meantime, please jot it on a sticky notelet and attach it to your fridge door: keeeeeeep dancing! Goodnight, gang. On Amy Dowden\u2019s absence, giroliddy says: \u201cPoor JB looked so lonely on his own. Thank goodness he\u2019s through.\u201d ReclinedPotato says of the group dance: \u201cCarlos is going to give me nightmares, turning from Claude into Beetlejuice!\u201d jagadox says of the night\u2019s musical guest: \u201cI\u2019m not always charmed by the Sunday \u2018turn\u2019 but Lady Blackbird is banging.\u201d AlanStatham adds: \u201cWait, what? Icons week? Bruno Mars? Icon threshold sets a new low bar.\u201d On Dr Punam Krishan\u2019s departure, GreatIsMyNewt says: \u201cShe didn\u2019t seem surprised but she hasn\u2019t been improving at the rate of some of the others. I do wonder how much they are able to train affects their performances.\u201d Paperview says: \u201cPunam in the dance-off is a cautionary tale about what happens when someone forces Gorka to do up his shirt.\u201d acanthe adds: \u201cI\u2019m glad she got to do her Couple\u2019s Choice. That was a special one.\u201d Let\u2019s conduct a swift vox pop of your comments. On Shayne Ward\u2019s dance-off appearance, spleety says: \u201cGASP!!! The curse of the mid-table, mid-season placing.\u201d Pancake01 says: \u201cDid Shayne say something like \u2018I just want people to like me\u2019 yesterday? I think that might be his problem. A bit too much need to be liked and a bit too earnest.\u201d joanieloves says: \u201cPoor Shayne. But 30 seconds of standing still waving a stick will put you in the dance-off.\u201d MartGray adds: \u201cWhatever the result, it\u2019s a win for Nancy that she didn\u2019t have her eye put out by Shayne\u2019s rhythmic pointer.\u201d Tonight\u2019s viewing tips? I\u2019m glad you asked. You can now stay turned to BBC1 for Antiques Roadshow or flip to BBC2 for Scotland: The New Wild on BBC2. At 9pm, choose from fun new drama Generation Z on Channel 4, Showtrial on BBC1, Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing on BBC2, MR James: Ghost Writer on BBC4, Chimp Crazy on Sky Documentaries or DI Ray on ITV1. If you\u2019re in the market for a Sunday night movie, there\u2019s The Dirty Dozen (9pm on 5Action), House Of Gucci (9pm on BBC3) or Malcolm X (10pm on BBC2). Pre-Halloween horrors include Dracula (10.30pm on Legend Xtra) or The Crazies (11pm on Sky Sci-Fi). Leave the big light on for the last two. Spanish pro Gorka M\u00e1rquez enhanced his reputation this year. Dr Punam Krishan was an underdog with no performance background but by steering her to the six-week mark, Gorka ensured she exceeded expectations. In his eight years on the show, Gorka has reached three finals - with Alexandra Burke, Maisie Smith and Helen Skelton. These successful years have alternated with early-ish departures: Tameka Empson, Katie Piper, Katie McGlynn, Nikita Kanda and now Dr Punam. The pattern suggests that Gorka will be due a promising partner next year. Could he even go all the way at last and lift the glitterball trophy? Fans of tapas and six-packs will certainly hope so. With justice done and the worst five dancers sent home, we\u2019re left with a field of two halves. There\u2019s the five celebrities likely to be competing for places in the grand glitterball final. To my mind, that\u2019s Tasha Ghouri, Montell Douglas, Jamie Borthwick, Chris McCausland and Sarah Hadland. Then there\u2019s the five who look set for the November chop: Shayne Ward, JB Gill, Sam Quek, Wynne Evans and Pete Wicks. Any of this quintet could hit a seam of form and propel themselves into the upper echelon, of course. Barring such surprises, though, expect them to depart over the next month or so. No second opinion needed. She deserved to go. However, Dr Punam Krishan departs with several GP surgeries full of new fans. Averaging 22 points, she was the lowest scorer left in the contest. She\u2019s been stuck near the bottom of the leaderboard and fortunate to escape the dance-off so far. She was always likely to leave when the red spotlight of doom did finally shine down on her. Her highlight came in Movie Week when she had the honour of dancing the first Couple\u2019s Choice of the series. Her Bollywood number with partner Gorka M\u00e1rquez was a milestone moment of representation for the South Asian community. Punam came alive during an infectiously fun and playful routine. It scored nine from the deeply moved Motsi Mabuse and a total of 33 points, Punam\u2019s best score by far, taking her to the dizzy heights of joint second on the leaderboard. Punam proudly dedicated the dance to her late grandfather, who passed away during the pandemic. A worthy Strictly legacy. The doctor did good. In a fright night shocker, blind comedian Chris McCausland and Dianne Buswell finished joint bottom of the Saturday scoreboard. Having been flying high in third place last week, the death slot combined with low marks for their middling zombie samba to leave them tied at the foot of the standings with on 26 points. A huge viewer favourite, Chris was always likely to be lifted clear of the dance-off by the public vote. However, he\u2019ll still have had an edgy evening and needs to bounce back to form next week. As a rock superfan with great musicality, Icons Week should suit him down to the burial ground. This time he can\u2019t blame the curse of dancing first. Shayne Ward was consigned to the dreaded dance-off for the second time in three weeks. He was always likely to prevail over Dr Punam, having outscored her by a five-point margin on Saturday night, but it will still have been a shock for the singer-turned-actor. Shayne clearly isn\u2019t getting enough viewer votes, hence him tumbling from mid-table into the bottom two again. His slightly needy, navel-gazing statements about online criticism, accusations of cockiness and showing his \u201ctrue self\u201d perhaps haven\u2019t helped his cause. Expect him to depart in the next couple of weeks. A shame, because we\u2019re big fans of his professional partner Nancy Xu. As the departing couple take a final twirl around the ballroom to Meat Loaf\u2019s Bat Out Of Hell (spooky), the credits roll and their castmates descend for consoling cuddles. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Her pro partner Gorka M\u00e1rquez returns the compliment, telling her: \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible, a fantastic six weeks. I\u2019m very proud of what she has achieved. She\u2019s a GP and a mum. She had never danced before and I think she improved week by week. She\u2019s truly what the show is about. Someone who doesn\u2019t have experience in the performance world came here and learnt to dance. She wanted to do so well and worked so hard. I also feel very proud and honoured that we got to do a Bollywood dance to represent your culture, show your culture to the world and open doors for so many people in your culture.\u201d Well said, Gorkz. In her exit speech, Dr Punam Krishan tells Tess: \u201cI am really proud of myself. I\u2019ve taken on something that\u2019s so out of my comfort zone. The one thing that I\u2019ve very much learnt is to say yes more. There is no point in your life when you can stop learning new skills. I\u2019ve learnt more than dancing, I\u2019ve learnt so much from Gorka. It\u2019s memories that I\u2019ll take home forever. I\u2019ve made friends for life. \u201cThis is one of those things that I\u2019ve dreamt about for years and to have one of your dreams genuinely come true is just a surreal feeling. Thank you, Gorka, for believing in me and giving me the gift of dancing. You\u2019ve definitely sparked soomething and I want to learn more. I definitely don\u2019t think this will be the end of my journey dancing.\u201d Well said. I hope she does continue dancing. Once again, it\u2019s unanimous. There\u2019s only been one split decision this series, when Anton opted to keep Tom Dean over Toyah Willcox. Head judge and tiny shoe enthusiast Shirley Ballas also would\u2019ve voted to save Shayne and Nancy. The majority vote means that Dr Punam Krishan and Gorka M\u00e1rquez become this year\u2019s fifth pair to depart the prop-strewn Strictly dancefloor. Shayne and Nancy, saying \u201cboth couples danced well but Shayne was stronger\u201d. Shayne and Nancy, saying \u201cboth improved by Shayne was higher level\u201d. Shayne and Nancy, saying \u201cPunam improved but Shayne styled it out brilliantly\u201d. I fear this is only going one way but you never know. Let\u2019s consult the quartet who\u2019ll have the final say. All the judges scored Shayne one point more than Punam last night, except Craig who scored him two more. Shayne Ward and his dance partner Nancy Xu reprise their paso doble to In The Hall of The Mountain King by Edvard Grieg. The judges said last night that it had intensity and commitment but it was a confused performance which took too long to get going. Too much sizzle and not enough sausage, in the words of Len Goodman. It scored 31 points, five more than Dr Punam, so Shayne surely just needs to avoid any howling slip-ups. Dr Punam Krishan and Gorka M\u00e1rquez have another go at their tango to 80s electro-pop banger Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) by Eurythmics. The judges said last night that it had great drama but was all a bit floppy and she lost her frame. It scored 26 points, five fewer than Shayne, so she\u2019ll need to show considerable improvement second time around. I\u2019m just relieved that me and Lady Blackbird aren\u2019t clashing. I considered wearing that outfit too tonight but thought the feathers might obstruct my typing. Musical interlude now from New Mexico soul diva Marley Munroe, aka Lady Blackbird, who has been described as \u201cthe Grace Jones of jazz\u201d. Indeed, she recorded a cover version of Slave To The Rhythm with its producer and co-writer Trevor Horn. Carlos Gu and Lauren Oakey provide the choreographic accompaniment. More Clauditorium conversation with the safe couples. Wynne Evans reveals that he\u2019s paying tribute to leather-lunged Welsh diva Shirley Bassey. Meanwhile, Sam Quek is doing someone called Taylor Swift. Tasha Ghouri is performing her Couples\u2019 Choice and says it\u2019ll be a tearjerker. Chris McCausland admits he had a blank before his samba and was relieved to make it through. Pete Wicks is now some sort of poster boy for otters and is being Freddie Mercury next week. No alarms and no surprises. As bookies predicted, Dr Punam Krishan and Gorka M\u00e1rquez must dance again for survival. So are Pete Wicks, Tasha Ghouri, Chris McCausland and Wynne Evans. Which means\u2026 Now to find out who will face Shayne in the dance-off. For Halloween, there should be a thunderclap and some lightning when the spotlight illuminates. Perhaps some bats. Bwa-ha-ha. Craig fell in love with his hair last night. A shampoo endorsement deal is surely imminent. Nice stat dropped in by Clipboard Claud there. Shirley appreciates cheeky little devil Wynne Evans\u2019 first lifts. Craig says Pete Wicks\u2019 confidence has kicked in. Motsi hails Sarah Hadland\u2019s Argentine tango as dance of the night and says it\u2019s set the level for the rest to beat. The panel perch their pert posteriors on La Winkle\u2019s banquette for a closer look at last night\u2019s dances. Anton wanted more identifiable paso doble content from Shayne Ward. Craig was much more keen. In a neat visual trick, Dianne Buswell and Michelle Tsiakkas are playing two halves of the same body. Well, Beetlejuice is the ghost with the most. The story takes us inside Beetlejuice\u2019s crazed mind, where every world through every door is represented by a different dance style. There\u2019s samba, tango, jazz, musical theatre. Props include feathers, maracas, doors, bicycles and musical instruments. Tome for a suitably spookacious group number from the Strictly pros. Choreographed by Matt Flint, it\u2019s a Beetlejuice-inspired routine, led by Carlos Gu. Well, at least he\u2019s not dressed as Claudia Winkleman anymore, which was just too discombobulating. Carlos is the familiar ghost in black-and-white striped suit and green hair. Say his name three times and he\u2019ll pop up. JB Gill and Amy Dowden will be dancing a Couple\u2019s Choice to Bruno Mars. Team MoJo will be paying homage to Whitney Houston. And Iiiiiiiiii\u2026. Up on the balcony of bantz with the relieved couples who are through to Icons Week, Jamie Borthwick \u2013 who has topped the scoreboard for the second week running \u2013 reveals that he\u2019\u2019ll be performing to George Michael\u2019s Faith. Meanwhile, Sarah Hadland and Vito Coppola confess that their motto in training is \u201cWhat would Shirley do?\u201d. Well, she\u2019f whip out a pair of tiny shoes for a start. The paddle-raising panel of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and head judge Shirley Ballas have taken off their fancy dress. It might lack gravitas if they were still in full trick-or-treat mode during decision time. Well, that\u2019s a slight surprise but not a mega one. Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu are consigned to the dance-off for the second time in three weeks. The curse of mid-table strikes again. With Amy Dowden absent, it was a relief that her partner JB Gill wasn\u2019t consigned to his second consecutive dance-off. If he had been, someone would\u2019ve needed to deputise at the last minute - presumably one of the eliminated female pros, meaning Nadiya, Karen or Luba - or he\u2019d have been forced to withdraw, which would have been a sad way to depart. Thankfully, JB was safe and it sounds like Amy is one the mend. Phew. So are Montell Douglas and JB Gill. Hold your calls and press pause on those important faxes. It\u2019s time to find out who\u2019s waltzing through to next week and who\u2019s tangoing into trouble. Amy Dowden\u2019s absence gets brief mention. Get well soon, Amy! Our 11 couples nervously await their fates. Those Frankenstein, Joker and scarecrow outfits look slightly sad the morning after, like a Halloween partygoer taking the walk of shame. A reminder of Saturday night\u2019s action on-screen now. Fancy dress frenzy! First Argentine tango of the series! Shining twins do a chilling Charleston! Tens for Sarah Hadland, Jamie Borthwick and Tasha Ghouri! Behold our presenting pair, so let\u2019s run the rule over their rig-outs. Tess Daly is in a PVC black bin liner. Claudia Winkleman is in a tuxedo with string tie. I think Tess might win, making it one-all this weekend. Roll clap-along credits. Which of these couples is about to be sent to the pumpkin patch of dance disgrace? Slip on your lounging cloak and insert your vampire fangs. We\u2019re about to head back to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 Tonight\u2019s musical guest is US jazz diva Lady Blackbird, who at least has a faintly spooky name. Lady Crow, Lady Vulture and Lady Vampire Bat were presumably washing their hair. Just five minutes to wait now\u2026 On BBC1 right now is agricultural stalwart Countryfile. It\u2019s a mere 10 minutes until we swap muddy wellies for dancing shoes. Any dance-off predictions? Let\u2019s turn on the juice and see what shakes loose. Yes, tonight\u2019s group dance is a Beetlejuice-themed routine with all manner of props, tricks and treats. Should be quite the supernatural spectacle. Not long now until glitter o\u2019clock\u2026 A cluster of four celebrities finished directly above the bottom two on last night\u2019s leaderboard - namely Sam Quek, Pete Wicks, Shayne Ward and Wynne Evans, who all scored 31 points. They will all be praying that viewer votes keep them clear of danger. It\u2019s 15 minutes until glitter o\u2019clock\u2026 We saw another flurry of maximums handed out last night. There were two 10s for Jamie Borthwick\u2019s American smooth, two for Sarah Hadland\u2019s Argentine tango and one for Tasha Ghouri\u2019s samba. Craig Revel Horwood, of course, is still to raise his perfect paddle. Don\u2019t go changing, dah-ling. It\u2019s 20 minutes until we\u2019re back in the ballroom\u2026 Coming into this weekend, bookmakers\u2019 strong favourite for elimination was TV GP Dr Punam Krishan. She duly finished bottom of the scoreboard, alongside Chris McCausland. Will voting viewers ride to their rescue? If so, could we see our first shock result of the series? Twenty five minutes until we get our first clues\u2026 Due to unforeseen circumstances, much-loved Welsh pro Amy Dowden is unable to appear in tonight\u2019s results show. Worrying reports overnight said that she was rushed to hospital after collapsing backstage following the main show. Amy has Crohns Disease and has been battling cancer, of course, so an ambulance was called as a precaution. According to a spokesperson: \u201cShe is feeling much better and would like to thank the Strictly family for their love and concern.\u201d Good news. I\u2019m sure we all wish her well and very much hope she\u2019s back next week. And hey, at least there was a doctor in the house. Punam Krishan\u2019s presence could have come in handy. The creepy curse is about to spell doom for one duo. Good evening and welcome to the fifth elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your devilish dance partner for tonight\u2019s results show. Please watch along with me as the fifth celebrity is sent home, falling agonisingly short of next weekend\u2019s midway milestone and missing out on next Saturday\u2019s first ever Icons Week. Following last night\u2019s spooktacular fancy-dressed live show, our 11 surviving pro-celebrity pairings will be whittled down to a terrifying 10. The judges\u2019 scores have been combined with the public vote and tonight the bottom two will dance-off for survival. So who\u2019s at risk? Media medic Dr Punam Krishan and, more surprisingly, comedian Chris McCausland were left joint bottom of the Halloween leaderboard but will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Pete Wicks, Sam Quek, Shayne Ward or Wynne Evans could be in demonic danger. It\u2019s showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and pumpkin-spiced sarcasm. So pour yourself a love potion (I\u2019d recommend no 9 on the drinks list) and see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d also love to hear from you. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for Halloween hubbub. I\u2019ll samba-bounce down there Whenever I can to gauge your reaction, chuckle at your observations and report on your comments. Someone\u2019s going home in a pumpkin-shaped carriage. Nearly time to staaaaaart spooky eliminating! That completes Saturday\u2019s blood-spattered liveblog but this weekend\u2019s Halloween hoofing isn\u2019t over yet. Meet you back here for the results show, which airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1. I\u2019ll fire up the magic blogging contraption at 6.50pm for build-up, so please rejoin me then. In the meantime, I\u2019m @michaelhogan on Twitter, so do creep up behind me and say boo. Thanks for watching along with me. Your comments have undoubtedly been treats, not tricks. Don\u2019t forget to put your clocks back an hour tonight. Yes, even the ones on the microwave and car dashboard. See you tomorrow but in the meantime, keeeeeep spooky dancing! I bid you a ghostly goodnight. Finally, on the Halloween costume ludicrousness, Jdhughes16 says: \u201cCraig and Anton - utter genius and hysterically funny!\u201d whistledownthewind says: \u201cSeeing Craig and Anton doing Charleston dance moves as the scary twins from The Shining is almost worth the price of the BBC licence fee in itself!\u201d irreverentnurse says: \u201cAnton looks like one of my old nurse managers.\u201d To which lordylovesasprout replies: \u201cGosh, yes! I was wondering why I started to shake and sweat. Even heard my name being bellowed down the ward. Ah, the 1970s.\u201d Gardener_Maidhc says: \u201cI swear Anton was the mean dinner lady who hated all children from my infant school with that wig.\u201d RichIrwinTN adds: \u201cI am expecting Gorka to say: \u2018Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die\u2019.\u201d On Sam Quek\u2019s show-closing jive, MartGray says: \u201cThat was Sam\u2019s best. It must be hard doing two dances in one.\u201d On tonight\u2019s music, Acanthe says: \u201cCan we just raise a glass to Dave Arch &amp; his wunnerful orchestra? What a variety of music they get around.\u201d On Sarah Hadland\u2019s Argentine tango, TeeDubyaBee: \u201cSarah &amp; Vito killed that. Superb.\u201d VirgilHilts says: \u201cInstead of just starting their dance, Sarah and Vito decided to have a couple of rounds of Sexy Twister.\u201d FewerNotLess adds: \u201cHow can that be a 10 when the first lift was so ragged?\u201d On Jamie Borthwick, G1adys says: \u201cJamie is quietly moving through the weeks, without entering the favourites-to-win category\u2026 yet? I\u2019d like to see him in the final. Michelle has killed the Wednesday Addams look tonight.\u201d dAsgoyne adds: \u201cEnjoyed that. And shout-out to Michelle because she is doing a really good job with Jamie as her first partner on the show.\u201d On Shayne Ward\u2019s paso doble, diamondcat says: \u201cI like the idea of a mad composer. It makes a change from bullfighting and Shayne is giving it his all. I do wish that the judges would remember that the celebs can only dance the steps that they\u2019re given - they\u2019re not the choreographers.\u201d Somersetlass says: \u201cWow, shout-out to the band for that rendition of Hall of the Mountain King. As for the dance, far too much faffin\u2019 abaht, which was all very dramatic but Shayne barely danced at all. Nancy did amazingly though.\u201d Magnoliatree says: \u201cShayne and Nancy! Wipes brow with lace hanky. Theatrical and very good.\u201d YodaknowsAll adds: \u201cWhat great choreography in that paso. Would have liked a tad more shaping from Shane and they could have started dancing earlier.\u201d On JB Gill\u2019s foxtrot, SecretPuddleJumper says: \u201cWell, that is scary stuff. I\u2019ve long assumed Toploader are playing on a loop in hell.\u201d lester48 says: \u201cOooh, I\u2019ve got a craving now for a Starbucks Pumpkin Spiced Latte.\u201d emilyscatnaps adds: \u201cI feel like the foxtrot is one of those dances that deserves tails at the very least (if not top hat). Poor JB has got to do it in baggy dungarees. With colourful patches. I liked it, JB, and I hope your costume hasn\u2019t gone against you #justiceforAston.\u201d On Montell Douglas, MarkRoche says: \u201cIt takes someone special to keep my eyes off Johannes. Montell has got it! Such a star.\u201d Storm adds: \u201cI know it\u2019s out of sequence but Jojo\u2019s reaction to Craig\u2019s nine was joyous. You would think he was the celebrity in the pair from his reaction.\u201d On Wynne Evans, meanwhile, Heartticker says: \u201cI didn\u2019t really enjoy that salsa from Wynne and Katya. Felt it was a little bit like a circus performance, rather than a dance.\u201d ButterflyBlu adds: \u201cWynne\u2019s dance was never worth eights!\u201d Lots of love for Pete Wicks. 1991fab says: \u201cPete\u2019s best dance so far! I loved it and especially the character! Great job!\u201d Shazza2704 says: \u201cI loved that from Pete. He looks the part and the choreography was top notch. Well done make-up too, he could be Joaquin\u2019s stunt double!\u201d Somersetlass says: \u201cPete looks less scary tonight than last week, tbh. That was quite a spectacular dance; his best yet.\u201d KarimaKat adds: \u201cNot a fan of the chucking round of Jowita like a rag doll. Viennese is meant to be elegant but this silly Halloween dressing-up kind of spoils that I guess. All about \u2018characterisation\u2019, sigh.\u201d Verdicts are in from the creepy comments section. On Chris McCausland, Vicc says: \u201cOh dear. The first dance. And the samba. Chris and Dianne may really need our votes!\u201d Diamondcat says of Dr Punam: \u201cPunam and Gorka\u2019s tango seemed to take ages to get going and having got going, then stopped. I know Craig said that it had \u2018intensity and drama\u2019 but I didn\u2019t see any drama happening - it all seemed very underpowered. They did look lovely, though.\u201d Who\u2019s taking home the skull-shaped prizes on fright night? Here are this week\u2019s liveblog gong-getters\u2026 Best dance: Sarah Hadland\u2019s Argentine tango takes the prize, with Jamie\u2019s American smooth and Tasha\u2019s samba just behind. Worst dance: Dr Punam again. She deserves to go now. Best music choice: Frank Sinatra or The Fugees for me. Worst music choice: Just when Toploader couldn\u2019t get any worse, some CGI birds squawked at us. Where are those zombie scarecrows when you need them? Or an augmented reality shotgun? Best outfit: Vito Coppola looked hot in a Paul-Rudd-playing-Amadeus way, while Craig and Anton as the Shining twins were comedically creepy. Worst outfit: Take your pick from Wynne\u2019s devil outfit, the lame scarecrows or Carlos Gu dressed as Claudia\u2019s disturbing doppelg\u00e4nger on the balcony. Best judges\u2019 comment: Anton on his Shining outfit: \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019ve never looked more attractive.\u201d Craig\u2019s reply? \u201cSo glad I had two of these at home, sister.\u201d Worst VT: Lots of horror cheese but Shayne \u201cpranking\u201d Nancy was particularly lame. Best Claudia quip: Her deadpan bafflement at Amy Dowden explaining the feather step. As La Winkle would be the first to tell you, just because she\u2019s been here a decade doesn\u2019t mean that she knows anything about dancing. On a high-scoring, high-quality night, Sarah Hadland and Jamie Borthwick jointly top the spooky standings, with Tasha Ghouri in third spot. Dr Punam Krishan and Chris McCausland, more surprisingly, are joint bottom. As always, though the viewer vote helps decide who\u2019ll be consigned to tomorrow night\u2019s dreaded dance-off. Wynne Evans, Sam Quek and Shayne Ward might also fear the blood-red spotlight of doom. You can now flip to ITV1 for The Voice final or to BBC2 for a compilation of sad songs (better than it sounds, promise). At 9pm, Nordic noir Justice: Those Who Kill returns to BBC4. At 9.10pm, Professor Alice Roberts\u2019 new travelogue Ottoman Empire by Train starts on Channel 4 or there\u2019s Dusty Springfield at the BBC on BBC2. Film-wise, at 9pm there\u2019s a choice between Out of Sight on Legend or True Lies on Comedy Central. At 10.10pm, David Bowie documentary Moonage Daydream is on Channel 4. At 11.10pm, continue the Halloween theme with Norwegian chiller The Innocents is on Film4. Well, what could be more relaxing than some murderous telepathic children? \u201cKeeeeeep dancing,\u201d our hosts howl at the moon. Claudia sweetly tells Tess \u201cYou are the hocus to my pocus\u201d. As the jack-o-lanterns are extinguished and the pumpkins repurposed as soup, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Tonight\u2019s routines get recapped on-screen. Which supernaturally good duo are you voting for? Which terrifyingly bad pair are you definitely not? The usual mayhem erupts, this week with a Halloween twist. Wynne singing! Ghostly cardboard cut-outs! Remember to vote for your favourites if you don\u2019t want a dance-off horror show tomorrow. Judges\u2019 scores for Sam and Nikita: 7, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 31 points. Her best yet but potential dance-off danger. Judges\u2019 comments for Sam and Nikita: Motsi says \u201cthe cherry on top of a great show, fun but waned more coordination\u201d. Shirley says \u201cstarted well but got a bit wonky\u201d. Anton says \u201cwe\u2019ve been outdone in the costume department, sister, made mistakes but you\u2019ve got so much promise\u201d. Craig concludes \u201ctiming and sync got out, upper body needs work but kicks and flick magnificent, bravo\u201d. Comments as much about the night overall, rather than Sam. Eights? Hockey star Sam Quek was gutted to make mistakes during last week\u2019s quickstep and, ferociously competitive as she is, is determined to bounce back strongly and has been working hard. Can she kick and flick her way up the leaderboard? She\u2019s relishing the character of Janet here, looking great in the wig and doing a rare bit of acting (\u201cBrad, where are you?\u201d). An exhausting routine with lots of fast footwork. They took the judges\u2019 advice and banned mirrors from the training room this week to improve Sam\u2019s peripheral vision and sharpen her timing. A sort of black lacy Bucks Fizz strip but they lost timing in several patches. Great entertainment but too many mistakes for me. Song: Time Warp from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The signature song from Richard O\u2019Brien\u2019s 1973 horror musical has soundtracked Strictly jives before from Charles Venn and Jamelia. Judges\u2019 scores for Sarah and Vito: 9, 10, 9, 10 for a total of 38 points. Joint top of the scoreboard. Meltdown on Miranda Hart\u2019s WhatsApp group. Judges\u2019 comments for Sarah and Vito: Craig says \u201ca problem with the first lift and missing passes but wonderful\u201d. Motsi says \u201cdance of the night\u201d. Shirley says \u201cspectacular, fantastic lifts, worked as a team, had it all going on\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cbest legs in the competition, agree with Motsi, best tonight\u201d. One nine and three 10s hoving into view? The first Argentine of the series now. Always a big moment. to Ready Or Not by Fugees. Goth feel as Sarah Hadland wakes up in bed, wearing a soft white dress and kicking her legs, to see Vito Coppola appear to her in spirit. An intense, icy feel. Lots of lifts, spins and sharp leg kicks. A challenging routine requiring balance, strength and control. Powerful, expressive and passionate with intricate foot movements and changes of gear. Fiery passion and intense chemistry. Perhaps lacking some body contact but for an icy routine, that was hawt. Wow. Song: Ready Or Not by Fugees. The 1996 hit contained a sample from Irish new age popstress Enya, who considered suing but eventually settled out of court when she heard and liked the song. Judges\u2019 scores for Jamie and Michelle: 9, 10 (dropped her paddle briefly there, ruining the impact), 10, 9 for a total of 38 points. A tiny bit overmarked for me but top of the leaderboard with dances two to go. Judges\u2019 comments for Jamie and Michelle: Anton says \u201cjoyous, you\u2019re so good, just learn to love it\u201d. Craig says \u201cin-credible\u201d. Motsi says \u201cimproving, amazing, just lighten up a little bit\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cpure genius, easy on the eye, what a partnership is developing\u201d. Eights and nines? EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick has been going from strength to strength. He\u2019s the only celebrity to have improved his score every week, culminating in him topping the leaderboard last week with a near-perfect 39 points for his traditional, authentic paso doble. Now he\u2019s back in ballroom hold with foxtrot steps, lifts and wow factor. They\u2019re playing Addams siblings Wednesday and Pugsley. Swing-ography to start. Maintaining his frame, use his feet and knees for glide and moving smoothly across the floor eventually, after some jerky messin\u2019 abaht to start. Role reversal lifts, then a bit spin to finish. Enjoyable if not very American smoothy. Song: The Addams Family Theme by Vic Mizzy. The finger-snapping theme for the 1964 TV series also featured prominently in recent Netflix spin-off Wednesday. Michelle Visage and Scott Mills both foxtrotted to it in previous series - Michelle with more success, scoring 39 points. Scott\u2019s got a mere 21 and he was promptly eliminated. Oops. Do we think Craig and Anton are enjoying being The Shining twins a bit too much? Judges\u2019 scores for Shayne and Nancy: 8, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 31 points. Mid-ranking. Judges\u2019 comments for Shayne and Nancy: Motsi says \u201cintensity, commitment, sharpness and energy, just start it earlier\u201d. Shirley says \u201cconfused performance, took too long for you to take a step but fabulous knee walks and commitment\u201d. Anton says \u201ctheatrically magnificent but the paso part suffered, too much sizzle and not enough sausage, as Len would say, bless him\u201d. Nice nod. Craig concludes \u201cdisagree, refreshing, you lived it and drove, congratulations\u201d. Sevens and eights? In a high-concept paso, bewigged Shayne Ward is a wizard conductor and Nancy Xu represents the musical notes. He\u2019s controlling her and moving her around the floor. Takes too long to resemble a paso but once it does, strong posture and fast feet. Frame falls and lacks that all-important banana shape for a while but improved after the knee walks. Intensity, control and playing the proud matador character pretty well. Jamie Borthwick scored 39 points for his paso last week. Surely won\u2019t match that but a strong finish and dramatic concept. Song: In The Hall of the Mountain King by Grieg. The ominous orchestral piece from Peer Gynt inspired the Inspector Gadget theme song, rather brilliantly. Judges\u2019 scores for Tasha and Alja\u017e: 9, 9, 9, 10 for a total of 37 points. Highest Halloween samba ever and top of the pops so far. Judges\u2019 comments for Tasha and Alja\u017e: Shirley says \u201ccombined character and technique, very impressive\u201d. Anton says \u201cGorka wants his body back, you\u2019re an exceptional dancer, bounced back brilliantly well from last week\u201d. Craig says \u201ca-may-zing\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201coutstanding\u201d. Nines en route? A terrifying 10? Tasha Ghouri suffered a rare dip for last week\u2019s bumpy tango but with 172 points across five weeks, they\u2019re still the contest\u2019s highest scoring couple in 20 years, with three points more more than Layton Williams and Nikita Kuzmin at his stage. I know, right? It\u2019s a fun, family-friendly, Franken-samba with them playing a creature couple. Technically tricky, robotic before it loosens up, lots of hip work, plenty of voltas. Body ripples and bounce. Travelling around the floor well with speed and changes of rhythm. Tiny timing snafu, I thought, but leg lift to end and all-round terrific. Song: I Like to Move It by Reel 2 Real. The 1993 ragga-house hit was originally released on aptly named US record label Strictly Rhythm. It has since become familiar from the Madagascar film franchise. Simon Webbe and Kristina Rihanoff danced a Strictly samba to it a decade ago. Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Amy: 7, 9, 8, 8 for a total of 32 points. Highest foxtrot of the series. Second place at the midway mark. Judges\u2019 comments for JB and Amy: Motsi says \u201ccharming scarecrows, you\u2019re a ballroom boy, led well, fundamentals and transitions on-point\u201d. Shirley says \u201cdifficult steps done well, fantastic footwork very impressive for me\u201d. Anton says \u201clost shape a bit, square it up, otherwise super-duper\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cfelt too technical and clockwork, bum stuck out, you\u2019re a lovely dancer but go a little bit further\u201d. Sevens and eights, do we think? The surprise dance-off survivors are back in their comfort zone. JB Gill is something of a ballroom boy who loves being in hold. They\u2019re playing scarecrows who come to life on a pumpkin farm in the moonlight. A nice nod to JB\u2019s agricultural day job and cutesy storytelling. Glide and gorgeous frame. Sweet and lovely, although the theme got in the way of the foxtrot\u2019s elegance. Song: Dancing In The Moonlight by Toploader. The 2000 cover of the 1970 Boffalongo original. Strangely, Toploader performed at both the Conservative and Labour Party conferences last year. A cynic might suggest it almost like they\u2019ll do anything for a few quid. Carlos Gu dressed as Claudia on the balcony is mildly disorientating. Just me? Judges\u2019 scores for Wynne and Katya: 7, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 31 points. Mid-table as it stands. Judges\u2019 comments for Wynne and Katya: Craig says \u201cdancing too wide, lacked fluidity but loved those lifts, born entertainer\u201d. Motsi says \u201cyou bring the sunshine and keep pushing it\u201d. Shirley says \u201cbrave lifts, good steps but work on your rotation\u201d, making the Shining twins reluctantly do a demo time. Anton concludes \u201cyou were Katya-ed and didn\u2019t die, well done, keep doing the cardio, you\u2019re going to need it\u201d. Eights incoming? Another frothy routine for Wynne, following last year\u2019s slapstick quickstep, to help shake off the lingering whiff of the \u201chandgate\u201d scandal. Katya apparently kneed him in the head practising their lifts this week. Wynne has great rhythm and musicality but needs technique too. Devilish outfits and a long shoulder lift to start. Katya barely touches the floor for the opening 30 seconds. Side-by-side stuff, shimmies and shakes. Huge fun, if lacking in spicy salsa flavour. Song: Canned Heat by Jamiroquai. The cat-in-the-hat performed it live in the Strictly ballroom back in 2006. The 1999 nu-disco funk hit was also used in the climactic dance scene of cult film Napoleon Dynamite. Judges\u2019 scores for Punam and Gorka: 6, 7, 6, 7 for a total of 26 points. Her second best but I suspect dance-off danger. Judges\u2019 comments for Punam and Gorka: Anton says \u201cgreat drama but all a bit floppy, believe in yourself a bit more\u201d. Craig says \u201cGorka was dragging you around, lost frame but you had intensity\u201d. Motsi says \u201cI disagree, I saw commitment, energy and improvement but exaggerate and commit\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cintention and expression, now get tidier in the legs and feet\u201d. Sixes and the odd seven, do we reckon? The bookies\u2019 favourite to go home this weekend bid to defy the odds. They\u2019re playing undead pirates from a ghost ship. Punam\u2019s sporting a shredded black and red dress. Short, sharp movements. Having a decent crack at the required passion, drama and intensity but lacking staccato. Not enough content in hold for me. They should be glued together, lying low and moving as one but the hold isn\u2019t quite compact enough. Fun but wobbly. Song: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) by Eurythmics. Synth-pop duo Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart\u2019s breakthrough 1983 hit is a bit of a favourite for Strictly tangos. Both Jonnie Peacock and Sophie Ellis-Bextor danced to it in previous series. Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: 9, 9, 9, 8 for a total of 35 points. Highest cha cha of the series and top of the scoreboard so far. Judges\u2019 comments for Montell and Jojo: Craig says \u201cthe potion worked, loved it\u201d. Motsi says \u201cgreat body action, fiery and stunning\u201d. The Queen of Latin says \u201cfundamentals, hip motion, simply breathtaking\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cmarvellous, strong performance, but I\u2019d like faster leg speed\u201d. Eights ahoy? Maybe a nine? Confidence should be high for this loveable couple after last week\u2019s milestone Couple\u2019s Choice moment, which closed the show and notched a near-perfect 39 points - the joint highest scote of the series so far. Now Team MoJo back to Latin for the first time in four weeks. She\u2019s making a concoction to play a trick on Johannes. Slightly wonky opening, then gets going. Flirty Cuban disco feel. Fast and controlled, then a little mistake in front of the judges, I think. Bags of fun ad her second strong week running. Song: Love Potion No. 9 by The Clovers. This 1959 rock song famously appeared on the soundtrack to George Lucas\u2019 American Graffiti. It was later covered by The Searchers, Elkie Brooks, The White Stripes and The Tygers of Pan Tang. Ed \u201cGlitter\u201d Balls danced a cha cha cha to it on the 2016 Halloween special, which the producers might be hoping we\u2019d forgotten. Judges\u2019 scores for Pete and Jowita: 7, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 31 points. His highest score. No joke(r). Judges\u2019 comments for Pete and Jowita: Pete says he was in jail for last week\u2019s illegal lifts. Shirley says \u201cno joke when it comes to the dancing, lovely footwork and frame, get steady on those wobbly feet but be proud\u201d. Anton says \u201cyour best dance (agree!), you\u2019re growing which is a joy to see, not perfect yet but terribly good\u201d. Craig says \u201ca bit behind the music but formidable characterisation\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cbest performance so far, you moved and led well, biggest step yet\u201d. Sevens, do we think? Maybe an eight? Pete Wicks is relishing the chance to play one of his favourite film characters, the Joker. Jowita is Harley Quinn in a red ruffled, frilly dress. Pete\u2019s been calling it \u201cthe Viennetta walk\u201d in training this week, which is a worrying sign. He starts in Arkham asylum, miming along, then emerges from behind bars and gets into hold. Gliding romantically around the floor with plenty of dizzying spins. Not sure the footwork is all there and they\u2019re not quite flying flat but a confident performance and cracking mood. End up on the floor. Fun. Song: That\u2019s Life by Frank Sinatra. The 1966 recording soundtracked the final scene of 2019 Joker and was reprised by Lady Gaga in this year\u2019s sequel, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux. Ore Oduba performed a Viennese to it in Blackpool, scored 38 points and went on to lift the glitterball trophy. No pressure, Pete. The glorious Sara Cox is this week\u2019s Clauditorium guest, reading out the voting smallprint. Loved her since The Girlie Show. Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: 5 (boo!), 7, 7, 7 for a total of 26 points. Not dance-off danger, surely? Judges\u2019 comments for Chris and Dianne: \u201cBe nice or I\u2019ll eat your brains,\u201d Chris tells the judges. Motsi says \u201cnailed the character, you did more than stay alive, you survived the opening\u201d. Shirley says \u201covercooked the bounce but content and characterisation fabulous\u201d. Anton says \u201cwent through the step and lacked fluidity but timing exceptional\u201d. Craig concludes \u201ctoo much hopping, needed stretch and smoothness, shoulders raised, no hip action on the voltas but immaculate rhythm and magnificent acting\u201d. Scary sevens, do we say? Uh-oh. Out first with a samba. Double danger. He moved many viewers to tears with last week\u2019s You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone waltz. Now can Chris McCausland get the party started? The samba has claimed two victims already this series. Surely it won\u2019t make it three here? We start in a spooky graveyard where cadaver Chris and decomposing Dianne Buswell rise from the dead for their annual disco dance. Chris has complained amusingly that Latin is \u201ctoo knackering\u201d and he lacks the requisite hips but he\u2019s doing a respectable job. Disco vibes and plenty of party spirit. Flat-footed, though, and perhaps his most hesitant performance yet. The Rio carnival zombies have come alive for one night only, so they return to their graves at the end. RIP. Song: Stayin Alive\u2019 by The Bee Gees. The 1977 disco hit from Saturday Night Fever also soundtracked Davood Ghadami\u2019s samba during the 2017 series. Our 11 couples emerge and they\u2019ve all been raiding the creepy costume box. Werewolves! Devils! Zombies! Ghostly pirates! Spooky scarecrows! It\u2019s like a primary school dress-up day on that staircase. The paddle-raising quartet arrive in full fancy dress. Anton Du Beke and Craig Revel Horwood have come as the twins from The Shining. Don\u2019t have nightmares, kids. Here come our hosts, so let\u2019s compare their fright night finery. Tess Daly has come as a pearl queen qwith weird sleeves. Claudia Winkleman is in chic black frock and blazer. Claud wins. Four of these couples have bitten the dance dust already. Who\u2019ll be next to join them in the glittery graveyard? Cue the compulsory spook-themed VT. Craig Revel Horwood in bed. Not a coffin, surprisingly. Open your creaking coffin lids and lurch out into the moonlight, cackling in a sinister manner. We\u2019re about to go live to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 Alan Carr\u2019s Picture Slam just reaching its bifocal climax on BBC1 now. It\u2019s enough to make you pine for the good ole days of Pointless Celebrities. Not long now, fancy footwork fans\u2026 Tonight\u2019s couples are bidding to make it through to Strictly\u2019s first ever Icons Week next Saturday, when routines will celebrate \u201cmusic icons across the decades\u201d. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s more of a success than Around The World Week a decade ago (remember that?). Ten minutes until the chilling church bell tolls\u2026 We can look forward to the traditional outlandish costumes and theming overload tonight. Our couples will be channelling the Addams family, the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and the Joker and Harley Quinn, alongside a whole gamut of ghostly randomness. Dig out your animal ears because it\u2019ll be like a Mean Girls costume party in that ballroom. So fetch. A mere 15 minutes until trick-or-treat time\u2026 Tick them off when they happen on-screen! Take a drink for each! End up apple-bobbing with a bolt through your neck and clown make-up you can\u2019t remember applying! Here\u2019s your 10-point spotter\u2019s guide for tonight: Every VT has a hammed-up horror film theme Judges wield pumpkin or ghost-shaped scoring paddles Someone begins their routine by climbing out of a coffin, giving us Nancy Dell\u2019Olio flashbacks Halloween prop overload means too much \u201cmessin\u2019 abaht\u201d and dances take ages to get going Routine \u201cenhanced\u201d and \u201caugmented\u201d by shonky CGI creatures Someone has a disembodied hand on their shoulder Craig describes a dodgy dance as \u201ca horror show, darling\u201d Someone\u2019s face is painted green and the make-up transfers to their partner\u2019s cheek during the dance Band leader Dave Arch is dressed as a baton-wielding werewolf or vampire The production team\u2019s names are \u201cspookified\u201d with Halloween puns on the end credits Tonight sees the most varied hoofing repertoire of the series so far, with 10 different dance styles on display. The only overlap is two sambas (from Chris McCausland and Tasha Ghouri). Most excitingly of all, we\u2019ll be treated to the first Argentine tango of the series, courtesy of Sarah Hadland and Vito Coppola. Twenty minutes until the witching hour\u2026 Based on the 2024 series so far, being on first and performing a samba could prove fatal. Three times in four weeks, the couple who danced first on Saturday night went on to appear in Sunday\u2019s dance-off (this fate has befallen Tom Dean, Shayne Ward and JB Gill). Meanwhile, two of the four eliminated couples went out on a samba (namely Toyah Willcox and Paul Merson). Keep an eye on the running order tonight for potential portents. It\u2019s 25 minutes to creepy kick-off\u2026 Media medic Dr Punam Krishan is the bookies\u2019 strong favourite for elimination this weekend, having languished near the bottom of the scoreboard every week but one. She also has the lowest average score of any surviving celebrity. But will tonight\u2019s scoring paddles and the public vote go according to form? Sam Quek and Pete Wicks are the next most widely tipped for the exit door. Could Halloween characterisation help them to safety? Less than half an hour until we get our first choreographic clues\u2026 Twinkle-toed trick or technical treat? Good evening and welcome to week six of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your undead dance partner for tonight\u2019s annual spooktacular - this year\u2019s second themed show and another milestone on the road to glittery glory. I\u2019d love you to watch along with me as our pro-celebrity pairs perform Halloween-themed routines. It promises to be a scream. Last week saw more perfect 10s, this time for Montell Douglas and Jamie Borthwick, while dad-dancing footballer Paul Merson was given the red card. Our surviving 11 pro-celebrity pairs now don phantasmagorical fancy dress and hit the Elstree dancefloor once again, bidding to make it to the contest\u2019s midway mark next weekend. As per usual, tonight\u2019s scores will be combined with the public vote. The two lowest-ranked couples will hoof again for survival on Sunday night. Who\u2019ll fall victim to fright night and fall short of the halfway point? Dr Puman Krishanlooks in the most danger. Sam Quek and Pete Wicks could also be vulnerable, while Shayne Ward and JB Gill have made shock appearances in the dance-off in recent weeks. Amid the Halloween frenzy, it\u2019s all to hoof for. It\u2019s spooky showtime at 6.25pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 5.55pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and pumpkin-spiced asides. So pour a bubbling chalice of magic potion, stock up on skull-shaped snacks and I\u2019ll see you on the cobweb-draped sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for ghoulish gossip. I\u2019ll zombie-shuffle down there from time-to-time to eavesdrop and report on your reactions. Someone\u2019s Halloween is set to be a horror show. Nearly time to staaaart spooky dancing!",

The indirect talks, mediated by Qatar, the US and Egypt, broke down after the death of Hamas\u2019s leader Ismail Haniyeh in a bombing in Iran believed to have been carried out by Israel. Hostilities with Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah have since overshadowed the peace process in Gaza.</p> \n<p>The killing of Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the 7 October 2023 attack, in the strip this month was presented by the international community as an opportunity to restart negotiations. Sinwar, who had the last word on Hamas\u2019s position, had repeatedly blocked progress towards a deal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f86cec8d-bb6f-4fbb-9764-0c4d6524c40d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sQQqyaimEzU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Later on Sunday, family members of the approximately 100 Israeli hostages who remain captive in Gaza disrupted a speech by Benjamin Netanyahu at a televised memorial event for victims of the Hamas attack, forcing the Israeli prime minister to stop his address.</p> \n<p>Many in Israel blame Netanyahu for the intelligence and response failures of 7 October and accuse him of dragging his heels on a deal in Gaza to bring the hostages home for political reasons.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Lebanese health ministry said that at least 21 people were killed on Sunday in Israeli strikes on three different areas in southern Lebanon.</p> \n<p>Nine people were killed and 38 wounded in a strike on Haret Saida, near the port city of Sidon, the ministry said, with at least seven others including a nurse and three rescuers killed in the southern village of Ain Baal, and five in Burj al-Shemali.</p> \n<p>Israel\u2019s military claimed on Sunday it had killed 70 Hezbollah fighters, and it issued a new wave of evacuation orders to villages that it said hosted Hezbollah military infrastructure.</p> \n<p>It also announced that five Israeli soldiers had been killed in the fighting in Lebanon, and another had died from wounds sustained in north Gaza.</p>",

In statements, the IDF said they had \u201celiminated over 40 terrorists\u201d in Jabaliya, and they disputed the death toll in Beit Lahiya, which they said did not align with the \u201cprecise munitions\u201d used. Israel launched a new ground and aerial offensive on northern Gaza on 6 October that it says is necessary to mop up Hamas cells that have regrouped. Sweeping evacuation orders for the 400,000 people who the UN estimates still live there, the blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as hospitals have led rights groups to accuse Israel of the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. Israel has denied it is systematically removing Palestinians from the area or using food as a weapon, both of which are illegal under international law. In a statement on Sunday, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called the plight of civilians trapped by the fighting in north Gaza \u201cunbearable\u201d. His office said: \u201cThe secretary general is shocked by the harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction in the north, with civilians trapped under rubble, the sick and wounded going without life-saving healthcare and families lacking food and shelter.\u201d The head of the Mossad, David Barnea, was expected to travel to Qatar on Sunday for meetings aimed at restarting ceasefire and hostage release negotiations. The indirect talks, mediated by Qatar, the US and Egypt, broke down after the death of Hamas\u2019s leader Ismail Haniyeh in a bombing in Iran believed to have been carried out by Israel. Hostilities with Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah have since overshadowed the peace process in Gaza. The killing of Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the 7 October 2023 attack, in the strip this month was presented by the international community as an opportunity to restart negotiations. Sinwar, who had the last word on Hamas\u2019s position, had repeatedly blocked progress towards a deal. Later on Sunday, family members of the approximately 100 Israeli hostages who remain captive in Gaza disrupted a speech by Benjamin Netanyahu at a televised memorial event for victims of the Hamas attack, forcing the Israeli prime minister to stop his address. Many in Israel blame Netanyahu for the intelligence and response failures of 7 October and accuse him of dragging his heels on a deal in Gaza to bring the hostages home for political reasons. Meanwhile, the Lebanese health ministry said that at least 21 people were killed on Sunday in Israeli strikes on three different areas in southern Lebanon. Nine people were killed and 38 wounded in a strike on Haret Saida, near the port city of Sidon, the ministry said, with at least seven others including a nurse and three rescuers killed in the southern village of Ain Baal, and five in Burj al-Shemali. Israel\u2019s military claimed on Sunday it had killed 70 Hezbollah fighters, and it issued a new wave of evacuation orders to villages that it said hosted Hezbollah military infrastructure. It also announced that five Israeli soldiers had been killed in the fighting in Lebanon, and another had died from wounds sustained in north Gaza.",

As with many of the best games, before kick-off you can make a decent case for either side being the favourite. Arsenal are at home, where they\u2019ve won 15 of the last 18 games, but they\u2019re on a downer and will be without at least three key players. Liverpool are full of the joys and have won all six away matches under Arne Slot, but they haven\u2019t really been tested in the league. Three of their away wins came against teams in the bottom four; the other was at Old Trafford.</p> <p>While Liverpool would love to make a statement of title-winning intent, it feels like an even bigger game for Arsenal \u2013 not must-win so much as mustn\u2019t-lose. It doesn\u2019t feel right that a team with sucn an outstainding Premier League record in 2024 \u2013 P26 W21 D3 L2 Pts 66 \u2013 should be under such scrutiny. But this is the life they chose, mainly to experience days like today. And they know a defiant win would end that scrutiny before sundown.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>4.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-27T15:37:34.812Z\">at 3.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s your lot for today. Thanks for your company and emails \u2013 goodnight! Bukayo Saka\u2019s reaction We\u2019re a bit disappointed. Credit to Liverpool, they\u2019re a good team, but we feel like we didn\u2019t show our best selves for the full 90 minutes. First half we showed our qualities and dominated. We gave them nothing in open play. In the second half we sat back a bit and we weren\u2019t at our best. They won more duels than us, they kept possession and then naturally the momentum was with them so we had to defend more. I hate missing games and it was really frustrating to be on the sidelines. I had this game in my mind and was going to do everything to be available. [On his goal] I tried to keep the keeper guessing. I haven\u2019t seen it back but it felt like a nice finish. I felt like I could have finished the game but the manager decided to take me off. Virgil van Dijk\u2019s reaction It\u2019s a very tough place to come, so to come back twice is a good thing. We take the point and move on. [On his goal] Thomas Partey was only looking at me, not the ball, so it was quite easy to get away from him. We kept the ball better in the second half. They pressed well in the first half but if we\u2019d kept the ball better we could have got some momentum. We didn\u2019t create loads of chances in the second half but we were much more dominant. We were trying, trying, trying and in the end it was a great goal. I think they only had two players injured today didn\u2019t they? They played a very, very strong team. [On his contract] I\u2019m very calm. Let\u2019s see what happens at the end of the season. I\u2019m enjoying my football, I feel very good physically and mentally. It\u2019s a beautiful game that we play. The updated Premier League table Gabriel Jesus was booked after the final whistle for giving the referee Anthony Taylor a mouthful. The crowd are booing, though I\u2019ve no idea why: the foul he gave against Kiwior was pretty much a 50/50 decision. Everyone\u2019s a winner. Okay, strictly speaking nobody\u2019s a winner, but when the dust settles both teams will find plenty of positives. Arsenal played with admirable defiance and took a point despite losing Gabriel and Jurrien Timber during the game. Also, Bukayo Saka. Liverpool didn\u2019t play particularlywell but twice came from behind to earn their first league point at the Emirates since 2021-22. It wasn\u2019t a great match, in truth, but the context made it compelling. 90+6 min Jesus wins a corner off Tsimikas\u2026 and the assistant gives a goalkick. The home fans aren\u2019t impressed. 90+4 min Nunez has a hack at Trossard and is booked. 90+3 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s corner is headed away really well at the near post, possibly by Kiwior. 90+2 min Gakpo wins a corner for Liverpool. Eek, a winning goal now would be a hammer blow. 90+1 min Seven minutes of added time. Liverpool have brought on Wataru Endo for Curtis Jones. 90 min Anthony Taylor whistles for a foul by Kiwior just as Havertz is about to go through on goal. Havertz keeps playing and lobs the ball over Kelleher and onto the post. Jesus follows up to score but the whistle had long gone so VAR can\u2019t get involved. 89 min \u201cBringing on the promising but untested Lewis-Skelly instead of the experienced Zinchenko was not the obvious decision, and the goal came down that side,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cArteta knows infinitely more about his players than me, but I do feel that sometimes he resists the obvious substitution, for reasons I never quite get.\u201d I can\u2019t comment on the second part, but I can promise you Zinchenko being on the field would have made no difference to the goal. 88 min The corner is headed away to Jesus on the edge of the D. He controls it on the chest, which knocks him off balance, but he still manages to stumble through a couple of challenges and rake a half-volley that is well held above his head by Kelleher. Lovely effort. 87 min Havertz teases a lovely cross over the head of Kelleher. Gabriel Jesus meets it on the volley beyond the far post but the angle is prohibitive and all he can do is win a corner off Jones. 85 min: Double substitution for Arsenal Gabriel Jesus and Ethan Nwaneri come on for Bukayo Saka, who understandably faded in the second half, and Gabriel Martinelli. 83 min Cole Palmer still wins pass of the day/season but that was still a beautiful, almost nonchalant ball from Alexander-Arnold. Arsenal broke dangerously thriugh Martinelli, who tried to run Konate and was made to realise the futility of that particular idea. The ball was moved forward Alexander-Arnold, who waved a devastating, perfectly weighted pass in behind Lewis-Skelly and Kiwior. Nunez surged onto it, in the inside-right channel, and squared for Salah to score. Salah, who criss-crossed his run with Nunez\u2019s, curled nervelessly into the far corner. Brilliant goal! Devastating stuff from Liverpool! 79 min This would such a big win for Arsenal, one that would end the external negativity at a stroke and make them feel like they can overcome any adversity. 77 min Arsenal have had some promising attacks in the last few minutes. Merino bobbles the ball across the edge of the area to Havertz, who thumps a half-volley over the bar. Difficult ball to hit. 76 min \u201cThis is where Arsenal are really missing Odegaard (and to a lesser extent, Xhaka) - he\u2019s so good at dictating tempo and his distribution and movement allows Arsenal to wrest control back, but today\u2019s midfield has no comparable passers even if a lot of quality still,\u201d says Will Vignoles. \u201cBit uncomfortable to defend all half, particularly with half a first-choice defence!\u201d 75 min: Arsenal substitution Timber is down again and has been replaced by Erling Haaland\u2019s buddy Myles Lewis-Skelly. He\u2019ll be playing against Mo Salah, who started tearing up the Premier League when Lewis-Skelly was 10 years old. 74 min Arne Slot was booked for something or other apparently. 73 min \u201cArsenal playing like they\u2019re down a man since the Gabriel injury,\u201d writes Sean Orlowicz. \u201cVery strange approach.\u201d I can see both sides! 72 min Timber goes down with cramp. He\u2019s okay to continue. 71 min Salah\u2019s outside-of-the-boot cross is clawed away by Raya but only as far as Jones, who chests the ball down and hits an early shot is crucially blocked by Partey. 70 min A tame cross-shot from Szoboszlai goes behind for a goalkick. 69 min See 67 mins. It\u2019s one-way traffic, has been for most of the second half. 67 min Arsenal were so good in the 15 minutes before half-time. Since the break: nada, zilch. Sweet bugger all. They haven\u2019t had a shot on or off target. And yet, for all Liverpool\u2019s pressure, David Raya hasn\u2019t had much to do either. 66 min David Raya is booked for timewasting. 65 min Gravenberch blooters one miles over the bar from 25 yards. 65 min It\u2019s all Liverpool now. The substitute Kiwior heads away crosses from both full-backs in the space of 30 seconds. 64 min \u201cNot a supporter of either club, but I really want Arsenal to win so they can bring out the huge cameras and Jamie Carragher cardboard cut-outs,\u201d says Dan Christmas. \u201cIf they did that they\u2019d be my second team forever.\u201d I can see both sides! 63 min: Triple substitution for Liverpool See, told you. Cody Gakpo, Dominik Szoboszlai and Kostas Tsimikas come on for Luis Diaz, Alexis Mac Allister and Andy Robertson. 62 min Liverpool are getting three players ready: Cody Gakpo, Dominik Szoboszlai and Kostas Tsimikas. 61 min Robertson\u2019s corner doesn\u2019t beat Havertz at the near post. 60 min Nunez is crowded out desperately in the Arsenal area after a good ball from Gravenberch, then Alexander-Arnold\u2019s shot deflects over the bar. Liverpool have a whiff of claret in their nostrils. 58 min Liverpool are having a good spell and have had 66 per cent of the possession since half-time. Alexander-Arnold throttles a long-range shot well wide from 25 yards. 56 min Salah is starting to liven up. He slips Timber superbly, runs from the halfway line to the edge of the area and cuts back inside onto his left foot. That slight delay is crucial because by the time he crosses the ball Diaz is offside. 55 min Arsenal\u2019s defence, from left to right, is Timber-Kiwior-White-Partey. You\u2019d have got long odds on that nine days ago. 54 min: Arsenal substitution Jakub Kiwior replaces the limping Gabriel. It looks like he got the injury when Nunez ran into the back of him at the start of the second half. 53 min Gabriel is down again, and this time it\u2019s terminal. 52 min Better from Liverpool. Salah plays a slick one-two with Mac Allister on the edge of the area, then rams a shot from an absurd angle that is pushed away by Raya. He should probably have crossed it. 51 min Diaz goes on a mazy run near the byline, past Partey and White, but then he overruns the ball and fouls David Raya. He\u2019s been the brighest of Liverpool\u2019s front three. 50 min Actually it might be Gabriel\u2019s left knee that is troubling him. Either way, he\u2019s going to try to continue. 48 min More injury woe for Arsenal: Gabriel is down with what looks like a muscle injury. Jakub Kiwior, who had a miserable time at Bournemouth last weekend, is warming up. 48 min Havertz breaks dangerously behind Robertson and slides a low cross that is well cleared by Konate. 47 min Sipke Hulshoff, Liverpool\u2019s assistant manager, has been booked. 46 min Peep peep! Arsenal begin the second half. No Saliba, no Calafiori, no Odegaard \u2013 but Arsenal have Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice and they inspired a defiant first-half performance. Saka scored a brilliant early goal; then, after Virgil van Dijk headed Liverpool level, Rice slowly took control of the midfield battle. Not content with that, he set up Mikel Merino\u2019s first goal for Arsenal with an undefendable free-kick. Liverpool had a good spell at 1-1 but have looked quite flat in attack. If it stays like this, Cody Gakpo and/or Dominik Szoboszlai will be on sooner rather than later. 45+4 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s excellent cross is met by Mac Allister, whose flicked header from 10 yards is held to his right by Raya. A difficult chance. 45+1 min There are four minutes of added time. Merino eventually headed in from six yards, which makes you wonder whether Kelleher could have come in. But Rice\u2019s cross was perfectly struck and always curling away from Kelleher, who was like a batsman being done in the flight by Noman Ali. GOAL GIVEN! Van Dijk\u2019s trailing leg was playing Merino onside. 45 min They\u2019re still checking it. 44 min There\u2019s a VAR check for offside\u2026 Merino owes a big thank you to Declan Rice, who curled a devastating free-kick into the corridor of uncertainty from a narrow position on the right. It was met by Merino, six yards out at the far post, and he powered a header past Kelleher. Mikel Merino gets his first goal for Arsenal! 41 min Arsenal are all over Liverpool at the moment. Trossard\u2019s cross from the left is headed away well by Van Dijk but Rice ensures Liverpool can\u2019t get out by winning the ball back. 41 min Underrated. 39 min Arsenal certainly have the right to feel aggrieved when Nunez gets away with flattening Saka just outside the penalty area on the right. That was a clear foul. 38 min This is an excellent spell for Arsenal, their best of the half. I think Diaz has just kicked the ball away again without being penalised. Thoughts with Twitter cranks at this difficult time. 37 min A flat, driven cross from the left is missed by Van Dijk and hits the unsighted Havertz at the far post. Had he controlled it he\u2019d have had a clear chance, though he saw it very late. 35 min Martinelli lifts a shot over the bar from the edge of the area. It came at the end of a good move that included a brilliant piece of control from Merino, who was in mid-air when he pulled down Rice\u2019s crossfield pass. It was almost a mirror image of Dennis Bergkamp\u2019s first touch against Argentina in 1998. 33 min Mac Allister is booked for a foul on Saka, who led him a merry dance before being brought down. 31 min: Penalty appeal Martinelli goes flying after a clumsy challenge from Konate and Alexander-Arnold. The ball bounces towards Havertz, who can\u2019t over the bouncing ball and swishes it over the bar. There\u2019s a VAR check but no penalty because Konate got something on the ball before sending Martinelli into outer space. It could have gone either way; had a penalty been given I\u2019m not sure it would have been overturned. 31 min \u201cMerino is left footed,\u201d says Gary Stover of the decision to play Rice on the right. True, but Rice is right footed and usually plays to the left of centre \u2013 as he did last week at Bournemouth even though Merino was on the pitch. I suspect there\u2019s another reason. 30 min \u201cRight,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI\u2019m just about to walk onto a five-a-side pitch. (My knees are not ready for this!) If nothing of import could happen for an hour or so, that would be greatly appreciated\u2026\u201d 29 min A really good break from Arsenal. Eventually Martinelli beats Alexander-Arnold and fires a dangerous early cross. It beats Saka at the near post and has too much heat for Havertz to control beyond the far post. 28 min Alexander-Arnold plays a good return ball to Salah, who tries to tee up the onrushing Jones. The pass takes a deflection, which leads to an impromptu game of pinball before Arsenal clear. It feels like Liverpool are slowly getting on top. 26 min Arsenal play on even though Mac Allister is down. He eventually gets to his feet, is booed for doing so and then gives the referee a serve. 25 min \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to recognise sarcasm in writing,\u201d says Joe Pearson, \u201cbut was your post at 5 mins a subtle reference to Partey maybe needing help against the more mobile Diaz?\u201d Ha, no it wasn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why Rice is playing there. You do sometimes have central midfielders picked specifically to help a full-back \u2013 Darren Fletcher did it superbly against Arsenal at the start of his career \u2013 but that\u2019s almost always in a 4-3-3. 24 min Saka, Arsenal\u2019s biggest threat by a distance, whips a curler over the bar from 25 yards. It\u2019s a strange thing to say, given how popular he is, but there\u2019s an argument Saka is still underrated. 22 min It was Diaz who kicked the ball away. The referee did see it; apparently the reason he wasn\u2019t booked is because he didn\u2019t delay the restart because Arsenal weren\u2019t set for the free-kick. Is that a valid reason? City weren\u2019t set when Trossard went off, surely? 20 min: Chance for Merino! Rice curls a brilliant free-kick from a deepish position on the right. It beats the men at the near post and reaches Merino, who cushions a volley well wide from six yards. At first it looked a great chance, though maybe the ball was slightly behind him. 19 min Arsenal\u2019s fans aren\u2019t happy because a Liverpool player has just kicked the ball away. I didn\u2019t see who it was; nor, more importantly, did the referee Anthony Taylor. For the second league game in a row, Arsenal have been done on a set-piece. Alexander-Arnold clipped it towards the near post, where Diaz headed it on Steve Bould-style. Van Dijk stooped in front of Partey, six yards out, and steered a header past Raya. If Virgil van Dijk was at fault for Arsenal\u2019s goal, he\u2019s back in the good books now! 16 min \u201cHello from Pittsburgh!\u201d says Eric Peterson. \u201cThe nature of this \u2018rivalry\u2019 seems defined by how much each club loathes Manchester United - it\u2019s tough to summon enmity for a club with which you have that in common. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing a game that can reveal the \u2018real\u2019 Liverpool in present time. Notable as it is to collect the results Arne Slot has, it remains true that their opponents thus far have been almost unanimously from the bottom half of the table. This game is a status check for the new Liverpool and a foreshadowing of what\u2019s in store on their league docket now that the strength-of-opposition pendulum swings against them.\u201d I think Niall\u2019s point is the key one; their success has rarely coincided. That\u2019s the basis for maybe 90 per cent of rivalries that aren\u2019t based on geography. 14 min: Chance for Salah! Mikel Merino allows the ball to run under his feet, 25 yards from goal. It rolls towards Salah, with Raya well off his line, but his first-time shot curls a few yards wide of the right-hand post. For a player of his etc, that was a chance. 11 min Gary Neville, commentating on Sky, thinks Virgil van Dijk didn\u2019t do enough to help Robertson on the goal. Even so, the way Saka slipped the ball between Robertson\u2019s legs to tee up the shot, then surprise Kelleher by whipping it past him at the near post, was lovely. Bukayo Saka has put Arsenal ahead with an outstanding goal. Ben White, playing centre-back today, clipped an excellent long pass in behind Robertson that was collected by Saka. He scurried into the area, nutmegged Robertson and whipped the ball past Kelleher at the near post. Guess who\u2019s back? 8 min The game hasn\u2019t settled down yet, though Salah almost enlivens it with a Palmerish through pass towards Diaz. Ben White makes an important interception. 7 min Van Dijk has a bit of a kick at Havertz off the ball and is penalised; he could have been booked for that. Arsenal make nothing of the free-kick. 5 min Arsenal are platying with a box midfield. The only slight change is that Declan Rice is the right-sided central midfielder; wonder why that is. 4 min There\u2019s an excellent atmosphere at the Emirates, as there has been throughout their ascent under Mikel Arteta. There\u2019s almost an underdog mentality today, with every challenge being cheered. Nowt wrong with that. 2 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s free-kick is headed on dangerously by Van Dijk and headed away by somebody in a red shirt on the six-yard line. 2 min Saka\u2019s first action is a foul on Robertson down the Liverpool left. Alexander-Arnold is over the ball\u2026 1 min Peep peep! After a performance of the Last Post, Curtis Jones gets the match underway. Liverpool, in their black change strip, are kicking from right to left as we watch. A reminder of the teams Arsenal could play Trossard deeper in a 4-3-3, though Mikel Arteta often likes a box midfield in the biggest games. Arsenal (possible 4-2-4) Raya; Partey, White, Gabriel, Timber; Merino, Rice; Saka, Havertz, Trossard, Martinelli. Substitutes: Neto, Gabriel Jesus, Kiwior, Zinchenko, Jorginho, Sterling, Lewis-Skelly, Nichols, Nwaneri. Liverpool (4-3-3) Kelleher; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson; Mac Allister, Gravenberch, Jones; Salah, Nunez, Diaz. Substitutes: Jaros, Davies, Gomez, Endo, Szoboszlai, Gakpo, Tsimikas, Quansah, Morton. Referee Anthony Taylor. And Arne Slot\u2019s Curtis [Jones] has had a week\u2019s rest so hopefully he can perform the way he did last week. You don\u2019t think about the points gap [Liverpool will go seven clear of Arsenal if they win] before a game, you think about preparing the team in the best possible way for them to perform. Sometimes it\u2019s the quality of the player that makes the difference; sometimes it\u2019s a lucky decision. Set-pieces are also important. You have to put a lot of effort in, then at the end if you get a result you can look at the points difference. Mikel Arteta\u2019s pre-match thoughts [On the return of Bukayo Saka and Jurrien Timber] They tried so hard to be available and it\u2019s a big boost for us. Injuries mean an opportunity for others and we have an unbelievable squad. A message for the crowd as well: when they come here to the Emirates they really need to feel it, and we have to play with that body language and certainty to win the game. \u201cIt\u2019s funny the lack of true rivalry between Liverpool and Arsenal,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cProbably their peaks never really coincided (\u201cit\u2019s up for grabs\u201d aside). The closest thing to enmity I can recall was after Stephane H\u00e9nchoz\u2019s goalkeeping exploits in 2001 and the fortuitous penalty in the 2008 Champions League quarter final. I guess that could change but it feels like the two clubs have an enemy in common these days.\u201d There were also three red cards in a game in August 2000, though that was more about Graham Poll than any strong rivalry. The peak is surely 1986-91, when George Graham knocked Liverpool off their perch. Liverpool had their moments too, obviously, including one of my favourite free-kicks. Chelsea 2-1 Newcastle Crystal Palace 1-0 Tottenham West Ham 2-1 Man Utd Cole Palmer, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jarrod Bowen (a 92nd-minute penalty) scored the winning goals in those games. Palmer also played one of the passes of the season so far. Chelsea\u2019s win means Arsenal drop to fifth before kick-off, though a draw would move them up to third. From the archive \u201cPhew, well I\u2019d call it the match of the century, I don\u2019t know about Match of the Day,\u201d puffed Wolstenholme pitchside after the final whistle. Colour analyst Walley Barnes \u2013 he of the late own goal in 1947 \u2013 veered awkwardly into shot to agree that \u201cmatch of the century is probably very right\u201d. Sadly, nobody who went to Anfield that day would have been able to hear these Cholmondley Warneresque jolly japes. BBC2 had only been on the air for four months, and was only available in the London area. An estimated audience of 20,000 watched history being transmitted \u2013 less than half of the day\u2019s 47,620 attendance \u2013 and viewers in Liverpool would have to make do with either The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, a western on BBC1, or ABC\u2019s western Sugarfoot. Today\u2019s multi-channel world of wall-to-wall tat suddenly doesn\u2019t seem so oppressive. Arsenal were criticised for overcelebrating after a terrific 3-1 victory over Liverpool at the Emirates in February. And they\u2019ll happily do it again if they win today. Great news for Arsenal: Bukayo Saka has recovered from his hamstring injury and will captain the side. Jurrien Timber is also fit to return, but Riccardo Calafiori hasn\u2019t made it. In all there are three changes to the side that started last weekend\u2019s defeat at Bournemouth. Saka, Timber and Gabriel Martinelli replace Calafiori, Raheem Sterling and the suspended William Saliba. It looks like Ben White will play at centre-back in Saliba\u2019s absence. Liverpool make three changes, one enforced, from the win over Chelsea last weekend. Darwin Nunez covers for the injured Diogo Jota; Luis Diaz and Alexis Mac Allister are preferred to Cody Gakpo and Dominik Szoboszlai. Arsenal (possible 4-2-4) Raya; Partey, White, Gabriel, Timber; Merino, Rice; Saka, Havertz, Trossard, Martinelli. Substitutes: Neto, Gabriel Jesus, Kiwior, Zinchenko, Jorginho, Sterling, Lewis-Skelly, Nichols, Nwaneri. Liverpool (4-3-3) Kelleher; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson; Mac Allister, Gravenberch, Jones; Salah, Nunez, Diaz. Substitutes: Jaros, Davies, Gomez, Endo, Szoboszlai, Gakpo, Tsimikas, Quansah, Morton. Referee Anthony Taylor. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Arsenal v Liverpool at the Emirates. As with many of the best games, before kick-off you can make a decent case for either side being the favourite. Arsenal are at home, where they\u2019ve won 15 of the last 18 games, but they\u2019re on a downer and will be without at least three key players. Liverpool are full of the joys and have won all six away matches under Arne Slot, but they haven\u2019t really been tested in the league. Three of their away wins came against teams in the bottom four; the other was at Old Trafford. While Liverpool would love to make a statement of title-winning intent, it feels like an even bigger game for Arsenal \u2013 not must-win so much as mustn\u2019t-lose. It doesn\u2019t feel right that a team with sucn an outstainding Premier League record in 2024 \u2013 P26 W21 D3 L2 Pts 66 \u2013 should be under such scrutiny. But this is the life they chose, mainly to experience days like today. And they know a defiant win would end that scrutiny before sundown. Kick off 4.30pm.",

Four pro-western opposition parties collectively won a total of 61 seats.</p> <p>The result thwarts the opposition\u2019s hopes for a pro-western coalition of four blocs and in effect stalls the country\u2019s aspirations for EU integration.</p> <p>Voters in the country of almost 4 million people had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/georgians-head-to-the-polls-in-pivotal-parliamentary-election\">headed to the polls</a> on Saturday in a watershed election to decide whether the increasingly authoritarian GD, which has been in power since 2012 and steered the country into a conservative course away from the west and closer to Russia, should get another four-year term.</p> <p>Bidzina Ivanishvili, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/who-is-bidzina-ivanishvili-the-shadowy-billionaire-founder-of-georgian-dream\">the shadowy billionaire founder </a>of GD, claimed victory shortly after polls closed in what has been called the most consequential election since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a rare case in the world that the same party achieves such success in such a difficult situation \u2013 this is a good indicator of the talent of the Georgian people,\u201d said Ivanishvili, widely considered to be the country\u2019s most powerful figure.</p> <p>For the past three decades, Georgia has maintained strong pro-western aspirations, with polls showing up to 80% of its people favour joining the EU. In recent years, however, the government has increasingly shifted away from the west in favour of Russia, showing reluctance to condemn Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>An international observer mission on Sunday said the conduct of the election was evidence of \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d in the country.</p> <p>A preliminary report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said it \u201cnoted reports of intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters, particularly on public sector employees and other groups, raising concerns about the ability of some voters to cast their vote without fear of retribution\u201d.</p> <p>However, it stopped short of saying the elections had been stolen or falsified \u2013 a claim the opposition reiterated on Sunday.</p> <p>On Saturday morning, several videos circulated online <a href=\"https://x.com/AlecLuhn/status/1850119143565013074\">appearing to show ballot stuffing</a> and voter intimidation at various polling stations across Georgia.</p> <p>Electoral commission data showed GD winning by suspiciously big margins of up to 90% in some rural areas, though it underperformed in bigger cities.</p> <p>Western officials have expressed concern over reports of election fraud, though they too have used cautious language and refrained from calling for a boycott of the results.

      "bodyText": "Georgia\u2019s pro-western opposition has called on the country to protest on Monday against the disputed parliamentary victory of the ruling, Russia-aligned Georgian Dream (GD) party. GD retained power in Saturday\u2019s pivotal election that dealt a significant blow to the country\u2019s long-held aspirations for EU membership, amid allegations of voter intimidation and coercion. The opposition refused to concede defeat and accused the ruling party of a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d, setting the stage for a potential political crisis that could further polarise the Caucasus country. At a press conference organised by the opposition on Sunday evening, Georgia\u2019s pro-EU president, Salome Zourabichvili, declared that she did not recognise the election results and asserted that the country had fallen victim to a \u201cRussian special operation\u201d. Zourabichvili, whose role is largely ceremonial, called on Georgians to protest against the results on Monday evening. \u201cThis was a total rigging, a total robbery of your votes,\u201d she said. The electoral commission announced on Sunday that GD secured 54% of the vote, winning 89 seats in the parliament \u2013 one fewer than in 2020. Four pro-western opposition parties collectively won a total of 61 seats. The result thwarts the opposition\u2019s hopes for a pro-western coalition of four blocs and in effect stalls the country\u2019s aspirations for EU integration. Voters in the country of almost 4 million people had headed to the polls on Saturday in a watershed election to decide whether the increasingly authoritarian GD, which has been in power since 2012 and steered the country into a conservative course away from the west and closer to Russia, should get another four-year term. Bidzina Ivanishvili, the shadowy billionaire founder of GD, claimed victory shortly after polls closed in what has been called the most consequential election since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. \u201cIt is a rare case in the world that the same party achieves such success in such a difficult situation \u2013 this is a good indicator of the talent of the Georgian people,\u201d said Ivanishvili, widely considered to be the country\u2019s most powerful figure. For the past three decades, Georgia has maintained strong pro-western aspirations, with polls showing up to 80% of its people favour joining the EU. In recent years, however, the government has increasingly shifted away from the west in favour of Russia, showing reluctance to condemn Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. An international observer mission on Sunday said the conduct of the election was evidence of \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d in the country. A preliminary report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said it \u201cnoted reports of intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters, particularly on public sector employees and other groups, raising concerns about the ability of some voters to cast their vote without fear of retribution\u201d. However, it stopped short of saying the elections had been stolen or falsified \u2013 a claim the opposition reiterated on Sunday. On Saturday morning, several videos circulated online appearing to show ballot stuffing and voter intimidation at various polling stations across Georgia. Electoral commission data showed GD winning by suspiciously big margins of up to 90% in some rural areas, though it underperformed in bigger cities. Western officials have expressed concern over reports of election fraud, though they too have used cautious language and refrained from calling for a boycott of the results. The European Council president, Charles Michel, on Sunday pushed for a swift and transparent investigation into alleged irregularities during the election. US secretary of state Antony Blinken joined calls from observers for a full probe into reports of election-related violations. \u201cGoing forward, we encourage Georgia\u2019s political leaders to respect the rule of law, repeal legislation that undermines fundamental freedoms, and address deficiencies in the electoral process together,\u201d Blinken said in a statement. It remains unclear if the opposition will be able to galvanise enough support in the coming days. Last spring, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Tbilisi to protest a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that critics argued was designed to stifle the country\u2019s media and NGOs. Those protests gradually faded after a police crackdown and a series of arrests. The election result suggests GD retains support from a core group of Georgian voters, particularly in industrial heartlands and conservative, poorer regions where economic progress has been slow and the appeal of Europe feels distant and faint. GD received congratulations from several foreign leaders including Hungary\u2019s hard-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a longtime ally of Ivanishvili, who is scheduled to visit Tbilisi on Tuesday. GD has been accused by critics at home and abroad of plans to move the country in an authoritarian direction after Ivanishvili vowed to ban all the leading opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers if his party was re-elected. The party was facing an unprecedented union of four pro-western opposition forces that had vowed to form a coalition government to oust it from power and put Georgia back on track to join the EU. The biggest opposition force is the centre-right UNM, a party founded by Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president who is in prison on charges of abuse of power that his allies say are politically motivated. From jail, Saakashvili called on Georgians to take the streets. In the aftermath of the elections, voters in Tbilisi seemed divided over the country\u2019s future course. Ana Machaidze, a 25-year-old student, said: \u201cWe have lost our country today. I don\u2019t know what to do next. I hope we can take to the streets, but if we lose, maybe I will live abroad.\u201d Support for the pro-western opposition groups generally came from urban and younger voters, who envision their political future with the EU. Irakli Shengelia, 56, a restaurant worker, said he was glad GD would remain in power because the party guaranteed \u201cpeace and stability\u201d with Russia. The government, aligned with the deeply conservative and influential Orthodox church, has sought to galvanise anti-liberal sentiments by campaigning on \u201cfamily values\u201d and criticising what it portrays as western excesses. In the summer, the parliament passed legislation imposing sweeping restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights \u2013 a move that critics say mirrored laws enacted in neighbouring Russia, where authorities have implemented a series of repressive measures against sexual minorities. In Russia, the election results were widely welcomed. As the results trickled in, state propaganda celebrated the outcome, with Margarita Simonyan, the influential editor-in-chief of the state media outlet RT, declaring that \u201cthe Georgians had won\u201d.",

England are desperate to pick him in their midfield against New Zealand if possible and the chances of him performing some kind of role against the All Blacks have duly been enhanced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/27/england-call-up-three-players-for-new-zealand-after-flurry-of-withdrawals\">England call up three players for New Zealand after flurry of withdrawals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A six-day turnaround is far from ideal but Slade stressed afterwards that he would be available for selection. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting week,\u201d the 31-year-old said. \u201cI look forward to putting my best foot forward and hopefully I\u2019m involved.\u201d</p> <p>Exeter\u2019s director of rugby also confirmed Slade had reported no post\u2011match problems with his shoulder. Rob Baxter said: \u201cFor a guy who\u2019s been out as long as he has, he looked pretty good, didn\u2019t he? He got some good game minutes into him and he\u2019s come off without injury. He looked a little bit rusty but that\u2019s to be expected.\u201d</p> <p>All is certainly not fine and dandy with Exeter, though, their confidence clearly sapped by a depressing start to the season. With a third of the campaign over they have yet to win and this game was a microcosm of their campaign to date. With his side worryingly porous in the first half and outgunned at the breakdown, Baxter made no attempt to sugar the pill. \u201cThe truth is we look a little stuck in the headlights. We\u2019ve got a lot of hard work to get done. Soul-searching is not the right word but we\u2019ve got a lot of manning up and standing up to do.\u201d</p> <p>Following their gruesome defeat at Newcastle last time out, only four players retained the same jersey number they wore at Kingston Park. Not since the 2013-14 season had they lost five successive league games in the same season while Quins had not won in Devon for a decade.</p> <p>Defensively, though, Exeter were all over the place in a helter\u2011skelter first half. Quins had three tries on the board inside 25 minutes and could easily have had two or three more. The visitors found ominous space both out wide and increasingly through the middle, and the relative hush around the ground for lengthy periods spoke volumes.</p>    <p>Slade and Olly Woodburn had already been required to make last\u2011ditch try-saving tackles before Oscar Beard opened the scoring for Quins and, after a sharp response from the athletic Ross Vintcent, Exeter endured a truly nightmarish few minutes. No sooner had the impressive Argentinian Rodrigo Isgr\u00f3 smashed past Woodburn to score than Quins were surging through another huge midfield hole and Will Evans, guilty of butchering a clear chance earlier, was poaching the first of his two tries.</p> <p>Even without their England contingent Quins were creating plenty and 25 missed Exeter tackles inside the first half-hour reinforced the creeping sense of local unease. It was a considerable bonus then when Exeter did finally exert pressure with ball in hand and their hard-running inside-centre Will Rigg, who was representing Coventry in the Championship last season, surged straight ahead to ensure his side trailed by only five points at the interval.</p> <p>It hardly required a psychology degree to foresee some pretty blunt messages being delivered in the home dressing room at half-time with the defence coach, Omar Mouneimne, understandably animated. Exeter\u2019s game is based around certain non\u2011negotiables and 12 clean breaks by a supposedly below-strength Quins in the opening 40 minutes underlined the collective lack of cohesion.</p> <p>Suitably reminded of their responsibilities, the hosts came close to scoring in the left corner through Paul Brown-Bampoe and received a huge slice of fortune when a spectacular try finished by Tyrone Green was ruled out for a forward pass by Quins\u2019 captain, Cadan Murley, in the buildup.</p> <p>Their luck was about to change, however, as a low pass rebounded off James Chisholm\u2019s shin and wrongfooted the Chiefs\u2019 defence to allow Evans to snaffle his second try and secure a try bonus point. A penalty from the quietly excellent Jarrod Evans stretched the gap to 10 points and, with Chiefs down to 14 men after the departure of a limping Woodburn, a late try for Murley completed a notable Quins away day.</p>",

England are desperate to pick him in their midfield against New Zealand if possible and the chances of him performing some kind of role against the All Blacks have duly been enhanced. A six-day turnaround is far from ideal but Slade stressed afterwards that he would be available for selection. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting week,\u201d the 31-year-old said. \u201cI look forward to putting my best foot forward and hopefully I\u2019m involved.\u201d Exeter\u2019s director of rugby also confirmed Slade had reported no post\u2011match problems with his shoulder. Rob Baxter said: \u201cFor a guy who\u2019s been out as long as he has, he looked pretty good, didn\u2019t he? He got some good game minutes into him and he\u2019s come off without injury. He looked a little bit rusty but that\u2019s to be expected.\u201d All is certainly not fine and dandy with Exeter, though, their confidence clearly sapped by a depressing start to the season. With a third of the campaign over they have yet to win and this game was a microcosm of their campaign to date. With his side worryingly porous in the first half and outgunned at the breakdown, Baxter made no attempt to sugar the pill. \u201cThe truth is we look a little stuck in the headlights. We\u2019ve got a lot of hard work to get done. Soul-searching is not the right word but we\u2019ve got a lot of manning up and standing up to do.\u201d Following their gruesome defeat at Newcastle last time out, only four players retained the same jersey number they wore at Kingston Park. Not since the 2013-14 season had they lost five successive league games in the same season while Quins had not won in Devon for a decade. Defensively, though, Exeter were all over the place in a helter\u2011skelter first half. Quins had three tries on the board inside 25 minutes and could easily have had two or three more. The visitors found ominous space both out wide and increasingly through the middle, and the relative hush around the ground for lengthy periods spoke volumes. Slade and Olly Woodburn had already been required to make last\u2011ditch try-saving tackles before Oscar Beard opened the scoring for Quins and, after a sharp response from the athletic Ross Vintcent, Exeter endured a truly nightmarish few minutes. No sooner had the impressive Argentinian Rodrigo Isgr\u00f3 smashed past Woodburn to score than Quins were surging through another huge midfield hole and Will Evans, guilty of butchering a clear chance earlier, was poaching the first of his two tries. Even without their England contingent Quins were creating plenty and 25 missed Exeter tackles inside the first half-hour reinforced the creeping sense of local unease. It was a considerable bonus then when Exeter did finally exert pressure with ball in hand and their hard-running inside-centre Will Rigg, who was representing Coventry in the Championship last season, surged straight ahead to ensure his side trailed by only five points at the interval. It hardly required a psychology degree to foresee some pretty blunt messages being delivered in the home dressing room at half-time with the defence coach, Omar Mouneimne, understandably animated. Exeter\u2019s game is based around certain non\u2011negotiables and 12 clean breaks by a supposedly below-strength Quins in the opening 40 minutes underlined the collective lack of cohesion. Suitably reminded of their responsibilities, the hosts came close to scoring in the left corner through Paul Brown-Bampoe and received a huge slice of fortune when a spectacular try finished by Tyrone Green was ruled out for a forward pass by Quins\u2019 captain, Cadan Murley, in the buildup. Their luck was about to change, however, as a low pass rebounded off James Chisholm\u2019s shin and wrongfooted the Chiefs\u2019 defence to allow Evans to snaffle his second try and secure a try bonus point. A penalty from the quietly excellent Jarrod Evans stretched the gap to 10 points and, with Chiefs down to 14 men after the departure of a limping Woodburn, a late try for Murley completed a notable Quins away day.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog is to publish a detailed breakdown of the \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d that Labour says it inherited after Rachel Reeves presents the budget on Wednesday. The Office for Budget Responsibility will release the conclusion of its review of how the forecast for departmental spending for its last economic and fiscal outlook, published for the March budget, was prepared. The review has examined whether the information and assurances provided to the OBR by the Treasury regarding departmental expenditure limits ahead of the Conservatives\u2019 final budget before the general election were adequate. The review could help to clear up whether Labour was left, as Reeves claims, with a \u00a322bn shortfall in funding to pay for public services this year. Jeremy Hunt, the former Conservative chancellor, has protested about the OBR\u2019s plan to publish the review on Wednesday, calling it \u201ca surprise and a significant concern\u201d. Hunt, who claimed in July that the \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d was nonsense, said he had not been contacted by the watchdog or the Treasury about the review, even though he was running the finance ministry until the election in early July. \u201cAs this covers my time as chancellor, as a matter of procedural fairness I would have expected to have been fully engaged with throughout the review and given the chance to address any criticisms made,\u201d Hunt told the OBR chief, Richard Hughes, in a letter on Friday. Hunt argues that the OBR is breaching the principle of political impartiality by releasing its work on budget day. \u201cI had serious concerns about the way the report was announced on 29th July, done with no prior notice at the same time as a highly political statement from the chancellor of the exchequer in the House of Commons. The comments alongside that announcement gave the impression the OBR had prejudged the outcome,\u201d Hunt said in his letter, published by the OBR on Sunday. Hughes insisted the OBR\u2019s findings and recommendations solely concerned the institutional relationship between it and the Treasury. \u201cIt does not disclose advice provided to ministers nor comment on, or refer to, the conduct or decisions of ministers,\u201d Hughes told Hunt in a letter on Sunday. The OBR is also declining to share the contents of its review with the opposition prior to publication, citing the \u201cpossible market sensitivity\u201d of some of the information contained within it. Reeves is expected to blame spending cuts and tax rises in the budget on the need to patch up the \u201cblack hole\u201d, having already abolished the winter fuel allowance for wealthier pensioners to help plug the gap.",

      "body": "<p>The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court allegedly responded to a formal complaint of sexual misconduct by trying to persuade the alleged victim to deny the claims, the Guardian has been told.</p> <p>Multiple ICC staff with knowledge of the allegations against Karim Khan said the prosecutor and another official close to him repeatedly urged the woman to disavow claims about his behaviour towards her.</p> <p>The alleged attempts to deter the woman from formally pursuing the claims took place in phone calls and in person, and came after Khan learned court authorities had been made aware of allegations of misconduct, four sources said.</p> <p>At the time, the chief prosecutor had been advised to avoid one-on-one contact with the alleged victim after an aborted internal inquiry into the matter.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian for comment, Khan denied asking the woman to withdraw any allegations. His lawyers said: \u201cOur client denies the whole of the allegations and we are most concerned the exposure of a confidential and closed internal matter is designed to undermine his high-profile ongoing work at a delicate time.\u201d</p> <p>After reports of alleged sexual misconduct began to circulate in the media in recent days, Khan denied the claims in a public statement that said he and the court had been \u201csubject to a wide range of attacks and threats\u201d. In anonymous briefings, court officials close to the prosecutor have suggested he may have been the target of a smear campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no truth to suggestions of such misconduct,\u201d Khan\u2019s statement said. \u201cI have worked in diverse contexts for 30 years and there has never been such a complaint lodged against me by anyone.\u201d</p> <p>The woman at the heart of the allegations \u2013 who ICC colleagues describe as a well-regarded lawyer in her 30s who worked directly for Khan \u2013 has declined requests for comment.</p> <p>But multiple sources familiar with the situation said she told colleagues she declined the alleged requests to disavow the claims. She believed the alleged approaches by Khan and another ICC official were part of an attempt to make her say that the claims against the prosecutor had been fabricated, the sources added.</p> <p>According to a document seen by the Guardian, the accusations against Khan, 54, include unwanted sexual touching and \u201cabuse\u201d over an extended period. They include an alleged incident in which he is said to have \u201cpressed his tongue\u201d into the woman\u2019s ear. Khan denies such allegations of misconduct.</p> <p>Four ICC sources familiar with the allegations said they also include coercive sexual behaviour and abuse of authority.</p> <p>The Guardian has interviewed 11 current and former ICC officials familiar with the case, as well as diplomatic sources and friends of the alleged victim. All declined to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the allegations, or because they wanted to protect the woman.</p> <p>Multiple sources said misreporting about the allegations and efforts to politicise the situation have been deeply distressing for the woman, who is said to have initially held back on pursuing a complaint against Khan over concerns about reprisals, and fears it could be exploited by Israel or opponents of the court.</p> <p>Sources who know the alleged victim said she has been left traumatised by the situation and is \u201cexperiencing severe emotional distress\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe never wanted any of this,\u201d one person close to her said. \u201cBut the complaint filed against her wishes, followed by Khan\u2019s denials and attempts to suppress the allegations, have forced her into a very difficult position.\u201d</p> <p>The public emergence of the allegations comes at an intensely sensitive moment for the ICC, a court of last resort that prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities.</p> <p>A panel of three ICC judges is weighing politically explosive requests by Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza.</p> <p>The ICC, which is headquartered in The Hague, now faces an unprecedented crisis amid growing internal strife over the handling of the allegations and apparent attempts by the court\u2019s opponents to weaponise them.</p> <p>Critics of the court have seized upon the allegations, which Khan<strong> </strong>first learned about weeks before his announcement in May requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, his defence minister and three Hamas leaders.</p> <p>Khan has stopped short of explicitly accusing Israel of being behind the allegations, but in his statement denying misconduct he noted that he and the court have been the target of \u201ca wide range of recent attacks and threats\u201d in recent months.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed earlier this year how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/28/spying-hacking-intimidation-israel-war-icc-exposed\">Israel\u2019s intelligence agencies ran a decade-long campaign against the ICC</a> that included threats and attempts to smear senior staff. Against this backdrop, ICC officials close to Khan are strongly hinting the allegations may be part of a smear campaign by Israel.</p> <p>However, in a months-long investigation into the allegations against Khan, the Guardian has found no evidence that Israel, or any other country, had any involvement in the underlying allegations \u2013 although there does appear to have been a subsequent effort by anonymous actors to brief journalists and post leaks online.</p> <h2><strong>Online leaks</strong></h2> <p>Last week, as leaks about Khan\u2019s alleged conduct began to appear, press reports and social media posts minimised and misconstrued the allegations, according to sources familiar with the alleged victim\u2019s accounts.</p> <p>References to allegations contained within a report by a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d, they said, included inaccuracies. Several media organisations received, and then published, the same incomplete information.</p> <p>The Guardian can reveal a more detailed picture of the allegations and of the complex sequence of events that ultimately led to aspects of the claims leaking online and into the pages of rightwing media outlets.</p> <p>According to three sources familiar with the situation, the allegations of sexual misconduct relate to Khan\u2019s behaviour towards the woman between a period of approximately April 2023 and April 2024.</p> <p>\u201cThe allegations do not relate to a single or a couple of incidents, but misconduct taking place over a period of several months,\u201d one ICC source said.</p> <p>The alleged victim told colleagues that, after initial concerns about how Khan had sought to hold her hand while on a work trip in London, the prosecutor is alleged to have made repeated attempts to initiate unwanted sexual contact.</p> <p>The alleged incidents are said to have escalated over time and occurred in his office at the ICC\u2019s headquarters, in hotel rooms on overseas work trips, as well as at his home in The Hague.</p> <p>Three sources said the woman reported to colleagues detailed descriptions of alleged unwanted sexual touching, including occasions when Khan would allegedly grope her and put his tongue in her ear.</p> <p>According to an ICC document describing the allegations, she reported that she tried to make excuses to avoid being alone with Khan, but attempts to distance herself from him would lead to negative consequences in the workplace.</p> <p>After returning from an overseas work trip with the prosecutor in April, the woman spoke in confidence to two close colleagues after they noticed she was upset and gave a detailed account of Khan\u2019s alleged conduct.</p> <p>The alleged victim told colleagues at the time that she was reluctant to pursue a formal complaint as she feared that doing so could have negative consequences for her, her family and the work of the international court.</p> <p>Within days of confiding in the two colleagues, however, Khan and the ICC\u2019s independent oversight mechanism (IOM), a watchdog that investigates alleged misconduct, had been made aware of the claims.</p> <p>Khan was told one evening in early May that serious allegations would soon be shared with the IOM when a small group of staff from his office approached him, according to multiple people familiar with the events.</p> <p>The meeting, which took place at Khan\u2019s home in The Hague, occurred without the woman\u2019s knowledge or consent. \u201cThe alleged victim was kept in the dark,\u201d one source said.</p> <h2><strong>Investigation</strong></h2> <p>Three days after Khan was given advance warning of the allegations, IOM investigators hastily summoned the alleged victim to a hotel in The Hague, informing her they had received a report of alleged misconduct.</p> <p>According to a record of the meeting, the woman told investigators she had been blind-sided by their approach and had serious concerns about their handling of the situation.</p> <p>ICC sources said the alleged victim had previously expressed concerns about the competence of the IOM, a body that was not wholly trusted by female staff at the court.</p> <p>Two days after meeting with the alleged victim, the IOM decided against opening a full investigation into the claims. The body recently said in its annual report the woman \u201cdeclined to pursue a formal complaint\u201d even after it was suggested an investigation could be \u201creferred to an external entity\u201d.</p> <p>However, records relating to the investigation seen by the Guardian suggest the woman agreed to meet the IOM for a second time, shortly before investigators closed the matter. An external investigation was not offered at that stage, the records suggest.</p> <p>In a recent statement about the IOM investigation, the court\u2019s governing body said that, following a conversation with the alleged victim, \u201cthe IOM was not in a position to proceed with an investigation at that stage. Measures to safeguard everyone\u2019s rights were recommended\u201d.</p> <p>Two sources said those recommendations, which were sent to Khan in writing, included that he minimise contact with the woman and avoid spending time with her alone, at night or while travelling on work trips.</p> <p>However, after the alleged victim returned to work, the prosecutor discussed the situation with her in several in-person meetings and calls, sources said. Another official within his office also encouraged her to distance herself from the claims, telling her that Khan was \u201cvery scared\u201d and \u201cnervous\u201d the allegations would eventually leak.</p> <p>Between May and September, according to three sources, Khan and the other official close to him encouraged the alleged victim to write a letter disavowing the allegations against the prosecutor.</p> <p>At one stage, the official is said to have told her that if she wrote such a letter it would normalise her working relationship with the prosecutor. He allegedly advised her to state in writing: \u201cI have never said this. He never assaulted me\u201d.</p> <p>The official is understood to dispute the suggestion he discussed the matter with the alleged victim. Lawyers for Khan also denied the episode. \u201cWe confirm that neither our client, nor any person acting on his behalf, or who reports to him, asked for any such letter to be written, nor did they ask the person to withdraw any allegations,\u201d they said.</p> <p>\u201cOur client has fully complied with internal processes and allowed these matters to be handled in an impartial manner by authorities independent of him.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018New theory\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Last week, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board, which adopts a conservative and pro-Israel line, published a leak of information about the allegations based on the questionable \u201cwhistleblower\u201d report that has been circulated to the media.</p> <p>The newspaper speculated on what it called \u201ca new theory\u201d: that Khan sought arrest warrants against Netanyahu to divert attention from sexual misconduct allegations that threatened to precipitate his resignation.</p> <p>One official with knowledge of the ICC\u2019s Palestine investigation described that suggestion as \u201cinaccurate\u201d. Another well-placed source pointed out that the key decisions to seek arrest warrants for senior Israeli and Hamas figures had already been made by the time Khan was informed of the misconduct complaint.</p> <p>By that stage, the source said, applications for the warrants were already in the process of being drafted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations.contact%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations.contact%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.me%2F%23p%2F%2B447721857348%22%3ESignal%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447721857348%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207721%20857%20348.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

Last week, the ICC\u2019s staff union called for a \u201cprompt, independent investigation led by an external panel free from any potential conflict of interest\u201d.</p> <p>Khan has said he would be willing, if asked, to cooperate with a new inquiry.</p> <p>In a statement, a spokesperson for his office added: \u201cIt is essential, in particular in the context in which the [prosecutor] is presently operating, that any reports of this nature are addressed in a formal independent process, protecting the rights of all persons.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, the Associated Press reported the woman at the centre of the allegations is now in touch with the assembly of states parties (ASP), the court\u2019s governing body which has the ultimate say about Khan\u2019s future.

      "bodyText": "The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court allegedly responded to a formal complaint of sexual misconduct by trying to persuade the alleged victim to deny the claims, the Guardian has been told. Multiple ICC staff with knowledge of the allegations against Karim Khan said the prosecutor and another official close to him repeatedly urged the woman to disavow claims about his behaviour towards her. The alleged attempts to deter the woman from formally pursuing the claims took place in phone calls and in person, and came after Khan learned court authorities had been made aware of allegations of misconduct, four sources said. At the time, the chief prosecutor had been advised to avoid one-on-one contact with the alleged victim after an aborted internal inquiry into the matter. Contacted by the Guardian for comment, Khan denied asking the woman to withdraw any allegations. His lawyers said: \u201cOur client denies the whole of the allegations and we are most concerned the exposure of a confidential and closed internal matter is designed to undermine his high-profile ongoing work at a delicate time.\u201d After reports of alleged sexual misconduct began to circulate in the media in recent days, Khan denied the claims in a public statement that said he and the court had been \u201csubject to a wide range of attacks and threats\u201d. In anonymous briefings, court officials close to the prosecutor have suggested he may have been the target of a smear campaign. \u201cThere is no truth to suggestions of such misconduct,\u201d Khan\u2019s statement said. \u201cI have worked in diverse contexts for 30 years and there has never been such a complaint lodged against me by anyone.\u201d The woman at the heart of the allegations \u2013 who ICC colleagues describe as a well-regarded lawyer in her 30s who worked directly for Khan \u2013 has declined requests for comment. But multiple sources familiar with the situation said she told colleagues she declined the alleged requests to disavow the claims. She believed the alleged approaches by Khan and another ICC official were part of an attempt to make her say that the claims against the prosecutor had been fabricated, the sources added. According to a document seen by the Guardian, the accusations against Khan, 54, include unwanted sexual touching and \u201cabuse\u201d over an extended period. They include an alleged incident in which he is said to have \u201cpressed his tongue\u201d into the woman\u2019s ear. Khan denies such allegations of misconduct. Four ICC sources familiar with the allegations said they also include coercive sexual behaviour and abuse of authority. The Guardian has interviewed 11 current and former ICC officials familiar with the case, as well as diplomatic sources and friends of the alleged victim. All declined to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the allegations, or because they wanted to protect the woman. Multiple sources said misreporting about the allegations and efforts to politicise the situation have been deeply distressing for the woman, who is said to have initially held back on pursuing a complaint against Khan over concerns about reprisals, and fears it could be exploited by Israel or opponents of the court. Sources who know the alleged victim said she has been left traumatised by the situation and is \u201cexperiencing severe emotional distress\u201d. \u201cShe never wanted any of this,\u201d one person close to her said. \u201cBut the complaint filed against her wishes, followed by Khan\u2019s denials and attempts to suppress the allegations, have forced her into a very difficult position.\u201d The public emergence of the allegations comes at an intensely sensitive moment for the ICC, a court of last resort that prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities. A panel of three ICC judges is weighing politically explosive requests by Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza. The ICC, which is headquartered in The Hague, now faces an unprecedented crisis amid growing internal strife over the handling of the allegations and apparent attempts by the court\u2019s opponents to weaponise them. Critics of the court have seized upon the allegations, which Khan first learned about weeks before his announcement in May requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, his defence minister and three Hamas leaders. Khan has stopped short of explicitly accusing Israel of being behind the allegations, but in his statement denying misconduct he noted that he and the court have been the target of \u201ca wide range of recent attacks and threats\u201d in recent months. The Guardian revealed earlier this year how Israel\u2019s intelligence agencies ran a decade-long campaign against the ICC that included threats and attempts to smear senior staff. Against this backdrop, ICC officials close to Khan are strongly hinting the allegations may be part of a smear campaign by Israel. However, in a months-long investigation into the allegations against Khan, the Guardian has found no evidence that Israel, or any other country, had any involvement in the underlying allegations \u2013 although there does appear to have been a subsequent effort by anonymous actors to brief journalists and post leaks online. Online leaks Last week, as leaks about Khan\u2019s alleged conduct began to appear, press reports and social media posts minimised and misconstrued the allegations, according to sources familiar with the alleged victim\u2019s accounts. References to allegations contained within a report by a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d, they said, included inaccuracies. Several media organisations received, and then published, the same incomplete information. The Guardian can reveal a more detailed picture of the allegations and of the complex sequence of events that ultimately led to aspects of the claims leaking online and into the pages of rightwing media outlets. According to three sources familiar with the situation, the allegations of sexual misconduct relate to Khan\u2019s behaviour towards the woman between a period of approximately April 2023 and April 2024. \u201cThe allegations do not relate to a single or a couple of incidents, but misconduct taking place over a period of several months,\u201d one ICC source said. The alleged victim told colleagues that, after initial concerns about how Khan had sought to hold her hand while on a work trip in London, the prosecutor is alleged to have made repeated attempts to initiate unwanted sexual contact. The alleged incidents are said to have escalated over time and occurred in his office at the ICC\u2019s headquarters, in hotel rooms on overseas work trips, as well as at his home in The Hague. Three sources said the woman reported to colleagues detailed descriptions of alleged unwanted sexual touching, including occasions when Khan would allegedly grope her and put his tongue in her ear. According to an ICC document describing the allegations, she reported that she tried to make excuses to avoid being alone with Khan, but attempts to distance herself from him would lead to negative consequences in the workplace. After returning from an overseas work trip with the prosecutor in April, the woman spoke in confidence to two close colleagues after they noticed she was upset and gave a detailed account of Khan\u2019s alleged conduct. The alleged victim told colleagues at the time that she was reluctant to pursue a formal complaint as she feared that doing so could have negative consequences for her, her family and the work of the international court. Within days of confiding in the two colleagues, however, Khan and the ICC\u2019s independent oversight mechanism (IOM), a watchdog that investigates alleged misconduct, had been made aware of the claims. Khan was told one evening in early May that serious allegations would soon be shared with the IOM when a small group of staff from his office approached him, according to multiple people familiar with the events. The meeting, which took place at Khan\u2019s home in The Hague, occurred without the woman\u2019s knowledge or consent. \u201cThe alleged victim was kept in the dark,\u201d one source said. Investigation Three days after Khan was given advance warning of the allegations, IOM investigators hastily summoned the alleged victim to a hotel in The Hague, informing her they had received a report of alleged misconduct. According to a record of the meeting, the woman told investigators she had been blind-sided by their approach and had serious concerns about their handling of the situation. ICC sources said the alleged victim had previously expressed concerns about the competence of the IOM, a body that was not wholly trusted by female staff at the court. Two days after meeting with the alleged victim, the IOM decided against opening a full investigation into the claims. The body recently said in its annual report the woman \u201cdeclined to pursue a formal complaint\u201d even after it was suggested an investigation could be \u201creferred to an external entity\u201d. However, records relating to the investigation seen by the Guardian suggest the woman agreed to meet the IOM for a second time, shortly before investigators closed the matter. An external investigation was not offered at that stage, the records suggest. In a recent statement about the IOM investigation, the court\u2019s governing body said that, following a conversation with the alleged victim, \u201cthe IOM was not in a position to proceed with an investigation at that stage. Measures to safeguard everyone\u2019s rights were recommended\u201d. Two sources said those recommendations, which were sent to Khan in writing, included that he minimise contact with the woman and avoid spending time with her alone, at night or while travelling on work trips. However, after the alleged victim returned to work, the prosecutor discussed the situation with her in several in-person meetings and calls, sources said. Another official within his office also encouraged her to distance herself from the claims, telling her that Khan was \u201cvery scared\u201d and \u201cnervous\u201d the allegations would eventually leak. Between May and September, according to three sources, Khan and the other official close to him encouraged the alleged victim to write a letter disavowing the allegations against the prosecutor. At one stage, the official is said to have told her that if she wrote such a letter it would normalise her working relationship with the prosecutor. He allegedly advised her to state in writing: \u201cI have never said this. He never assaulted me\u201d. The official is understood to dispute the suggestion he discussed the matter with the alleged victim. Lawyers for Khan also denied the episode. \u201cWe confirm that neither our client, nor any person acting on his behalf, or who reports to him, asked for any such letter to be written, nor did they ask the person to withdraw any allegations,\u201d they said. \u201cOur client has fully complied with internal processes and allowed these matters to be handled in an impartial manner by authorities independent of him.\u201d \u2018New theory\u2019 Last week, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board, which adopts a conservative and pro-Israel line, published a leak of information about the allegations based on the questionable \u201cwhistleblower\u201d report that has been circulated to the media. The newspaper speculated on what it called \u201ca new theory\u201d: that Khan sought arrest warrants against Netanyahu to divert attention from sexual misconduct allegations that threatened to precipitate his resignation. One official with knowledge of the ICC\u2019s Palestine investigation described that suggestion as \u201cinaccurate\u201d. Another well-placed source pointed out that the key decisions to seek arrest warrants for senior Israeli and Hamas figures had already been made by the time Khan was informed of the misconduct complaint. By that stage, the source said, applications for the warrants were already in the process of being drafted. Multiple current and former ICC officials expressed concerns that Israel and its allies would seek to exploit the controversy surrounding the embattled chief prosecutor, with little regard for due process for the woman at the centre of the situation. Many staff within the court are understood to be supportive of Khan\u2019s decision to request the arrest warrants and applauded him for asserting the independence of the court in the face of significant political pressure. But many in the same workforce also have deep concerns about the accusations he is facing and the court\u2019s handling of the situation. Last week, the ICC\u2019s staff union called for a \u201cprompt, independent investigation led by an external panel free from any potential conflict of interest\u201d. Khan has said he would be willing, if asked, to cooperate with a new inquiry. In a statement, a spokesperson for his office added: \u201cIt is essential, in particular in the context in which the [prosecutor] is presently operating, that any reports of this nature are addressed in a formal independent process, protecting the rights of all persons.\u201d On Friday, the Associated Press reported the woman at the centre of the allegations is now in touch with the assembly of states parties (ASP), the court\u2019s governing body which has the ultimate say about Khan\u2019s future. A diplomatic source said the ASP had yet to initiate a new investigation. That investigation may be the next step in the process, resulting in Khan facing a second formal inquiry that would be expected to question the prosecutor and alleged victim about the allegations, and conduct other investigative work, prior to reaching any conclusion about Khan\u2019s innocence or guilt. In a statement issued last week, the ASP\u2019s president, P\u00e4ivi Kaukoranta, said \u201cany reports of misconduct are taken very seriously\u201d. She asked people to respect the integrity and confidentiality of internal processes, \u201cincluding any further possible steps as necessary\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The marketing gurus had billed this autumn series between England and Samoa as a chance for revenge given what happened in an extraordinary Rugby League World Cup semi-final two years ago, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/12/samoas-stephen-crichton-breaks-england-hearts-with-golden-drop-goal\">Samoa stunned Shaun Wane\u2019s side</a> in extra time at the Emirates Stadium.</p> <p>The reality, however, is that this two-match series is not about looking back for England but rather looking forward to the next World Cup. To that end, this was another successful tick in the box for a side who will be largely unchanged when the tournament kicks off in Australia in two years\u2019 time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/27/victor-radley-england-samoa-rugby-league\">Victor Radley: \u2018I love coming to England. Every year gets better\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The hosts were ultimately too good for the touring Samoans, who trailed 16-6 at half-time and could have no complaints about the fact they need to win in Leeds next weekend to square the series. They, too, will have hopes of success in the 2026 World Cup after reaching the final in England last time out, given how they are littered with National Rugby League superstars.</p> <p>Here, though, there were still simmering tensions from 2022. That was evident before a ball had been kicked, with Samoa\u2019s spine\u2011tingling Siva Tau war dance leading to the Hull KR half-back Mikey Lewis and the Manly Sea Eagles\u2019 Gordon Chan Kum Tong going head-to-head.</p> <p>When the action began, it was England who were the superior of the two teams. Led by another imperious display from their captain, George Williams, there was a lot to like about what Wane\u2019s side delivered: even if his post-match assessment was not exactly glowing.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be better, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d the head coach said. \u201cThat performance wouldn\u2019t trouble Australia. We know what we need to fix as a group, staff and players. But it would mean everything to me to make it 2-0 next week.\u201d</p> <p>English rugby league has been stuck in a cycle of heartbreaking World Cup defeats followed by four years of optimism-building displays going into the next tournament. Wane will hope this talented young group has the capabilities to break that cycle in Australia after falling short on home soil.</p>    <p>Williams was at the heart of everything England did well. He set up two of the three first-half tries, and scored the other. \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d Wane said of the captain. \u201cHe can do better though, he\u2019s heard that about 500 times from me in his career but it\u2019s because I know what he\u2019s capable of.\u201d</p> <p>It was Williams\u2019s decisive pass that led to Herbie Farnworth \u2013 another outstanding performer \u2013 opening the scoring early on, before a stunning long pass from Williams created the space for Matty Ashton to finish and make it 10-0 to the hosts. Williams then burst through a tackle to score a third try and put England in complete control after the opening quarter.</p> <p>Samoa reduced the deficit when Deine Mariner intercepted a Daryl Clark pass to score a try before the break, and while the tourists improved in the second half so, too, did England. They scored the try of the Test to extend their lead shortly after the restart when Williams and Farnworth combined to set up another of England\u2019s exceptional performers, Victor Radley.</p> <p>Samoa, however, looked at their most threatening when the game was at its most chaotic and Mariner claimed his second after Jarome Luai caused mayhem in the England defence. That made it 22-12 but Ashton\u2019s second re-established the hosts\u2019 comfortable advantage before Super League\u2019s Man of Steel, Lewis, finished another wonderful long-range England move.</p> <p>The final word went to Samoa as Chan Kum Tong claimed another interception try for the tourists. But this was categorically England\u2019s day and, in terms of the road to the 2026 World Cup, another big tick for Wane and his side.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The marketing gurus had billed this autumn series between England and Samoa as a chance for revenge given what happened in an extraordinary Rugby League World Cup semi-final two years ago, when Samoa stunned Shaun Wane\u2019s side in extra time at the Emirates Stadium. The reality, however, is that this two-match series is not about looking back for England but rather looking forward to the next World Cup. To that end, this was another successful tick in the box for a side who will be largely unchanged when the tournament kicks off in Australia in two years\u2019 time. The hosts were ultimately too good for the touring Samoans, who trailed 16-6 at half-time and could have no complaints about the fact they need to win in Leeds next weekend to square the series. They, too, will have hopes of success in the 2026 World Cup after reaching the final in England last time out, given how they are littered with National Rugby League superstars. Here, though, there were still simmering tensions from 2022. That was evident before a ball had been kicked, with Samoa\u2019s spine\u2011tingling Siva Tau war dance leading to the Hull KR half-back Mikey Lewis and the Manly Sea Eagles\u2019 Gordon Chan Kum Tong going head-to-head. When the action began, it was England who were the superior of the two teams. Led by another imperious display from their captain, George Williams, there was a lot to like about what Wane\u2019s side delivered: even if his post-match assessment was not exactly glowing. \u201cWe need to be better, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d the head coach said. \u201cThat performance wouldn\u2019t trouble Australia. We know what we need to fix as a group, staff and players. But it would mean everything to me to make it 2-0 next week.\u201d English rugby league has been stuck in a cycle of heartbreaking World Cup defeats followed by four years of optimism-building displays going into the next tournament. Wane will hope this talented young group has the capabilities to break that cycle in Australia after falling short on home soil. Williams was at the heart of everything England did well. He set up two of the three first-half tries, and scored the other. \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d Wane said of the captain. \u201cHe can do better though, he\u2019s heard that about 500 times from me in his career but it\u2019s because I know what he\u2019s capable of.\u201d It was Williams\u2019s decisive pass that led to Herbie Farnworth \u2013 another outstanding performer \u2013 opening the scoring early on, before a stunning long pass from Williams created the space for Matty Ashton to finish and make it 10-0 to the hosts. Williams then burst through a tackle to score a third try and put England in complete control after the opening quarter. Samoa reduced the deficit when Deine Mariner intercepted a Daryl Clark pass to score a try before the break, and while the tourists improved in the second half so, too, did England. They scored the try of the Test to extend their lead shortly after the restart when Williams and Farnworth combined to set up another of England\u2019s exceptional performers, Victor Radley. Samoa, however, looked at their most threatening when the game was at its most chaotic and Mariner claimed his second after Jarome Luai caused mayhem in the England defence. That made it 22-12 but Ashton\u2019s second re-established the hosts\u2019 comfortable advantage before Super League\u2019s Man of Steel, Lewis, finished another wonderful long-range England move. The final word went to Samoa as Chan Kum Tong claimed another interception try for the tourists. But this was categorically England\u2019s day and, in terms of the road to the 2026 World Cup, another big tick for Wane and his side.",

James Farrar, the director of the campaign group Worker Info Exchange, which obtained the recording, said: \u201cMcDonald\u2019s are micromanaging the delivery workers in Antrim and Ballymena as if they are direct employees but then hide behind the Uber platform to avoid responsibility. \u201cFor years Uber has specialised in exploiting workers; now they are selling access to their platform to help other large multinationals do the same.\u201d Neil Moore, a regional officer for the Unite union, said: \u201cUnite is increasingly concerned by the exploitative employment model used by fast food delivery companies. All too often the interests of low-paid and short-staffed workers are being played off against those of couriers.\u201d The 45-minute briefing was for drivers serving McDonald\u2019s Antrim restaurant, but a recording of it was being shared by staff in a Facebook group for drivers at the nearby Ballymena branch as recently as last week, along with a \u201ccode of conduct\u201d with \u201cpoints drivers must adopt\u201d. \u201cIf it\u2019s important to the restaurant, it\u2019s going to be important to you guys,\u201d the McDonald\u2019s manager says at the start of the briefing, encouraging couriers to share his comments with their colleagues. He says relations between drivers and the restaurant have improved since a previous briefing three months earlier, but \u201cthere\u2019s some naughty boys and girls we need to talk about today\u201d. The manager raises the issue of couriers\u2019 proficiency in English. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk up to the front counter with your phone and point at your phone and tell the staff: \u2018Where is this?\u2019,\u201d he says. He says his staff complain because \u201cthey think you\u2019re being harsh or abrupt, but you\u2019re just speaking normally, the way you would do in Romania. You know, English is a bit softer.\u201d It is \u201cyour responsibility to improve your language and your communication\u201d, he adds. The manager goes on to mention a string of other issues, including couriers being too slow to pick up orders, failing to close delivery bags properly, claiming free drinks they are not entitled to, and using two phones with separate Uber Eats accounts. He says he and his colleagues will be checking drivers\u2019 phones from now on to prevent this. \u201cIn my other store, I had to remove two drivers. I had to remove them, gone. One was cheeky, and one just wasn\u2019t working as a team,\u201d he says. Formally, restaurants have no power to \u201cremove\u201d particular couriers, though they could raise complaints about them to Uber Eats. Local drivers who spoke to Worker Info Exchange said the small town had only a limited number of restaurants, so it would be hard to make a living without delivering from McDonald\u2019s. At one point in the recording of the meeting, a driver interjects to say that after petrol and car running costs and insurance, \u201cI barely make \u00a3100 a day. I can show you.\u201d Uber cab drivers have been classed as workers since 2021, after a supreme court ruling, giving them access to holiday pay and a pension scheme, though not the full rights of an employee, but Uber Eats couriers remain self-employed. Employment law is devolved to the Northern Ireland assembly. The Department for the Economy recently carried out a consultation on whether to boost employment rights, including asking about the risks of \u201cbogus self-employment\u201d. \u201cGenuinely self-employed individuals can exercise a large degree of flexibility and control over how, if and when they work,\u201d the consultation said, adding: \u201cWhere a worker has been misclassified as self-employed and the reality of their relationship is that of a worker or an employee, the worker is at risk of missing out on important employment protections.\u201d A McDonald\u2019s spokesperson said \u201crespectful working relationships with couriers\u201d were essential. \u201cWe encourage all of our restaurants and franchisees to actively foster these relationships, as do our delivery partners with their couriers,\u201d they said. \u201cWe believe our customers get the best service when our teams work collaboratively with couriers and create an environment where they do their job most effectively. \u201cWe are discussing this specific instance that has been brought to our attention with the franchisee organisation and reminding them of best practice in creating respectful, positive and collaborative environments.\u201d An Uber Eats spokesperson said: \u201cUber Eats couriers are self-employed and are free to work when and where they choose. Convening a meeting of this nature is not something Uber condoned nor participated in. We are currently investigating and have reached out to McDonald\u2019s directly on this matter.\u201d",

He was often looked after by his maternal grandmother, Jewel \u201cBobbie\u201d Chapman, a music lover who kept the radio tuned to classical stations. As Phil wrote in his autobiography Searching for the Sound: My Life With the Grateful Dead (2005): \u201cI was awakened to the power of music early in life through the magic of radio broadcasts and by listening to my father play, from memory, his favourite tunes on the piano.\u201d Lesh began learning the violin, and played with Berkeley\u2019s Young People\u2019s Symphony Orchestra.</p> <p>At 14 he switched to the trumpet, then transferred from El Cerrito high school to Berkeley high school to study harmony. He became interested in free jazz and the classical avant garde and, after short stints at San Francisco State College and the College of San Mateo, enrolled at UC Berkeley.</p> <p>However, he again dropped out in favour of studying with the Italian experimental composer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/may/28/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries2\">Luciano Berio</a> at Mills College in Oakland (among his classmates was the future star of minimalism, Steve Reich). Lesh created several of his own compositions and tried some writing with Reich.</p>    <p>In 1965 he met Garcia, at the time better known as a bluegrass banjo player than an electric guitarist, and who was performing with his band the Warlocks at a pizza parlour in Menlo Park in San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area. Lesh would recall being struck how \u201cmusic with that kind of directness and simplicity could deliver an aesthetic and emotional payoff comparable to that of the greatest operatic or symphonic works\u201d.</p> <p>The story goes that Garcia immediately informed Lesh that he was the band\u2019s new bass player, to which Lesh replied: \u201cWhy not?\u201d Soon afterwards the group changed its name to the Grateful Dead. Perhaps uninhibited because he had never previously played bass, Lesh approached the instrument in the same spirit as other 1960s innovators such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/jack-bruce\">Jack Bruce</a> of Cream, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jun/29/guardianobituaries.arts\">John Entwistle</a> of the Who, and Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane.</p> <p>The Dead\u2019s colourful career ended with the death of Garcia in 1995, a year after they had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But the band members had frequently branched out into projects outside the band, and continued to do so.</p> <p>In 1975 Lesh had combined with the electronics specialist Ned Lagin and various California-based musicians on the experimental album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW370_ETZ4Y\">Seastones</a>. In 1998 he joined his fellow Dead survivors Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, and the sometime Dead keyboard player Bruce Hornsby, in the Other Ones, who later renamed themselves the Dead.</p>    <p>The same year Lesh, who had been suffering from chronic hepatitis C, had a liver transplant. Fully recovered, he then worked with his own outfit, Phil Lesh and Friends. This had enjoyed a brief incarnation in 1994 when it featured Garcia, but from 1999 became a rotating group of musicians that included members of Phish, Little Feat, the Allman Brothers Band and Jefferson Airplane. </p> <p>From 1999 to 2003, a version of the band called the Phil Lesh Quintet became its most permanent incarnation, and they recorded a couple of live albums and the studio album There and Back Again (2002). In 2008 the group was augmented by Weir and Hart for a concert in support of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>The group also performed at Terrapin Crossroads, a restaurant and music venue opened by Lesh in San Rafael, California, in 2012, where Lesh\u2019s sons, Grahame and Brian, both musicians, often played with the house band. In 2009 Lesh and Weir had reunited in Furthur, a sextet playing music by or in the spirit of the Grateful Dead.</p> <p>Lesh rejoined Weir, Hart and Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann in 2015 for three concerts at Soldier Field stadium, Chicago, billed as Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead.</p> <p>In 2006 Lesh had undergone surgery for prostate cancer, the disease that had killed his father. In 2015, he revealed he had had surgery for bladder cancer.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Jill, with whom he formed the Unbroken Chain Foundation to support music, education and environment charities, Grahame and Brian, and a grandson.</p> <p>\u2022 Phillip Chapman Lesh, musician, singer and composer, born 15 March 1940; died 25 October 2024</p>",

But he also scored songwriting credits on the Dead\u2019s on-the-road odyssey Truckin\u2019 and Cumberland Blues. He co-wrote and sang on Unbroken Chain and Pride of Cucamonga from the album From the Mars Hotel (1974), put a funk-like stamp on Passenger from Terrapin Station (1977), and was one of the masterminds behind St Stephen, an early favourite at Grateful Dead concerts. Born in Berkeley, California, Phil was the son of Frank, an amateur musician who owned a small business, and his wife, Barbara (nee Chapman). He was often looked after by his maternal grandmother, Jewel \u201cBobbie\u201d Chapman, a music lover who kept the radio tuned to classical stations. As Phil wrote in his autobiography Searching for the Sound: My Life With the Grateful Dead (2005): \u201cI was awakened to the power of music early in life through the magic of radio broadcasts and by listening to my father play, from memory, his favourite tunes on the piano.\u201d Lesh began learning the violin, and played with Berkeley\u2019s Young People\u2019s Symphony Orchestra. At 14 he switched to the trumpet, then transferred from El Cerrito high school to Berkeley high school to study harmony. He became interested in free jazz and the classical avant garde and, after short stints at San Francisco State College and the College of San Mateo, enrolled at UC Berkeley. However, he again dropped out in favour of studying with the Italian experimental composer Luciano Berio at Mills College in Oakland (among his classmates was the future star of minimalism, Steve Reich). Lesh created several of his own compositions and tried some writing with Reich. In 1965 he met Garcia, at the time better known as a bluegrass banjo player than an electric guitarist, and who was performing with his band the Warlocks at a pizza parlour in Menlo Park in San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area. Lesh would recall being struck how \u201cmusic with that kind of directness and simplicity could deliver an aesthetic and emotional payoff comparable to that of the greatest operatic or symphonic works\u201d. The story goes that Garcia immediately informed Lesh that he was the band\u2019s new bass player, to which Lesh replied: \u201cWhy not?\u201d Soon afterwards the group changed its name to the Grateful Dead. Perhaps uninhibited because he had never previously played bass, Lesh approached the instrument in the same spirit as other 1960s innovators such as Jack Bruce of Cream, John Entwistle of the Who, and Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane. The Dead\u2019s colourful career ended with the death of Garcia in 1995, a year after they had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But the band members had frequently branched out into projects outside the band, and continued to do so. In 1975 Lesh had combined with the electronics specialist Ned Lagin and various California-based musicians on the experimental album Seastones. In 1998 he joined his fellow Dead survivors Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, and the sometime Dead keyboard player Bruce Hornsby, in the Other Ones, who later renamed themselves the Dead. The same year Lesh, who had been suffering from chronic hepatitis C, had a liver transplant. Fully recovered, he then worked with his own outfit, Phil Lesh and Friends. This had enjoyed a brief incarnation in 1994 when it featured Garcia, but from 1999 became a rotating group of musicians that included members of Phish, Little Feat, the Allman Brothers Band and Jefferson Airplane. From 1999 to 2003, a version of the band called the Phil Lesh Quintet became its most permanent incarnation, and they recorded a couple of live albums and the studio album There and Back Again (2002). In 2008 the group was augmented by Weir and Hart for a concert in support of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign. The group also performed at Terrapin Crossroads, a restaurant and music venue opened by Lesh in San Rafael, California, in 2012, where Lesh\u2019s sons, Grahame and Brian, both musicians, often played with the house band. In 2009 Lesh and Weir had reunited in Furthur, a sextet playing music by or in the spirit of the Grateful Dead. Lesh rejoined Weir, Hart and Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann in 2015 for three concerts at Soldier Field stadium, Chicago, billed as Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead. In 2006 Lesh had undergone surgery for prostate cancer, the disease that had killed his father. In 2015, he revealed he had had surgery for bladder cancer. He is survived by his wife, Jill, with whom he formed the Unbroken Chain Foundation to support music, education and environment charities, Grahame and Brian, and a grandson. \u2022 Phillip Chapman Lesh, musician, singer and composer, born 15 March 1940; died 25 October 2024",

While the result is not a repeat of the political seismic shock of 15 years ago \u2013 an unprecedented defeat for the LDP \u2013 it has left the party significantly weakened and will raise questions about the future of the recently installed prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba. Ishiba, 67, called Sunday\u2019s election only days after taking office on 1 October, aiming to bolster his position and that of his scandal-hit party. \u201cThe results so far have been extremely severe, and we take them very seriously,\u201d Ishiba told the national broadcaster, NHK. \u201cI believe the voters are telling us to reflect more and become a party that lives up to their expectations.\u201d NHK exit polls earlier indicated the LDP was expected to win between 153 and 219 seats, down sharply from the comfortable majority of 247 it held previously.

Ishiba, a former defence minister, became the party\u2019s president \u2013 and Japan\u2019s new prime minister \u2013 last month after his predecessor, Fumio Kishida, announced he was stepping down to take responsibility for the funding scandal. Dozens of LDP lawmakers were found to have siphoned unreported profits from the sale of tickets to party gatherings into slush funds. Several senior figures were disciplined, and the party withdrew its support for several candidates in Sunday\u2019s vote \u2013 moves that failed to repair the damage inflicted by the funding scandal. Ishiba, who is battling low approval ratings just weeks into his premiership, was wrongfooted days before the vote when the media reported that the party had given millions of yen in campaign funds to local party chapters whose candidates had lost the party\u2019s endorsement. Japan\u2019s longsuffering opposition was pinning its hopes on the scandal triggering a repeat of the 2009 lower house election, the last time the LDP was deposed. The CDP leader, Yoshihiko Noda, accused the LDP of ignoring the needs of ordinary people, as polls said most voters wanted action on rising prices, as well as tax cuts and wage rises. \u201cThe LDP\u2019s politics are all about quickly implementing policies for those who give them lots of cash,\u201d Noda told supporters on Saturday. \u201cBut vulnerable people have been ignored.\u201d Takeshi Ito, a 38-year-old voter, said he would support the LDP in the absence of a viable alternative. \u201cEven if I were to switch to an opposition party, it\u2019s still unclear whether they could push forward reforms, and I don\u2019t know if I can trust them or not at this point,\u201d Ito said. \u201cI want to see the party in power continue to move forward.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A few months after the death of the neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks in 2015, I visited his office in midtown Manhattan to pass on my condolences to his friend and longtime editor Kate Edgar. Shelves were stacked with editions of every translation of Sacks\u2019s books; piled on every surface were reams of yellow paper covered in Sacks\u2019s barely legible scrawl. The subjects were as eclectic as his enthusiasms: two towering piles were marked \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cMemory\u201d, and another was marked \u201cBorges\u201d. There was more than enough material for at least two more books of essays, Edgar told me (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/14/the-river-of-consciousness-by-oliver-sacks-review\">The River of Consciousness</a></em> would be published in 2017, and <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/everything-in-its-place-9781509821808/\">Everything in Its Place</a></em> in 2019), and then, gesturing to some of the piles around her, intimated the scale of another task: sorting through 70 large boxes of correspondence.</p> <p>From the riches of those boxes, Edgar has now distilled 700 pages of absorbing, illuminating, moving and entertaining letters for publication. They range from August 1960 (when Sacks first moved from England to North America), through to a few days before his death in New York, from melanoma, 55 years later.</p> <p>Sacks qualified in medicine in England in the 1950s and, after his internship, began training as a neurologist in California in 1961. The US offered \u201cenormous opportunities, not merely professionally, but for leading a full and fascinating life in many other ways\u201d, he wrote home. He came from a family of medics: his father, Samuel Sacks, practised as a London GP well into his 90s, while his mother, Muriel<strong> </strong>Elsie Landau, was a distinguished gynaecologist. She looms large throughout this collection: \u201cMy mother was not only the first Jewish woman (and almost the first woman) to be elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons,\u201d Sacks later wrote, \u201c[but] one of the very few Jewish consultants in the whole of England.\u201d One letter reveals how she would occasionally bring home \u201cdeformed foetuses\u201d from hospital and ask the 10-year-old Oliver to dissect them. He had a traumatic childhood: he was evacuated to a sadistic residential school during the war, and his letters often return to the horror of that abandonment. His memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/08/on-the-move-a-life-oliver-sacks-review-autobiography-neurologist\">On </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/08/on-the-move-a-life-oliver-sacks-review-autobiography-neurologist\">the Move </a></em>(2015) describes how his mother abandoned him twice over when, at 18, he admitted his homosexuality. \u201cYou are an abomination!\u201d Sacks remembered her saying. \u201cI wish you had never been born.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sacks wrote of Kate Edgar as his \u2018mother figure\u2019, adding that he did his best work when she was in the next room</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the loving early letters Sacks wrote to both parents are among the jewels of this collection, detailing his anxieties about medicine (citing a temporary \u201caversion to patients, sickness, hospitals and particularly doctors\u201d), his weightlifting escapades (he was the joint Californian squat champion), and his accounts of motorbiking through the desert, high on amphetamines, and using a stethoscope to siphon stolen petrol.</p> <p>Even in his 20s, Sacks wrote in a learned, stylish and energetic prose. But it\u2019s after his move to New York in 1965 that the compassionate physician of later fame appears. He began with neuropathology (but confessed \u201cporing down a microscope drives me nuts, and I need some return to clinical work\u201d), then took on a job in a headache clinic \u2013 material from which would become his first book, <em>Migraine </em>(1970). Then, as a resident neurologist at Beth Abraham, a hospital for chronic neurological disease, he found his vocation, as devoted physician to patients with a severe form of Parkinson\u2019s disease (<em>encephalitis lethargica</em>), all of whom had been institutionalised since the \u201csleepy sickness\u201d epidemic of the 1920s. A new medication, L-dopa, was just becoming available, and in his groundbreaking <em>Awakenings </em>(1973) Sacks charted its spectacular effects. The book later inspired a play by Harold Pinter and a Hollywood movie starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. In the early 80s, a young editor called Kate Edgar was assigned to edit a book of&nbsp;his neurological case histories that would later become <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife </em><em>for </em><em>a Hat </em>(1985), the&nbsp;title chosen by his then&nbsp;editor at&nbsp;the <em>London Review of Books</em>, Mary-Kay Wilmers.</p>    <p>A letter from Sacks to Edgar asking her to stay on working for him is among the most touching in the book: he wonders \u201cwhether we might make some sort of private arrangement between us, my retaining you as \u2013 I can think of no term general enough! \u2013 but as some sort of literary/intellectual factotum,&nbsp;inciting, organising, typing, editing\u2026 odd pieces, case histories, essays, lectures, etc\u201d. It comes two-thirds of the way through <em>Letters, </em>when Sacks is 53; <em>Hat </em>(as he called it) propelled him to&nbsp;the bestseller lists and international fame.</p> <p>Sacks wrote of Edgar as his \u201cmother figure\u201d, adding that he did his best work when she was in the next room. His many subsequent books \u2013 <em>Seeing Voices, Uncle Tungsten, Musicophilia, Hallucinations</em><em>, </em>among others \u2013 are testament to a successful partnership. By the end of his life, his correspondents included his many fans around the world (in my loft at home I have a kind response he sent me in 1997), as well as poets, artists and scientists. The prose shifts gradually in tone as he was called upon to take up the role of public intellectual, but his restless curiosity, breadth of interests, and the energy of his enthusiasm never wanes, even when responding to his critics. His reply to a psychiatrist, Orrin Palmer, who in 1988 wrote to complain of Sacks\u2019s characterisation of Tourette syndrome, reads: \u201cI have a profound respect for Affliction, and the Afflicted \u2013 this is at the heart of my physicianhood and personhood\u2026 While I fully respect the medical model \u2013 and my own writings (<em>Migraine</em> etc) are examples of it \u2013 I think that one must go BEYOND it.\u201d Sacks showed generations of doctors (and patients) how medicine is just the starting point for an exploration of the possibilities of being human. With these letters, his legacy as an extraordinary writer, humanitarian and physician is secured.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gavin Francis is a GP in Edinburgh.

There was more than enough material for at least two more books of essays, Edgar told me (The River of Consciousness would be published in 2017, and Everything in Its Place in 2019), and then, gesturing to some of the piles around her, intimated the scale of another task: sorting through 70 large boxes of correspondence. From the riches of those boxes, Edgar has now distilled 700 pages of absorbing, illuminating, moving and entertaining letters for publication. They range from August 1960 (when Sacks first moved from England to North America), through to a few days before his death in New York, from melanoma, 55 years later. Sacks qualified in medicine in England in the 1950s and, after his internship, began training as a neurologist in California in 1961. The US offered \u201cenormous opportunities, not merely professionally, but for leading a full and fascinating life in many other ways\u201d, he wrote home. He came from a family of medics: his father, Samuel Sacks, practised as a London GP well into his 90s, while his mother, Muriel Elsie Landau, was a distinguished gynaecologist. She looms large throughout this collection: \u201cMy mother was not only the first Jewish woman (and almost the first woman) to be elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons,\u201d Sacks later wrote, \u201c[but] one of the very few Jewish consultants in the whole of England.\u201d One letter reveals how she would occasionally bring home \u201cdeformed foetuses\u201d from hospital and ask the 10-year-old Oliver to dissect them. He had a traumatic childhood: he was evacuated to a sadistic residential school during the war, and his letters often return to the horror of that abandonment. His memoir On the Move (2015) describes how his mother abandoned him twice over when, at 18, he admitted his homosexuality. \u201cYou are an abomination!\u201d Sacks remembered her saying. \u201cI wish you had never been born.\u201d But the loving early letters Sacks wrote to both parents are among the jewels of this collection, detailing his anxieties about medicine (citing a temporary \u201caversion to patients, sickness, hospitals and particularly doctors\u201d), his weightlifting escapades (he was the joint Californian squat champion), and his accounts of motorbiking through the desert, high on amphetamines, and using a stethoscope to siphon stolen petrol. Even in his 20s, Sacks wrote in a learned, stylish and energetic prose. But it\u2019s after his move to New York in 1965 that the compassionate physician of later fame appears. He began with neuropathology (but confessed \u201cporing down a microscope drives me nuts, and I need some return to clinical work\u201d), then took on a job in a headache clinic \u2013 material from which would become his first book, Migraine (1970). Then, as a resident neurologist at Beth Abraham, a hospital for chronic neurological disease, he found his vocation, as devoted physician to patients with a severe form of Parkinson\u2019s disease (encephalitis lethargica), all of whom had been institutionalised since the \u201csleepy sickness\u201d epidemic of the 1920s. A new medication, L-dopa, was just becoming available, and in his groundbreaking Awakenings (1973) Sacks charted its spectacular effects. The book later inspired a play by Harold Pinter and a Hollywood movie starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. In the early 80s, a young editor called Kate Edgar was assigned to edit a book of his neurological case histories that would later become The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1985), the title chosen by his then editor at the London Review of Books, Mary-Kay Wilmers. A letter from Sacks to Edgar asking her to stay on working for him is among the most touching in the book: he wonders \u201cwhether we might make some sort of private arrangement between us, my retaining you as \u2013 I can think of no term general enough! \u2013 but as some sort of literary/intellectual factotum, inciting, organising, typing, editing\u2026 odd pieces, case histories, essays, lectures, etc\u201d. It comes two-thirds of the way through Letters, when Sacks is 53; Hat (as he called it) propelled him to the bestseller lists and international fame. Sacks wrote of Edgar as his \u201cmother figure\u201d, adding that he did his best work when she was in the next room. His many subsequent books \u2013 Seeing Voices, Uncle Tungsten, Musicophilia, Hallucinations, among others \u2013 are testament to a successful partnership. By the end of his life, his correspondents included his many fans around the world (in my loft at home I have a kind response he sent me in 1997), as well as poets, artists and scientists. The prose shifts gradually in tone as he was called upon to take up the role of public intellectual, but his restless curiosity, breadth of interests, and the energy of his enthusiasm never wanes, even when responding to his critics. His reply to a psychiatrist, Orrin Palmer, who in 1988 wrote to complain of Sacks\u2019s characterisation of Tourette syndrome, reads: \u201cI have a profound respect for Affliction, and the Afflicted \u2013 this is at the heart of my physicianhood and personhood\u2026 While I fully respect the medical model \u2013 and my own writings (Migraine etc) are examples of it \u2013 I think that one must go BEYOND it.\u201d Sacks showed generations of doctors (and patients) how medicine is just the starting point for an exploration of the possibilities of being human. With these letters, his legacy as an extraordinary writer, humanitarian and physician is secured. Gavin Francis is a GP in Edinburgh.

      "body": "<p>Two Georgia megachurches hosted presidential candidates last week, highlighting the stark differences between how Kamala Harris and Donald Trump speak about faith and what Georgia\u2019s Christian religious congregations expect of them.</p> <p>Though Trump and Harris communicate differently to the public about their faith, religious leaders on the left and the right are casting this election in apocalyptic terms. And both candidates know religious voters will be essential to winning swing states like Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so good to be here with everyone today and to worship with you,\u201d Harris said from the pulpit to thousands gathered at New Birth Missionary Baptist church in south DeKalb county last Sunday. \u201cOn this day, then, I am reminded, with everything that we reflect on, on the parable from the Gospel of Luke.\u201d</p> <p>Four thousand people packed the pews of the predominantly Black megachurch outside of Atlanta, one of the most prominent and powerful Black churches in America \u2013 a point of which pastor Jamal Bryant regularly reminds his congregation. New Birth owns more land than any Black church in America. It gave away $83m in college scholarships last year, he said.</p> <p>It wields its political clout deftly. New Birth\u2019s congregants include many of Atlanta\u2019s most powerful political figures \u2013 mayors, sheriffs, members of Congress. Bryant said it has hosted appearances by five presidents. </p> <p>But people who attend New Birth aren\u2019t there for a stump speech. And Harris didn\u2019t give one.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to give political speeches in a sanctuary, because you\u2019re there to worship God,\u201d said state senator Emanuel Jones, a DeKalb Democrat who attended church at New Birth last week. \u201cTo me, it is not a good use of a sanctuary to try and politicize \u2013 particularly on a Sunday, by the way \u2013 to try and mix politics with religion. I think she does a really good job of keeping them separate. She did that today, and we all should.\u201d</p>    <p>Harris campaigned in Georgia with her pastor Rev Dr Amos Brown, pastor at Third Baptist Church of San Francisco and a contemporary of Martin Luther King Jr and other luminaries in Atlanta\u2019s civil rights history. She told a CNN town hall a few days later that her first call after learning that Biden would be withdrawing was to Brown.</p> <p>\u201cI do pray every day,\u201d she told Anderson Cooper. \u201cSometimes twice a day.\u201d</p> <p>Harris will discuss her faith when it comes up, but doesn\u2019t go out of her way to portray her campaign as religiously motivated. Conversely, she never mentioned her campaign directly while speaking at New Birth. She shied away from the political themes common to her political rhetoric \u2013 abortion rights, the cost of living and the general unfitness of her opponent. She used the word \u201cfaith\u201d 16 times in her 14-minute address.</p> <p>\u201cFaith is a verb,\u201d she said. \u201cWe show it in action, in our deeds and in our service.\u201d</p> <p>Though she had not come to deliver a political speech, in a church with the flags of dozens of countries lining the balconies, the subtext was clear enough \u2013 a repudiation of conservative xenophobia about immigrants. </p> <p>Elaine Montgomery heard it.</p> <p>\u201cLike she said, when you don\u2019t help people like my neighbors and we all in this world,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cEverything belongs to God.\u201d</p> <p>Montgomery, 69, from Stone Mountain, Georgia, was wearing a pink hat big enough to see from space that Sunday. She was on her way to vote. Her disdain for Trump\u2019s expression of faith was plain.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man speaking on a level that\u2019s below God, I will say that,\u201d Montgomery said. Her voice lowered. \u201cI don\u2019t really think Donald Trump had faith. I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m serious, you know, because if he had faith and he believed in Jesus Christ, he wouldn\u2019t be doing the things he does.\u201d</p> <p>Faith matters in Georgia. White Christian evangelical beliefs correlate with the strongest support for Donald Trump, and about 38% of Georgians fall into that category, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/georgia/\">Pew Research Center</a>. Black voters in Georgia are also much more likely to be religious than the baseline, and Black voters represent about 30% of the electorate.</p> <p>Georgia, in the heart of the Bible belt, has one of the highest rates of <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/compare/attendance-at-religious-services/by/state/\">regular church attendance</a> in America at 42%.</p>    <p>Last Sunday, 42,694 voters cast a ballot in Georgia, many going in a \u201csouls to the polls\u201d push regularly organized by churches, particularly in metro Atlanta. In the flurry of conservative election legislation that followed the 2020 election in Georgia, a plan to eliminate Sunday early voting floated through the legislature. Outcry from pastors across the state ended that gambit. Mobilizing religiously motivated voters is a necessary, if insufficient, requirement for any candidate to win a Georgia election.</p> <p>Trump found himself in Zebulon, Georgia, last week, doing just that.</p> <p>He was 45 minutes late to the faith town hall held at Christ Chapel church. Thousands of people packed its hall and sprawled into a parking lot ringed by semi-truck trailers with snipers on the roofs.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, without religion, it\u2019s like the \u2013 it\u2019s like the glue that holds it all together. This would be a different country,\u201d he said, noting a declining trend in religious participation, suggesting that \u201cpeople started thinking a little bit differently and they got used to a different way of life\u201d after the pandemic. He spoke about how Christians \u2013 particularly Catholics \u2013 faced unspecified \u201cpersecution\u201d today in America. </p> <p>But most of Trump\u2019s comments at the \u201cBelievers and Ballots\u201d town hall were campaign fodder about illegal immigration, how great his rallies have been and attacks on Harris and the Biden administration.</p> <p>About 1,100 people live in Zebulon, about an hour and a half south of Atlanta. Christ Chapel has about 1,600 members, with more at satellite campuses in middle Georgia.</p> <p>Brian Hood, a congregant at Christ Chapel, said he expected Trump to speak about the border and inflation, but also freedom of religion.</p> <p>\u201cDonald J Trump professes to be a born-again Christian. Does that mean that he\u2019s perfect? Of course not. None of us are. Anybody who says they are is a liar. He appeals to, not just Christians, but all the American people. He loves God and loves people, all walks of life.\u201d</p> <p>Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, a Republican and ally of the former president, asked Trump about coping with the assassination attempts and the pressure of the campaign. \u201cHow do you lean into your faith and your family to deal with this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI say this. Faith \u2013 when you have faith, when you believe in God, it\u2019s a big advantage over people that don\u2019t have that. It\u2019s a big advantage,\u201d Trump replied.</p> <p>It was the only substantial reference Trump made to his own faith in the abbreviated 40-minute forum for faith voters.</p>    <p>Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition and a longtime activist on the Christian right, succinctly laid out the stakes for antiabortion conservatives as he warmed up the crowd before Trump\u2019s arrival.</p> <p>Harris is \u201cgoing to pass a federal law to impose abortion on demand on all 50 states\u201d, Reed said. \u201cAnd when she\u2019s done doing that, she\u2019s going to repeal the filibuster and then she\u2019s going to pass a federal law imposing term limits on the supreme court which will instantly remove justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and John Roberts from the court and she\u2019s going to replace them with the most leftwing radical extremist justices ever nominated. That\u2019s her agenda.\u201d</p> <p>The first accomplishment listed on the campaign\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://believers.donaldjtrump.com/accomplishments\">Believers for Trump</a>\u201d website is how Trump appointed three supreme court justices, \u201cwhich led to the end of Roe v Wade and broader protections for religious liberties\u201d. Ending legal abortion is central to the religious conservatism of many of his supporters.</p> <p>\u201cI believe that life begins in conception. I cannot follow the dictates of being able to abort at any time,\u201d said Carol Whitcomb of Stockbridge, a conservative who attended the Trump forum. </p> <p>But it also may be a losing political position, even in Georgia. In every state where abortion rights have been a ballot referendum since the end of federal protections, voters have taken the more pro-choice position.

      "bodyText": "Two Georgia megachurches hosted presidential candidates last week, highlighting the stark differences between how Kamala Harris and Donald Trump speak about faith and what Georgia\u2019s Christian religious congregations expect of them. Though Trump and Harris communicate differently to the public about their faith, religious leaders on the left and the right are casting this election in apocalyptic terms. And both candidates know religious voters will be essential to winning swing states like Georgia. \u201cIt is so good to be here with everyone today and to worship with you,\u201d Harris said from the pulpit to thousands gathered at New Birth Missionary Baptist church in south DeKalb county last Sunday. \u201cOn this day, then, I am reminded, with everything that we reflect on, on the parable from the Gospel of Luke.\u201d Four thousand people packed the pews of the predominantly Black megachurch outside of Atlanta, one of the most prominent and powerful Black churches in America \u2013 a point of which pastor Jamal Bryant regularly reminds his congregation. New Birth owns more land than any Black church in America. It gave away $83m in college scholarships last year, he said. It wields its political clout deftly. New Birth\u2019s congregants include many of Atlanta\u2019s most powerful political figures \u2013 mayors, sheriffs, members of Congress. Bryant said it has hosted appearances by five presidents. But people who attend New Birth aren\u2019t there for a stump speech. And Harris didn\u2019t give one. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give political speeches in a sanctuary, because you\u2019re there to worship God,\u201d said state senator Emanuel Jones, a DeKalb Democrat who attended church at New Birth last week. \u201cTo me, it is not a good use of a sanctuary to try and politicize \u2013 particularly on a Sunday, by the way \u2013 to try and mix politics with religion. I think she does a really good job of keeping them separate. She did that today, and we all should.\u201d Harris campaigned in Georgia with her pastor Rev Dr Amos Brown, pastor at Third Baptist Church of San Francisco and a contemporary of Martin Luther King Jr and other luminaries in Atlanta\u2019s civil rights history. She told a CNN town hall a few days later that her first call after learning that Biden would be withdrawing was to Brown. \u201cI do pray every day,\u201d she told Anderson Cooper. \u201cSometimes twice a day.\u201d Harris will discuss her faith when it comes up, but doesn\u2019t go out of her way to portray her campaign as religiously motivated. Conversely, she never mentioned her campaign directly while speaking at New Birth. She shied away from the political themes common to her political rhetoric \u2013 abortion rights, the cost of living and the general unfitness of her opponent. She used the word \u201cfaith\u201d 16 times in her 14-minute address. \u201cFaith is a verb,\u201d she said. \u201cWe show it in action, in our deeds and in our service.\u201d Though she had not come to deliver a political speech, in a church with the flags of dozens of countries lining the balconies, the subtext was clear enough \u2013 a repudiation of conservative xenophobia about immigrants. Elaine Montgomery heard it. \u201cLike she said, when you don\u2019t help people like my neighbors and we all in this world,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cEverything belongs to God.\u201d Montgomery, 69, from Stone Mountain, Georgia, was wearing a pink hat big enough to see from space that Sunday. She was on her way to vote. Her disdain for Trump\u2019s expression of faith was plain. \u201cHe\u2019s a man speaking on a level that\u2019s below God, I will say that,\u201d Montgomery said. Her voice lowered. \u201cI don\u2019t really think Donald Trump had faith. I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m serious, you know, because if he had faith and he believed in Jesus Christ, he wouldn\u2019t be doing the things he does.\u201d Faith matters in Georgia. White Christian evangelical beliefs correlate with the strongest support for Donald Trump, and about 38% of Georgians fall into that category, according to the Pew Research Center. Black voters in Georgia are also much more likely to be religious than the baseline, and Black voters represent about 30% of the electorate. Georgia, in the heart of the Bible belt, has one of the highest rates of regular church attendance in America at 42%. Last Sunday, 42,694 voters cast a ballot in Georgia, many going in a \u201csouls to the polls\u201d push regularly organized by churches, particularly in metro Atlanta. In the flurry of conservative election legislation that followed the 2020 election in Georgia, a plan to eliminate Sunday early voting floated through the legislature. Outcry from pastors across the state ended that gambit. Mobilizing religiously motivated voters is a necessary, if insufficient, requirement for any candidate to win a Georgia election. Trump found himself in Zebulon, Georgia, last week, doing just that. He was 45 minutes late to the faith town hall held at Christ Chapel church. Thousands of people packed its hall and sprawled into a parking lot ringed by semi-truck trailers with snipers on the roofs. \u201cYou know, without religion, it\u2019s like the \u2013 it\u2019s like the glue that holds it all together. This would be a different country,\u201d he said, noting a declining trend in religious participation, suggesting that \u201cpeople started thinking a little bit differently and they got used to a different way of life\u201d after the pandemic. He spoke about how Christians \u2013 particularly Catholics \u2013 faced unspecified \u201cpersecution\u201d today in America. But most of Trump\u2019s comments at the \u201cBelievers and Ballots\u201d town hall were campaign fodder about illegal immigration, how great his rallies have been and attacks on Harris and the Biden administration. About 1,100 people live in Zebulon, about an hour and a half south of Atlanta. Christ Chapel has about 1,600 members, with more at satellite campuses in middle Georgia. Brian Hood, a congregant at Christ Chapel, said he expected Trump to speak about the border and inflation, but also freedom of religion. \u201cDonald J Trump professes to be a born-again Christian. Does that mean that he\u2019s perfect? Of course not. None of us are. Anybody who says they are is a liar. He appeals to, not just Christians, but all the American people. He loves God and loves people, all walks of life.\u201d Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, a Republican and ally of the former president, asked Trump about coping with the assassination attempts and the pressure of the campaign. \u201cHow do you lean into your faith and your family to deal with this?\u201d \u201cI say this. Faith \u2013 when you have faith, when you believe in God, it\u2019s a big advantage over people that don\u2019t have that. It\u2019s a big advantage,\u201d Trump replied. It was the only substantial reference Trump made to his own faith in the abbreviated 40-minute forum for faith voters. Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition and a longtime activist on the Christian right, succinctly laid out the stakes for antiabortion conservatives as he warmed up the crowd before Trump\u2019s arrival. Harris is \u201cgoing to pass a federal law to impose abortion on demand on all 50 states\u201d, Reed said. \u201cAnd when she\u2019s done doing that, she\u2019s going to repeal the filibuster and then she\u2019s going to pass a federal law imposing term limits on the supreme court which will instantly remove justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and John Roberts from the court and she\u2019s going to replace them with the most leftwing radical extremist justices ever nominated. That\u2019s her agenda.\u201d The first accomplishment listed on the campaign\u2019s \u201cBelievers for Trump\u201d website is how Trump appointed three supreme court justices, \u201cwhich led to the end of Roe v Wade and broader protections for religious liberties\u201d. Ending legal abortion is central to the religious conservatism of many of his supporters. \u201cI believe that life begins in conception. I cannot follow the dictates of being able to abort at any time,\u201d said Carol Whitcomb of Stockbridge, a conservative who attended the Trump forum. But it also may be a losing political position, even in Georgia. In every state where abortion rights have been a ballot referendum since the end of federal protections, voters have taken the more pro-choice position. Trump has generally avoided talking about abortion on the campaign trail, with no mention of it at all in a later appearance in Georgia last week. Sandra Stargel of McDonough, Georgia, who attended the forum, has registered a change in Trump\u2019s posture toward abortion, she said. \u201cBut, you know, I believe God has been talking to him, too. God has him here for a reason. I understand that women want to be in charge of their bodies. I get that. But in that case, they make birth control. Use it. Don\u2019t just keep killing babies.\u201d Reed highlighted the stakes of the election: \u201cWe gather in this sanctuary 13 days before not only the most important election of our lifetimes but one of the most important elections in American history,\u201d he said. While Harris was at New Birth a few days earlier, the church\u2019s pastor Bryant used similar rhetoric, likening this political moment to the biblical story of Esther and her obligation to save Jews from death. \u201cIf you are silent in this moment, your family will not survive,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThis is not the time for y\u2019all to be bougie and stuck up. Generations of your unborn family are waiting to see what you do next.\u201d",

A defeat, though, could see them finish the weekend in 13th.</p> <p>To be frank, anything other than a Chelsea win would come as a surprise. The Blues have not lost a home league game to Newcastle since 2012 and the visitors have struggled for goals recently.

      "bodyText": "Nike Ames\u2019 report has landed, and the Arsenal v Liverpool game is about to start. So I\u2019ll say my farewells. Thanks for sticking with me and for letting me know I\u2019m not the only one baffled by daylight savings! Best to you all! I was wondering if anyone was going to call me out for this blatant gaffe. Colin Young wasn\u2019t going to let me go. Hi Daniel, much as I am hoping my club Arsenal CAN make it a clean sweep, I\u2019m enjoying even more that you don\u2019t appear to include Spurs as a \u2018London Club\u2019 in your post. Thanks for that, made my day so far! COYG! Apologies to all Spurs fans. I promise I didn\u2019t discount you deliberately. So, to correct my previous statement: it\u2019s been a good day for (most) London clubs. They\u2019ve just shown the Palmer pass in the build up to the Jackson goal and tell you what, it\u2019s proper good! Get a load of this: It\u2019s a good day for London clubs so far: Crystal Palace 1-0 Tottenham West Ham 2-1 Manchester United Can Arsenal make it a clean sweep later? Chelsea hold on and move up to fourth! Jackson on the scoresheet, Palmer too in a player of the match show, it wasn\u2019t always pretty but that victory ticks a lot of boxes. 90+8 min: They\u2019re still playing and Newcastle are still trying to deliver a ball into the box. They manage to do so and James keeps Chelsea ahead at the death! A wonderful diagonal finds Willock at the far post and his head across the face of goal is intercepted by James who heads it out for a corner. Can Newcastle steal a draw? Pope goes up. 90+7 min: Chelsea\u2019s defence holds firm. That is surely that. 90+6 min: Last minute of added time. Nkunku again in the thick of it. He commits a foul just inside his own half. Newcastle with one final chance to hoof the ball into the mixer. 90+3 min: Nkunku is booked for an ugly hack on Guimaraes. Maresca is furious! He thought his man won the ball. The manager is booked too. What a scrappy end to this game. 90+1 min: VAR overturns the penalty decision! So surely Nkunku should be booked for diving? Longstaff is booked for arguing too vociferously. Anyway, justice prevails and Newcastle have a glimmer of hope still. Hooper is going over to the screen. I\u2019d be floored if he doesn\u2019t reconsider his decision after another look. If this sticks it will be one of the softest penalty decisions I\u2019ve seen. Nkunku was held, no doubt, but there\u2019s no way Burn\u2019s soft touch had enough force to bundle him over. 89 min: Simon Hooper points to the penalty spot! Nkunku goes down after Palmer\u2019s cute touch unleashed him. Burn lunged at him but is there enough contact for this to be upheld? 88 min: Neto is booked for a late challenge. Joeltinton, who was Newcastle\u2019s best player, is subbed. So is Hall. On come Osula and Kelly. 87 min: Nkunku has a chance on the edge of the box. Nope, he doesn\u2019t take it, instead he takes a touch, then another, then another. He simply doesn\u2019t want to shoot with his left. But rather than pass he dallies and eventually the ball is lost. His teammates weren\u2019t too impressed with that. 85 min: Chelsea get a free-kick in their own half and they are in no rush to take it. They really are crawling their way to the finish line. Neto gets a sniff inside Newcastle\u2019s box after a few lucky bounces, but he can\u2019t latch onto the loose ball. Newcastle come again. 83 min: As if to prove that Chelsea are looking anxiously at the clock, Sanchez is booked for time wasting. 81 min: Livramento and Murphy combine for a neat one-two down the right flank and the former is tearing down the touchline. Defenders rally so Newcastle have to slow things down. They lack the precision to work their way through the wall of blue and in a flash Chelsea are in Newcastle\u2019s box. Palmer is again pulling the strings and eventually it lands for Mudryk who shoots but straight at Pope. 78 min: Palmer makes an interception on half-way and rather than rush his delivery forward, he slows things down. Again, that\u2019s fantastic from the youngster who seems to move at a different pace to everyone else. As a result Chelsea can enjoy a spell of possession and regain some control. 77 min: Gusto leaves the pitch for Cucurella. Jackson also makes way. On comes Nkunku. Chelsea are holding on a bit here and seem ragged. Newcastle, with a bit of bravery and accuracy, can still nick a result. 74 min: Isak has blown a golden chance! What has happened there! He was put through on goal. Admittedly he was wide and had to do some work. A step-over saw him ease past Sanchez but now thew angle was really acute. So he cuts back towards the middle of the box. Rather than pass to Longstaff he tries to find the room to shoot which gives Caicedo the opportunity to slide in and tackle. It bobbles out for a corner but that should be 2-2. 72 min: Tell you what, since I wrote off Newcastle they\u2019ve dominated possession. Guimaraes is seeing more of the ball, though that hopeful diagonal was always going to bobble away for a goal kick. Lavia is hooked and replaced by Enzo Hernandez. That\u2019s a good change for Chelsea who could do with a bit of spark. 70 min: Newcastle have managed just one shot all game. I\u2019m struggling to see what their plan is, beyond trying to counter when Chelsea press forward. More limbs in the middle might help. As I type that, though, Isak headers towards goal and James has to make a timely block. Brilliant ball from Murphy after being set loose by Joelinton on the left. 67 min: Schar chooses to aim for the top corner closest to the keeper but it was always going over. A pretty weak effort to be honest. Chelsea make a change as Mudryk replaces Madueke. Newcaslte have made three changes. Almiron, Tonali and Barnes make way. Murphy, Longstaff and Willock enter the scene. 65 min: Oooh, there\u2019s a clash off the ball as Hall is bundled over by Madueke \u2013 who gets booked \u2013 and Newcastle have a free-kick in a promising position. It\u2019s around 35 yards out just off centre of the goal. A perfect place for any right-footer. 64 min: Ah, Barnes makes a mess of a great opportunity. A big pass out to the left finds him in space. He has an option of a runner to his outside but chooses to cut infield to work the short. His touch is heavy so he needs another one, but that\u2019s heavy as well. In the end he commits a foul. Tonali then acts like a child, delaying a quick free kick from Chelsea, and gets booked. 62 min: Another long ball, this time from James, comes to nothing. Have Newcastle decided to drop a little deeper in the hope of springing a counter? The game has fallen into a lull, or is this the calm before the storm? Both teams taking stock before their substitutes perhaps? 60 min: Joelinton again drops deep and serves as a conduit between attack and defence. He almost sparks a move upfield but Chelsea do win it back and now they\u2019re forming something inside Newcastle territory. The Magpies have dropped deeper now, forcing Chelsea to play around them. The plan works. Chelsea lose their patience and a speculative long ball hands possession over. 58 min: Joelinton drops very deep, almost at left back, to help out. It works. Newcastle keep possession and work their way through Chelsea\u2019s high press. Isak gets the ball and takes it to the byline where he dinks in a dangerous cross that requires James to intervene with a clearing header. Better from Newcastle and perhaps a sign that it\u2019s simply a case of supplying more bodies where they\u2019re needed. 55 min: Newcastle need to get a grip in midfield. They\u2019re still set up in a 4-3-3. Maybe they need to match Chelsea\u2019s 4-2-3-1? Again they give the ball away and Madueke has it on the right flank. He holds onto it before trying to slide in Gusto on an overlap, but it\u2019s just a touch overcooked and out for a goal kick. 53 min: The Newcastle goal is getting peppered! Gusto cuts onto his left and fires a shot. It\u2019s well wide, but the Magpies are falling apart. Their midfield is nonexistent at present. 51 min: Again Newcastle lose it on halfway and Chelsea break. Jackson is leading the charge but a sloppy touch on the edge of the box slows things down. He plays a ball to his right for Madueke who has to check his run. But rather than pass, the winger opts to cut onto his left foot and shoot. It\u2019s a tame effort and Pope gathers it as it bobbles along the turf. 49 min: Neto headers against the post! Madueke and Caicedo combine well down the right and when the cross is delivered deep, Neto rises and meets it with a stiff header. He did so well to climb above his marker but got unlucky. An inch or two to the right and he\u2019d have found the net. It had to be him! What a player! What a season he\u2019s having! Newcastle give the ball away cheaply on half-way and Palmer picks it up and runs towards goal. He keeps going, they back off him. A short shift onto his left and he hammers it towards the near post. Maybe Pope should have got down in time but you know what, that was thumped! That\u2019s his seventh of the season and Chelsea have the lead again 75 seconds after the restart. We\u2019re back. Can either side pull clear? G\u2019Day D.G, G\u2019day to you, Chris Paraskevas. (Don\u2019t ask what time it is). I won\u2019t. Glad you also think daylight savings is silly. You\u2019re all worried about VAR but the true crime against football (and my retinas) is Chelsea\u2019s holographic badge. As much as I\u2019ve seen some shocking lows as a Newcastle fan, at hours that make Daylight Saving and the rotation of the planet irrelevant (e.g. Bowyer-Dyer Title Fight), I\u2019ve never seen anything as visually offensive as the current Chelsea badge and kit. Nice finish from Isak by the way. I\u2019m off to find more caffeine. Good luck with the caffeine run and thanks for the message. For what it\u2019s worth I am actually on Team VAR. But I agree, I\u2019m not a fan of that Chelsea strip, though it does earn points for the absence of a sponsor on the front. Once again we\u2019re talking about VAR. Justin Kavanagh thinks we;\u2019re heading down a path the leads to players getting electrocuted on the pitch: The offside rule is getting ridiculous and this constant reversion to VAR to measure whiskers is taking both the mickey and the joy out of football. Soon, some training-ground guru is going to put tracker GPS on strikers or administer shocks to the body beyond the offside line, similar to the invisible fence technology that keeps dogs in their place. Stay\u2026 stay Cole\u2026 now go, go fetch boy! That\u2019ll do after Newcastle fail to test Sanchez from that free-kick. It was a tame 10 minute to bring that half to a close but the preceding action was lively. Chelsea thought they had the lead when Palmer slid one into the far corner, but he was ruled off-side. Then Jackson scored, but Isak did likewise. Honours even at the break. 45+7 min: Newcastle will get a final chance before half-time to deliver a decent ball into the box after Gusto flies in and makes a reckless challenge. Hall stands over it from the left flank. 45+6 min: Colwill leaves a bit on Isak right before the break. It\u2019s not a foul, but they do need to bring play to a momentary halt. 45+5 min: Pope does well this time to hold on to Palmer\u2019s corner. Clear plan from Chelsea to test Pope on set pieces. Every ball they\u2019ve played in has teased the keeper, inviting him to either punch or grab it. 45+3 min: James\u2019 corner is nudged out for another corner. Newcastle have yet to concede from a corner all season. Can they hold out til the end of the half? Palmer\u2019s in-swinger is right on Pope and he punches it out for another corner. 45+2 min: Good from Jackson has he holds it up and then plays a ball on the half-turn. Madueke offers width and then feeds Gusto on the overlap. His clipped ball to the back post is headed out for a corner. 44 min: Neto has pulled out a good ol\u2019 fashioned dive. He didn\u2019t sell anyone with that one. Rather than receive a free-kick on halfway, it\u2019s a Newcastle throw. Joelinton, though, does get a freekick and Newcastle build again from the back. 43 min: It\u2019s getting heated! First Lavia and Barnes hack at each other. Then Pope comes tearing out of his box to sweep up a long ball but in doing so takes out Jackson on the canter. 41 min: Another shot from Neto. This time he forces a save from Pop after it take a deflection from outside the box. It still required saving and a diving effort kept it out and behind for a corner. 40 min: Palmer sparks another move after a slick nutmeg in the middle of the park. It\u2019s then moved on to Madueke who cuts infield from the right. Rather than shoot he feeds Neto who checks once, twice, and then lets fly, but a great block Livramento sees it out for a corner. 38 min: James is biffed by Almiron on halfway and the Newcastle forward gets a stern word from the ref. Chelsea have responded well since the goal. They\u2019re a bit more controlled in possession with Lavia seeing more of it in central midfield. 36 min: I said this had all the ingredients of a proper ding-dong battle, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got so far. Chelsea nick the ball off Newcastle and the space opens for Caicedo on the edge of the box, but his shot is sliced and ends up well wide. He\u2019s onside! The check is over and the goal stands. A well worked move on the right of Chelsea\u2019s box has Hall firing in a low ball across the face of the goal that takes out the keeper and two defenders. Isak is there to knock it home. Has Fofana\u2019s right boot kept Isak onside? It\u2019s a long delay. I think he\u2019s off. We\u2019re level! Or are we? They\u2019re checking if Isak strayed offside before bundling in a goal. 31 min: It\u2019s end to end! I can barely keep up. Now Newcastle have a corner and Isak gets away from his marker, but he can\u2019t get his head around the ball enough and his effort from the near post goes wide. 29 min: Palmer delivers a wicked corner that forces Pope to punch from his own line. But Newcastle get a let-off when Fofana commits a silly foul. 27 min: Three Newcastle shots serve as a reminder that they won\u2019t lie down. The first two \u2013 from Isak and Tonali \u2013 are blocked. Almiron gets his through the defensive wall but Sanchez saves easily. It all started with a great ball forward for Isak who then showed some neat footwork to hold up play in time for his mates to arrive in support. 26 min: Gusto, from inside the box, can\u2019t connect with his first time shot as he runs onto a deep cross from Neto. He had the time and space, but slipped just as he attempted a side-footer. 25 min: Chelsea are camped inside Newcastle\u2019s territory. Palmer is pulling the strings with Madueke offered loads of space to shoot, but it\u2019s blocked. They come again. A cross just evades Jackson but Newcastle can\u2019t escape. James and Gusto are effectively playing in the midfield they\u2019re so advanced. 22 min: Schar is booked for clattering Palmer. Neto then crunches a first time shot from the edge of the box straight at Pope. It\u2019s all Chelsea right now. 22 min: You\u2019ll want to find a replay of that Chelsea goal simply to see Palmer\u2019s pass. It could well be a contender for the ball of the season so far. He won\u2019t get the assist but it made the goal. 20 min: Guimaraes finds Almiron with a slick through ball forward towards the edge of the box. Almiron takes a decent first touch but his second is woeful and the shot bobbles wide. No doubt this time! Brilliant from Chelsea. A wonder ball from Palmer from deep in his own half, having wriggled the room for himself, finds Neto on the gallop down the left. Suddenly it\u2019s a two on two and Neto played in the perfect pass for Jackson in the middle of the box and his finish was stiff and accurate. Excellent counter attack from Chelsea. 18 min: Both sides are living dangerously. Snachez\u2019s pass upfield is intercepted but Isak couldn\u2019t sort his feet out in time to captalise. Then Jackson is given the freedom to run but a late intervention sees out the danger. 16 min: Guimaraes goes down in the box after bursting through a wall of blue shirts. He\u2019s told to get up but he looked convinced. He\u2019s struggling to get back up and is met with a chorus of boos. Oh, he was definitely clipped, but it was outside the box. Which means VAR can\u2019t get involved. Newcastle would have taken the free-kick though. 15 min: Reece clips in the corner which is headed away, but only as far as Neto on the edge of the box who volleys first time. That looked good but was met with a firm block. 14 min: Hall\u2019s in-swinger is too deep and Chelsea deal with it. But Newcastle come back with Barnes. Then Chelsea counter and win a corner of their own as Neto\u2019s cross from the byline is deflected out. 13 min: Joelinton has been lively. A strong run down the right wins his side a corner. 10 min: Chelsea\u2019s press is functioning so well and they pinch the ball back from Newcastle\u2019s back four. But Joelinton returns the favour and launches a counter from inside Chelsea\u2019s half. They can\u2019t work a decent chance \u2013 just a pop shot from range that\u2019s deflected safely to Sanchez - and there\u2019s a break as Fofan requires some medical attention. 8 min: A huge let off for Newcastle who now settle with some time on the ball. But Chelsea press them and almost win it back in the final third. Palmer\u2019s goal is chalked off! He was off by a whisker. What a shame, that finish deserved a goal. It\u2019s so tight. I think he might be just a touch off. So simple! And who else but Palmer. A perfect run from the inside left channel is found by Jackson and he\u2019s away. All he has to do is slide it into the far corner and he does so with ease. Oh, but they\u2019re checking it\u2026. was he offside? Yes he was! No goal! 3 min: Jackson collects a ball around halfway and takes a brilliant first touch as he spins away from his man and startsc antering upfield. A short pass to his right finds Madueke who opens his body but it\u2019s a tame shot and Pope saves. 1 min: An early touch for Pope. A cross from Madueke on the right is snaffled by the \u2018keeper. And we\u2019re off! The players are out and Stamford Bridge looks a picture! Chelsea in their royal blue, Newcastle in their black and white stripes. This feels like a proper Premier League bout! Chelsea fans, what do you make of Nicolas Jackson? A goal or two today could bring a few more doubters on his side. But another tough day in what has been described as a \u2018faltering start\u2019 to the season could heap more pressure on the lad and force his manager to make a tough decision moving forward. We\u2019ve got out first mail of the day from Eric Peterson on the other side of the Atlantic. Good morning from Pittsburgh! Slogging through the most annoying weekend of my Premier League season: when the UK departs daylight savings time and the USA has yet to do so. This totally upsets my established Sunday rhythm of the Premier League dovetailing with the NFL. Annoying. With this comes the inevitable anxious lap around this website\u2019s sports links wondering why I can\u2019t find the doggone link to the early MBM - because it won\u2019t be put online for another hour, Eric. Sigh. Year after year. I never learn. The highest-quality pranks, Halloween or otherwise, self-inflicted or not, are the inadvertent ones. Eric, we are one and the same. Coming from a country that doesn\u2019t bother with daylight savings, I still can\u2019t get my head around this ridiculous approach. I don\u2019t care if it helps the farmers. It does my head in! In news that will surprise absolutely no one, Roy Keane supports Enzo Maresca publicly calling out Reece James. Jonathan Liew speaks with Marcel Desailly. Does that need a hard sell? Trust me, this is a cracking piece thanks to two legends in their field. If you thought I wasn\u2019t going to share this goal again, you were very much mistaken. An absolute worldie from 2012 from one of my favourite players in the league\u2019s history. It\u2019s been a week of managers publicly blasting their players. OK, maybe blasting is a bit strong. But both Eddie Howe and Enzo Maresca have singled out big players and have asked them to pull up their socks. Maresca said he \u201cexpected more\u201d from Reece James, adding that the Blues\u2019 dressing room lacked a \u201cproper leader\u201d. Yeowch! Meanwhile, Howe told Alexander Isak to \u201cfocus on football\u201d as the out-of-form Swedish striker unsure on his future at the club. With an average age of 23 years and 220 days, Chelsea\u2019s starting XI across the season is the youngest in Premier League history. They\u2019re currently ahead of David O\u2019Leary\u2019s Leeds who finished third in 2000 with an average starting XI aged 24 years and 162 days. Two changes as well for Newcastle from their last outing. They\u2019re both on the wings with Jacob Murphy making way for Miguel Almiron on the left. Big news on the right. Anthony Gordon is out with a groin injury and is replaced by Harvey Barnes. Newcastle: Pope; Livramento, Schar, Burn, Hall; Tonali, Guimaraes, Joelinton; Almiron, Isak, Barnes. Subs: Odysseas, Ruddy, Krafth, Osula, Murphy, Kelly, Willock, Longstaff, Miley. Two changes to the side that lost to Liverpool last week. Wesley Fofana comes into the back four in place of Tosin Adarabioyo. In midfield, Pedro Neto replaces Jadon Sancho on the left. Chelsea: Sanchez; James, Fofana, Colwill, Gusto; Lavia, Caicedo; Madueke, Palmer, Neto; Jackson. Subs: Jorgensen, Tosin, Veiga, Cucurella, Enzo, Mudryk, Sancho, Felix, Nkunku. On paper, this looks like a cracking contest. Two flawed but enterprising teams, both filled with attacking talent and the ever-present risk of implosion. If you\u2019re a neutral this is exactly what you want for the Sunday 2pm slot under gorgeous blue skies in London. Both Chelsea and Newcastle are also after redemption. The Blues went down 2-1 to Liverpool last time out in the league while the Mapgies suffered a shock 1-0 reverse at home to Brighton. Chelsea, currently seventh, could move up to fourth above Arsenal (at least temporarily). Newcastle have had a pretty shambolic start to their campaign and will be desperate for at least a point that would lift them into the top half of the table. A defeat, though, could see them finish the weekend in 13th. To be frank, anything other than a Chelsea win would come as a surprise. The Blues have not lost a home league game to Newcastle since 2012 and the visitors have struggled for goals recently. But, as the great F1 commentator Murray Walker famously quipped, anything can happen and it usually does. Kick-off at 2pm BST. Lineups and more news to come.",

It was one of few clear chances for the visitors, most of their openings coming when Chelsea\u2019s intensity and composure went awry.</p> \n<p>That still happens too often but Chelsea will always have a chance of picking opponents off as long as Palmer is in view. He beat Nick Pope within four minutes of kick-off, scuffing in via the far post after fine work by Jackson, but the muted nature of his celebration conveyed a fear VAR would spoil the fun. Indeed it did, replays showing Palmer had strayed a mite offside, but a fast start would yield legitimate reward soon enough.</p> \n<p>While Jackson\u2019s finish, converted crisply on the run, was simple enough it was worth dwelling on a breathtaking buildup. Palmer\u2019s whipped pass from inside the Chelsea half took Tino Livramento completely out of the picture and sent Pedro Neto, who snicked the ball away from a sliding Fabian Sch\u00e4r, in full flight down the left. The resulting tee-up was perfect, the overall impression exhilarating.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason people come to the stadium is to see players like him,\u201d Maresca said of Palmer. \u201cThey pay to see that kind of player.\u201d He did not shy away from comparing the 22-year-old to Gianfranco Zola, who had lavished praise on one of his successors donning Chelsea\u2019s creative mantle earlier in the day, saying: \u201cThey are quite similar in terms of quality.\u201d</p> \n<p>Palmer would soon show that again, but first Chelsea had to suffer the inconvenience of an equaliser that Newcastle had signposted. Anthony Gordon, their closest Palmer analogue, was missing with a groin injury that Howe said will require a scan but Isak and Harvey Barnes were causing flutters. When the latter, taking possession after a meticulously constructed move that picked through Chelsea\u2019s midfield, found Lewis Hall on the overlap the position invited a lurking centre-forward to scent blood. Hall, on his old stomping ground, delivered perfectly and Isak bundled in at waist height. The goal, Newcastle\u2019s first from open play since 21 September, was subjected to its own VAR review but survived.</p> \n<p>\u201cI felt the momentum was with us,\u201d Howe said, although Pope had to save spectacularly when the sparky Neto unloaded a shot which took a deflection. By the end of the first period Maresca was sufficiently exasperated to take his annoyance at refereeing decisions, and perhaps the fact Chelsea\u2019s ideas were running dry, out on his seat; 75 seconds after the interval he was leaping out of it as Palmer ensured all was forgotten.</p> \n<p>Isak failed to hold the ball up on halfway and a prod from Rom\u00e9o Lavia was enough to send his teammate scampering into the chasm between midfield and defence. There is always the sense Palmer will deliver in these situations and he justified it with a firm, low finish from 15 yards. Pope will regret being beaten at his near post despite the shot\u2019s crispness.</p> \n<p>Chelsea briefly looked like running away with it, Neto leaping high but striking an upright. They can be explosive but the corollary appears to be an inability to slow down, to put method before mayhem. \u201cI was shouting all the game: \u2018Calm, calm, calm, make passes,\u2019\u201d said Maresca, who is no model of serenity himself. \u201cThere are games, especially today, where if you do a basketball game they\u2019ll destroy you.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Isak should have proved the point during a scratchy spell in which Newcastle found a second wind.

The resulting tee-up was perfect, the overall impression exhilarating. \u201cThe reason people come to the stadium is to see players like him,\u201d Maresca said of Palmer. \u201cThey pay to see that kind of player.\u201d He did not shy away from comparing the 22-year-old to Gianfranco Zola, who had lavished praise on one of his successors donning Chelsea\u2019s creative mantle earlier in the day, saying: \u201cThey are quite similar in terms of quality.\u201d Palmer would soon show that again, but first Chelsea had to suffer the inconvenience of an equaliser that Newcastle had signposted. Anthony Gordon, their closest Palmer analogue, was missing with a groin injury that Howe said will require a scan but Isak and Harvey Barnes were causing flutters. When the latter, taking possession after a meticulously constructed move that picked through Chelsea\u2019s midfield, found Lewis Hall on the overlap the position invited a lurking centre-forward to scent blood. Hall, on his old stomping ground, delivered perfectly and Isak bundled in at waist height. The goal, Newcastle\u2019s first from open play since 21 September, was subjected to its own VAR review but survived. \u201cI felt the momentum was with us,\u201d Howe said, although Pope had to save spectacularly when the sparky Neto unloaded a shot which took a deflection. By the end of the first period Maresca was sufficiently exasperated to take his annoyance at refereeing decisions, and perhaps the fact Chelsea\u2019s ideas were running dry, out on his seat; 75 seconds after the interval he was leaping out of it as Palmer ensured all was forgotten. Isak failed to hold the ball up on halfway and a prod from Rom\u00e9o Lavia was enough to send his teammate scampering into the chasm between midfield and defence. There is always the sense Palmer will deliver in these situations and he justified it with a firm, low finish from 15 yards. Pope will regret being beaten at his near post despite the shot\u2019s crispness. Chelsea briefly looked like running away with it, Neto leaping high but striking an upright. They can be explosive but the corollary appears to be an inability to slow down, to put method before mayhem. \u201cI was shouting all the game: \u2018Calm, calm, calm, make passes,\u2019\u201d said Maresca, who is no model of serenity himself. \u201cThere are games, especially today, where if you do a basketball game they\u2019ll destroy you.\u201d Isak should have proved the point during a scratchy spell in which Newcastle found a second wind. The pass to an open Joelinton was on from near the byline but he allowed Levi Colwill to rescue the situation, Howe later cutting a more conciliatory figure than the one that cursed by the side. \u201cAlex is moving at 100 miles per hour and you\u2019ve got to make split-second decisions,\u201d he said. Palmer got the big calls right, and therein lay the difference. \u201cOn the ball we were unbelievable in some moments,\u201d Maresca said. Chelsea and their star turn continue to grow in credibility.",

      "bodyText": "The multi-billionaire owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, continued facing criticism throughout the weekend because executives from his aerospace company met with Donald Trump on the same day the newspaper prevented its editorial team from publishing an endorsement of his opponent in the US presidential election. Senior news and opinion leaders at the Washington Post flew to Miami in late September 2024 to meet with Bezos, who had reservations about the paper issuing an endorsement in the 5 November election, the New York Times reported. Amazon and the space exploration company Blue Origin are among Bezos-owned businesses that still compete for lucrative federal government contracts. And the Post on Friday announced it would not endorse a candidate in the 5 November election after its editorial board had already drafted its endorsement of Kamala Harris. Friday\u2019s announcement did not mention Amazon or Blue Origin. But within hours, high-ranking officials of the latter company briefly met with Trump after a campaign speech in Austin, Texas, as the Republican nominee seeks a second presidency. Trump met with the Blue Origin chief executive officer, David Limp, and vice-president of government relations, Megan Mitchell, the Associated Press reported. Meanwhile, CNN reported that the Amazon CEO, Andy Jassy, had also recently reached out to speak with the former president by phone. Those reported overtures were eviscerated by the Washington Post editor-at-large and longtime columnist Robert Kagan, who resigned on Friday. On Saturday, he argued that the meeting Blue Origin executives had with Trump would not have taken place if the Post had endorsed the Democratic vice-president as it planned. \u201cTrump waited to make sure that Bezos did what he said he was going to do \u2013 and then met with the Blue Origin people,\u201d Kagan told the Daily Beast on Saturday. \u201cWhich tells us that there was an actual deal made, meaning that Bezos communicated, or through his people, communicated directly with Trump, and they set up this quid pro quo.\u201d The Post\u2019s publisher, Will Lewis, hired by Bezos in January, defended the paper\u2019s owner by claiming the decision to spike the Harris endorsement was his. But that has done little to defuse criticism from within the newspaper\u2019s ranks as well as the wave of subscription cancelations that has met the institution. Eighteen opinion columnists at the Washington Post signed a dissenting column against the decision, calling it \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d. The paper has already made endorsements this election cycle, including in a US Senate seat race in Maryland. The Washington Post endorsed Hillary Clinton when Trump won the presidency in 2016. It endorsed Joe Biden when Trump lost in 2020, despite Trump\u2019s pledges to retaliate against anyone who opposed him. In their criticism of the Post\u2019s decision on Friday, former and current employees cited the dangers to democracy posed by Trump, who has openly expressed his admiration for authoritarian rule amid his appeals for voters to return him to office. The former Washington Post journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who broke the Watergate story, called the decision \u201cdisappointing, especially this late in the electoral process\u201d. The former Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron said in a post on X: \u201cThis is cowardice with democracy as its casualty.\u201d The cartoon team at the paper published a dark formless image protesting against the non-endorsement decision, playing on the \u201cdemocracy dies in darkness\u201d slogan that the Post adopted in 2017, five years after its purchase by Bezos. High-profile readers, including the bestselling author Stephen King as well as the former congresswoman and vocal Trump critic Liz Cheney, announced the cancellation of their Washington Post subscriptions with many others in protest. The Post\u2019s non-endorsement came shortly after the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, refused to allow the editorial board publish an endorsement of Harris. Many pointed out how the stances from the Post and the LA Times seems to fit the definition of \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d as spelled out in On Tyranny, Tim Snyder\u2019s bestselling guide to authoritarianism. Snyder defines the term as \u201cgiving over your power to the aspiring authoritarian\u201d before the authoritarian is in position to compel that handover. Bezos is the second wealthiest person in the world behind Elon Musk, who has become a prominent supporter of Trump\u2019s campaign for a second presidency. He bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250m. In 2021, Bezos stepped down as CEO of Amazon, claiming during a podcast interview that he intended to devote more time to Blue Origin. The New York Times reported Bezos had begun to get more involved in the paper in 2023 as it faced significant financial losses, a stream of employee departures and low morale. His pick of Lewis as publisher in January seemingly did little to help morale at the paper. Employees and devotees of the paper were worried that Lewis was brought on to the Post despite allegations that he \u201cfraudulently obtained phone and company records in newspaper articles\u201d as a journalist in London, as the New York Times reported. Nonetheless, in a memo to newsroom leaders in June 2024, Bezos wrote: \u201cThe journalistic standards and ethics at the Post will not change.\u201d",

It\u2019s not a matter of instructing people about what shots they can and can\u2019t play. That\u2019s got a very short shelf life. These guys are able to play the game a lot better than perhaps we could ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>It is safe to say that none of his players felt 10ft tall at the time, having over the last two games of the series taken it in turns to be reduced to rubble by the spin of Sajid Khan and Noman Ali, and by the batting of Kamran Ghulam and Saud Shakeel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/27/ben-stokes-hurting-after-test-series-defeat-in-pakistan-says-brendon-mccullum\">Ben Stokes \u2018hurting\u2019 after Test series defeat in Pakistan, says Brendon McCullum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For a while in Pakistan they had stood tall, and shortly after drinks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/oct/16/pakistan-v-england-second-cricket-test-day-two-live-score-updates?page=with:block-670fa81e8f0898da3e0b586c#block-670fa81e8f0898da3e0b586c\">on the second day</a> of the second Test England had over the series thus far scored a ludicrous 1,034 for nine. When Ben Stokes said that there were \u201cmany times in the last two Tests you would argue we were in front of the game and we let that slip\u201d, this was the one above all others, the moment victory was within their grasp. From there until defeat was confirmed in Rawalpindi they scored 603 for 38.</p> <p>As it all fell apart across Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, there were times when England seemed to be batting as if the outcome, individually and collectively, didn\u2019t really matter. In many ways they would have been right: they do not play another Test in Asia until they visit Bangladesh in 2027, their chances of reaching the World Test Championship final next year were already over, and in less than a month they will be in New Zealand preparing for another series, this one vanishing already in the rearview mirror.</p> <p>\u201cIn the end they were much better than us in these conditions,\u201d McCullum summarised, approximating the sound of a shrug. Asked if England\u2019s often catastrophic batting against spin was a concern, Stokes said: \u201cIf you look into it very deeply, which is something I don\u2019t like to do, I could maybe say yes.\u201d It could be argued that the England captain should look into it pretty deeply, but given his own struggles across the series he probably has enough on his mind.</p> <p>What, anyway, are the repercussions of failure in this England squad? The answer is not always clear, certainly for the batters. Ollie Pope had an abysmal series, averaging 11; in seven of his past 11 innings he has scored fewer than eight runs and he has reached 30 only once. But not only is his position not under threat, England do not even have an obvious alternative top-order batter to cover for injury or illness. Pope bats at No 3 because nobody else in the squad wants to, and nobody outside it has been considered.</p>    <p>\u201cNo 3 is a tough place to bat,\u201d McCullum said of Pope. \u201cHe\u2019s still a really important part for us. He\u2019ll benefit from a couple of weeks out and he\u2019ll get another opportunity when we head to New Zealand in conditions where he\u2019ll hopefully be able to flourish.\u201d Surely those three games represent a chance Pope must take.</p> <p>Sajid and Noman, who between them took 39 of a possible 40 wickets in the last two Tests, did not just show up the touring batters. England\u2019s spinners had the obvious disadvantage of not bowling at their own teammates on turning pitches \u2013 so called because they turn English brains to mush \u2013 but obviously they were outbowled, and they could work in particular on improving their variations of pace.</p> <p>Last week Stokes said of Shoaib Bashir: \u201cWe see him now as our spinner across the world,\u201d which put Jack Leach in his place. England are unlikely to field multiple specialist spinners many times between now and that trip to Bangladesh and he is already 33; perhaps this for him is the end of the road. Having turned 21 in Pakistan, Bashir is both a short\u2011term gamble and a long-term investment. Stokes said: \u201cI said to him the other day: \u2018You\u2019re getting to learn on the job here. You\u2019re getting to learn about yourself as a bowler while you\u2019re in a Test match, and how exciting is that?\u2019\u201d There is no guarantee of success, but it also promises to be quite exciting to watch.</p> <p>Jamie Smith, also learning on the job, made a couple of embarrassing errors behind the stumps, a flubbed stumping in the first Test and a bungled catch in the second, and it is true that games can turn on such moments but he remains heavily in credit. Ben Duckett was excellent, Gus Atkinson similar, and Brydon Carse bowled superbly in extremely taxing conditions. For all the sense of crisis at its conclusion, there are plenty of positives to take out of the series.</p> <p>Besides, it could be argued that this team, at least outside the Ashes, is not particularly focused on winning, that taking part in three brilliantly entertaining Tests was \u2013 and should be \u2013 a victory in itself. Results are not the only things that matter. As Shan Masood, the Pakistan captain, put it on Saturday: \u201cI think they\u2019re one of the best teams in the world. Sometimes scorecards can be a bad reflection of how good actually you are.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201c\u2018It\u2019s about mindset,\u201d Brendon McCullum said, early on Saturday afternoon, while Pakistan\u2019s players were still celebrating on the outfield with their trophy and their fans. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting players who feel 10ft tall and bulletproof when they go out to play. It\u2019s not a matter of instructing people about what shots they can and can\u2019t play. That\u2019s got a very short shelf life. These guys are able to play the game a lot better than perhaps we could ourselves.\u201d It is safe to say that none of his players felt 10ft tall at the time, having over the last two games of the series taken it in turns to be reduced to rubble by the spin of Sajid Khan and Noman Ali, and by the batting of Kamran Ghulam and Saud Shakeel. For a while in Pakistan they had stood tall, and shortly after drinks on the second day of the second Test England had over the series thus far scored a ludicrous 1,034 for nine. When Ben Stokes said that there were \u201cmany times in the last two Tests you would argue we were in front of the game and we let that slip\u201d, this was the one above all others, the moment victory was within their grasp. From there until defeat was confirmed in Rawalpindi they scored 603 for 38. As it all fell apart across Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, there were times when England seemed to be batting as if the outcome, individually and collectively, didn\u2019t really matter. In many ways they would have been right: they do not play another Test in Asia until they visit Bangladesh in 2027, their chances of reaching the World Test Championship final next year were already over, and in less than a month they will be in New Zealand preparing for another series, this one vanishing already in the rearview mirror. \u201cIn the end they were much better than us in these conditions,\u201d McCullum summarised, approximating the sound of a shrug. Asked if England\u2019s often catastrophic batting against spin was a concern, Stokes said: \u201cIf you look into it very deeply, which is something I don\u2019t like to do, I could maybe say yes.\u201d It could be argued that the England captain should look into it pretty deeply, but given his own struggles across the series he probably has enough on his mind. What, anyway, are the repercussions of failure in this England squad? The answer is not always clear, certainly for the batters. Ollie Pope had an abysmal series, averaging 11; in seven of his past 11 innings he has scored fewer than eight runs and he has reached 30 only once. But not only is his position not under threat, England do not even have an obvious alternative top-order batter to cover for injury or illness. Pope bats at No 3 because nobody else in the squad wants to, and nobody outside it has been considered. \u201cNo 3 is a tough place to bat,\u201d McCullum said of Pope. \u201cHe\u2019s still a really important part for us. He\u2019ll benefit from a couple of weeks out and he\u2019ll get another opportunity when we head to New Zealand in conditions where he\u2019ll hopefully be able to flourish.\u201d Surely those three games represent a chance Pope must take. Sajid and Noman, who between them took 39 of a possible 40 wickets in the last two Tests, did not just show up the touring batters. England\u2019s spinners had the obvious disadvantage of not bowling at their own teammates on turning pitches \u2013 so called because they turn English brains to mush \u2013 but obviously they were outbowled, and they could work in particular on improving their variations of pace. Last week Stokes said of Shoaib Bashir: \u201cWe see him now as our spinner across the world,\u201d which put Jack Leach in his place. England are unlikely to field multiple specialist spinners many times between now and that trip to Bangladesh and he is already 33; perhaps this for him is the end of the road. Having turned 21 in Pakistan, Bashir is both a short\u2011term gamble and a long-term investment. Stokes said: \u201cI said to him the other day: \u2018You\u2019re getting to learn on the job here. You\u2019re getting to learn about yourself as a bowler while you\u2019re in a Test match, and how exciting is that?\u2019\u201d There is no guarantee of success, but it also promises to be quite exciting to watch. Jamie Smith, also learning on the job, made a couple of embarrassing errors behind the stumps, a flubbed stumping in the first Test and a bungled catch in the second, and it is true that games can turn on such moments but he remains heavily in credit. Ben Duckett was excellent, Gus Atkinson similar, and Brydon Carse bowled superbly in extremely taxing conditions. For all the sense of crisis at its conclusion, there are plenty of positives to take out of the series. Besides, it could be argued that this team, at least outside the Ashes, is not particularly focused on winning, that taking part in three brilliantly entertaining Tests was \u2013 and should be \u2013 a victory in itself. Results are not the only things that matter. As Shan Masood, the Pakistan captain, put it on Saturday: \u201cI think they\u2019re one of the best teams in the world. Sometimes scorecards can be a bad reflection of how good actually you are.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Now is the time to \u201cinvest, and invest big\u201d in radical millennium-style arts and culture projects across the UK, an economist has urged ahead of the Labour government\u2019s first budget on Wednesday. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, needs to urgently fund projects that \u201cmake lives livable\u201d to help rebuild deprived parts of the country, said Andy Haldane, the chief executive of the Royal Society for Arts and former chief economist at the Bank of England. Haldane said this should include making a \u201cbig, bold bet\u201d similar to that made in the run-up to the year 2000 when the Millennium Commission, which was set up by the Conservative government and continued after 1997 under Labour, provided \u00a32bn of national lottery funding to dozens of now iconic arts and culture institutions. These have included the Eden Project in Cornwall, the Wales Millennium Centre, The Deep aquarium in Hull, the Glasgow Science Centre and the Millennium Dome (now the O2 Arena). Many were built on brownfield sites, particularly in areas with high levels of deprivation, and in some cases this has led to dramatic economic transformations of the areas. \u201cTo grow in the north and elsewhere, we need to invest and invest big, because we\u2019ve underinvested too much for too long and that now needs to be reversed,\u201d Haldane told the Guardian. \u201cIn making those investment choices, let\u2019s put front and centre the sort of social infrastructures that are crucial to people\u2019s everyday experiences, to how much they enjoy the place that they live.\u201d He said cultural institutions provided \u201ca sense of joy and a sense of pride, a sense of belonging\u201d and \u201cif you underinvest in them, you find communities falling apart\u201d. \u201cThere was a correlation between those places over the summer that experienced riots and the amount of money that had been spent in investing in what I\u2019ve called their social infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t just good for our sense of joy and wellbeing and health, jobs and skills. These are also the community glue that enable communities to stick together rather than fall apart. Nothing is more important in the UK now than that.\u201d Haldane said there were already \u201cpockets of brilliance\u201d in the creative economy, citing the Millennium-funded Lowry theatre in Salford, where he launched the RSA\u2019s Creative Corridors report, a policy idea for accelerating growth by joining up creative hotspots throughout the UK, in collaboration with the Arts Council, Creative PEC and metro mayors including Tracy Brabin, the mayor of West Yorkshire, and Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester. The Lowry was built on the derelict Salford Docks, which in the years since has become a thriving hub, home to Media City and Imperial War Museum North. \u201cYou see it all the time. You need some anchor for a place and then all of a sudden you get what we nerdy economists call agglomeration,\u201d he said, citing the redevelopment of the King\u2019s Cross area of London as another example of how economic activity clustered around an existing hub. \u201cSomeone needs to make the first move, right? To make a big, bold bet on a place and say \u2018I\u2019m doing it\u2019. Where someone leads, others are less fearful about treading, and before you know it you\u2019ve transformed a place.\u201d Ahead of the budget, Haldane also called specifically for tax credits on research and development to be extended to include creative innovation, to help boost a sector of the economy that has bucked the trend of decline and still has plenty of room for growth. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre that our key incentive scheme for investment in the creative industries currently disadvantages those very industries and that very innovation that we think is most important.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2024. In an earlier version, we said the Millennium Commission was set up by the Labour government in the run-up to the year 2000; in fact it was established in 1993 under the Conservatives, with the funding of projects continuing under the Labour government from 1997 until the commission was dissolved in 2006.",

But speculation about the country\u2019s political future after a tightly contested vote will be competing for space with another event taking place thousands of miles away. And all because of one man: Shohei Ohtani. On Tuesday in Japan, millions of people are expected to devour every pitch and hit in the next instalment of the seven-game World Series between Ohtani\u2019s Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees, with enthusiasm reaching levels usually reserved for the climax of domestic baseball, the Japan Series. An injury scare notwithstanding, not even the tricky time difference \u2013 New York is 13 hours behind Tokyo \u2013 will deter the legions of Ohtani devotees, including a good number with little or no previous interest in the sport.

Early TV viewing for the World Series figures from Japan have yet to be released, but there will be no surprise if they exceed the 13 million \u2013 about 10% of the population \u2013 who tuned into the decisive fifth game of the Dodgers-San Diego Padres National League Division Series earlier this month. Robert Whiting, an authority on Japanese baseball and author of a book about Ichiro Suzuki \u2013 one of Japan\u2019s MLB trailblazers \u2013 attributes Ohtani\u2019s popularity at home not just to his easygoing manner and philanthropy, but also to his ability to \u201cget the better of American players on their own terms\u201d. \u201cCritics of Japanese baseball say the players are good at the fundamentals but don\u2019t have the size and strength of their American counterparts, that they have turned baseball into a kind of martial art with endless training and a focus on spirit,\u201d Whiting said. \u201cBut Ohtani is bigger than most American players.

Not even the arrest of his interpreter and friend, Ippei Mizuhara, has dented Ohtani\u2019s popularity. Mizuhara pleaded guilty to stealing millions of dollars from the player\u2019s bank account to pay off gambling debts to an illegal bookmaker. Ohtani\u2019s 50th home run ball from this season sold at auction for $4.39m, a record high price for any ball in any sport, and is now the property of a Taiwanese investment firm that fended off rival bids from Japan. Fans from Japan bought more World Series tickets for the first two games of the series than from anywhere outside North America, according to reports, while the start of the latest series of the popular anime series One Piece has been delayed by a week to avoid a scheduling conflict with the baseball. Japanese expectations of Ohtani have shifted from high to stratospheric following an extraordinary first year with the Dodgers. As the regular season reached its climax, he became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases, and ended with a 54-59 record.

      "body": "<p>Opposition to the assisted dying bill is growing in parliament after the interventions of the health and justice secretaries to call for caution \u2013 and a backlash among new MPs who are angered by the speed of the legislation.</p> <p>Rachael Maskell, the former Labour shadow minister who chairs the Dying Well all-party parliamentary group against assisted dying, told the Guardian she and others had been meeting dozens of undecided MPs and hoped to persuade them to vote down the bill and push instead for a wide-ranging commission that would explore better palliative care.</p> <p>The Guardian understands there is particular anger among new Labour MPs about the speed of the bill. The House of Commons will vote on the private member\u2019s bill led by the MP Kim Leadbeater in five weeks\u2019 time and there is growing concern that full details of the legislation are yet to be published.</p> <p>Keir Starmer is known to be a keen supporter of the proposed change but has said there will be a free vote for MPs.</p> <p>A number of senior politicians have expressed opposition to the bill in recent days. One key factor in the debate among MPs has been the decisions of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to say they will vote against the bill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/16/assisted-dying-bill-mps-england-wales-panel\">Should MPs legalise assisted dying? Our panel responds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among those who are deeply torn there is a strong feeling that the vote should not take place until the government can show significant improvements to the state of the NHS \u2013 or risk sending a dangerous message. There are also grave doubts about the process of the private member\u2019s bill, with just two Fridays to debate it. Several stressed, however, that they did not blame Leadbeater.</p> <p>Maskell, who was part of a 14-month inquiry into assisted dying while she was on the Commons health select committee, said there were still key outstanding issues. She claimed there would be little time to press for clarity on issues such as whether doctors would have to opt out or opt in to carry out the procedure to end a life.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very detailed, involved, complex area of healthcare and it\u2019s got to be treated with that gravity, I think, and I just don\u2019t get the sense that the five-hour parliamentary debate will even touch on that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Maskell said MPs would be pushing for the government to instead announce a commission on palliative care, as a way to address many of the horror stories that have been raised as a reason to back assisted dying for those terminally ill and in great pain and distress.</p> <p>Maskell said she and both of her former colleagues on the select committee who remained in parliament, Dr Caroline Johnson and Paulette Hamilton, were against the bill. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones that have kind of really lived and breathed this for a significant amount of time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Maskell, who is a religious Christian, denied that faith was the key factor for many opposed, saying there were many atheist MPs who were opposed and motivated by a human rights and equality perspective.</p> <p>\u201cBoth Wes and Shabana are the two cabinet members that have the responsibility for implementing this, and when they\u2019ve dug into the issue, they\u2019ve expressed a concern,\u201d Maskell said. \u201cThey really should be listened to.\u201d</p> <p>She said there was very little time for opponents to make their case. \u201cThe second reading on 29 November is really the day to defeat the bill and to say actually we don\u2019t have to do this [in the] first six months of a Labour government. It isn\u2019t the only vehicle in town, we can do something else.\u201d</p> <p>Streeting told MPs he had been persuaded because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/20/end-of-life-care-in-england-and-wales-cant-cope-with-demand-say-doctors-opposed-to-assisted-dying\">poor state of palliative care</a>, despite having voted for assisted dying the last time around. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, was also previously a member of the APPG against assisted dying. But other cabinet ministers have said they are in favour, including the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, and the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy.</p> <p>Among Conservative MPs, the issue is split down the middle. \u201cI think that it\u2019s very much a case of a core number of religious ones who are against it, a core number of people who through personal or constituency experience are very strongly in favour, and then a number who are very torn,\u201d one senior Conservative said. \u201cBut I think there is a growing feeling of \u2018is this the right way to do this?\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, who has a disabled son and whose wife has MS, has said he will vote against the bill.</p> <p>Cabinet ministers are not expected to campaign on the issue. Earlier this month, the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, wrote to ministers to say they \u201cshould exercise discretion and should not take part in the public debate\u201d.</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s support has been very influential for a number of MPs, however, and there are others in all the parties who are passionate supporters of the legal change, backed by three-quarters of the public, according to some polls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/20/doctor-spared-by-keir-starmer-from-assisted-dying-charges-says-pm-wants-change-in-law\">Doctor spared by Keir Starmer from assisted dying charges \u2018is sure PM wants law change\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a survey of MPs published earlier this month, just over half of those who responded backed legalisation in the case of terminal illness.</p> <p>Esther Rantzen, the celebrity backer of the assisted dying law change, to whom Starmer promised he would hold a vote on the issue, wrote to Streeting late this week to say she was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in his decision and accused him of \u201cignoring the government\u2019s request to stay neutral\u201d.</p> <p>She told the Express that Streeting should know \u201ceven the best palliative care cannot always protect patients from dying in agony, and their families and doctors watching helplessly\u201d.</p> <p>Maskell, a former physiotherapist, said taking part in the health and social care select committee inquiry into assisted dying had left her extremely concerned about the procedure.

      "bodyText": "Opposition to the assisted dying bill is growing in parliament after the interventions of the health and justice secretaries to call for caution \u2013 and a backlash among new MPs who are angered by the speed of the legislation. Rachael Maskell, the former Labour shadow minister who chairs the Dying Well all-party parliamentary group against assisted dying, told the Guardian she and others had been meeting dozens of undecided MPs and hoped to persuade them to vote down the bill and push instead for a wide-ranging commission that would explore better palliative care. The Guardian understands there is particular anger among new Labour MPs about the speed of the bill. The House of Commons will vote on the private member\u2019s bill led by the MP Kim Leadbeater in five weeks\u2019 time and there is growing concern that full details of the legislation are yet to be published. Keir Starmer is known to be a keen supporter of the proposed change but has said there will be a free vote for MPs. A number of senior politicians have expressed opposition to the bill in recent days. One key factor in the debate among MPs has been the decisions of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to say they will vote against the bill. Among those who are deeply torn there is a strong feeling that the vote should not take place until the government can show significant improvements to the state of the NHS \u2013 or risk sending a dangerous message. There are also grave doubts about the process of the private member\u2019s bill, with just two Fridays to debate it. Several stressed, however, that they did not blame Leadbeater. Maskell, who was part of a 14-month inquiry into assisted dying while she was on the Commons health select committee, said there were still key outstanding issues. She claimed there would be little time to press for clarity on issues such as whether doctors would have to opt out or opt in to carry out the procedure to end a life. \u201cIt\u2019s a very detailed, involved, complex area of healthcare and it\u2019s got to be treated with that gravity, I think, and I just don\u2019t get the sense that the five-hour parliamentary debate will even touch on that,\u201d she said. Maskell said MPs would be pushing for the government to instead announce a commission on palliative care, as a way to address many of the horror stories that have been raised as a reason to back assisted dying for those terminally ill and in great pain and distress. Maskell said she and both of her former colleagues on the select committee who remained in parliament, Dr Caroline Johnson and Paulette Hamilton, were against the bill. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones that have kind of really lived and breathed this for a significant amount of time,\u201d she said. Maskell, who is a religious Christian, denied that faith was the key factor for many opposed, saying there were many atheist MPs who were opposed and motivated by a human rights and equality perspective. \u201cBoth Wes and Shabana are the two cabinet members that have the responsibility for implementing this, and when they\u2019ve dug into the issue, they\u2019ve expressed a concern,\u201d Maskell said. \u201cThey really should be listened to.\u201d She said there was very little time for opponents to make their case. \u201cThe second reading on 29 November is really the day to defeat the bill and to say actually we don\u2019t have to do this [in the] first six months of a Labour government. It isn\u2019t the only vehicle in town, we can do something else.\u201d Streeting told MPs he had been persuaded because of the poor state of palliative care, despite having voted for assisted dying the last time around. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, was also previously a member of the APPG against assisted dying. But other cabinet ministers have said they are in favour, including the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, and the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy. Among Conservative MPs, the issue is split down the middle. \u201cI think that it\u2019s very much a case of a core number of religious ones who are against it, a core number of people who through personal or constituency experience are very strongly in favour, and then a number who are very torn,\u201d one senior Conservative said. \u201cBut I think there is a growing feeling of \u2018is this the right way to do this?\u2019.\u201d Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, who has a disabled son and whose wife has MS, has said he will vote against the bill. Cabinet ministers are not expected to campaign on the issue. Earlier this month, the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, wrote to ministers to say they \u201cshould exercise discretion and should not take part in the public debate\u201d. Starmer\u2019s support has been very influential for a number of MPs, however, and there are others in all the parties who are passionate supporters of the legal change, backed by three-quarters of the public, according to some polls. In a survey of MPs published earlier this month, just over half of those who responded backed legalisation in the case of terminal illness. Esther Rantzen, the celebrity backer of the assisted dying law change, to whom Starmer promised he would hold a vote on the issue, wrote to Streeting late this week to say she was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in his decision and accused him of \u201cignoring the government\u2019s request to stay neutral\u201d. She told the Express that Streeting should know \u201ceven the best palliative care cannot always protect patients from dying in agony, and their families and doctors watching helplessly\u201d. Maskell, a former physiotherapist, said taking part in the health and social care select committee inquiry into assisted dying had left her extremely concerned about the procedure. She said there were a significant number of her colleagues who remained undecided. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even seen the bill yet and we will have five weeks and then a five-hour debate \u2013 that feels like the process isn\u2019t right for dealing with such a sensitive and challenging subject and complex subject,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the context of a broken NHS. We know that social care is so fragmented and is just not functioning and massively under-resourced, and local authorities are climbing the wall around their finances. And we know that palliative care and the hospice service have been crying out for years about their underfunding.\u201d Maskell said for many MPs there was widespread support among their constituents for the change, and for those MPs who had their own doubts, they needed to explain an alternative to voting for the bill. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to think about end of life in a very different way if we are going to give people the very best of care,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019ve been so many people who are just feeling they\u2019re having to grab the first thing that comes along. I just think that lobby has been very successful and persuasive in trying to advance their agenda.\u201d Maskell said she had been having one-to-one discussions with MPs who were undecided. \u201cI would say it\u2019s certainly not the majority in favour yet. But the problem is that they don\u2019t have an adequate response currently to give their constituents, to say: \u2018I don\u2019t want have to do this now, but I want to get palliative care right.\u2019\u201d",

Mariposa was on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/wildfires\">fire</a> again. It was the Fourth of July, a high-risk time in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a> mountain town near Yosemite national park that had already seen its fair share of emergency evacuations.</p> <p>Memories still fresh from the destructive 2022 Oak fire, Armstrong<strong> </strong>and her husband rushed to pack up their four dogs as the sky began to glow red and flames raced toward the back door. \u201cIt was traumatizing,\u201d she recalled in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle we are still here.\u201d</p> <p>In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/05/french-fire-yosemite-california-heat\">French fire</a>, Armstrong and her neighbors reflected on their<strong> </strong>chaotic evacuation down the winding mountain roads and focused on a new worry: this time, they barely made it through the sloping two-lane egress toward town. Would they make it next time around?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/23/lassen-volcanic-national-park-dixie-fire-greenville-california\">\u2018There\u2019s still beauty\u2019: a national park bounces back after California\u2019s biggest single fire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kampgrounds of America (KOA) is eyeing a plot just down the road for a new camping and glamping development. Should the project move forward, up to a thousand visitors could end up spending the night on land that straddles the narrow escape route. When a fire inevitably flares again, evacuating may be far more challenging.</p> <p>As the outdoor recreation industry reaches deeper into natural areas, issues like these are causing concerns in the rural communities across the US. In the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, where Mariposa is located, tourism has boomed, along with the promise of economic opportunities for an area that has long had few. But the nature that serves as the attraction isn\u2019t able to accommodate an onslaught of visitors, especially now that the climate crisis has turned up the dial.</p> <p>The region has been battered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/extreme-weather\">extreme weather</a> whiplash in recent years, with<strong> </strong>sweltering summer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extreme-heat\">heatwaves</a> and long stretches of drought alternating with<strong> </strong>furious winter storms and spring floods. Fires that roar across the hillsides, consuming homes and the treasured land around them, have terrorized the town and others that dot the California mountainsides time and time again.</p> <p>Residents who have paid a heavy toll to recover from and prepare for these extreme elements are increasingly worried that, along with fire dangers, a boost in tourists will drain their waning water supply, overwhelm infrastructure and put additional strain on the delicate ecosystems.</p>    <p>It\u2019s not just a problem in Mariposa. On the other side of the mountain range in Mammoth Lakes, California, there are fears that <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-the-threat-of-wildfire-in-the-west-arrives-alongside-tourists/\">each additional visitor increases the chance of new ignitions</a>, locals near Zion national park in Utah fear that tourism is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/11/tourism-utah-drought-zion-economy\">sucking the region dry</a>, and officials in areas that occasionally explode in flowers during the so-called \u201csuper-bloom\u201d have begged people to stay away, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/03/california-wildflower-superbloom-tourism-history\">hoping to avoid the ecological crisis that comes with popularity.</a></p> <p>But as enthusiasm for outdoor recreation continues to grow, companies are eager to increase their offerings. The industry as a whole produces an <a href=\"https://recreationroundtable.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/California-2022-One-Pager.pdf\">eye-popping $1.1tn in economic output each year</a> \u2013 more than mining, utilities, or farming and ranching \u2013 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and generates more than $73bn in California alone.</p> <p>KOA, which operates one of the largest network of campgrounds in North America, is one of many companies cashing in.</p> <p>Claiming its mission \u2013 \u201cconnecting people to the outdoors and each other\u201d \u2013 is a way to increase appreciation and ultimately conservation of natural spaces, it has also been a boon for business. Registration revenue rose 36% since 2019, and the company expects to <a href=\"https://rvbusiness.com/koa-surpasses-500-million-in-camper-registration-revenue/\">hit its $700m mark by 2027</a>.</p> <p>The company launched a new glamping brand called Terramor in 2020 to tap into the rising demand for luxury outdoor experiences, and is hoping to house one of its initial offerings in Mariposa.</p> <p>KOA representatives said they are still far from breaking ground on the project and plan to conduct layers of studies to maximize sustainability, safety and compliance with local codes.</p> <p>Steve Engfer, the county planning director overseeing KOA\u2019s application, stressed in an email that an official application hasn\u2019t been filed for the proposed project. \u201cThere is an extensive process that would occur with multiple community/public hearings as a part of the formal land use entitlement applications,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>But if the plan is approved in its entirety, the site would host a campground with 400 RV campsites and 50 tent sites, with 90 Terramor glamping tents across the road, and bunk housing for the hundred or so workers on the site.</p> <p>Armstrong and others in Mariposa said their resistance to the proposal isn\u2019t about not wanting people to come to their town. They are afraid for what the future holds.</p> <p>\u201cWith what we are going through now, and the crisis of climate change, I don\u2019t feel like we will be able to dodge another fire,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t nimbys,\u201d she added, \u201cwe are dimbys \u2014 \u2018danger in my back yard\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2>The quiet life threatened by the climate crisis</h2> <p>The historic town of Mariposa, complete with a vibrant but small downtown, has long attracted residents in search of the quiet life. Tucked close to the Merced River, the town that sits a couple just hours away from the San Francisco Bay Area feels worlds away.</p> <p>But there are hardships baked into remote and rural life, especially in a warming world. Home to only 1,060 people according to 2022 census data, roughly a quarter of residents fall below the poverty line. The population skews older, with a median age above 55 \u2013 almost 20 years older than other Californias at large \u2013 has struggled to keep pace with rising costs to warm and cool their homes or to rebuild after disasters strike.</p> <p>Like in other climate-vulnerable communities, affording and accessing home insurance has also become a top concern. Policies are becoming harder to afford as carriers continue to drop households and businesses in the area.</p> <p>Many people in Mariposa and nearby Midpines are on the <a href=\"https://www.cfpnet.com/about-fair-plan/\">California Fair Plan</a>, the state\u2019s last-ditch answer for those without other options. It\u2019s a \u201csyndicated fire insurance pool\u201d that\u2019s often more expensive, covers less and is <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-fair-plan-insurer-of-last-resort-warns-major-disaster-could-wipe-out-funds/\">creeping toward being overwhelmed and insolvency</a>. Many more have opted to forgo insurance altogether.</p>    <p>Beth Pratt, the regional executive director of National Wildlife Federation, said her mountain home in Midpines was dropped from her insurance policy even after she went into debt ensuring it was as defended as possible against fire risk, complete with new metal siding. Now on the Fair Plan, she pays more than $5,000 a year \u2013 three times more than she had been paying in the past.</p> <p>Even beyond the rising costs, dangers loom. This past summer, the area baked in heatwaves that kept temperatures above 100F for weeks. When the fire risks spiked, electricity was cut, leaving the area without access to cooling.</p> <p>\u201cThe power goes out and then it just hits you \u2013 \u2018Oh my God, it is going to be 106F tomorrow and I have no power,\u2019\u201d Pratt said. \u201cIt changes everything.\u201d</p> <p>The challenges posed by extreme weather are taxing the region\u2019s wildlife, in addition to its communities. Pratt says she\u2019s witnessed acorn woodpeckers gasping for breath on the hottest days, deer peeking into her windows in search of refuge. \u201cI had a bee land on me like I was a lifeboat,\u201d she said, calling the summer \u201chellish\u201d.</p> <p>Extreme weather and development can go hand in hand to take an exacting toll on wildlife, Pratt said. \u201cThe Mariposa area where I live is ground zero,\u201d she said of climate extremes. \u201cYou have the pressure to develop because of the park but the ecological effects are staring us in the face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about keeping people out,\u201d she added. \u201cYou just can\u2019t build everywhere. The planet is trying to tell us something.\u201d</p> <h2>A national park flooded with tourists</h2> <p>Still, tourism has thrived in the region.</p> <p>Yosemite <a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Annual%20Park%20Recreation%20Visitation%20(1904%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)?Park=YOSE\">hosted</a> close to 4 million people in 2023, and with limited space to stay in the park there\u2019s been a spike in overnight vacation units popping up in gateway communities. Since 2016, 1,124 accommodations have been proposed, adding to the 692 already in place, according to data compiled by the National Parks Conservation Association.</p> <p>Pratt says she gets about a call a week from investors wanting to buy her home to turn it into a short-term rental.</p>    <p>KOA bought the land <a href=\"https://www.mariposacounty.org/2718/KOA-Terramor-Pre-Application\">it is planning to develop</a> \u2013 several parcels sprawling across roughly<a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/4989-Triangle-Rd_Mariposa_CA_95338_M19085-97275\"> a thousand acres in the heart of Mariposa</a> \u2013 for $5.7m in 2021. Straddling a scenic highway to the Merced River canyon, the sellers boasted its potential as a destination resort.</p> <p>Mariposa\u2019s leaders <a href=\"https://www.mariposacounty.org/2888/Plans-for-the-Parkway\">have envisioned new draws for visitation into the area</a> even after years of warnings from Yosemite officials who cautioned gateway communities not to tie their economies to the park.</p> <p>\u201cLocal governments and developers need to recognize that Yosemite national park has a finite capacity for tourism,\u201d Michael Finley wrote in a letter back in 1994 when he was superintendent of the park.</p> <p>It\u2019s taken decades, but as popularity continues to surge, the park started testing out a reservation pilot program in 2024 to limit the number of people allowed to enter each day.</p> <p>Still, as pressure builds to accommodate more tourists in this quiet rural community, Mariposans want to be clear with their leaders: this isn\u2019t the future they\u2019d hoped for. </p> <h2>A diverse coalition to stem the flow</h2> <p>The politically purple district that skews Republican has had its share of disagreements before. But \u201cNO WAY KOA\u201d and \u201cSTOP TERRAMOR\u201d posters can be seen at property entrances along the winding mountain roads alongside competing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris signs.</p> <p>Neighbors with diverse interests and backgrounds have formed a united front against the development, peppering local officials with questions and learning every detail they can about the potential development for the last three years since the property was purchased.</p> <p>Gathered in a booth at the local grocery and cafe on a scorching day in late September, a group of organizers shared stories and updates, and handed out signs.</p>    <p>Among them, local hardware store owner Troy Foster, Mariposa Fire Safe Council executive director Barbara Cone and local homeowner Theresa Cook share overlapping but different concerns about a plan that would double their community\u2019s population with tourists. Pratt and Armstrong are also part of this group, working to stop the wheels of development from turning. Pratt\u2019s parents, octogenarians who moved from the Boston area several years ago to retire, have joined up as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe argument they\u2019ve made is this is going to be a boon to Mariposa business. But as a Mariposa business owner, I just don\u2019t see that,\u201d Foster said, highlighting how the resort and campground will have its own store and supplies. He\u2019s also worried about water use and the grading of the land, which runs across both drainages and natural features.</p> <p>Cone has focused on the fire dangers. Chains dragged from RVs, campfire misuse and fireworks have all started fires already across this region, mostly by those who aren\u2019t accustomed to high risks.</p> <p>There are worries that the town\u2019s small hospital emergency room won\u2019t be able to withstand increased needs, that the campground won\u2019t be required to pay taxes designed for hotels, and that law enforcement and fire response will be spread thin. Cook described the shift in the rural way of life that drew residents here to begin with.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a simmering mistrust of how the decisions are being made, especially after it came to light that a former congressman, George Radanovich, brokered the deal with KOA. His real estate career was short-lived; documents show Radanovich oversaw this sale before returning to politics. He\u2019s now a Republican candidate running to represent the area for the California senate. His campaign did not respond to emails requesting information and comment.</p> <p>Citing the community\u2019s concerns, KOA representatives said the company did not intend to move quickly. In fact, it said, the campground may not become reality at all. Jenny McCullough, senior director of brand growth for Kampgrounds of America Inc, said the company is still in the scoping phase to see if this new addition would be a good fit \u2013 and a good investment \u2013 for the business.</p> <p>\u201cWe are being very thoughtful about the approach here,\u201d she said, noting that there are several components that go into building \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d. There are slews of studies to be done, including for water use, traffic and road needs, and for impact to nesting birds. An assessment of cultural artifacts on the land, which was once an important site for the indigenous California Miwok Tribe, needs to be carried out, in addition to an analysis to ensure compliance with California\u2019s environmental quality act restrictions.</p> <p>The company would need to apply for rezoning, possibly build or widen roads to ensure proper ingress and egress, and plan for water drawdown from an already water-scarce region. There are also historic buildings on the site.</p> <p>McCullough said that because the plans will be based around those studies, she couldn\u2019t offer any details on what the final development would look like or the timeline for when construction would begin. KOA has pulled the plug on projects before, deciding not to pursue a development in the Catskills after significant community pushback and assessments that were less than favorable.</p> <p>Miles Menetrey, the chair of the Mariposa county board of supervisors, said in an email that the project hasn\u2019t been up for official consideration by the county: only a pre-application has been filed. He added that he is \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the issues raised by residents, from wildfire and water usage to traffic and clouding of the dark sky. \u201cThe concerns of the community are well expressed, documented and heard,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Even so, the Mariposans aren\u2019t planning to stand down. At the local grocery and cafe, the group leaned into the work that still lies ahead.

      "bodyText": "Kathleen Armstrong saw the smoke curling above the tree-covered horizon and turned on her scanner with bated breath. Mariposa was on fire again. It was the Fourth of July, a high-risk time in the California mountain town near Yosemite national park that had already seen its fair share of emergency evacuations. Memories still fresh from the destructive 2022 Oak fire, Armstrong and her husband rushed to pack up their four dogs as the sky began to glow red and flames raced toward the back door. \u201cIt was traumatizing,\u201d she recalled in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle we are still here.\u201d In the aftermath of the French fire, Armstrong and her neighbors reflected on their chaotic evacuation down the winding mountain roads and focused on a new worry: this time, they barely made it through the sloping two-lane egress toward town. Would they make it next time around? Kampgrounds of America (KOA) is eyeing a plot just down the road for a new camping and glamping development. Should the project move forward, up to a thousand visitors could end up spending the night on land that straddles the narrow escape route. When a fire inevitably flares again, evacuating may be far more challenging. As the outdoor recreation industry reaches deeper into natural areas, issues like these are causing concerns in the rural communities across the US. In the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, where Mariposa is located, tourism has boomed, along with the promise of economic opportunities for an area that has long had few. But the nature that serves as the attraction isn\u2019t able to accommodate an onslaught of visitors, especially now that the climate crisis has turned up the dial. The region has been battered by extreme weather whiplash in recent years, with sweltering summer heatwaves and long stretches of drought alternating with furious winter storms and spring floods. Fires that roar across the hillsides, consuming homes and the treasured land around them, have terrorized the town and others that dot the California mountainsides time and time again. Residents who have paid a heavy toll to recover from and prepare for these extreme elements are increasingly worried that, along with fire dangers, a boost in tourists will drain their waning water supply, overwhelm infrastructure and put additional strain on the delicate ecosystems. It\u2019s not just a problem in Mariposa. On the other side of the mountain range in Mammoth Lakes, California, there are fears that each additional visitor increases the chance of new ignitions, locals near Zion national park in Utah fear that tourism is sucking the region dry, and officials in areas that occasionally explode in flowers during the so-called \u201csuper-bloom\u201d have begged people to stay away, hoping to avoid the ecological crisis that comes with popularity. But as enthusiasm for outdoor recreation continues to grow, companies are eager to increase their offerings. The industry as a whole produces an eye-popping $1.1tn in economic output each year \u2013 more than mining, utilities, or farming and ranching \u2013 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and generates more than $73bn in California alone. KOA, which operates one of the largest network of campgrounds in North America, is one of many companies cashing in. Claiming its mission \u2013 \u201cconnecting people to the outdoors and each other\u201d \u2013 is a way to increase appreciation and ultimately conservation of natural spaces, it has also been a boon for business. Registration revenue rose 36% since 2019, and the company expects to hit its $700m mark by 2027. The company launched a new glamping brand called Terramor in 2020 to tap into the rising demand for luxury outdoor experiences, and is hoping to house one of its initial offerings in Mariposa. KOA representatives said they are still far from breaking ground on the project and plan to conduct layers of studies to maximize sustainability, safety and compliance with local codes. Steve Engfer, the county planning director overseeing KOA\u2019s application, stressed in an email that an official application hasn\u2019t been filed for the proposed project. \u201cThere is an extensive process that would occur with multiple community/public hearings as a part of the formal land use entitlement applications,\u201d he wrote. But if the plan is approved in its entirety, the site would host a campground with 400 RV campsites and 50 tent sites, with 90 Terramor glamping tents across the road, and bunk housing for the hundred or so workers on the site. Armstrong and others in Mariposa said their resistance to the proposal isn\u2019t about not wanting people to come to their town. They are afraid for what the future holds. \u201cWith what we are going through now, and the crisis of climate change, I don\u2019t feel like we will be able to dodge another fire,\u201d she said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t nimbys,\u201d she added, \u201cwe are dimbys \u2014 \u2018danger in my back yard\u2019.\u201d The quiet life threatened by the climate crisis The historic town of Mariposa, complete with a vibrant but small downtown, has long attracted residents in search of the quiet life. Tucked close to the Merced River, the town that sits a couple just hours away from the San Francisco Bay Area feels worlds away. But there are hardships baked into remote and rural life, especially in a warming world. Home to only 1,060 people according to 2022 census data, roughly a quarter of residents fall below the poverty line. The population skews older, with a median age above 55 \u2013 almost 20 years older than other Californias at large \u2013 has struggled to keep pace with rising costs to warm and cool their homes or to rebuild after disasters strike. Like in other climate-vulnerable communities, affording and accessing home insurance has also become a top concern. Policies are becoming harder to afford as carriers continue to drop households and businesses in the area. Many people in Mariposa and nearby Midpines are on the California Fair Plan, the state\u2019s last-ditch answer for those without other options. It\u2019s a \u201csyndicated fire insurance pool\u201d that\u2019s often more expensive, covers less and is creeping toward being overwhelmed and insolvency. Many more have opted to forgo insurance altogether. Beth Pratt, the regional executive director of National Wildlife Federation, said her mountain home in Midpines was dropped from her insurance policy even after she went into debt ensuring it was as defended as possible against fire risk, complete with new metal siding. Now on the Fair Plan, she pays more than $5,000 a year \u2013 three times more than she had been paying in the past. Even beyond the rising costs, dangers loom. This past summer, the area baked in heatwaves that kept temperatures above 100F for weeks. When the fire risks spiked, electricity was cut, leaving the area without access to cooling. \u201cThe power goes out and then it just hits you \u2013 \u2018Oh my God, it is going to be 106F tomorrow and I have no power,\u2019\u201d Pratt said. \u201cIt changes everything.\u201d The challenges posed by extreme weather are taxing the region\u2019s wildlife, in addition to its communities. Pratt says she\u2019s witnessed acorn woodpeckers gasping for breath on the hottest days, deer peeking into her windows in search of refuge. \u201cI had a bee land on me like I was a lifeboat,\u201d she said, calling the summer \u201chellish\u201d. Extreme weather and development can go hand in hand to take an exacting toll on wildlife, Pratt said. \u201cThe Mariposa area where I live is ground zero,\u201d she said of climate extremes. \u201cYou have the pressure to develop because of the park but the ecological effects are staring us in the face. \u201cIt\u2019s not about keeping people out,\u201d she added. \u201cYou just can\u2019t build everywhere. The planet is trying to tell us something.\u201d A national park flooded with tourists Still, tourism has thrived in the region. Yosemite hosted close to 4 million people in 2023, and with limited space to stay in the park there\u2019s been a spike in overnight vacation units popping up in gateway communities. Since 2016, 1,124 accommodations have been proposed, adding to the 692 already in place, according to data compiled by the National Parks Conservation Association. Pratt says she gets about a call a week from investors wanting to buy her home to turn it into a short-term rental. KOA bought the land it is planning to develop \u2013 several parcels sprawling across roughly a thousand acres in the heart of Mariposa \u2013 for $5.7m in 2021. Straddling a scenic highway to the Merced River canyon, the sellers boasted its potential as a destination resort. Mariposa\u2019s leaders have envisioned new draws for visitation into the area even after years of warnings from Yosemite officials who cautioned gateway communities not to tie their economies to the park. \u201cLocal governments and developers need to recognize that Yosemite national park has a finite capacity for tourism,\u201d Michael Finley wrote in a letter back in 1994 when he was superintendent of the park. It\u2019s taken decades, but as popularity continues to surge, the park started testing out a reservation pilot program in 2024 to limit the number of people allowed to enter each day. Still, as pressure builds to accommodate more tourists in this quiet rural community, Mariposans want to be clear with their leaders: this isn\u2019t the future they\u2019d hoped for. A diverse coalition to stem the flow The politically purple district that skews Republican has had its share of disagreements before. But \u201cNO WAY KOA\u201d and \u201cSTOP TERRAMOR\u201d posters can be seen at property entrances along the winding mountain roads alongside competing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris signs. Neighbors with diverse interests and backgrounds have formed a united front against the development, peppering local officials with questions and learning every detail they can about the potential development for the last three years since the property was purchased. Gathered in a booth at the local grocery and cafe on a scorching day in late September, a group of organizers shared stories and updates, and handed out signs. Among them, local hardware store owner Troy Foster, Mariposa Fire Safe Council executive director Barbara Cone and local homeowner Theresa Cook share overlapping but different concerns about a plan that would double their community\u2019s population with tourists. Pratt and Armstrong are also part of this group, working to stop the wheels of development from turning. Pratt\u2019s parents, octogenarians who moved from the Boston area several years ago to retire, have joined up as well. \u201cThe argument they\u2019ve made is this is going to be a boon to Mariposa business. But as a Mariposa business owner, I just don\u2019t see that,\u201d Foster said, highlighting how the resort and campground will have its own store and supplies. He\u2019s also worried about water use and the grading of the land, which runs across both drainages and natural features. Cone has focused on the fire dangers. Chains dragged from RVs, campfire misuse and fireworks have all started fires already across this region, mostly by those who aren\u2019t accustomed to high risks. There are worries that the town\u2019s small hospital emergency room won\u2019t be able to withstand increased needs, that the campground won\u2019t be required to pay taxes designed for hotels, and that law enforcement and fire response will be spread thin. Cook described the shift in the rural way of life that drew residents here to begin with. There\u2019s also a simmering mistrust of how the decisions are being made, especially after it came to light that a former congressman, George Radanovich, brokered the deal with KOA. His real estate career was short-lived; documents show Radanovich oversaw this sale before returning to politics. He\u2019s now a Republican candidate running to represent the area for the California senate. His campaign did not respond to emails requesting information and comment. Citing the community\u2019s concerns, KOA representatives said the company did not intend to move quickly. In fact, it said, the campground may not become reality at all. Jenny McCullough, senior director of brand growth for Kampgrounds of America Inc, said the company is still in the scoping phase to see if this new addition would be a good fit \u2013 and a good investment \u2013 for the business. \u201cWe are being very thoughtful about the approach here,\u201d she said, noting that there are several components that go into building \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d. There are slews of studies to be done, including for water use, traffic and road needs, and for impact to nesting birds. An assessment of cultural artifacts on the land, which was once an important site for the indigenous California Miwok Tribe, needs to be carried out, in addition to an analysis to ensure compliance with California\u2019s environmental quality act restrictions. The company would need to apply for rezoning, possibly build or widen roads to ensure proper ingress and egress, and plan for water drawdown from an already water-scarce region. There are also historic buildings on the site. McCullough said that because the plans will be based around those studies, she couldn\u2019t offer any details on what the final development would look like or the timeline for when construction would begin. KOA has pulled the plug on projects before, deciding not to pursue a development in the Catskills after significant community pushback and assessments that were less than favorable. Miles Menetrey, the chair of the Mariposa county board of supervisors, said in an email that the project hasn\u2019t been up for official consideration by the county: only a pre-application has been filed. He added that he is \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the issues raised by residents, from wildfire and water usage to traffic and clouding of the dark sky. \u201cThe concerns of the community are well expressed, documented and heard,\u201d he wrote. Even so, the Mariposans aren\u2019t planning to stand down. At the local grocery and cafe, the group leaned into the work that still lies ahead. Residents will have to prepare for the climate risks that loom large while they confront the changes they believe could take an exacting toll on their way of life. Armstrong called it a \u201cfeeling of abandonment\u201d, lamenting the time and effort each has invested into fighting this battle, on top of everything else. \u201cWe had a forest in front of our house and it\u2019s gone,\u201d she said, reflecting back on the destruction left by the 2022 Oak fire . But that\u2019s why, she said, it\u2019s worth the struggle. This community means everything to her. \u201cThrough our little signs and word of mouth I hope we have elevated the awareness level enough,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be the last hill I plant my flag on \u2013 but I am going to do it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 October 2024 to reflect the property damage that was caused by the 2022 Oak fire.",

Some days are tougher than others but we\u2019re out here putting that good foot forward and putting in that work.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, Unite Here ran a similar door-knocking campaign. The union claimed it mobilized over 440,000 infrequent voters to vote for Biden in Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania, including 125,000 voters who had not voted in 2016. The union <a href=\"https://unitehere.org/press-releases/unite-here-union-that-knocked-on-doors-of-3-million-voters-including-575000-in-philadelphia-celebrates-victory-for-biden-harris/\">knocked</a> on 3m doors during the 2020 election cycle.</p> <p>The union has already knocked on over 3 million doors this election year, with a goal of 3.5m doors across 10 key election battleground states in support of the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, Democratic Senate candidates and local elected officials.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much noise in the election, getting a voter to engage at the door involves being able to make a quick connection with them, and I think our members are particularly positioned to do that,\u201d said the Unite Here president, Gwen Mills, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/05/unite-here-union-fight-against-trump\">designed</a> the union\u2019s Take Back 2020 campaign.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not tracking polls.

He began canvassing this year and is excited as it will be the first presidential election he has been old enough to vote in.</p> <p>He began working about two years ago in the midst of a contract fight with his employer that was only recently resolved after three separate <a href=\"https://www.unitehere11.org/strike-alert-hundreds-of-food-and-beverage-workers-at-sky-harbor-airport-walk-out-over-contract-dispute/\">strike actions</a>.</p> <p>Bonilla explained he got involved with the door-knocking campaign in Arizona because he noticed there was a lot more work to be done for workers and to ensure public officials are elected who support unions.</p> <p>\u201cThe Biden administration really helped out with giving unions as a whole a lot more power to ask for more, demand more from our employers, and I think Kamala Harris wants to continue that.

      "bodyText": "As the US election nears, union members are knocking on millions of doors in swing states across America in a last-ditch attempt to swing the too-close-to-call election for Kamala Harris. Joe Biden billed himself as the most pro-union president ever. Now his successor is hoping that the all-out support of organized labor can push her bid over the line. But in a divided America, the labor movement too is split. Tim Freeman, a hotel worker and member of Unite Here in Philadelphia, has been knocking doors for Democrats since 2020 when he came out in support of the Biden campaign. \u201cIt opened my eyes to seeing what\u2019s important, not just about the voting, but the issues, and then connecting with the voters,\u201d said Freeman. Unite Here, the hospitality and food service workers union, is running the largest independent labor-led field program in the US in the 2024 election, with operations focused in swing states of Pennsylvania, Arizona Nevada, and seven other states. Recent polls show Pennsylvania and Nevada as toss-up states, favoring Democrats by a slim margin, with Arizona currently leaning slightly in favor of Republicans. Freeman argued Kamala Harris was the best candidate for union members as she backs and has fought for worker rights compared to Trump, who has opposed unions and efforts to bolster worker rights. \u201cOur union rights are definitely under attack, but not just union rights. All of our rights are under attack,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this man back in office.\u201d Speaking with voters in person, so that they don\u2019t have to rely on television ads or campaign rhetoric, was important, he said. \u201cYou can be able to see somebody right here in your space, at your door, sharing your story with them as well as seeing what we have in common,\u201d added Freeman. \u201cStrength is in numbers and the more you gather, collect, and give out information to people to let them know, this is what we\u2019re here for and this is why we canvas. Some days are tougher than others but we\u2019re out here putting that good foot forward and putting in that work.\u201d Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, Unite Here ran a similar door-knocking campaign. The union claimed it mobilized over 440,000 infrequent voters to vote for Biden in Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania, including 125,000 voters who had not voted in 2016. The union knocked on 3m doors during the 2020 election cycle. The union has already knocked on over 3 million doors this election year, with a goal of 3.5m doors across 10 key election battleground states in support of the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, Democratic Senate candidates and local elected officials. \u201cThere\u2019s so much noise in the election, getting a voter to engage at the door involves being able to make a quick connection with them, and I think our members are particularly positioned to do that,\u201d said the Unite Here president, Gwen Mills, who designed the union\u2019s Take Back 2020 campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re not tracking polls. We\u2019re just focused on how many doors we can knock on and how many conversations we can have with a voter that may feel disaffected that their vote doesn\u2019t matter, or who may still be struggling with issues and on the fence about where these two candidates are.\u201d Unite Here noted the number of these voters exceeded Biden\u2019s margin of victory in Nevada and Arizona. \u201cFundamentally it comes down to, are we going to be on offense, continuing to build the labor movement, or will be on defense, defending against a central attack,\u201d added Mills. \u201cWe feel, without a doubt, that the volume of these conversations, the quality, can tip the outcome of the election.\u201d The union also engaged in significant voter turnout efforts in Georgia Senate runoff elections in 2021 and 2022, and in Virginia state senate and house elections in 2023. According to Pew Research Center data from 2023, 59% of union members lean Democratic, with 39% leaning Republican \u2013 a large enough percentage to make a real difference in such a close election cycle. The Teamsters, one of the largest US labor unions, declined to issue an endorsement this election cycle after its president, Sean O\u2019Brien, became the first Teamsters president to address the Republican national convention this year. The union announced its \u201cnon-endorsement\u201d with a poll of members that backed Trump. Trump has had less success with the United Auto Workers president, Shawn Fain, who has come out for Harris, a move that led Trump to insult Fain and autoworkers. The former president has continued to court support from UAW members in Michigan with promises to increase auto jobs. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts The UAW released a poll last week revealing members in key battleground states support Harris over Trump by 22 percentage points. The union has been running a door-knocking campaign in support of Harris and noted that support for her increased to 29% among members who had been contacted by the union about the election. Fain will make a final appeal to members on Tuesday: \u201cThis election, the question for UAW members, and every member of the working class, is simple: Which side are you on? If you\u2019re with the working class, it\u2019s time to Stand Up. If you\u2019re sick of the endless greed of corporate America, it\u2019s time to Speak Up,\u201d he wrote on X. In the meantime, the door-knocking continues. On 19 October the Service Employees International Union, National Education Association, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and American Federation of Teachers began a joint, multi-state voter outreach program to include a series of rallies and statewide canvassing efforts in key swing states. The unions have a combined membership of over 8 million. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have our members and leaders on the ground in every battleground state from now until election day, ensuring every voice is heard and every vote is counted,\u201d said April Verrett, president of SEIU. David Bonilla, 21, works as an airport service worker in Phoenix, Arizona and is a Unite Here Local 11 member. He began canvassing this year and is excited as it will be the first presidential election he has been old enough to vote in. He began working about two years ago in the midst of a contract fight with his employer that was only recently resolved after three separate strike actions. Bonilla explained he got involved with the door-knocking campaign in Arizona because he noticed there was a lot more work to be done for workers and to ensure public officials are elected who support unions. \u201cThe Biden administration really helped out with giving unions as a whole a lot more power to ask for more, demand more from our employers, and I think Kamala Harris wants to continue that. It\u2019s a no-brainer for us. We have to knock on doors for her and get her into office just to get working people more of a say in their life,\u201d said Bonilla. \u201cEspecially for our union, who are service and hospitality workers, we are the backbone of our economy and these are the jobs that low propensity voters, the people who we are reaching out to at the doors, are working in.\u201d For the US labor movement, the differences between Harris and Trump are stark. Harris has strongly backed labor unions and is backed by a majority of labor unions, while Trump has castigated unions and workers. Under the Trump administration, his appointees scaled back worker protections and rules aimed at encouraging organizing at the US Department of Labor. \u201cIt\u2019s important that I\u2019m out door-knocking and canvassing because Kamala, she supports a lot of the things that I\u2019m faced with, that a lot of American people are faced with, like ending price gouging, supporting the right to make a decision for your own body, and the tips,\u201d said Morlaina Bruce, a guest room attendant at Circus Circus in Las Vegas, Nevada and member of the Culinary Union for seven years. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the hatred that Trump has put out there, the division, and the lies that he tells.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government is considering making it easier for pubs to serve independent, local beers as the chancellor looks for ways to boost the sector. Some pubs, known as tied pubs, only sell beer from the company that owns the pub, in exchange for lower rent. However, many publicans have for years grated against the \u201cbeer tie\u201d, and drinkers also tell pollsters they want more choice of independent beers. A Treasury source said Rachel Reeves was considering ways of \u201cexpanding access to pubs for the small brewers\u201d, and could announce some form of consultation with the industry in her budget. The source said the government wanted to give pubs \u201cgreater flexibility to buy beer from local small breweries to help bring in more footfall, expand choice for drinkers and support local breweries\u201d. Policies would still have to be put forward as legislation, but any move to increase indie beer sales by pubs would be welcomed by craft brewers, who are competing with an increasing number of global brands who are producing \u201ccraft\u201d beers. The Society of Independent Brewers and Associates (Siba), a lobby group, said brewers\u2019 inability to sell to local producers was a major problem \u201cacross the sector, even in so called \u2018free house\u2019 pubs who are technically free to buy from whoever they choose\u201d. Andy Slee,Siba\u2019s chief executive, said a government review of the problems facing indie brewers would be an \u201cimportant first step to explore the right solution for the sector, ensuring all breweries have access to sell draught beer and that consumer demand is met\u201d. He added: \u201cWe know that there is lots of demand for locally produced independent draught beer alongside more global brands, but consumers often can\u2019t enjoy them in their local pub because the supply is dominated by a few globally owned breweries.\u201d The lobby group also called for Reeves to increase draught beer duty relief to 20%, which would reduce the amount of tax due on pints poured from the tap. The government increased the relief from 5% to 9.2% for beer and cider in March 2023. The government is also expected to offer smaller producers of spirits such as scotch whisky and Irish poit\u00edn a small boost at the budget by cutting the price of accreditation. \u201cGeographic indicators\u201d generally cost producers \u00a37,000 every two years, but the source said Reeves intended to cut that cost.",

      "bodyText": "Georgia\u2019s ruling party has retained power in a contested parliamentary election in a blow to the country\u2019s long-held aspiration for EU membership, amid accusations of intimidation and coercion of voters. Georgia\u2019s pro-western opposition refused to concede defeat, accusing the ruling party of a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d and promising to announce protests, setting the stage for a potential political crisis that could further polarise the Caucasus country. The commission said the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party had won 54% of the vote, with more than 99% of precincts counted. The result for GD would thwart the opposition\u2019s hopes for a pro-western coalition of four blocs and in effect stall the country\u2019s aspirations for EU integration. Voters in the country of almost 4 million people headed to the polls on Saturday in a watershed election to decide whether the increasingly authoritarian GD party, which has been in power since 2012 and steered the country into a conservative course away from the west and closer to Russia, should get another four-year term. Bidzina Ivanishvili, the shadowy billionaire founder of GD, claimed victory shortly after polls closed, in what has been called the most consequential election since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. \u201cIt is a rare case in the world that the same party achieves such success in such a difficult situation \u2013 this is a good indicator of the talent of the Georgian people,\u201d said Ivanishvili, widely considered to be the country\u2019s most powerful figure. At a press conference late on Saturday, leaders of the opposition coalition called the results of the elections a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. \u201cThe victory was stolen from the Georgian people \u2026 We do not accept results of these falsified elections,\u201d said Tinatin Bokuchava, the leader of the biggest opposition party, United National Movement (UNM). An international observer mission announced on Sunday that the conduct of the election was evidence of \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d in the country. A preliminary report by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said it \u201cnoted reports of intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters, particularly on public sector employees and other groups, raising concerns about the ability of some voters to cast their vote without fear of retribution\u201d. However, it stopped short of saying the elections had been stolen or falsified \u2013 a claim the opposition reiterated on Sunday. The opposition, which is expected to announce its next move late on Sunday, has accused GD of relying on its \u201cadministrative resources\u201d during the elections \u2013 an umbrella term that includes pressing state employees to vote and offering cash handouts to mostly rural voters. A group of 2,000 election observers called My Vote said it did not believe the preliminary results \u201creflect the will of Georgian citizens\u201d given the scale of voter fraud and violence. On Saturday morning, several videos circulated online appearing to show ballot stuffing and voter intimidation at various polling stations across Georgia. \u201cBidzina Ivanishvili\u2019s thugs are desperate to cling on to power and will resort to anything to subvert the election process,\u201d Bokuchava, the UNM leader, said as voting was under way. Electoral commission data showed GD winning by huge margins of up to 90% in some rural areas, though it underperformed in bigger cities. For the past three decades Georgia has maintained strong pro-western aspirations, with polls showing up to 80% of its people favour joining the EU. In recent years, however, the government has increasingly shifted away from the west in favour of Russia, showing reluctance to condemn Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The GD has also been accused by critics of plans to move the country in an authoritarian direction after Ivanishvili vowed to ban all the leading opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers if his party was re-elected. Many expected that GD would become the biggest party but might fall short of a majority and struggle to form a government, with all other blocs refusing to collaborate with it. The GD was facing an unprecedented union of four pro-western opposition forces that had vowed to form a coalition government to oust it from power and put Georgia back on track to join the EU. The biggest opposition force is the centre-right UNM, a party founded by Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president who is in prison on charges of abuse of power that his allies say are politically motivated. The GD ran its campaign on accusations that the pro-western opposition was trying to pull Georgia into a Ukraine-style conflict. In 2008, Georgia fought a war with Russia that lasted five days and left deep scars, and the invasion of Ukraine has left some in the country wary of the possible consequences of provoking Russia by moving closer to the west. On Saturday night, voters in Tbilisi seemed divided over the country\u2019s future course. \u201cWe have lost our country today,\u201d said Ana Machaidze, a 25-year-old student. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do next. I hope we can take to the streets, but if we lose, maybe I will live abroad.\u201d Support for the pro-western opposition groups generally came from urban and younger voters, who envision their political future with the EU. Irakli Shengelia, 56, a restaurant worker, said he was glad GD would remain in power because the party guaranteed \u201cpeace and stability\u201d with Russia and shared his conservative values. The government, aligned with the deeply conservative and influential Orthodox church, has sought to galvanise anti-liberal sentiments by campaigning on \u201cfamily values\u201d and criticising what it portrays as western excesses. In the summer, the parliament passed legislation imposing sweeping restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights, a move that critics say mirrors laws enacted in neighbouring Russia, where authorities have implemented a series of repressive measures against sexual minorities. The EU granted Georgia candidate membership status last year but has put its application on hold in response to a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill passed in May, requiring media and NGOs receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d. The bill, which triggered weeks of mass protests in the spring, has been labelled a \u201cRussian law\u201d by critics, who liken it to legislation introduced by the Kremlin a decade earlier to silence political dissent in the media and elsewhere.",

Social housing is to receive a modest boost. But there is a lot of talk about other budgets <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/954d33a0-6291-4dbb-96c6-f19bc93959f2\">continuing to be squeezed</a>, not least when it comes to the money that goes from Whitehall to local councils that are already in dire financial straits. And here, we alight on something that the chancellor would do well to remember: the fact that austerity often turns out to be very, very expensive.</p> <p>There is no better example than an issue that is now constantly in the news: how the state provides for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, or Send. The mess of misery and stress this encompasses is manifested in families being <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wj011wd57o\">refused</a> anything like the right provision, and rising numbers of kids who are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9qg94d45zxo\">not in school at all</a>. But inevitably, the current Send crisis is also about cold financial numbers.</p> <p>Last Thursday, the National Audit Office (NAO) <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/support-for-children-and-young-people-with-special-educational-needs/\">published</a> a report on the condition of England\u2019s special needs system. Over the past decade, it said, the so-called high-needs block \u2013 which pays for provision and extra support in schools and colleges \u2013 has risen by 58%, to \u00a310.7bn a year. Despite this, the Send deficits run up by local authorities may soon reach well over \u00a34bn. At the moment, those overspends have been removed from councils\u2019 balance sheets. They are scheduled to go back on in 2026: the report says that when that happens \u2013 and read this slowly \u2013 43% of local authorities in England will be at risk of bankruptcy.</p> <p>As the NAO bluntly says, despite all the extra spending, \u201cthe system is still not delivering better outcomes for children and young people\u201d. The whole story suggests a level of dysfunction partly caused by the increasing amount of children who need help, and changes that will not go away: for instance, greater <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/04/uk-increase-autism-diagnoses-neurodiversity\">understanding of autism</a> (not least among women and girls, something that was overlooked until very recently) has only increased the financial strain. But the key factor in what has happened should not be forgotten: fundamentally, the Send crisis is the result of 14 years of Conservative government, and the chaos the people in charge let loose.</p> <p>It has affected education throughout the age range. The Sure Start children\u2019s centres that were introduced by the last Labour government were staffed by people who could spot developmental problems early, and offer help \u2013 but since George Osborne began slashing the money given to councils to spend on such things, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-closed-1300-family-centres-21506487\">1,300 have closed</a>, leaving many children\u2019s issues to fester and reach crisis point.</p> <p>Because schools endured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/feb/24/schools-england-real-terms-cuts-since-2010-tories\">real-terms cuts</a> in their budgets while the pay offered to teaching assistants remained miserly, a lot of support in mainstream schools <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/may/04/school-leaders-warn-of-full-blown-special-needs-crisis-in-england\">has also fallen away</a>, with similar consequences. The result has been a veritable exodus into specialist schools: the number of children with special needs in mainstream settings <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/education/government-segregation-special-needs-children-mainstream-schools-328706#:~:text=There%20are%20some%201.2%20million,the%20JPI%20Media%20Data%20Unit\">fell by a quarter</a> between 2012 and 2019, while the number attending special schools increased by nearly a third.</p> <p>Those schools are now often both <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/two-thirds-of-special-schools-full-or-over-capacity-new-data-shows/\">oversubscribed and overcrowded</a>. Because places are so scarce, their pupils often have to deal with insanely long daily journeys to and from home, which is the reason for another part of the Send crisis: the fact that councils\u2019 spend on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68665303\">children\u2019s travel costs</a> has rocketed. And because a cash-strapped public sector failed to keep pace with the need for specialist provision, other interests stepped into the breach: the kind of private equity firms that now <a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2024/02/19/private-equity-in-public-services-the-case-of-special-educational-needs-schools/\">operate</a> many specialist schools, and charge councils <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/how-investors-are-making-millions-from-the-bankrupt-send-system/\">sky-high fees</a>. Such is the self-defeating flipside of Osbornomics: when dependable provision is cut back, or fails to keep pace with need, you end up paying through the nose to fill the gaps.</p> <p>Faced with such a mess, parents have one key means of getting their kids roughly what they need \u2013 in theory, at least. Education, health and care plans (or EHCPs) set out provision as a matter of legally enforceable rights, overseen by a dedicated tribunal. Since 2015, the number of children with an EHCP has risen from 240,000 to 576,000. A child who needs a place in a specialist school will usually need one to get in \u2013 and in the absence of enough ad hoc, informal help from teaching assistants, plenty of kids in mainstream schools now also have to go down the same route to secure the right support. However, many councils now seem to be set on cutting Send costs by <a href=\"https://www.specialneedsjungle.com/uncovering-truth-send-safety-valve-agreement-cut-childrens-send-provision/\">restricting access</a> to this kind of protection.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/25/labour-mps-chancellor-rachel-reeves-budget-problems\">Labour MPs fear chancellor\u2019s tough budget will bring new set of problems</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf unreformed, the SEN system is financially unsustainable,\u201d says the NAO report.

      "bodyText": "The Greens\u2019 federal housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, says the Queensland election result shows federal Labor needs to drop its \u201cdeep hostility\u201d to the minor party \u2013 or risk losing next year\u2019s national poll. The Liberal National party\u2019s victory at the weekend \u2013 its first majority in almost a decade \u2013 relied upon gains from Labor in regional areas, including heartland seats in central and north Queensland. The Greens had hoped to pick up several seats in inner Brisbane, including in areas they won at the 2022 federal election. But election night proved disappointing for the leftwing party, which lost South Brisbane to Labor and conceded ground in several target seats. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Sunday the Queensland result sent a message to the federal Greens leader, Adam Bandt. \u201cContaining the Greens party shows that people who elected the Greens to parliament expected them to play a progressive role, not a blocking role,\u201d Albanese said. Much of the immediate analysis on election night suggested the Greens\u2019 struggles, coming after marginal losses in the Australian Capital Territory election, pointed to problems with the party\u2019s federal agenda. But Chandler-Mather, who has been at the forefront of tangles with Albanese and Labor over housing, said Saturday\u2019s outcome showed the ALP had expended too much effort fighting the Greens rather than working with them. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThe frustration is that Labor spends so much of their time and resources attacking us,\u201d Chandler Mather said. \u201cIf they had held on [in regional areas] then there could have been a minority government with us in the balance of power. \u201cThe lesson for federal Labor is if the prime minister wants to spend the next six months fighting and attacking the Greens then he\u2019s going to hand the keys to Peter Dutton.\u201d Labor did pivot campaign resources to Brisbane in the final days of the Queensland election as polls pointed to the party holding more ground in the city. The government also shifted substantially to the left in the 10 months after Steven Miles became premier, including adopting several Greens policies. Chandler-Mather said these included cheap public transport fares, increased mining royalties, free school lunches and other measures that proved popular. \u201cThe only reason that Labor was able to recover so much of their vote in Brisbane is they adopted so much of the Greens policy platform,\u201d he said. The alternative to Labor losing the next federal election was for them to \u201cdrop \u2026 the deep hostility to the Greens [and] come work with us,\u201d Chandler-Mather said. \u201cReach the sort of compromise they reached last year on housing. We\u2019re ready to do this. \u201cThey can\u2019t say this election demonstrates the Greens are unpopular when they adopted most of our platform. \u201cOur policies are broadly popular. That\u2019s sort of the message we\u2019ve been trying to communicate with the federal Labor party, which still seems to be on the strategy of trying to destroy the Greens.\u201d Labor sources on Sunday talked up the prospect of taking back federal Brisbane seats held by the Greens, including Chandler-Mather\u2019s electorate of Griffith. Reflecting on the Greens\u2019 failures to pick up seats on Saturday, Chandler-Mather said the minor party \u201cneeded to get better\u201d at communicating wins and the impact Greens MPs had shifting policy debate to the left. \u201cLabor might think that all of this means the Greens are going away. [But] if you look at our core vote in our future target seats, the foundations are there still. \u201cIf anything we\u2019re finding we\u2019ve had more volunteers this election than we ever had before.

      "body": "<p>It is a truth<em> almost</em> universally acknowledged that what the average civilian really craves in life is a little proximity to celebrity. If a star does grant access, then a hitherto hidden portal abruptly opens up. Entering it can prove easier than exiting.</p> <p>In 1971, Elliot Mintz was a twentysomething radio host in Los Angeles who one day interviewed the avant-garde <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/feb/18/yoko-ono-music-of-the-mind-tate-modern-review-huge-moving-and-full-of-surprises\">artist</a> Yoko Ono on his show. Ono was used to existing within the shadow of her more famous husband, John Lennon, and so was thrilled to claim a little solo limelight. She liked Mintz, and called him up the next day for a chat. This soon became a daily event, and she then recommended that John call him, too. Mintz was a good listener, patient, irrespective of his own schedule. If they rang in the middle of the night and woke him up, so what? They liked that he pandered to them, didn\u2019t fawn. Then, when they\u2019d run out of conversational steam, they\u2019d simply hang up on him. \u201cThey rarely bothered to say goodbye,\u201d he notes.</p> <p>So began a relationship that would endure, with John up to his death in 1980 and with Yoko to this day. Previously, their acquaintance had remained that rarest thing in celebrity circles: private. But no more. Mintz, now 79, has decided to tell all. \u201cI loved them like family,\u201d he writes in this memoir. \u201cI\u2019d like to say they felt a similar familial attachment to me, but I was never completely sure.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He is there for the binges, the recrimination and the heartbreak. He is there, too, in the hours after Lennon\u2019s murder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This didn\u2019t trouble him too much, however. He installed another phone line in his house to ensure he\u2019d never miss a call, and if it rang when he had a lady friend over, then she was asked quickly to leave. He was now otherwise engaged.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t help himself; they fascinated him. \u201cThe English language contains some 170,000 words, and I\u2019ve never come across a single one of them that fully describes the odd contours that made up my relationship with them,\u201d he writes in a rapturous sigh.<em> I</em> can think of a word: gofer. It\u2019s something he himself pretty much \u2019fesses up to later on: \u201cI was a trusted confidant, a fixer, media rep, sounding board, and [their] connection to the outside world.\u201d</p> <p>He had come into their lives at a difficult time. Their marriage was in trouble. Both were coming down from heroin, then methadone. They were spiky, rude, self-involved. Sometimes, Lennon would summon him to keep him company, to drive him someplace, or to help him set up assignations with other women. Ono pleaded with him to keep her errant husband safe, while Lennon told Mintz: \u201cThere will be times when you\u2019ll think she\u2019s bloody mad. Just do what she tells you.\u201d</p>    <p>He is there for the binges, the recrimination and the heartbreak. He is there, too, in the hours after Lennon\u2019s murder, his presence requested by his widow to catalogue all his personal items.</p> <p>For Beatles aficionados, there is little new here, but it does nevertheless offer up a fascinating ringside seat into the psychodrama of the most compelling celebrity couple of the 1970s, Lennon craving world peace and self-destruction, Ono communing with psychics and obsessed with the number nine.

      "bodyText": "It is a truth almost universally acknowledged that what the average civilian really craves in life is a little proximity to celebrity. If a star does grant access, then a hitherto hidden portal abruptly opens up. Entering it can prove easier than exiting. In 1971, Elliot Mintz was a twentysomething radio host in Los Angeles who one day interviewed the avant-garde artist Yoko Ono on his show. Ono was used to existing within the shadow of her more famous husband, John Lennon, and so was thrilled to claim a little solo limelight. She liked Mintz, and called him up the next day for a chat. This soon became a daily event, and she then recommended that John call him, too. Mintz was a good listener, patient, irrespective of his own schedule. If they rang in the middle of the night and woke him up, so what? They liked that he pandered to them, didn\u2019t fawn. Then, when they\u2019d run out of conversational steam, they\u2019d simply hang up on him. \u201cThey rarely bothered to say goodbye,\u201d he notes. So began a relationship that would endure, with John up to his death in 1980 and with Yoko to this day. Previously, their acquaintance had remained that rarest thing in celebrity circles: private. But no more. Mintz, now 79, has decided to tell all. \u201cI loved them like family,\u201d he writes in this memoir. \u201cI\u2019d like to say they felt a similar familial attachment to me, but I was never completely sure.\u201d This didn\u2019t trouble him too much, however. He installed another phone line in his house to ensure he\u2019d never miss a call, and if it rang when he had a lady friend over, then she was asked quickly to leave. He was now otherwise engaged. He couldn\u2019t help himself; they fascinated him. \u201cThe English language contains some 170,000 words, and I\u2019ve never come across a single one of them that fully describes the odd contours that made up my relationship with them,\u201d he writes in a rapturous sigh. I can think of a word: gofer. It\u2019s something he himself pretty much \u2019fesses up to later on: \u201cI was a trusted confidant, a fixer, media rep, sounding board, and [their] connection to the outside world.\u201d He had come into their lives at a difficult time. Their marriage was in trouble. Both were coming down from heroin, then methadone. They were spiky, rude, self-involved. Sometimes, Lennon would summon him to keep him company, to drive him someplace, or to help him set up assignations with other women. Ono pleaded with him to keep her errant husband safe, while Lennon told Mintz: \u201cThere will be times when you\u2019ll think she\u2019s bloody mad. Just do what she tells you.\u201d He is there for the binges, the recrimination and the heartbreak. He is there, too, in the hours after Lennon\u2019s murder, his presence requested by his widow to catalogue all his personal items. For Beatles aficionados, there is little new here, but it does nevertheless offer up a fascinating ringside seat into the psychodrama of the most compelling celebrity couple of the 1970s, Lennon craving world peace and self-destruction, Ono communing with psychics and obsessed with the number nine. Throughout, Mintz displays a sense of duty that would impress Julian Fellowes for its Downton Abbey-esque obsequience. He could play Carson with aplomb. The reader repeatedly wonders: why? Why such indulgence? He wasn\u2019t even much of a Beatles fan: \u201cI preferred Elvis.\u201d Even Mintz isn\u2019t entirely sure. \u201cIf only I had learned to say no, I might have [lived] a more balanced, traditional existence,\u201d he writes. \u201cI might have married, had children, made some ordinary friends.\u201d At one point he suggests that \u201cin my more mystical moments, I ponder if we were bound by a \u2018soul contract\u2019 that made our friendship cosmically inevitable, forever to be repeated in various incarnations for all eternity.\u201d Or perhaps he simply enjoyed being fame-adjacent, the chosen one? The world does not need yet another take on either John or Yoko, but amid the countless critical tomes about them, this one is at least reverential and kind, albeit so blurred by the adoration of its subjects that objectivity is impossible. Yoko, you feel, would approve. \u2022 We All Shine On: John, Yoko &amp; Me by Elliot Mintz is published by Bantam (\u00a325).

Meanwhile, the Zionists cleave to Moses\u2019 prophecy of a promised land, surely the Bible\u2019s greatest hostage to fortune. The Islamists believe that, Allah willing \u2013 as transmitted by his prophet, Mohammad \u2013 they will conquer the infidels. And Christian nationalists in the US pray the coming election will deliver an American theocracy. The idea of dying for democracy lacks the spiritual grandeur, the romanticism, the open-ended faith of revolution or martyrdom. It fails to summon the hatred that hurls the religious fanatic, the bloody revolutionary and the snorting patriot on to the field of battle. Who waged a war for a woman\u2019s right to vote? Or equality before the law? Or the right of gay people to love one another? Democracy has no prophet. And thank goodness. It offers no 1,000-year utopias, no enycyclicals and no promised lands. It strives for universal ideas of liberty that transcend the concepts of empire and nation and faith. *** In Ukraine we find an exception: a people willing to fight and die for the right to self-determination as a democracy. Putin\u2019s useful idiots in the west brand Ukraine\u2019s pursuit of democratic freedom illegitimate, even as they enjoy the liberty to say so as citizens of open democracies. Alexei Navalny, the late leader of Russia\u2019s opposition, was a rare example of a man who consciously gave his life for democracy. He martyred himself for a beautiful vision of Russia enjoying the basic freedom that we do. I had hoped he would set up a Russian government in exile, along the lines of General de Gaulle\u2019s or the Polish government in exile during the second world war. Instead, he went home and was murdered in an Arctic prison. In the US \u2013 so often declared to be \u201cthe greatest democracy in the world\u201d \u2013 those who despise democracy blame the electoral system for standing in the way of absolute power. They yearn for a tyrant who will punish those whose very existence affronts their idea of the proper social order \u2013 the migrant, the progressive, the liberal, the \u201csocialist\u201d, the homosexual. They want to be rid of the messy handover of power every few years, and they\u2019ve shown they are willing to violently support the dream of an autocracy stacked with Christian nationalists who answer to a god and not to the people. Democracy be damned.

      "body": "<p>Walk down the pasta aisle of any decent-sized supermarket and there is choice overload: not just penne or pappardelle, white or wholewheat, but pasta made from rice, lentils, peas, corn and more. These gluten-free products are no longer marketed only at people with allergies and intolerances, but at everyone with an interest in healthy eating. Is there something wrong with eating regular durum wheat pasta? And are these alternatives really any better?</p> <p>Pasta was venerated during the low-fat era of the 80s and 90s and demonised in the low-carb craze of the 00s. Today, there is a lot of confusion over whether it is \u201chealthy\u201d or not. \u201cWhite pasta has such a bad rep,\u201d says <a href=\"https://robhobson.co.uk/\">Rob Hobson</a>, a registered nutritionist and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/unprocess-your-family-life-9780008729622/\">Unprocess Your Family Life</a>. \u201cEveryone thinks that carbs are bad and make you fat. They\u2019re actually a really important part of the diet.\u201d</p> <p>But don\u2019t carbohydrates cause your blood sugar to rise too quickly? \u201cWhen you eat food, your blood sugar goes up and the body produces insulin to deal with it. It\u2019s perfectly natural,\u201d says Hobson. \u201cIt\u2019s only a problem if you\u2019re overeating or constantly snacking, or if your resting blood sugar is high.\u201d Having said that, he adds: \u201cNot all carbs are equal. Quickly digested carbs [such as white pasta] can leave you hungry soon after eating them, and craving more. They\u2019re easy to overeat, so you do have to eat them in moderation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Think about what you\u2019re serving white pasta with. Go tomato-based rather than oil, cream or cheese. And add vegetables!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I assume that means he avoids white pasta, but I am wrong. \u201cI do a lot of sport, so I tend to stick to white pasta \u2013 carbs are important for fuel, especially before endurance events,\u201d he says. \u201cI like it, and I team it with a bit of protein and veg to make it a balanced meal.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/1/123\">2022 review of novel pasta products</a> and their impact on health, published in the journal Foods, described pasta as \u201ca healthy and convenient food\u201d. It noted that most people prefer white pasta \u201cdue to better taste, appearance and texture\u201d. Hobson says: \u201cIf you only like white pasta, think about what you\u2019re serving it with. Go tomato-based rather than oil, cream or cheese. If you like pesto, you could use less and combine it with yoghurt. And add vegetables!\u201d</p> <p>His other simple, healthy serving suggestions are olive oil, garlic and chilli; oily fish, such as smoked or tinned salmon; and a pasta bake with half lean beef or chicken mince and half lentils. \u201cIf you\u2019re buying a sauce, the fresh ones are usually the least ultra-processed. If it has to be a jar, choose one with the fewest additives and the lowest salt and sugar.\u201d</p> <p>So, is it OK to eat pasta every day? According to a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/730668/frequency-of-eating-pasta-in-italy/\">2023 YouGov</a> survey, 17% of Italians do, with a further 30% eating it four or five times a week. Another <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/consumer/articles/31554-britains-favourite-best-pasta-shape\">YouGov survey</a>, in 2020, found that 68% of Britons eat pasta at least once a week; of those, 42% eat it several times a week. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t eat pasta every day, because you want as varied a diet as possible, but a few times a week is fine,\u201d Hobson says. \u201cPasta is a really cheap way to make a meal. I think I ate tuna and sweetcorn pasta every day as a student!\u201d</p>    <p>Wholegrain or wholemeal pasta is undeniably healthier than white. The 2022 review concluded that choosing wholegrain is \u201cthe simplest way \u2026 to enhance the nutritional and potentially health-promoting properties of pasta\u201d. Wholemeal pasta contains the wheat bran, while wholegrain or wholewheat contains the endosperm, the bran and the germ. \u201cSince the bran and the germ contain many biologically active compounds, such as vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, amino acids and many phytochemicals, they have been linked to reducing the risk of many lifestyle diseases,\u201d the researchers explained.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_antonioalderuccio_/\">Antonio Alderuccio</a>, a Sicilian chef and <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/veganissimo-the-plant-based-and-gluten-free-italian-kitchen-antonio-alderuccio/7731580\">the author of Veganissimo</a>, prefers wholewheat pasta. \u201cWhite pasta might contain over-refined, bleached flour,\u201d he says. \u201cBuy wholewheat and, if you can, UK-grown grains or ancient grains.\u201d</p> <p>If wholewheat is good, are alternative grains, pulses and legumes better? From pea penne to lentil lasagne, these lookalikes eschew the durum wheat that pasta has been made from for centuries. They are part of a general rise in \u201cfree-from\u201d foods. In July, <a href=\"https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/category-reports/free-from-trends-2024-dull-and-tasteless-no-more/693184.article\">the Grocer reported</a> that the category as a whole broke through the \u00a32bn barrier in the UK five years ago and is now worth nearly double that, at \u00a33.9bn.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Lentil and pea pastas are good for people who don\u2019t eat meat \u2013 a serving contains almost as much protein as a small chicken breast</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The increasing availability of pasta alternatives is great news for coeliacs, who can\u2019t eat gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley and rye), and for people with gluten intolerances and sensitivities. But they are also touted as healthier products for the rest of us. Are they?</p> <p>\u201cAlternative pastas are often much higher in protein and fibre,\u201d says Hobson. Most people already get enough protein in their diets, but vegetarians and vegans may not. \u201cLentil and pea pastas are really good options for people who don\u2019t eat meat \u2013 a serving contains almost as much protein as a small chicken breast,\u201d he says. Sainsbury\u2019s own-brand white pasta contains 11g of protein per 200g cooked serving, whereas its green pea and red lentil pastas contain 22g and nearly 25g respectively \u2013 half an adult\u2019s reference intake.</p> <p>The vast majority of us don\u2019t eat enough fibre \u2013 according to the British Heart Foundation, average daily intakes are 20g, but they should be 30g. White pasta provides about 3g per 200g, pea and lentil more than 7g each and wholewheat almost 11g. \u201cHigher-fibre pasta is broken down more slowly and keeps you fuller for longer,\u201d says Hobson. Varying your pasta can also contribute to your 30 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/19/chew-slowly-keep-moving-and-eat-30-plants-a-week-12-rules-for-gut-health\">\u201cplant points\u201d</a> a week.</p> <p>However, in April, the epidemiologist Prof Tim Spector posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C50jDCDI6Xa/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=f75b7ecd-6c97-4149-8718-a473c55e606b\">a video on Instagram</a> about the \u201cbig craze\u201d for gluten-free pasta, warning that not all varieties are high in fibre and protein and some are ultra-processed, containing emulsifiers that are thought to damage the gut. He praised red lentil pasta for its high protein, but concluded: \u201cFor the majority of us who aren\u2019t coeliac or don\u2019t have an intolerance, wholegrain alternatives are often less processed, cheaper and healthier.\u201d</p> <p>Alderuccio, who has a gluten intolerance, is a fan of pasta made from white corn and rice (check the label to ensure it doesn\u2019t contain emulsifiers). \u201cThis is the easiest to cook and the most similar in flavour \u2013 it\u2019s brilliant. Buckwheat pasta is also fantastic.\u201d</p>    <p>If pasta alternatives are good enough for a Sicilian, they have to be worth a try. I subjected my partner and his two teenage children to a taste test of eight kinds of fusilli: white; wholewheat; tricolori (flavoured with tomato and spinach); spelt; brown rice; corn and rice; green pea; and red lentil. (The 2020 YouGov survey found that fusilli is Britain\u2019s favourite pasta shape, with spaghetti in second place and penne third.) The pastas we tried are widely available from Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose; none had any emulsifiers or other additives. We tasted them all plain and with pesto.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have high hopes \u2013 Hobson and Alderuccio had warned me that alternative pastas are not as easy to cook and can go squidgy or break apart. In fact, they all held their shape perfectly well.</p> <p>We all agreed with Alderuccio that the rice and corn blend was the best substitute for white pasta \u2013 none of us could taste the difference. The green pea pasta was the most unusual, with a pronounced but pleasant pea flavour and a mealy texture that would soak up a lot of sauce.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s favourite by far was the red lentil pasta, which had a subtle flavour that we thought would go well with tomatoes. I usually eat wholewheat pasta, but the others really disliked its dense texture and \u201cworthy\u201d taste \u2013 suggesting anecdotally that it may not be the simplest swap for white pasta after all.</p> <p>In the end, the starkest difference was the cost. Sainsbury\u2019s white fusilli is 65p for 500g, while wholewheat is 75p. Its brown rice, green pea and red lentil pastas are \u00a31.70 each for half as much. It does have a 500g \u201cfree-from\u201d pasta for 75p (made from rice, maize and quinoa), but it contains emulsifiers. The equivalent at Waitrose, which has no emulsifiers, is \u00a31.75. As ever, avoiding ultra-processed food comes at a cost.</p> <p>So, what is the healthiest, tastiest, cheapest way forward? A varied diet featuring wholewheat pasta, red lentil dal, split pea soup, buckwheat noodles, chickpea curry, brown rice and so on. But if you love a comforting bowl of white pasta, don\u2019t sweat it \u2013 just try not to have mac\u2019n\u2019cheese every day.</p> <h2>Five simple pasta sauces</h2> <p>Recipes by <a href=\"https://www.bettinaskitchen.com/\">Bettina Campolucci Bordi</a>, a plant-based, free-from cook.</p> <h2>Pumpkin seed pesto</h2> <p>Makes<strong> </strong>1 jar</p> <p><strong>250ml olive oil<br>120g pumpkin seeds<br>1 bunch of basil (30g)<br>1 clove of garlic</strong>, peeled<strong><br>\u00bd tbsp each salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p>Add all the ingredients to a blender and blitz until smooth.

In fact, they all held their shape perfectly well. We all agreed with Alderuccio that the rice and corn blend was the best substitute for white pasta \u2013 none of us could taste the difference. The green pea pasta was the most unusual, with a pronounced but pleasant pea flavour and a mealy texture that would soak up a lot of sauce. Everyone\u2019s favourite by far was the red lentil pasta, which had a subtle flavour that we thought would go well with tomatoes. I usually eat wholewheat pasta, but the others really disliked its dense texture and \u201cworthy\u201d taste \u2013 suggesting anecdotally that it may not be the simplest swap for white pasta after all. In the end, the starkest difference was the cost. Sainsbury\u2019s white fusilli is 65p for 500g, while wholewheat is 75p. Its brown rice, green pea and red lentil pastas are \u00a31.70 each for half as much. It does have a 500g \u201cfree-from\u201d pasta for 75p (made from rice, maize and quinoa), but it contains emulsifiers. The equivalent at Waitrose, which has no emulsifiers, is \u00a31.75. As ever, avoiding ultra-processed food comes at a cost. So, what is the healthiest, tastiest, cheapest way forward? A varied diet featuring wholewheat pasta, red lentil dal, split pea soup, buckwheat noodles, chickpea curry, brown rice and so on. But if you love a comforting bowl of white pasta, don\u2019t sweat it \u2013 just try not to have mac\u2019n\u2019cheese every day. Five simple pasta sauces Recipes by Bettina Campolucci Bordi, a plant-based, free-from cook. Pumpkin seed pesto Makes 1 jar 250ml olive oil 120g pumpkin seeds 1 bunch of basil (30g) 1 clove of garlic, peeled \u00bd tbsp each salt and black pepper Add all the ingredients to a blender and blitz until smooth.

      "body": "<p>The last time I was in Los Angeles, in February 2020, I had told a white lie. My taxi driver asked me what I was doing there. \u201cI\u2019m here to write about Joni Mitchell,\u201d I said. I wanted to have a story. Earlier this month, I landed at LAX airport, returning to see Mitchell play at the Hollywood&nbsp;Bowl.</p> <p>In 2020, the idea she would perform again seemed like fantasy. In 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/01/joni-mitchell-taken-to-hospital-reports\">she had an aneurysm </a>that left her unable to speak or walk, and even before that, her public performances had been rare. But over the past few years, Mitchell has hosted musicians at her home for a \u201cjam\u201d in her living room. For a long time, she listened to others sing her songs to her, but then, gradually, she began to sing along. In 2022, she made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/25/joni-mitchell-gives-first-full-live-performance-since-2002\">surprise appearance at the Newport folk festival</a> in Rhode Island and, last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/11/joni-mitchell-review-gorge-amphitheatre-quincy-washington\">headlined a show in Washington state</a>. I failed to get tickets. In the days after, I\u2019d watch videos of it people posted on Instagram, but with the sound down because it felt too painful to listen to, as though I was seeing the love of my life get married to someone else. I wanted to hold on to an idea I\u2019d hear her for myself one day.</p>    <p>After my first trip to Los Angeles, I began to write a book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/26/arrangements-in-blue-notes-on-love-and-making-a-life-by-amy-key-review-courageous-meditation-on-singledom\">Arrangements in Blue</a></em>, inspired by the type of intimate self-examination that is at the heart of Mitchell\u2019s music, especially her album <em>Blue</em>. Like millions of her fans, I felt \u2013 I feel \u2013 that <em>Blue</em> belongs to me, as if it is part of my own personal mode of emotional expression. It shaped my ideas of romantic love, of the life I believed I would lead and the woman I would grow to be. So when I wanted to look at the life I\u2019d created and the one I wanted, it was <em>Blue</em> I turned to, using a lyric from each of the songs as a prompt to explore different parts of life. Since my book was published last spring, I\u2019ve become, for some people, tethered to Mitchell. I\u2019m sent news about her, links to interviews and clips. Readers tell me what she means to them \u2013 what their favourite song is. And some tell me they\u2019ve listened to her for the first time: they\u2019ve found <em>Blue</em> because of my book. I\u2019m hardly the first writer to fall under her spell, but I\u2019m glad to have contributed to a growing body of culture that celebrates her significance as an artist.</p> <p>Then, in January this year, she announced another show. I unfroze a credit card and bought \u2013 in a state of real panic and confusion, as though I was trying to escape the Crystal Maze \u2013 two tickets at the cost of \u00a31,979.29. After, I was in shock. The combination of spending more money on a single thing than I\u2019d ever done in my life and the near certainty I\u2019d get to see Mitchell perform took hold of my nervous system in a way I couldn\u2019t comprehend. How was I going to pay for all this and how would I survive the emotional debt this encounter with Mitchell might&nbsp;generate?</p> <p>Once I land in LA, for the first few days I work in the courtyard of my hotel, my brain soothed by the sound of water running from the spout of a stonework lion into a small pond. Then I take a trip to the Getty museum. My Uber driver, a cheerful man named Gregory, asks me what I\u2019m doing in LA. \u201cI\u2019m here to see Joni Mitchell at the Bowl,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m going to be writing about it for a newspaper back home.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got chills!\u201d he replies. \u201cI\u2019m so excited for you, you\u2019re going to have <em>the best</em> time.\u201d I can\u2019t get my enthusiasm to match his. I realise I am feeling&nbsp;afraid.</p> <p>My friend the Scottish poet Roddy Lumsden died just before my last trip to Los Angeles. He\u2019d been ill for a long time, suffering from complications of alcohol addiction. That time is infused with grief: everything I saw and experienced was illuminated by or in the shadow of his absence and the confrontation his death had instigated. While I was standing outside Mitchell\u2019s old house in Laurel Canyon on a kind of pilgrimage in 2020, for the first time I allowed myself to acknowledge a pain I\u2019d been carrying. I had let the absence of romantic love become the organising principle of my life. I\u2019d built my life around, and defined it through, lack. The trip was transformative: it opened up a space to rethink my life and ultimately it was the impetus to write <em>Arrangements in Blue</em>, which, while it isn\u2019t a book about Mitchell, is a book that would not exist without her.</p> <p>That I would tether my life so intimately to someone I\u2019ve never met surprises me. I love to be a fan, but I\u2019ve never signed up to fandom. I don\u2019t get into fights about Mitchell on the internet and I am not a completist. There\u2019s a lot of her oeuvre I\u2019m yet to spend time with. But I have written a book inspired by a work of art created by a person who doesn\u2019t know I exist. If that\u2019s not fandom, then what is? The thought of sharing a space with her, the knowledge I would hear her speak and sing live gave me the woozy panicked feeling of waking from a dream where someone you\u2019ve lost appears to be alive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I want, I now realise with some small degree of shame, to identify myself as a big fan, attract her attention</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe things we want most we will never have,\u201d wrote Roddy in a poem. Will I get what I want? Do I deserve to have it? When it comes, will I be able to experience it, inhabit the moment completely? This was where the fear was coming from, that I might not be equal to the opportunity. Maybe Roddy meant not that you don\u2019t get the things you want most, but that if you do, the experience will not correspond to the desire you felt. A bride left disenchanted by her longed-for wedding day.</p> <p>Since my book came out I\u2019ve been asked countless times: \u201cHas Joni read it?\u201d \u201cI wish,\u201d I say. \u201cOh God, I hope not,\u201d I think. I hate the thought of my own art inspired by Mitchell finding its way to her and for her to hate it or, worse, be utterly indifferent. I don\u2019t need her to know who I am, or what I think of her and how her music made me. A Mitchell lyric to hand for every heartbreak, for every sense of restlessness.</p>    <p>This is almost true. In the days leading up to the concert, I\u2019ve daydreamed about what I might post about it on Instagram: a photo of Mitchell singing captioned: \u201cThis is my Eras tour.\u201d There isn\u2019t a Swiftie friendship bracelet exchange equivalent for the Mitchell fanbase, but I\u2019ve brought my own merch. A customised jacket inspired by an original tour jacket from 1976. I commissioned someone to recreate the beautiful chain-stitched lettering on the back. At the show, I want people to say: \u201cI love your jacket, where did you get it?\u201d I want, I now realise with some small degree of shame, to identify myself as a big fan, attract Mitchell\u2019s attention. My heart not just on my sleeve but embroidered on my back.</p> <p>On my first trip to LA, I had a sense of wanting to trace Mitchell\u2019s steps, as though being eye level with her experience might reveal something to me. I got more than I bargained for in that respect: it sent me careening into something more intimate than I could have imagined. But this time I have a strange sense of haunting myself, retracing my steps to check how I correspond with past me. LA keeps throwing cinematic narratives my way. Visiting a flea market, I stop at a box of old postcards and immediately find one, sent in 1934, with an ethereal illustration of the Hollywood Bowl at night. A couple of days later, I call an Uber and the driver gets out: it\u2019s Gregory, from my trip to the Getty. He tells me that earlier that day he dropped a woman off in Laurel Canyon, saying she\u2019d met Mitchell back in the day.</p> <p>The day before the show, I meet up with photographer Dan Tuffs. We stop at the Canyon Country Store, a famous landmark from the 1960s and 70s, then take a detour so I can once more walk down Mitchell\u2019s old street, site of my epiphany back in 2020.</p> <p>The day of the concert, I have lunch with the writer Dolly Alderton (back in London, we met and became friends because we both love Mitchell). \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d We ask each other over our bloody marys. \u201cI have a confusing sense of nervy excitement,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s like <em>I</em> am going to be doing a show.\u201d</p> <p>I go with my friend Doug Powell, a poet who lives in San Francisco. We meet before the show and walk to the Bowl, slowly meeting others going in the same direction, a snaking crowd forming. I tune into bits of conversation. \u201cI hope she plays Morning Morgantown,\u201d a man says. \u201cI think she loves mozzarella sticks,\u201d a girl says. \u201cShe loves mozzarella sticks?\u201d her companion says in reply. \u201cYeah, well I think she\u2019s definitely a vegetarian.\u201d \u201cLook at that jacket,\u201d a woman says, and I wonder if she\u2019s talking about me.</p> <p>Taking our seats at the Bowl, I am surprised to find mine is slap bang in the middle: I will be eye to eye with Mitchell even if I can\u2019t see her face from that distance. In the row behind us is a family, in front a lesbian couple; people with pizzas and drinks, wearing merch while holding on to their new merch.</p> <p>The house lights go down and the stage begins to revolve. We all get to our feet. The big screen shows Mitchell on her throne, wearing purple velvet and her hair in plaits under a beret. Her skin seemingly lit from within, she holds a walking stick tipped with a diamond-encrusted cat\u2019s head like a sceptre. Beside her, a table with a stained-glass Tiffany lamp. We are invited into her living room, all on the same level, seated, but spiritually at her feet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The third song she sings is Hejira, the one I had dared to hope for. My tears come then, silent and steady</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She opens with two songs I don\u2019t know, Be Cool and Harlem in Havana. It doesn\u2019t matter. I almost need that dislocation from my personal Mitchell canon to adjust to what is happening: I am really there, <em>she</em> is really there. But the third song she plays is Hejira, the one I had dared to hope for. \u201cSo now I\u2019m returning to myself,\u201d she sings, \u201cThese things that you and I suppressed.\u201d The tears come then, silent and steady. She sings Coyote, mischievous and sexy. I think of a young woman, \u00cdde, who I met last year at a book event, and how happy she must be \u2013 I know she is somewhere in the audience \u2013 with her \u201cNo regrets Coyote\u201d tattoo.</p> <p>There is a singalong to Carey, reminding me of when I visited Matala in Crete, where Mitchell met Cary Raditz, and felt too self-conscious to sing along when the tour guide played the song on the coach. This time, I stand up with everyone else, add my voice to theirs. Closing her first set, she sings Both Sides Now; the moon rises to the right of the stage, inching over the hills as she begins and finishing high above the Bowl as she takes us into the interval. As counterpoint to her incredibly rich, strong voice, I can hear a woman behind me weeping uncontrollably.</p>    <p>The second half is more bombastic: out come the special guests (Doug leaps out of his seat at the sight of Annie Lennox). They begin with a barnstorming Big Yellow Taxi, a song I can ordinarily take or leave but find myself swept up by. A thrilling Raised on Robbery, followed by California, sung mainly by Marcus Mumford but redeemed for me by Joni\u2019s spontaneous interjections. Hearing her ask an audience if they will \u201ctake me as I am\u201d moves me deeply. The distance Mitchell has travelled between recording that song in her 20s and singing it to a rapt audience at 80 years old is so gorgeously felt in her voice. Every lyric and evolution of her register is enriched by the journey she has been on, and it feels a privilege to get to hear it: hear how life \u2013 its pain, glory, futility, rancour, joy \u2013 accumulates.</p> <p>After Dog Eat Dog, someone shouts: \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d and she replies: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/21/joni-mitchell-lets-rip-at-donald-trump-at-rarity-laden-us-concert\">I love that song.</a>\u201d Throughout, she chuckles and laughs, letting her pleasure show. During Shine, I scribble down a lyric \u2013 \u201cThey travelled inward / Past themselves\u201d \u2013 because it feels important to remember. It\u2019s where I need to go. To quote Come in from the Cold: \u201cI longed to lose control.\u201d I want to know I can just love Mitchell and (to quote an earlier song) \u201cforget about me\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m left wondering how you metabolise profound experience. I\u2019m not sure you can in its immediate wake. That night with Mitchell was so intimately mine yet shared with almost 18,000 others. I was just a biggest fan among all her biggest fans. It has entered me in a form beyond language, infused my cells. I\u2019m rendered daft and incapable other than the most cliched expression. If I feel overwhelmed, then good. I\u2019m grateful. How wonderful to know what something has meant to you with no need to persuade someone of it.</p> <p>On the postcard I found at the flea market, the sender wrote: \u201cIt was thrilling sitting there with just the stars for a roof.\u201d Twice, when I looked up at the night sky above the Bowl, I saw a shooting star.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Arrangements in Blue</em> by Amy Key is published by Vintage (\u00a310.99).

But I have written a book inspired by a work of art created by a person who doesn\u2019t know I exist. If that\u2019s not fandom, then what is? The thought of sharing a space with her, the knowledge I would hear her speak and sing live gave me the woozy panicked feeling of waking from a dream where someone you\u2019ve lost appears to be alive. \u201cThe things we want most we will never have,\u201d wrote Roddy in a poem. Will I get what I want? Do I deserve to have it? When it comes, will I be able to experience it, inhabit the moment completely? This was where the fear was coming from, that I might not be equal to the opportunity. Maybe Roddy meant not that you don\u2019t get the things you want most, but that if you do, the experience will not correspond to the desire you felt. A bride left disenchanted by her longed-for wedding day. Since my book came out I\u2019ve been asked countless times: \u201cHas Joni read it?\u201d \u201cI wish,\u201d I say. \u201cOh God, I hope not,\u201d I think. I hate the thought of my own art inspired by Mitchell finding its way to her and for her to hate it or, worse, be utterly indifferent. I don\u2019t need her to know who I am, or what I think of her and how her music made me. A Mitchell lyric to hand for every heartbreak, for every sense of restlessness. This is almost true. In the days leading up to the concert, I\u2019ve daydreamed about what I might post about it on Instagram: a photo of Mitchell singing captioned: \u201cThis is my Eras tour.\u201d There isn\u2019t a Swiftie friendship bracelet exchange equivalent for the Mitchell fanbase, but I\u2019ve brought my own merch. A customised jacket inspired by an original tour jacket from 1976. I commissioned someone to recreate the beautiful chain-stitched lettering on the back. At the show, I want people to say: \u201cI love your jacket, where did you get it?\u201d I want, I now realise with some small degree of shame, to identify myself as a big fan, attract Mitchell\u2019s attention. My heart not just on my sleeve but embroidered on my back. On my first trip to LA, I had a sense of wanting to trace Mitchell\u2019s steps, as though being eye level with her experience might reveal something to me. I got more than I bargained for in that respect: it sent me careening into something more intimate than I could have imagined. But this time I have a strange sense of haunting myself, retracing my steps to check how I correspond with past me. LA keeps throwing cinematic narratives my way. Visiting a flea market, I stop at a box of old postcards and immediately find one, sent in 1934, with an ethereal illustration of the Hollywood Bowl at night. A couple of days later, I call an Uber and the driver gets out: it\u2019s Gregory, from my trip to the Getty. He tells me that earlier that day he dropped a woman off in Laurel Canyon, saying she\u2019d met Mitchell back in the day. The day before the show, I meet up with photographer Dan Tuffs. We stop at the Canyon Country Store, a famous landmark from the 1960s and 70s, then take a detour so I can once more walk down Mitchell\u2019s old street, site of my epiphany back in 2020. The day of the concert, I have lunch with the writer Dolly Alderton (back in London, we met and became friends because we both love Mitchell). \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d We ask each other over our bloody marys. \u201cI have a confusing sense of nervy excitement,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s like I am going to be doing a show.\u201d I go with my friend Doug Powell, a poet who lives in San Francisco. We meet before the show and walk to the Bowl, slowly meeting others going in the same direction, a snaking crowd forming. I tune into bits of conversation. \u201cI hope she plays Morning Morgantown,\u201d a man says. \u201cI think she loves mozzarella sticks,\u201d a girl says. \u201cShe loves mozzarella sticks?\u201d her companion says in reply. \u201cYeah, well I think she\u2019s definitely a vegetarian.\u201d \u201cLook at that jacket,\u201d a woman says, and I wonder if she\u2019s talking about me. Taking our seats at the Bowl, I am surprised to find mine is slap bang in the middle: I will be eye to eye with Mitchell even if I can\u2019t see her face from that distance. In the row behind us is a family, in front a lesbian couple; people with pizzas and drinks, wearing merch while holding on to their new merch. The house lights go down and the stage begins to revolve. We all get to our feet. The big screen shows Mitchell on her throne, wearing purple velvet and her hair in plaits under a beret. Her skin seemingly lit from within, she holds a walking stick tipped with a diamond-encrusted cat\u2019s head like a sceptre. Beside her, a table with a stained-glass Tiffany lamp. We are invited into her living room, all on the same level, seated, but spiritually at her feet. She opens with two songs I don\u2019t know, Be Cool and Harlem in Havana. It doesn\u2019t matter. I almost need that dislocation from my personal Mitchell canon to adjust to what is happening: I am really there, she is really there. But the third song she plays is Hejira, the one I had dared to hope for. \u201cSo now I\u2019m returning to myself,\u201d she sings, \u201cThese things that you and I suppressed.\u201d The tears come then, silent and steady. She sings Coyote, mischievous and sexy. I think of a young woman, \u00cdde, who I met last year at a book event, and how happy she must be \u2013 I know she is somewhere in the audience \u2013 with her \u201cNo regrets Coyote\u201d tattoo. There is a singalong to Carey, reminding me of when I visited Matala in Crete, where Mitchell met Cary Raditz, and felt too self-conscious to sing along when the tour guide played the song on the coach. This time, I stand up with everyone else, add my voice to theirs. Closing her first set, she sings Both Sides Now; the moon rises to the right of the stage, inching over the hills as she begins and finishing high above the Bowl as she takes us into the interval. As counterpoint to her incredibly rich, strong voice, I can hear a woman behind me weeping uncontrollably. The second half is more bombastic: out come the special guests (Doug leaps out of his seat at the sight of Annie Lennox). They begin with a barnstorming Big Yellow Taxi, a song I can ordinarily take or leave but find myself swept up by. A thrilling Raised on Robbery, followed by California, sung mainly by Marcus Mumford but redeemed for me by Joni\u2019s spontaneous interjections. Hearing her ask an audience if they will \u201ctake me as I am\u201d moves me deeply. The distance Mitchell has travelled between recording that song in her 20s and singing it to a rapt audience at 80 years old is so gorgeously felt in her voice. Every lyric and evolution of her register is enriched by the journey she has been on, and it feels a privilege to get to hear it: hear how life \u2013 its pain, glory, futility, rancour, joy \u2013 accumulates. After Dog Eat Dog, someone shouts: \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d and she replies: \u201cI love that song.\u201d Throughout, she chuckles and laughs, letting her pleasure show. During Shine, I scribble down a lyric \u2013 \u201cThey travelled inward / Past themselves\u201d \u2013 because it feels important to remember. It\u2019s where I need to go. To quote Come in from the Cold: \u201cI longed to lose control.\u201d I want to know I can just love Mitchell and (to quote an earlier song) \u201cforget about me\u201d. I\u2019m left wondering how you metabolise profound experience. I\u2019m not sure you can in its immediate wake. That night with Mitchell was so intimately mine yet shared with almost 18,000 others. I was just a biggest fan among all her biggest fans. It has entered me in a form beyond language, infused my cells. I\u2019m rendered daft and incapable other than the most cliched expression. If I feel overwhelmed, then good. I\u2019m grateful. How wonderful to know what something has meant to you with no need to persuade someone of it. On the postcard I found at the flea market, the sender wrote: \u201cIt was thrilling sitting there with just the stars for a roof.\u201d Twice, when I looked up at the night sky above the Bowl, I saw a shooting star.

Fire Wes Streeting out of a cannon (even though he played along with the Wetherspoon\u2019s suggestion, claiming it was \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/wesstreeting/status/1848376248910663964\">sadly vetoed by the Chancellor</a>\u201d)?

Someone suggested a Frequent Patient Programme, where the most assiduous attenders \u201ccould earn quirky prizes like honorary hospital gowns or gold-plated tongue depressors\u201d. Streeting, said another, should do an Undercover Boss NHS show, to generate \u201cheartwarming anecdotes\u201d. Other proposals included adding a \u201cleap hour\u201d between 08.00 and 08.01 \u201cso that everyone has time to book their GP appointments\u201d and piping Coldplay through hospital speakers to stop delayed discharges (who are we targeting here, the patients or staff? What of the collateral damage?).</p> <p>Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to work out if contributions are a joke, modest-proposal-adjacent satire or deadly serious.

      "bodyText": "Do you ever wonder if the British might be a fundamentally unserious people? I do, though I should stress that I include myself; a thoroughly trivial person whose \u201cprofessional\u201d life is mainly spent in the silliest corners of an internet that long ago destroyed my capacity for joined-up thinking. Still, if you do have any intellectual rigour, it must be troubling, what with the hegemony of Hun culture, voting for politicians purely on bants potential, expressing dissent through the medium of milkshake chucking, being endlessly amused by our own social awkwardness and viewing Gemma Collins as some kind of philosopher savant. It\u2019s all arguably ironic, but that doesn\u2019t make it any better. I keep expecting Melvyn Bragg to defect and seek asylum in the Sorbonne. I was thinking this as I read the responses to the NHS\u2019s idea-generating Change project. Launched last week and described as a \u201cnational conversation\u201d and \u201crallying cry to the nation\u201d, the Change NHS website offers a platform for the British public to contribute views and ideas on how to fix the NHS. You can probably already imagine the kind of highlights picked out by eagle-eyed readers before moderators ruined the fun. Get your British banter bingo card and dobbers out: put a Wetherspoon\u2019s in every hospital? Tick. Make Larry the Cat the health minister? Tick. Fire Wes Streeting out of a cannon (even though he played along with the Wetherspoon\u2019s suggestion, claiming it was \u201csadly vetoed by the Chancellor\u201d)? Tick. Anger management counselling for GP receptionists? Absolutely. Make it the \u201cNorthern Health Service and make others get their own\u201d? Tick. Call it \u201cNHSy McNHS Face\u201d? Bingo! Browsing the site, I found a few more. Someone suggested a Frequent Patient Programme, where the most assiduous attenders \u201ccould earn quirky prizes like honorary hospital gowns or gold-plated tongue depressors\u201d. Streeting, said another, should do an Undercover Boss NHS show, to generate \u201cheartwarming anecdotes\u201d. Other proposals included adding a \u201cleap hour\u201d between 08.00 and 08.01 \u201cso that everyone has time to book their GP appointments\u201d and piping Coldplay through hospital speakers to stop delayed discharges (who are we targeting here, the patients or staff? What of the collateral damage?). Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to work out if contributions are a joke, modest-proposal-adjacent satire or deadly serious. Food court-style buzzers for A&amp;E sound fun, but unworkable. One wag suggested exercise bikes in waiting rooms, which patients could pedal to generate electricity, with health and energy saving benefits, with the most powerful pedallers \u201cfast-tracked to their appointments\u201d. \u201cAllow patients to vote each other off the ward\u201d sounds like something that could be successfully televised, becoming a powerful revenue driver. \u201cI have a solution: wolves\u201d one submission said, succinctly, if mysteriously, quoting the Guardian\u2019s George Monbiot. Some suggestions are definitely in earnest, but you wish they weren\u2019t. A depressing number of people support penalising \u201clifestyle\u201d illnesses, the most sinister kind of slippery slope. Then there are those who think the NHS should look like a Sunday evening feelgood TV series, apparently yearning for a time when doctors smoked pipes, wore tweed and cycled round to cure your shellshock with a pep talk and an arrowroot biscuit. They want sanatoriums, cottage hospitals and parish nurses; clear hierarchical uniforms and \u201choney still for tea\u201d.

      "body": "<p>As a young artist, Miguel Arzabe visited art shows around the US to learn from others\u2019 work. But his biggest source of inspiration were the exhibit catalogues. Fascinated by the documents, he decided to make his own work out of the books themselves.</p> <p>He cut the pages into thin strips and wove them into a large, intricate Andean tapestry called Last Weaving \u2013 because the strips would make a timeless and lasting work of art \u2013 completed in 2018.</p> <p>Arzabe had previously made similar tapestries from used movie posters and old pamphlets. At first, it was hard to find buyers for the work, and Arzabe considered quitting. But his tapestries, blending ancient patterns with ubiquitous modern material, eventually gained traction in the art market. Beginning this month, Arzabe\u2019s Last Weaving will hang from the ceiling of the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) museum in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco\">San Francisco</a>, part of The Poetics of Dimensions, a show of artwork made entirely of found and discarded objects \u2013 from plastic bags to shoelaces.</p>    <p>\u201cThese are all materials we recognize, but the artists have alchemized them\u201d to help viewers think through consumerism, its aftermath and the ability of art to bring new life to thrown-away objects, said the show\u2019s curator, Larry Ossei-Mensah.</p> <p>Ossei-Mensah worked with Alison Gass, the museum\u2019s director, for months to plan the show of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art\">art</a> made with used toothpaste caps, zip ties, broken computer keys, perfume spray tubes and other used objects. They initially planned to mount the show at the museum, set up in 2022 at a former school gym in the city\u2019s gentrifying Dogpatch neighborhood. But with weeks to go, the museum itself was offered a new space, in a building in downtown San Francisco, <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2024/08/30/institute-of-contemporary-art-san-francisco-relocates-downtown/\">reportedly for free</a>.</p> <p>The show will now be housed among ageing vaults at the Cube, a former bank and one of San Francisco\u2019s landmark buildings, which had lain vacant as the city\u2019s tech workers increasingly began working from home. The found objects will be shown in a found space.</p>      <p>\u201cWe want to help viewers navigate the world through artistic practice,\u201d Gass said on a recent Tuesday, as the artwork was coming out of crates. A large abstract painting, spread across two canvases, went from shades of pink to red. Closer inspection showed it was made entirely of durags carefully stitched together \u2013 a work by the artist Anthony Akinbola.</p> <p>Together, the artworks seek to question what is desirable, bring visibility to the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/waste\">waste</a> collectors and reveal the increasingly global nature of waste supply chains.</p> <p>For instance, there is a nearly life-sized image of a woman in a pink coat bent low under a load she is carrying on her back. It is one of many images of waste pickers and porters from around the world created by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles\">Los Angeles</a>-based artist Huge McCloud. On a trip to Mumbai, McCloud saw plastic sacks being used to store nearly everything he saw, to transport products such as construction equipment, and to serve as roofing material. He began collecting these sacks and then single-use plastic bags from his travels to Morocco, the Philippines, Thailand, India and elsewhere. He stacked them by color at his studio, then cut out plastic strips and pressed them onto canvas using a clothing iron to create a painting-like effect.</p>    <p>Much of the plastic waste in the US and Europe is shipped to Asia, where waste pickers like those McCloud portrays collect plastic to resell. \u201cI am concerned with social inequality and through my art I want to show what we ignore,\u201d McCloud says. \u201cI am trying to use my work to open up these conversations, create a manageable way for viewers to swallow truth.\u201d</p> <p>Arzabe, meanwhile, says his own work was initially a response to the Bay Area\u2019s tech boom. \u201cSo much money was going towards creating newer and more complex technology,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to show that complexity and value could be created through humble materials.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The Poetics of Dimensions is on view at San Francisco\u2019s Institute of Contemporary Art from 25 October to 23 February</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "As a young artist, Miguel Arzabe visited art shows around the US to learn from others\u2019 work. But his biggest source of inspiration were the exhibit catalogues. Fascinated by the documents, he decided to make his own work out of the books themselves. He cut the pages into thin strips and wove them into a large, intricate Andean tapestry called Last Weaving \u2013 because the strips would make a timeless and lasting work of art \u2013 completed in 2018. Arzabe had previously made similar tapestries from used movie posters and old pamphlets. At first, it was hard to find buyers for the work, and Arzabe considered quitting. But his tapestries, blending ancient patterns with ubiquitous modern material, eventually gained traction in the art market. Beginning this month, Arzabe\u2019s Last Weaving will hang from the ceiling of the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) museum in San Francisco, part of The Poetics of Dimensions, a show of artwork made entirely of found and discarded objects \u2013 from plastic bags to shoelaces. \u201cThese are all materials we recognize, but the artists have alchemized them\u201d to help viewers think through consumerism, its aftermath and the ability of art to bring new life to thrown-away objects, said the show\u2019s curator, Larry Ossei-Mensah. Ossei-Mensah worked with Alison Gass, the museum\u2019s director, for months to plan the show of art made with used toothpaste caps, zip ties, broken computer keys, perfume spray tubes and other used objects. They initially planned to mount the show at the museum, set up in 2022 at a former school gym in the city\u2019s gentrifying Dogpatch neighborhood. But with weeks to go, the museum itself was offered a new space, in a building in downtown San Francisco, reportedly for free. The show will now be housed among ageing vaults at the Cube, a former bank and one of San Francisco\u2019s landmark buildings, which had lain vacant as the city\u2019s tech workers increasingly began working from home. The found objects will be shown in a found space. \u201cWe want to help viewers navigate the world through artistic practice,\u201d Gass said on a recent Tuesday, as the artwork was coming out of crates. A large abstract painting, spread across two canvases, went from shades of pink to red. Closer inspection showed it was made entirely of durags carefully stitched together \u2013 a work by the artist Anthony Akinbola. Together, the artworks seek to question what is desirable, bring visibility to the work of waste collectors and reveal the increasingly global nature of waste supply chains. For instance, there is a nearly life-sized image of a woman in a pink coat bent low under a load she is carrying on her back. It is one of many images of waste pickers and porters from around the world created by the Los Angeles-based artist Huge McCloud. On a trip to Mumbai, McCloud saw plastic sacks being used to store nearly everything he saw, to transport products such as construction equipment, and to serve as roofing material. He began collecting these sacks and then single-use plastic bags from his travels to Morocco, the Philippines, Thailand, India and elsewhere. He stacked them by color at his studio, then cut out plastic strips and pressed them onto canvas using a clothing iron to create a painting-like effect. Much of the plastic waste in the US and Europe is shipped to Asia, where waste pickers like those McCloud portrays collect plastic to resell. \u201cI am concerned with social inequality and through my art I want to show what we ignore,\u201d McCloud says. \u201cI am trying to use my work to open up these conversations, create a manageable way for viewers to swallow truth.\u201d Arzabe, meanwhile, says his own work was initially a response to the Bay Area\u2019s tech boom. \u201cSo much money was going towards creating newer and more complex technology,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to show that complexity and value could be created through humble materials.\u201d The Poetics of Dimensions is on view at San Francisco\u2019s Institute of Contemporary Art from 25 October to 23 February",

Trump\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and his failed attempt to cling to power after losing the 2020 election should alone be disqualifying, Obama argued. But now the people who worked closest with him when he was president \u2013 his former advisers and cabinet secretaries \u2013 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/election-trump-staffers-john-kelly\">stepped forward </a>with a warning that he should not be allowed to return to power.</p> \n<p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me if I\u2019m a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trump\u2019s gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn,\u201d Obama said. \u201cPreach!\u201d a woman shouted.</p> \n<p>The event in Kalamazoo, which Obama referred to as \u201cKamala-zoo\u201d, was her first appearance on the campaign trail this election, after delivering a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/21/michelle-obama-dnc-speech-reaction\">rousing speech</a> at the Democratic national convention in August. To predominantly female audience, Obama said voters should not choose Harris because she is a woman but \u201cbecause Kamala Harris is a grown-up \u2013 and Lord knows we need a grown-up in the White House\u201d.</p> \n<p>When Obama finished, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>\u2019s Freedom thundered from the loudspeakers and Harris emerged on stage. The women \u2013 the first Black first lady and the first Black vice-president \u2013 embraced, and the crowd erupted.</p> \n<p>With 10 days left, Harris delivered her closing argument: she pledged to be a president who listened to the American people, unlike her opponent, whom she accused of \u201clooking in the mirror all the time\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust imagine the Oval Office in three months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is either Donald Trump in there stewing over his enemies\u2019 list \u2013 or me working for you, checking off my to-do list.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before the event, Harris visited a local doctor\u2019s office in nearby Portage, where she spoke to healthcare providers and medical students about the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion\">abortion</a> restrictions. Harris has made protecting \u201creproductive freedom\u201d and what remains of abortion access a major theme of her campaign, using it to draw a sharp contrast with Trump, who has claimed credit for his role in overturning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade\">Roe v Wade</a> but insisted he would not allow a nationwide ban as president. </p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-guardian-live-world-news/id409128287?mt=8\">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>In Kalamazoo, both Harris and Obama argued that Trump had no credibility on the matter. But Obama went further, describing the full spectrum of women\u2019s reproductive health \u2013 from period cramps to hot flashes \u2013 and demanding that they are seen as \u201cmore than just baby-making vessels\u201d. She lamented the lack of research on women\u2019s health and the racial disparities in treatment. Directing her comments to the \u201cmen who love us\u201d, Obama asked them to consider the harm that is done when a government \u201ckeeps revoking the basic care from its women\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, Barack Obama delivered a stern message for Black men in his first campaign event for Harris, telling them to drop the \u201cexcuses\u201d and support her. Michelle Obama tried a different tack \u2013 asking American men to listen to women this election.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am asking y\u2019all, from the core of my being, to take our lives seriously,\u201d Obama said, her voice swelling with emotion. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get this election right, your wife, your daughter, your mother, we as women will become collateral damage to your rage.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abortion bans, she argued, affected men as well. If something happened during a pregnancy or a delivery and the doctor was prevented from providing care, \u201cyou will be the one praying that it\u2019s not too late. You will be the one pleading for somebody, anybody, to do something, and then there is the tragic but very real possibility that in the worst-case scenario, you just might be the one holding flowers at the funeral,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The Obamas\u2019 appeals reflected the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/07/gen-z-voters-political-ideology-gender-gap\">election-defining gender divide</a> between the candidates, with women powering Harris and men turning to Trump. She acknowledged the challenges facing the country, and conceded that progress could be too slow, but she argued that sitting out or voting third-party was not the answer.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is too much we stand to lose if we get this one wrong,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a> is known as his party\u2019s great orator, Michelle Obama remains one of its most popular and effective speakers. Having once encouraged Democrats to \u201cgo high\u201d when they \u201cgo low\u201d, Obama on Saturday made no effort to conceal her disdain for the man who led a years-long campaign questioning her husband\u2019s birthplace. Trump has also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/harris-trump-birther-attacks/index.html\">turned the racist birtherism </a>conspiracy on Harris, the daughter of immigrants who was born in Oakland, California.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn any other profession or arena, Trump\u2019s criminal track record and amoral character would be embarrassing, shameful and disqualifying,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The Harris campaign deployed Obama \u2013 along with Barack Obama and other leading figures and celebrities, including Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruce Springsteen \u2013 in hopes that their star power might deliver an 11th-hour jolt to a presidential contest that has otherwise remained static.</p> \n<p>Both Harris and Trump were in Michigan on Saturday, chasing the state\u2019s 15 electoral votes.</p> \n<p>After Pennsylvania, where Harris will campaign on Sunday, Michigan is perhaps the next most critical state on the Democrat\u2019s path to the White House.</p> \n<p>Trump \u2013 who planned to spend part of Sunday at a rally in New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden \u2013 won Pennsylvania in 2016, when he tore down the trio of \u201cblue wall\u201d battlegrounds.

      "bodyText": "Michelle Obama laced into Donald Trump in a searing speech in Michigan on Saturday, accusing the former president of \u201cgross incompetence\u201d and having an \u201camoral character\u201d while challenging hesitant Americans to choose Kamala Harris for US president. \u201cBy every measure, she has demonstrated that she\u2019s ready,\u201d the former first lady told a rapt audience in Kalamazoo. \u201cThe real question is, as a country, are we ready for this moment?\u201d With the race virtually deadlocked, Obama, a reluctant political campaigner, said she was in the midwestern battleground heeding her own advice to \u201cdo something\u201d to support Harris bid to be the country\u2019s first female president. In raw and strikingly personal terms, she asked why Harris was being held to a \u201chigher standard\u201d than her opponent. Trump\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and his failed attempt to cling to power after losing the 2020 election should alone be disqualifying, Obama argued. But now the people who worked closest with him when he was president \u2013 his former advisers and cabinet secretaries \u2013 had stepped forward with a warning that he should not be allowed to return to power. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me if I\u2019m a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trump\u2019s gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn,\u201d Obama said. \u201cPreach!\u201d a woman shouted. The event in Kalamazoo, which Obama referred to as \u201cKamala-zoo\u201d, was her first appearance on the campaign trail this election, after delivering a rousing speech at the Democratic national convention in August. To predominantly female audience, Obama said voters should not choose Harris because she is a woman but \u201cbecause Kamala Harris is a grown-up \u2013 and Lord knows we need a grown-up in the White House\u201d. When Obama finished, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Freedom thundered from the loudspeakers and Harris emerged on stage. The women \u2013 the first Black first lady and the first Black vice-president \u2013 embraced, and the crowd erupted. With 10 days left, Harris delivered her closing argument: she pledged to be a president who listened to the American people, unlike her opponent, whom she accused of \u201clooking in the mirror all the time\u201d. \u201cJust imagine the Oval Office in three months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is either Donald Trump in there stewing over his enemies\u2019 list \u2013 or me working for you, checking off my to-do list.\u201d Before the event, Harris visited a local doctor\u2019s office in nearby Portage, where she spoke to healthcare providers and medical students about the impact of abortion restrictions. Harris has made protecting \u201creproductive freedom\u201d and what remains of abortion access a major theme of her campaign, using it to draw a sharp contrast with Trump, who has claimed credit for his role in overturning Roe v Wade but insisted he would not allow a nationwide ban as president. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts In Kalamazoo, both Harris and Obama argued that Trump had no credibility on the matter. But Obama went further, describing the full spectrum of women\u2019s reproductive health \u2013 from period cramps to hot flashes \u2013 and demanding that they are seen as \u201cmore than just baby-making vessels\u201d. She lamented the lack of research on women\u2019s health and the racial disparities in treatment. Directing her comments to the \u201cmen who love us\u201d, Obama asked them to consider the harm that is done when a government \u201ckeeps revoking the basic care from its women\u201d. Earlier this month, Barack Obama delivered a stern message for Black men in his first campaign event for Harris, telling them to drop the \u201cexcuses\u201d and support her. Michelle Obama tried a different tack \u2013 asking American men to listen to women this election. \u201cI am asking y\u2019all, from the core of my being, to take our lives seriously,\u201d Obama said, her voice swelling with emotion. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get this election right, your wife, your daughter, your mother, we as women will become collateral damage to your rage.\u201d Abortion bans, she argued, affected men as well. If something happened during a pregnancy or a delivery and the doctor was prevented from providing care, \u201cyou will be the one praying that it\u2019s not too late. You will be the one pleading for somebody, anybody, to do something, and then there is the tragic but very real possibility that in the worst-case scenario, you just might be the one holding flowers at the funeral,\u201d she said. The Obamas\u2019 appeals reflected the election-defining gender divide between the candidates, with women powering Harris and men turning to Trump. She acknowledged the challenges facing the country, and conceded that progress could be too slow, but she argued that sitting out or voting third-party was not the answer. \u201cThere is too much we stand to lose if we get this one wrong,\u201d she said. While Barack Obama is known as his party\u2019s great orator, Michelle Obama remains one of its most popular and effective speakers. Having once encouraged Democrats to \u201cgo high\u201d when they \u201cgo low\u201d, Obama on Saturday made no effort to conceal her disdain for the man who led a years-long campaign questioning her husband\u2019s birthplace. Trump has also turned the racist birtherism conspiracy on Harris, the daughter of immigrants who was born in Oakland, California. \u201cIn any other profession or arena, Trump\u2019s criminal track record and amoral character would be embarrassing, shameful and disqualifying,\u201d she said. The Harris campaign deployed Obama \u2013 along with Barack Obama and other leading figures and celebrities, including Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruce Springsteen \u2013 in hopes that their star power might deliver an 11th-hour jolt to a presidential contest that has otherwise remained static. Both Harris and Trump were in Michigan on Saturday, chasing the state\u2019s 15 electoral votes. After Pennsylvania, where Harris will campaign on Sunday, Michigan is perhaps the next most critical state on the Democrat\u2019s path to the White House. Trump \u2013 who planned to spend part of Sunday at a rally in New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden \u2013 won Pennsylvania in 2016, when he tore down the trio of \u201cblue wall\u201d battlegrounds. But four years later, Michigan delivered Biden his biggest swing state victory and then Democrats swept the state in the 2022 congressional midterms, after the supreme court ruling overturning Roe v Wade. Polls show a dead heat. Trump has sought to exacerbate Democratic divisions over the Biden administration\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and Lebanon, elevating the issue in Michigan, where scores of Muslim and Arab American voters have said they cannot support Harris. On Saturday, Trump was joined on stage in Novi, Michigan, by Bill Bazzi, the current and first Muslim mayor of Dearborn Heights. \u201cI have never seen the devastation that we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d Bazzi said. \u201cWhen President Trump was president, there was no wars.\u201d The Harris campaign has conducted several outreach attempts to the Arab community, but tensions remain high with little time for a course change and the risk of escalation following Israel\u2019s pre-dawn strikes on Iran. At the event, Harris was interrupted by a pro-Palestinian protester. \u201cWe have to end that war,\u201d she responded, as the crowd drowned out the demonstration with \u201cKamala\u201d chants. Democrats are focused on juicing turnout in Detroit \u2013 which Trump insulted (again) at his Novi event on Saturday \u2013 while aggressively courting women, independents and anti-Trump Republicans in the suburbs.

Israel openly attacked Iran for the first time on Saturday in the latest direct confrontation between the regional enemies, bringing the Middle East another step closer to a full-scale conflagration. In the immediate aftermath, Iran appeared to downplay the airstrikes, which killed four soldiers.

There are only two options here. Hogan will be a key player in whatever happens. Liz Cheney, [former congressmen] Adam Kinzinger and Joe Walsh \u2013 all of us who have been pushed aside and fortunately were not infected with Maga, we will have something to say about what happens on 6 November.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s the day after election day, when Trump will face Kamala Harris. If Trump wins, all bets will be off. If he loses, the never-Trumpers could try to reclaim their party. Few are under any illusions about the size of the task.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take somewhere between six, eight, 10 years to defeat the Maga piece of the party resoundingly and definitively,\u201d said Reed Galen, son of the late GOP stalwart Rich Galen. Galen is an adviser to George W Bush and John McCain, a co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, and now running <a href=\"https://jointheunion.us/\">Join the Union</a>, a coalition of pro-democracy groups.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think about it, 85% of Republican primary voters this year voted for Trump. Now, is that bad for somebody who owns the party and is a former president? Yeah, electorally, it could be. But it also says that the people who actually choose nominees are Maga, right?</p> <p>\u201cDo I think there will be some erosion if Trump loses? Yeah, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be below 50% and I don\u2019t think that anybody who considers themselves a diehard Republican or a Maga Republican is looking to go back to the days of George W Bush, John McCain, or Mitt Romney, or even Nikki Haley.</p> <p>\u201cIf the establishment, such as it is, wants its party back, then it\u2019s going to have to do some pretty serious work to destroy the parts of it that are anti-democratic and fundamentally dangerous to the country. I don\u2019t know, based on their track record, whether they\u2019re willing to do that. Frankly, I don\u2019t think they are.

      "body": "<p>Pat Parker has campaigned for Democratic presidential candidates in the battleground state of Michigan through five elections, and it hasn\u2019t always been a happy experience.</p> <p>The thrill of doorstepping for Barack Obama gave way to working in a Hillary Clinton campaign office in the bellwether Saginaw county, Michigan, with all the atmosphere of a morgue, even though it was assumed she would win. Campaigning for Joe Biden was constrained by the pandemic.</p> <p>Next week\u2019s election, though, is different. For the first time Parker is seeing real fear.</p> <p>The clinical social worker is enthusiastic about Kamala Harris but she recognises that many of those who say they will vote to make her the US\u2019s first Black female president are being goaded to the polls by her opponent, Donald Trump.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>It\u2019s about him. There\u2019s a huge component of, \u2018We can\u2019t have him back, we\u2019ve got to stop him.\u2019 Some conversations, it\u2019s really difficult. People get completely freaked out and upset, and it doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room for, \u2018What do you think of Harris?\u2019,\u201d said Parker.</p> <p>After Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020, many Americans hoped and expected he would withdraw from the political stage. But the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, Trump\u2019s continued subverting of confidence in the electoral system and the lasting consequences of his presidency, not least the loss of abortion rights, meant that the former president remained very much at the forefront of US politics.</p> <p>Parker said this year\u2019s campaign has only ratcheted up the fear as Trump spewed threats to tear down democracy, turn the military on the \u201cenemy within\u201d and use the justice system to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties\">punish those who crossed him</a>. Then there is the mania of Trump\u2019s campaign rallies filled with bile against immigrants, including those in the US legally, and threats to deport millions of people.</p> <p>\u201cWe watch him. It\u2019s like you can\u2019t keep your eyes off a fire,\u201d said Parker.</p> <p>Michiganders have a front row seat to all this, blitzed with campaign ads and rallies, as Harris and Trump battle to the last for every vote in a key state where they remain neck and neck in the <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/michigan/\">polls</a>.</p> <p>The Harris campaign sees its least difficult path to victory as running through Michigan alongside two other Rust belt swing states, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The key to that victory is turnout.</p>    <p>Trump won those \u201cblue wall\u201d states in 2016, taking Michigan by just 10,704 votes.</p> <p>The then president increased his vote substantially in all three states in 2020 but still lost them to Biden, because Democrats who stayed home four years earlier turned out in large numbers to remove Trump from the White House. A larger proportion of registered voters \u2013 72% \u2013 cast a ballot in Michigan in 2020 than in any election since John F Kennedy won the presidency 60 years earlier.</p> <p>There are signs that this year could see an even larger turnout, with Michigan county clerks reporting increased voter registration and nearly 1m postal ballots returned already. The good news for Harris is that the bulk of those come from strongly Democratic areas such as Detroit.</p> <p>But the Harris campaign is all too aware of taking anything for granted in the wake of the failures of 2016. Clinton barely bothered to campaign in Michigan or engage with key blocs such as car workers and Black communities who traditionally voted Democratic. Clinton\u2019s strategists assured worried Michigan Democrats that the data showed she was five points ahead in the state and they were concentrating their resources elsewhere. That confidence was badly misplaced and she lost Michigan and other battleground states.</p> <p>In contrast, Harris has spent more time campaigning in Michigan than any other state except Pennsylvania. The vice-president and her running mate, Tim Walz, are criss-crossing Michigan wooing factory workers and Black voters, white suburban women and college students.</p> <p>The Harris campaign wheeled out Barack Obama to rap with Eminem at a Detroit rally and sent Bernie Sanders, the darling of the left of the Democratic party, to assuage the doubts of student voters who fear that Harris is just another corporate Democrat.</p> <p>Harris is also working to draw in anti-Trump Republicans with the backing of former Republican officials in the state, including former members of congress. The vice-president shared a stage with former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney in a move to reassure Republican voters who are repulsed by Trump, and alarmed at the legal assault on women\u2019s rights, that it is safe to vote for Harris.</p> <p>Cheney\u2019s father, Dick, has also endorsed Harris \u2013 an association that left some Michigan Democrats squirming given his role in driving the US to a disastrous war in Iraq.</p> <p>Chris Wyant, a senior Harris campaign adviser in Michigan who also worked on the Clinton campaign in the state, acknowledged that the strategy is shaped by the lessons learned from the 2016 loss.</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think there was the robust team and we didn\u2019t get the time from the candidate that we do now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For his part, Trump and his vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, have been hitting the state with lots of hard promises that even many of his supporters do not really believe will be fulfilled. The former president told a rally in Saginaw earlier this month that he would make Michigan the \u201ccar capital of the world again\u201d. More than a dozen auto factories in the county, which once employed tens of thousands of people, have closed in recent decades.</p> <p>Trump has also latched on to divisions over electric vehicles at his recent rallies in Michigan, where most voters <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3913\">are opposed</a> to government incentives to promote EVs because it could cost jobs in traditional auto factories.</p> <p>However, the former president did not help himself at a rally in Detroit by disparaging a city still recovering from loss of factories and population, and dotted with abandoned and burned out homes.</p> <p>\u201cOur whole country will end up being like Detroit if she\u2019s your president,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Trump is trusted much more than Harris on two key issues in Michigan \u2013 inflation and immigration. The Biden administration boasts of a booming economy, including record job growth, but statistics don\u2019t help the large numbers of Americans still grappling with the consequences of years of surging prices.</p> <p>At a Saginaw soup kitchen, Darshell Roberson is less concerned as a Black woman about Trump\u2019s racist rhetoric than she is about struggling to maintain a job.</p>    <p>\u201cI voted for Biden but I really feel like Biden has failed me. I trust Donald Trump. In the last election I didn\u2019t vote for him. I was kind of scared of him a little bit, but once I really got to watch him and look at him I liked him,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI think Donald Trump is gonna make everything better. I really do. I could be wrong but hope I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Roberson\u2019s shifting loyalties reflect a deep disillusionment with politicians among many in Michigan, much of it aimed at national Democrats who are viewed as too close to corporate interests or not caring for working people. Union organisers in Saginaw despair that many of their members vote for Trump and in part blame it on how far the Democratic establishment has become detached from the party\u2019s traditional base.</p> <p>Trump is also popular with young white males in Michigan, some of them first-time voters who could help push up the former president\u2019s vote count. Lewis Jensen, for example, travelled to Trump\u2019s rally in Saginaw from rural Michigan.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m voting for Trump. All my friends are voting for Trump. He may get a little crazy in some of the things he says but he\u2019ll put Americans first,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust Harris. I think she\u2019s under the control of Obama. She\u2019ll just do what the banks want.\u201d</p> <p>The key question for Trump, though, is whether he can find enough votes to take the state if Democrats turn out for Harris in the same numbers as they did in 2020.</p> <p>Parker, the Democratic campaigner, said the conversations she is having with other voters suggests many share her alarm at the prospect of Trump returning to power, and this will drive turnout.</p> <p>\u201cHe can do anything now if he gets re-elected. There\u2019s a lot of him that\u2019s just bluster and untruth, and he doesn\u2019t have the energy to follow through on half of it. But he\u2019s now putting people around him that do. It could completely transform this country,\u201d she said.</p>    <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have the ability to protest. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have the ability to be heard. I\u2019m not even sure if there will be elections again. The vengefulness, how deep will it go?\u201d</p> <p>Trump is also facing a changed election process in Michigan.</p> <p>Parker was an activist for a grassroots group, <a href=\"https://votersnotpoliticians.com/\">Voters Not Politicians</a>, that won a referendum to put an end to gerrymandering of elections to the state legislature.<em> </em>A second campaign saw the introduction of nine days of early voting for the first time in the state\u2019s presidential election. Among other things, that will help a push by Black churches to turn out their congregations to vote on the Sunday before election day in a \u201csouls to polls\u201d initiative.</p> <p>Turnout is also likely to be spurred by the issue of abortion rights. Voter numbers surged in the 2022 midterm elections as they backed a ballot initiative enshrining the right to abortion in the Michigan constitution, after the US supreme court struck down Roe v Wade. Democrats in Michigan believe that continued fear of a federal ban on abortion if Trump is elected again, and Republicans win control of both houses of congress, will again help drive turnout, and win over some white suburban women who previously voted for Trump.</p> <p>The issue was a particular driver for students in the midterms. Keaton Henning, a student campaigning for Harris at Saginaw Valley State University, said he expects to see the same this year.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been active since I heard what Donald Trump said about immigrants. Coming from a Hispanic family, that was a big deal in 2016 and so ever since it stuck with me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut for a lot of students it\u2019s women\u2019s rights. So restoring Roe v Wade, that is a big thing that a lot of people on campus talk about. And then there\u2019s a subsection of other people who are talking about the war in Gaza. There\u2019s still that.\u201d</p> <p>Israel\u2019s war in Gaza continues to be a difficult issue for Harris in Michigan. More than 100,000 people, many of them from the state\u2019s Arab American community around Detroit, voted uncommitted in the Democratic primaries in February in a protest against Biden\u2019s support for Israel, as the toll of Palestinian deaths surged into the tens of thousands. Few of those voters are likely to back Trump, but they may abstain. This could decide the election in Michigan if the race is as tight as in 2016.</p> <p>The uncommitted movement is now <a href=\"https://x.com/uncommittedmvmt/status/1843642889823498488\">warning</a> about the danger of letting Trump back in, saying he would be even worse for the Palestinians than the president they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cGenocide Joe\u201d.</p> <p>For some people, it\u2019s all too much. \u201cOne of my dearest friends is leaving the country on November 1,\u201d said Parker. \u201cShe\u2019s going to Canada to get out of the country and not coming back until it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pat Parker has campaigned for Democratic presidential candidates in the battleground state of Michigan through five elections, and it hasn\u2019t always been a happy experience. The thrill of doorstepping for Barack Obama gave way to working in a Hillary Clinton campaign office in the bellwether Saginaw county, Michigan, with all the atmosphere of a morgue, even though it was assumed she would win. Campaigning for Joe Biden was constrained by the pandemic. Next week\u2019s election, though, is different. For the first time Parker is seeing real fear. The clinical social worker is enthusiastic about Kamala Harris but she recognises that many of those who say they will vote to make her the US\u2019s first Black female president are being goaded to the polls by her opponent, Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s about him. There\u2019s a huge component of, \u2018We can\u2019t have him back, we\u2019ve got to stop him.\u2019 Some conversations, it\u2019s really difficult. People get completely freaked out and upset, and it doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room for, \u2018What do you think of Harris?\u2019,\u201d said Parker. After Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020, many Americans hoped and expected he would withdraw from the political stage. But the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, Trump\u2019s continued subverting of confidence in the electoral system and the lasting consequences of his presidency, not least the loss of abortion rights, meant that the former president remained very much at the forefront of US politics. Parker said this year\u2019s campaign has only ratcheted up the fear as Trump spewed threats to tear down democracy, turn the military on the \u201cenemy within\u201d and use the justice system to punish those who crossed him. Then there is the mania of Trump\u2019s campaign rallies filled with bile against immigrants, including those in the US legally, and threats to deport millions of people. \u201cWe watch him. It\u2019s like you can\u2019t keep your eyes off a fire,\u201d said Parker. Michiganders have a front row seat to all this, blitzed with campaign ads and rallies, as Harris and Trump battle to the last for every vote in a key state where they remain neck and neck in the polls. The Harris campaign sees its least difficult path to victory as running through Michigan alongside two other Rust belt swing states, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The key to that victory is turnout. Trump won those \u201cblue wall\u201d states in 2016, taking Michigan by just 10,704 votes. The then president increased his vote substantially in all three states in 2020 but still lost them to Biden, because Democrats who stayed home four years earlier turned out in large numbers to remove Trump from the White House. A larger proportion of registered voters \u2013 72% \u2013 cast a ballot in Michigan in 2020 than in any election since John F Kennedy won the presidency 60 years earlier. There are signs that this year could see an even larger turnout, with Michigan county clerks reporting increased voter registration and nearly 1m postal ballots returned already. The good news for Harris is that the bulk of those come from strongly Democratic areas such as Detroit. But the Harris campaign is all too aware of taking anything for granted in the wake of the failures of 2016. Clinton barely bothered to campaign in Michigan or engage with key blocs such as car workers and Black communities who traditionally voted Democratic. Clinton\u2019s strategists assured worried Michigan Democrats that the data showed she was five points ahead in the state and they were concentrating their resources elsewhere. That confidence was badly misplaced and she lost Michigan and other battleground states. In contrast, Harris has spent more time campaigning in Michigan than any other state except Pennsylvania. The vice-president and her running mate, Tim Walz, are criss-crossing Michigan wooing factory workers and Black voters, white suburban women and college students. The Harris campaign wheeled out Barack Obama to rap with Eminem at a Detroit rally and sent Bernie Sanders, the darling of the left of the Democratic party, to assuage the doubts of student voters who fear that Harris is just another corporate Democrat. Harris is also working to draw in anti-Trump Republicans with the backing of former Republican officials in the state, including former members of congress. The vice-president shared a stage with former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney in a move to reassure Republican voters who are repulsed by Trump, and alarmed at the legal assault on women\u2019s rights, that it is safe to vote for Harris. Cheney\u2019s father, Dick, has also endorsed Harris \u2013 an association that left some Michigan Democrats squirming given his role in driving the US to a disastrous war in Iraq. Chris Wyant, a senior Harris campaign adviser in Michigan who also worked on the Clinton campaign in the state, acknowledged that the strategy is shaped by the lessons learned from the 2016 loss. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there was the robust team and we didn\u2019t get the time from the candidate that we do now,\u201d he said. For his part, Trump and his vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, have been hitting the state with lots of hard promises that even many of his supporters do not really believe will be fulfilled. The former president told a rally in Saginaw earlier this month that he would make Michigan the \u201ccar capital of the world again\u201d. More than a dozen auto factories in the county, which once employed tens of thousands of people, have closed in recent decades. Trump has also latched on to divisions over electric vehicles at his recent rallies in Michigan, where most voters are opposed to government incentives to promote EVs because it could cost jobs in traditional auto factories. However, the former president did not help himself at a rally in Detroit by disparaging a city still recovering from loss of factories and population, and dotted with abandoned and burned out homes. \u201cOur whole country will end up being like Detroit if she\u2019s your president,\u201d he said. But Trump is trusted much more than Harris on two key issues in Michigan \u2013 inflation and immigration. The Biden administration boasts of a booming economy, including record job growth, but statistics don\u2019t help the large numbers of Americans still grappling with the consequences of years of surging prices. At a Saginaw soup kitchen, Darshell Roberson is less concerned as a Black woman about Trump\u2019s racist rhetoric than she is about struggling to maintain a job. \u201cI voted for Biden but I really feel like Biden has failed me. I trust Donald Trump. In the last election I didn\u2019t vote for him. I was kind of scared of him a little bit, but once I really got to watch him and look at him I liked him,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Donald Trump is gonna make everything better. I really do. I could be wrong but hope I\u2019m not.\u201d Roberson\u2019s shifting loyalties reflect a deep disillusionment with politicians among many in Michigan, much of it aimed at national Democrats who are viewed as too close to corporate interests or not caring for working people. Union organisers in Saginaw despair that many of their members vote for Trump and in part blame it on how far the Democratic establishment has become detached from the party\u2019s traditional base. Trump is also popular with young white males in Michigan, some of them first-time voters who could help push up the former president\u2019s vote count. Lewis Jensen, for example, travelled to Trump\u2019s rally in Saginaw from rural Michigan. \u201cI\u2019m voting for Trump. All my friends are voting for Trump. He may get a little crazy in some of the things he says but he\u2019ll put Americans first,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust Harris. I think she\u2019s under the control of Obama. She\u2019ll just do what the banks want.\u201d The key question for Trump, though, is whether he can find enough votes to take the state if Democrats turn out for Harris in the same numbers as they did in 2020. Parker, the Democratic campaigner, said the conversations she is having with other voters suggests many share her alarm at the prospect of Trump returning to power, and this will drive turnout. \u201cHe can do anything now if he gets re-elected. There\u2019s a lot of him that\u2019s just bluster and untruth, and he doesn\u2019t have the energy to follow through on half of it. But he\u2019s now putting people around him that do. It could completely transform this country,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have the ability to protest. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have the ability to be heard. I\u2019m not even sure if there will be elections again. The vengefulness, how deep will it go?\u201d Trump is also facing a changed election process in Michigan. Parker was an activist for a grassroots group, Voters Not Politicians, that won a referendum to put an end to gerrymandering of elections to the state legislature. A second campaign saw the introduction of nine days of early voting for the first time in the state\u2019s presidential election. Among other things, that will help a push by Black churches to turn out their congregations to vote on the Sunday before election day in a \u201csouls to polls\u201d initiative. Turnout is also likely to be spurred by the issue of abortion rights. Voter numbers surged in the 2022 midterm elections as they backed a ballot initiative enshrining the right to abortion in the Michigan constitution, after the US supreme court struck down Roe v Wade. Democrats in Michigan believe that continued fear of a federal ban on abortion if Trump is elected again, and Republicans win control of both houses of congress, will again help drive turnout, and win over some white suburban women who previously voted for Trump. The issue was a particular driver for students in the midterms. Keaton Henning, a student campaigning for Harris at Saginaw Valley State University, said he expects to see the same this year. \u201cI\u2019ve been active since I heard what Donald Trump said about immigrants. Coming from a Hispanic family, that was a big deal in 2016 and so ever since it stuck with me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for a lot of students it\u2019s women\u2019s rights. So restoring Roe v Wade, that is a big thing that a lot of people on campus talk about. And then there\u2019s a subsection of other people who are talking about the war in Gaza. There\u2019s still that.\u201d Israel\u2019s war in Gaza continues to be a difficult issue for Harris in Michigan. More than 100,000 people, many of them from the state\u2019s Arab American community around Detroit, voted uncommitted in the Democratic primaries in February in a protest against Biden\u2019s support for Israel, as the toll of Palestinian deaths surged into the tens of thousands. Few of those voters are likely to back Trump, but they may abstain. This could decide the election in Michigan if the race is as tight as in 2016. The uncommitted movement is now warning about the danger of letting Trump back in, saying he would be even worse for the Palestinians than the president they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cGenocide Joe\u201d. For some people, it\u2019s all too much. \u201cOne of my dearest friends is leaving the country on November 1,\u201d said Parker. \u201cShe\u2019s going to Canada to get out of the country and not coming back until it\u2019s all over.\u201d",

He set up Access Children\u2019s Theatre (ACT) and toured nursery and primary schools for the next 10 years.</p> <p>Born in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, to smallholders Grace (nee Thompson) and Thomas Smyth, George left High Wycombe grammar school to study English at Leeds University, graduating in 1956. He then began a PGCE in order to become a teacher. He took a post at a school in Tring, Hertfordshire, where he taught the beat poetry then being written in the US. One of his pupils, Spike Hawkins, became an early underground poet who was instrumental in setting up Liverpool\u2019s first regular venue in 1961.</p> <p>A conscientious objector, George worked as a postman and hospital orderly for his alternative national service. Following a period working in London, he went travelling, arriving in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1961, where he taught English in the Commercial College for three years, finishing up as head of department.</p> <p>After a cultural tour of India and the Middle East, George returned to the UK in 1966 with an interest in innovative forms of theatre. He gained a qualification in theatre production and teaching, and practical experience at the Unity theatre in London. Through Spike, he joined the countercultural community established at Morden Tower. As a committee member in the late 1960s, George helped accompany new American poets such as Robert Duncan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/14/guardianobituaries\">Edward Dorn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/nov/23/robert-bly-obituary\">Robert Bl</a>y in the UK. I met George at a poetry reading and joined his improvisation class.</p> <p>Some members of Theatre Probe, including George and me, lived communally, taking improvised theatre to streets and festivals. In 1970 we left the collective to volunteer with Les Treteaux Libres de Gen\u00e8ve. Rejoining colleagues, now called Skin and Bones Theatre Collective, George and the group toured theatre-in-education, puppetry and pantomime around disadvantaged areas of the north-east, sometimes extending to Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>After taking an extra qualification in early years education in 1986, George wrote plays for the nursery section of the collective, which became ACT in 1989, and toured them until retirement in 1998, when we settled in Totnes, Devon.</p> <p>We married in 1992, and the following year became a long-term foster family to two young siblings. </p> <p>George is survived by me.</p>",

He set up Access Children\u2019s Theatre (ACT) and toured nursery and primary schools for the next 10 years. Born in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, to smallholders Grace (nee Thompson) and Thomas Smyth, George left High Wycombe grammar school to study English at Leeds University, graduating in 1956. He then began a PGCE in order to become a teacher. He took a post at a school in Tring, Hertfordshire, where he taught the beat poetry then being written in the US. One of his pupils, Spike Hawkins, became an early underground poet who was instrumental in setting up Liverpool\u2019s first regular venue in 1961. A conscientious objector, George worked as a postman and hospital orderly for his alternative national service. Following a period working in London, he went travelling, arriving in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1961, where he taught English in the Commercial College for three years, finishing up as head of department. After a cultural tour of India and the Middle East, George returned to the UK in 1966 with an interest in innovative forms of theatre. He gained a qualification in theatre production and teaching, and practical experience at the Unity theatre in London. Through Spike, he joined the countercultural community established at Morden Tower. As a committee member in the late 1960s, George helped accompany new American poets such as Robert Duncan, Edward Dorn and Robert Bly in the UK. I met George at a poetry reading and joined his improvisation class. Some members of Theatre Probe, including George and me, lived communally, taking improvised theatre to streets and festivals. In 1970 we left the collective to volunteer with Les Treteaux Libres de Gen\u00e8ve. Rejoining colleagues, now called Skin and Bones Theatre Collective, George and the group toured theatre-in-education, puppetry and pantomime around disadvantaged areas of the north-east, sometimes extending to Scotland and Wales. After taking an extra qualification in early years education in 1986, George wrote plays for the nursery section of the collective, which became ACT in 1989, and toured them until retirement in 1998, when we settled in Totnes, Devon. We married in 1992, and the following year became a long-term foster family to two young siblings. George is survived by me.",

      "bodyText": "A scheme designed to boost the numbers of French children able to travel to Britain for school trips is reportedly in peril as a result of an overhaul of entry requirements in the UK. New rules for French school trips were introduced in December last year after a meeting between the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the then UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak. The pair struck a deal to allow French pupils to travel to Britain using national identity cards, and for their non-EU classmates to enter without the need for a visa, in an attempt to address a decline in visits after Brexit. However, the Financial Times reported that the scheme was at risk because of the UK\u2019s new electronic travel authorisation (ETA) scheme, which is due to come into force on 2 April 2025 and will require all EU visitors to register before travelling to the UK, a process that requires children to have a passport. The FT cited a letter written by Val\u00e9rie Boned, the president of Les Entreprises du Voyage, the main trade body for travel agencies in France, to the UK home secretary, Yvette Cooper, on 8 October asking whether the programme for French school groups would be retained. The group said it had not received a reply from the Home Office. The Home Office declined to comment. Boned wrote in her letter, seen by the FT: \u201cThe sooner we manage to clear the situation, the less impact it will have on the number of school trips for 2025,.\u201d According to data from Les Entreprises du Voyage, the scheme has led to a 30% increase in school trips to the UK from France, which it said had been 60% below 2019 levels when the scheme was introduced. The FT also cited French government officials who had \u201cexpressed concern\u201d to the UK government over how the ETA programme would affect the school trips scheme.

      "bodyText": "In the winding streets of ancient Tbilisi, one is ever under his watchful gaze. From a hilltop glass mansion, likened by critics to a Bond villain\u2019s lair, Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia\u2019s wealthiest and most influential figure, has guided the country\u2019s shift away from the west over more than a decade. With his party\u2019s latest victory in the pivotal parliamentary elections on Saturday, that trajectory appears set to continue for years to come, sparking warnings from opponents that Ivanishvili plans to dismantle Georgia\u2019s fragile three-decade experiment with democracy while blocking any viable path to EU integration. Since his short tenure as prime minister from 2012 to 2013, the secretive oligarch, whose wealth is estimated to be $7.5bn in a country whose GDP is $30bn, has largely exerted his influence from behind the scenes and is widely described by many Georgians as the country\u2019s \u201cpuppet master\u201d. But Ivanishvili grinned widely in public on Saturday night at his party\u2019s HQ as the country\u2019s election commission announced that the ruling Georgian Dream party he founded had won 54% of the vote, a result that will secure its hold on power for another four years. After his speech, fireworks lit up the sky, their loud bangs echoing through the city, highlighting the despair of an opposition whose hopes of forming a pro-western coalition lay in ruins. Ivanishvili spent much of the 1990s in Russia, founding banking, metals and telecoms companies and becoming wealthy in the chaotic aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union. When he returned to Georgia and entered politics, he cultivated an air of mystery. His eccentric hobbies, including keeping sharks and zebras and collecting rare trees, gained widespread attention, turning stories of his lavish pursuits into household tales across the country. As he said once in a rare interview: \u201cI could tell you anything and you wouldn\u2019t be able to check it.\u201d Ivanishvili took a more visible role in the run-up to Saturday\u2019s election, which was widely seen as a watershed vote that could determine whether Georgia shifts away from its long-held western orientation towards stronger ties with the Kremlin. The oligarch\u2019s public comeback coincided with a sharp escalation in his party\u2019s anti-liberal and anti-western rhetoric. In a recent interview laced with transphobic and homophobic rhetoric reminiscent of far-right online forums, Ivanishvili portrayed Georgia as locked in a cultural struggle against the west, accusing it of attempting to impose corrosive values on the nation. He claimed parents in Europe put pressure on children to undergo gender affirmation surgeries, and that \u201cmen\u2019s milk\u201d for babies was regarded as \u201cthe same as women\u2019s\u201d. Ivanishvili advised those who doubted his claims to watch footage of a pride event in Barcelona, alleging that it featured young children present and \u201call sorts of orgies\u201d. He also framed his party\u2019s election campaign around accusations that the west, along with the local opposition, was attempting to drag Georgia into a Ukraine-style conflict, a potent message in a country where many fear war with Russia after Vladimir Putin\u2019s troops briefly invaded the country in 2008. Ivanishvili\u2019s critics and those who once worked with him warn that behind his bombastic rhetoric lies a real danger. They point to his pledges to ban all major opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers after the elections, labelling them as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d. \u201cIt is very simple, Ivanishvili actually does what he says. He promises to outlaw and jail his opponents and have no reason to doubt he will try to do that,\u201d said Tina Khidasheli, who served as defence minister in a Georgian Dream-led government from 2015 to 2016 and has since become a critic of Ivanishvili. As his rhetoric hardened, so too did his paranoia. While once comfortable with large crowds, Ivanishvili now travels with a large security cordon, delivering his speeches behind bulletproof glass. \u201cStaying in power is an existential matter of survival for Ivanshvili,\u201d said Kornely Kakachia, the director of the Georgian Institute of Politics. \u201cHe believes that if he loses, his opponents will go not just after his political power but also after his business empire.\u201d Pointing to the Russian origins of his wealth, opposition parties have long accused Ivanishvili of loyalties to Moscow. Under his leadership, Georgia enacted a \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that targeted western-funded NGOs, alongside anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, both measures bearing notable similarities to laws passed by the Kremlin years earlier. However, seasoned observers have warned against oversimplifying the narrative by framing him as merely a puppet of Putin. \u201cHe is appeasing Russia, but I see no reason to suggest that he is owned or run by Russia and that\u2019s an important distinction,\u201d said Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe and an expert on the region. Instead, de Waal says Ivanishvili\u2019s tactics mirror those of Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the divisive leader Hungary. De Waal pointed out that Orb\u00e1n and Ivinishavili have centred their campaigns on conservative \u201cChristian\u201d values while calling for \u201cpeace\u201d in Ukraine without condemning Russia. Tellingly, Orb\u00e1n was the first foreign leader to congratulate the Georgian Dream for an \u201coverwhelming victory,\u201d hours before official results were announced. For now, Georgia\u2019s immediate future remains uncertain. On Sunday morning, Georgia\u2019s opposition refused to concede defeat, accusing the ruling party of staging a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d and calling for protests. This sets the stage for a potential political crisis in a country with a history of mass unrest. There is little doubt that Ivanishvili has leveraged his seemingly limitless finances to influence the elections, which have been marred by allegations of irregularities, including reports of coercing state employees to vote and instances of vote buying. Still, the outcome suggests that Ivanishvili\u2019s messages resonate with a core group of Georgian voters, particularly in the industrial heartlands and conservative poorer regions, where economic progress has been slow and the allure of Europe seems distant and faint. \u201cIt is tempting for the opposition to dismiss that Ivanishivli\u2019s party has no support, that they completely bought the elections,\u201d said one western official in Tbilisi. \u201cBut the reality is that Ivanishvili appears to have won this battle for the time being.\u201d",

But, she said, \u201cthere was a moment \u2013 without naming names \u2013 when there was a news piece about us that was just complete nonsense.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we actually just said you\u2019re not telling the truth here and we started to push back in a very systematic way every time there was something untruthful. People have been sitting up and taking notice, because we\u2019ve been really vigilant, so pushing back in a respectful way seems to be a good strategy\u201d.</p>    <p>A key figure was Celia Richardson, the trust\u2019s director of communications, who has used her personal X account to relentlessly rebut claims.</p> <p>When it comes to disinformation, Richardson speaks of taking \u201ca broken windows approach\u201d \u2013 borrowing from the criminology theory that addressing low-level problems creates an atmosphere that discourages larger ones. \u201cRepair every window, otherwise it\u2019s much easier to break more windows,\u201d Richardson said.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/09/culture-warriors-national-trust-populists-polarising-divisive\">opinion piece for the Guardian</a> this year, she wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve had to be open and direct about what\u2019s behind untrue stories wherever possible. We\u2019ve answered all media questions, and consistently sought corrections.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been careful not to use major platforms for countering disinformation \u2013 no one travels to our Instagram to see rebuttals of culture-war stories. We\u2019ve spoken to other institutions and charities about what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Other prominent defenders of the charity have included Matthew Sweet, the broadcaster and cultural historian, who factchecked claims made by the National Trust\u2019s biggest nemesis, Restore Trust, and frequently crossed swords with the organisation online.</p> <p>\u201cRestore Trust had an X account which kept on making very strange assertions. I remember the first one <a href=\"https://x.com/DrMatthewSweet/status/1582984698653184000\">I checked out was after they used photographs</a> from Hanbury Hall [a stately home in Worcestershire] in 2020 and 2021 and claimed that ornamental lamps, torch\u00e8res, in the style of black servant figures had been removed,\u201d Sweet recalls.</p>    <p>\u201cYet not only had they not disappeared, they only arrived in the house after the National Trust had bought it. So the idea that something ancestral was being disturbed was frankly nonsense, as were other examples being pumped out by this frankly very cranky account. None of them stood up.\u201d</p> <p>A source associated with Restore Trust at the time said its tweet was only pushing back against what it claimed were National Trust moves to remove items from view as part of a programme of \u201cdecolonisation\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Ornamental lamps \u2013 and vegan scones \u2013 are just some of the fronts seized on by Restore Trust, which presents itself as a grassroots movement of thousands of current and former National Trust members.</p> <p>It denies being an \u201castroturf\u201d group \u2013 these rely on hidden donors while presenting themselves as grassroots campaigns \u2013 but has declined to reveal who funds it.</p> <p>Restore Trust\u2019s inception dates to April 2021 when it was incorporated as a company called RT2021 at a time when the temperature of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit culture wars was beginning to rise, particularly when it came to history.</p> <p>Two months earlier, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, had summoned the leaders of 25 heritage bodies to a <a href=\"https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/2021/02/fears-over-editorial-freedom-as-heritage-bodies-summoned-to-discuss-contested-history/\">summit on contested heritage</a>. He had been criticised the previous year by the Museums Association, which accused him of threatening to withdraw funding if bodies did not align with the government\u2019s stance on areas including the removal of statues venerating those with links to slavery.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/13/national-trust-warns-of-threat-from-ideological-campaign-waged-against-it\">Restore Trust\u2019s directors included</a> the communications specialist Neil Bennett, and a director of RT2021, a company handling what he later told the Guardian was a \u201csignificant and growing amount of donations\u201d. </p> <p>To date, its attempts to exert influence at National Trust annual general meetings have mostly been defeated each year.</p> <p>Members at a record turnout at the 2021 AGM <a href=\"https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/national-trust-members-narrowly-reject-motions-protest-group-annual-general-meeting/governance/article/1732010\">narrowly rejected motions</a> put forward by the group, although three of its preferred candidates were elected. At the 2022 AGM, candidates backed by Restore Trust <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/06/right-leaning-group-fails-to-wrest-control-of-national-trust-from-political-takeover\">failed to win seats</a> while resolutions against National Trust participation in Pride events and rewilding also failed.</p> <p>Restore Trust\u2019s preferred candidates, including the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption, again fell short last year.</p> <p>A year later, accounts suggest a new threat was headed off when parliamentary supporters of the National Trust leadership rallied to dilute what they feared would be an assault from Westminster.</p>    <p>Having got wind that the Tory backbencher Andrew Murrison intended to set up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/tory-mp-sets-up-all-party-group-on-national-trust-without-telling-charity\">a new all-party parliamentary group (APPG)</a>, other MPs and peers quickly scrambled to turn up at the group\u2019s inaugural meeting. A Labour backbencher, Luke Pollard, was made co-chair along with Murrison while the National Trust later took on an administrative role as its \u201csecretariat\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was quite clear what was going on, that this was going to be a vehicle for parliamentary criticism of the National Trust, but people basically turned up to make sure that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d recalled one person present, and who said they were \u201c100% certain\u201d that the plan had been for Restore Trust to run the group.</p> <p>Murrison, a critic of the National Trust\u2019s direction in recent years and whose South Wiltshire constituency includes one of its best-known properties, Stourhead, doesn\u2019t recognise this account and said he would have been concerned about Restore Trust taking the role.</p> <p>He said: \u201cAny great institution, particularly one that\u2019s constituted the way the National Trust is, needs to be open to scrutiny. Parliament is where you do that and so it seemed to me that there was a need to have an APPG to do precisely that.\u201d</p> <p>More broadly, he echoes a viewpoint shared by Restore Trust and others, which is that the trust has diverged over the past 10 years from its \u201cfundamental role as a clerk of works\u201d looking after the fabric of sites entrusted to it.</p> <p>\u201cI think most people want the National Trust to be a completely politically free space. They go to its properties for leisure, recuperation and solace, and they expect the National Trust to be a custodian of some of our most important places. They did not expect it to proselytise or advance a particular cultural or political view.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Restore Trust began to deploy paid adverts on Facebook/Meta in the name of an offshoot called Respect Britain\u2019s Heritage.</p> <p>More than \u00a395,000 has been spent on such attack ads to date, according to data from Meta\u2019s Ad Library, and politicians including Rees-Mogg and the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage have shared them before the 2023 AGM.</p> <p>The defeat of Restore Trust again at last year\u2019s AGM prompted jubilation among members \u2013 and a number of people who had been long involved in Restore Trust ceased to be directors.</p> <p>But National Trust insiders remain vigilant ahead of this year\u2019s AGM, which will be held on Saturday. Opponents of policies concerning not just the charity\u2019s colonial past but also net zero and diversity are renewing efforts to establish a beachhead of influence.</p> <p>And attacks on the National Trust\u2019s direction are now being fought on other fronts. </p> <p>Take History Reclaimed, a not-for-profit that claims to be an \u201cindependent group of scholars with a wide range of opinions on many subjects\u201d. Its website is a platform for articles attacking supposedly \u201cwoke\u201d causes such as the repatriation of historical artefacts.</p> <p>History Reclaimed\u2019s editorial advisory committee includes Cornelia van der Poll, a former Oxford lecturer who was one of Restore Trust\u2019s co-founders, along with historians at the forefront of combating what the right has seen as a relentless attack on Britain\u2019s imperial legacy, such as Niall Ferguson and Nigel Biggar.</p> <p>The group\u2019s deputy editor is Zewditu Gebreyohanes, who stepped down as Restore Trust\u2019s director late last year. This year, she authored <a href=\"https://li.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NATIONAL-DISTRUST-20.03.24-SCREEN-1.pdf\">a critical report</a> called National Distrust at the Legatum Institute, where she now works.</p> <p>The influence of the institute \u2013 a pro-Brexit free-market thinktank funded by the Dubai-based Legatum investment group \u2013 is a particular concern for those at the National Trust, who defend what they view as duties to respond to the climate crisis and make the charity a welcoming place.</p> <p>The investment company is also a backer of GB News, which has become a platform for frequent attacks on the National Trust.</p> <p>Gebreyohanes said: \u201cFar from debunking claims, it is important to remember that the National Trust\u2019s management have at every step sought to deflect attention from the very real issues afflicting the trust about good governance and accountability, which they have consistently undermined.\u201d</p> <p>She also cited concerns expressed by a former National Trust chair, Sir William Proby, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/03/21/national-trust-abuse-of-power-voting-agm/\">who wrote</a> that governance changes were taking the charity in the wrong direction.</p> <p>***</p> <p>All of the above unfolded before Labour\u2019s landslide election win in July. At the party\u2019s conference last month, McGrady expressed the hope that the new government would mark an end to a \u201cwar\u201d, which she said was not of the charity\u2019s making, and encouraged Labour to prevent further \u201cpolitical\u201d appointments to public bodies.</p> <p>Referring to a fraught encounter under the last government, she said: \u201cI was in a meeting at one point where a minister at the time said: \u2018I\u2019ve been appointed and it would appear I\u2019m not allowed to have any influence.\u2019 And actually that was the point. You were not meant to have any influence on it.\u201d</p> <p>But she was also candid about enduring tensions between the often younger, more liberal makeup of charity workforces and the different demographics of their users.</p> <p>\u201cI would say 70% of my staff and volunteers would be regarded as progressive activists so I have a workforce of people who are really wanting to push on this,\u201d she said, referring to issues the trust campaigns on and contrasting these with its membership base.<br><br>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to characterise our members as particularly conservative. They are actually not but there is a dynamic that I as a director general need to be aware of \u2013 that my organisation is pushing very hard on one side while I need to be aware of how the public are receiving that.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, before he became prime minister, Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/starmer-defend-rnli-national-trust-desperate-tory-culture-war\">pledged to defend</a> organisations such as the National Trust and Royal National Lifeboat Institution, accusing the Conservatives of attacking them to stoke a \u201cdesperate\u201d culture war.</p> <p>However, a former Conservative minister is among those who caution against the idea that the arrival of Starmer in Downing Street spells respite for the charity \u2013 whether or not Badenoch becomes the next Tory party leader at the weekend.</p> <p>\u201cLabour could be the salvation of the National Trust but it also carries a risk in that the latter will be seen as even more part of an establishment, and that puts them even more at risk from a Tory party that is lashing out,\u201d said the former minister.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand, there will be a much more benign environment, but on the other the trust could be elided with a Labour government\u2019s supposed \u2018woke agenda\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>And any hopes that Badenoch, if she does win, will drop the issue seem ill founded. A direct link between the former equalities minister and the campaign against the National Trust has emerged, with Badenoch running her leadership campaign from a property owned by Neil Record, one of Restore Trust\u2019s original directors.</p> <p>Record, a Tory donor, has previously <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/multimillionaire-backers-of-climate-change-denial-thinktank-revealed-9707267.html\">donated to</a> the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which was set up to question climate crisis policy, and now chairs Net Zero Watch, which seeks to highlight what it calls the \u201ccosts of net zero\u201d.</p> <p>Record, van der Poll and members of Restore Trust were approached for comment.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 29 October 2024 to include the fact that the National Trust covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Corinne Fowler remembers sitting alongside her son in their garden shed during the first Covid lockdown, when the very start of what would become an avalanche of hate mail popped up in her inbox. \u201cThere was a barrage of emails but the first one just said in the title: \u2018You\u2019re cooked.\u2019 And it went on from there,\u201d recalls the historian, who in 2020 had just published a landmark report into the colonial history behind some National Trust properties. The author of the email, she adds, seemingly shared the views of some prominent Conservative MPs, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had accused Fowler and the trust of \u201cdenigrating\u201d British history by detailing the connections to slavery of 93 historic places in the charity\u2019s care. Looking back now, Fowler believes \u201cheated rhetoric\u201d from politicians and others encouraged anger and even death threats against her and the National Trust\u2019s director general, Hilary McGrady. An intervention by leading historical bodies took some of the heat out of the debate over the trust\u2019s perceived \u201cwokeness\u201d and headed off threats of interference by the Conservative government. But the actions of the trust itself \u2013 alongside supporters including a slew of keyboard warriors \u2013 have also worked to blunt the impact of the culture war the charity found itself caught up in. Four years on, the National Trust has largely defeated repeated attempts to elect opponents to its council, which appoints board members \u2013 though the latest is coming up this week. Some hope that its fightback may serve as a lesson to other bodies caught in culture war crosshairs. *** The National Trust \u2013 Europe\u2019s biggest conservation charity, with more than 5 million members, and covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2013 is considered by many to be a treasured institution. Founded 129 years ago and later imbued with statutory powers as the foremost guardian of Britain\u2019s historic properties and countryside, fault lines have always run through the body \u2013 from tussles over how to respond to the postwar growth of mass recreation to the aftermath of the 2004 ban on foxhunting. But in recent years an insurgent group called Restore Trust, as well as media and Conservative figures, began to spearhead a campaign to oppose some of its decisions \u2013 especially about efforts to address links to slavery and Britain\u2019s colonial past. They have included Kemi Badenoch, now a frontrunner to become the next Conservative party leader, who this year accused the National Trust of using \u201canti-white\u201d rhetoric after the charity replaced the term \u201cethnic minority\u201d with \u201cglobal majority\u201d. One of the most recent so-called controversies concerned a plan to make 50% of food in National Trust cafes vegan and vegetarian as part of a commitment to reach net zero by 2030. For McGrady, faced with accusations of \u201cwokeness\u201d and erring from the National\u2019s Trust\u2019s focus on conservation, the key response has been one of going on the offensive. The National Trust has examined the claims levelled at it and acted robustly to call out what she described as \u201cbreathtaking misinformation\u201d, McGrady said. \u201cIn the early days we were on the defensive,\u201d she recalled, speaking to the Guardian on the sidelines of this year\u2019s Labour party conference. But, she said, \u201cthere was a moment \u2013 without naming names \u2013 when there was a news piece about us that was just complete nonsense. \u201cAnd we actually just said you\u2019re not telling the truth here and we started to push back in a very systematic way every time there was something untruthful. People have been sitting up and taking notice, because we\u2019ve been really vigilant, so pushing back in a respectful way seems to be a good strategy\u201d. A key figure was Celia Richardson, the trust\u2019s director of communications, who has used her personal X account to relentlessly rebut claims. When it comes to disinformation, Richardson speaks of taking \u201ca broken windows approach\u201d \u2013 borrowing from the criminology theory that addressing low-level problems creates an atmosphere that discourages larger ones. \u201cRepair every window, otherwise it\u2019s much easier to break more windows,\u201d Richardson said. In an opinion piece for the Guardian this year, she wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve had to be open and direct about what\u2019s behind untrue stories wherever possible. We\u2019ve answered all media questions, and consistently sought corrections. \u201cWe\u2019ve been careful not to use major platforms for countering disinformation \u2013 no one travels to our Instagram to see rebuttals of culture-war stories. We\u2019ve spoken to other institutions and charities about what\u2019s happening.\u201d Other prominent defenders of the charity have included Matthew Sweet, the broadcaster and cultural historian, who factchecked claims made by the National Trust\u2019s biggest nemesis, Restore Trust, and frequently crossed swords with the organisation online. \u201cRestore Trust had an X account which kept on making very strange assertions. I remember the first one I checked out was after they used photographs from Hanbury Hall [a stately home in Worcestershire] in 2020 and 2021 and claimed that ornamental lamps, torch\u00e8res, in the style of black servant figures had been removed,\u201d Sweet recalls. \u201cYet not only had they not disappeared, they only arrived in the house after the National Trust had bought it. So the idea that something ancestral was being disturbed was frankly nonsense, as were other examples being pumped out by this frankly very cranky account. None of them stood up.\u201d A source associated with Restore Trust at the time said its tweet was only pushing back against what it claimed were National Trust moves to remove items from view as part of a programme of \u201cdecolonisation\u201d. *** Ornamental lamps \u2013 and vegan scones \u2013 are just some of the fronts seized on by Restore Trust, which presents itself as a grassroots movement of thousands of current and former National Trust members. It denies being an \u201castroturf\u201d group \u2013 these rely on hidden donors while presenting themselves as grassroots campaigns \u2013 but has declined to reveal who funds it. Restore Trust\u2019s inception dates to April 2021 when it was incorporated as a company called RT2021 at a time when the temperature of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit culture wars was beginning to rise, particularly when it came to history. Two months earlier, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, had summoned the leaders of 25 heritage bodies to a summit on contested heritage. He had been criticised the previous year by the Museums Association, which accused him of threatening to withdraw funding if bodies did not align with the government\u2019s stance on areas including the removal of statues venerating those with links to slavery. Restore Trust\u2019s directors included the communications specialist Neil Bennett, and a director of RT2021, a company handling what he later told the Guardian was a \u201csignificant and growing amount of donations\u201d. To date, its attempts to exert influence at National Trust annual general meetings have mostly been defeated each year. Members at a record turnout at the 2021 AGM narrowly rejected motions put forward by the group, although three of its preferred candidates were elected. At the 2022 AGM, candidates backed by Restore Trust failed to win seats while resolutions against National Trust participation in Pride events and rewilding also failed. Restore Trust\u2019s preferred candidates, including the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption, again fell short last year. A year later, accounts suggest a new threat was headed off when parliamentary supporters of the National Trust leadership rallied to dilute what they feared would be an assault from Westminster. Having got wind that the Tory backbencher Andrew Murrison intended to set up a new all-party parliamentary group (APPG), other MPs and peers quickly scrambled to turn up at the group\u2019s inaugural meeting. A Labour backbencher, Luke Pollard, was made co-chair along with Murrison while the National Trust later took on an administrative role as its \u201csecretariat\u201d. \u201cIt was quite clear what was going on, that this was going to be a vehicle for parliamentary criticism of the National Trust, but people basically turned up to make sure that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d recalled one person present, and who said they were \u201c100% certain\u201d that the plan had been for Restore Trust to run the group. Murrison, a critic of the National Trust\u2019s direction in recent years and whose South Wiltshire constituency includes one of its best-known properties, Stourhead, doesn\u2019t recognise this account and said he would have been concerned about Restore Trust taking the role. He said: \u201cAny great institution, particularly one that\u2019s constituted the way the National Trust is, needs to be open to scrutiny. Parliament is where you do that and so it seemed to me that there was a need to have an APPG to do precisely that.\u201d More broadly, he echoes a viewpoint shared by Restore Trust and others, which is that the trust has diverged over the past 10 years from its \u201cfundamental role as a clerk of works\u201d looking after the fabric of sites entrusted to it. \u201cI think most people want the National Trust to be a completely politically free space. They go to its properties for leisure, recuperation and solace, and they expect the National Trust to be a custodian of some of our most important places. They did not expect it to proselytise or advance a particular cultural or political view.\u201d Last year, Restore Trust began to deploy paid adverts on Facebook/Meta in the name of an offshoot called Respect Britain\u2019s Heritage. More than \u00a395,000 has been spent on such attack ads to date, according to data from Meta\u2019s Ad Library, and politicians including Rees-Mogg and the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage have shared them before the 2023 AGM. The defeat of Restore Trust again at last year\u2019s AGM prompted jubilation among members \u2013 and a number of people who had been long involved in Restore Trust ceased to be directors. But National Trust insiders remain vigilant ahead of this year\u2019s AGM, which will be held on Saturday. Opponents of policies concerning not just the charity\u2019s colonial past but also net zero and diversity are renewing efforts to establish a beachhead of influence. And attacks on the National Trust\u2019s direction are now being fought on other fronts. Take History Reclaimed, a not-for-profit that claims to be an \u201cindependent group of scholars with a wide range of opinions on many subjects\u201d. Its website is a platform for articles attacking supposedly \u201cwoke\u201d causes such as the repatriation of historical artefacts. History Reclaimed\u2019s editorial advisory committee includes Cornelia van der Poll, a former Oxford lecturer who was one of Restore Trust\u2019s co-founders, along with historians at the forefront of combating what the right has seen as a relentless attack on Britain\u2019s imperial legacy, such as Niall Ferguson and Nigel Biggar. The group\u2019s deputy editor is Zewditu Gebreyohanes, who stepped down as Restore Trust\u2019s director late last year. This year, she authored a critical report called National Distrust at the Legatum Institute, where she now works. The influence of the institute \u2013 a pro-Brexit free-market thinktank funded by the Dubai-based Legatum investment group \u2013 is a particular concern for those at the National Trust, who defend what they view as duties to respond to the climate crisis and make the charity a welcoming place. The investment company is also a backer of GB News, which has become a platform for frequent attacks on the National Trust. Gebreyohanes said: \u201cFar from debunking claims, it is important to remember that the National Trust\u2019s management have at every step sought to deflect attention from the very real issues afflicting the trust about good governance and accountability, which they have consistently undermined.\u201d She also cited concerns expressed by a former National Trust chair, Sir William Proby, who wrote that governance changes were taking the charity in the wrong direction. *** All of the above unfolded before Labour\u2019s landslide election win in July. At the party\u2019s conference last month, McGrady expressed the hope that the new government would mark an end to a \u201cwar\u201d, which she said was not of the charity\u2019s making, and encouraged Labour to prevent further \u201cpolitical\u201d appointments to public bodies. Referring to a fraught encounter under the last government, she said: \u201cI was in a meeting at one point where a minister at the time said: \u2018I\u2019ve been appointed and it would appear I\u2019m not allowed to have any influence.\u2019 And actually that was the point. You were not meant to have any influence on it.\u201d But she was also candid about enduring tensions between the often younger, more liberal makeup of charity workforces and the different demographics of their users. \u201cI would say 70% of my staff and volunteers would be regarded as progressive activists so I have a workforce of people who are really wanting to push on this,\u201d she said, referring to issues the trust campaigns on and contrasting these with its membership base. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to characterise our members as particularly conservative. They are actually not but there is a dynamic that I as a director general need to be aware of \u2013 that my organisation is pushing very hard on one side while I need to be aware of how the public are receiving that.\u201d Earlier this year, before he became prime minister, Keir Starmer pledged to defend organisations such as the National Trust and Royal National Lifeboat Institution, accusing the Conservatives of attacking them to stoke a \u201cdesperate\u201d culture war. However, a former Conservative minister is among those who caution against the idea that the arrival of Starmer in Downing Street spells respite for the charity \u2013 whether or not Badenoch becomes the next Tory party leader at the weekend. \u201cLabour could be the salvation of the National Trust but it also carries a risk in that the latter will be seen as even more part of an establishment, and that puts them even more at risk from a Tory party that is lashing out,\u201d said the former minister. \u201cOn the one hand, there will be a much more benign environment, but on the other the trust could be elided with a Labour government\u2019s supposed \u2018woke agenda\u2019.\u201d And any hopes that Badenoch, if she does win, will drop the issue seem ill founded. A direct link between the former equalities minister and the campaign against the National Trust has emerged, with Badenoch running her leadership campaign from a property owned by Neil Record, one of Restore Trust\u2019s original directors. Record, a Tory donor, has previously donated to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which was set up to question climate crisis policy, and now chairs Net Zero Watch, which seeks to highlight what it calls the \u201ccosts of net zero\u201d. Record, van der Poll and members of Restore Trust were approached for comment. \u2022 This article was updated on 29 October 2024 to include the fact that the National Trust covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

      "body": "<p>While organising an interview with Marianna Spring, the BBC\u2019s first Social Media Investigations correspondent, I asked if I could meet her at home. It would be more intimate than meeting at the BBC\u2019s offices, I said, more relaxed. But a communications manager called me on the phone. It\u2019s a bit sensitive, she said. It\u2019s not that Marianna doesn\u2019t want me to go to her house, she explained, it\u2019s just\u2026 the trolls.</p> <p>In the first five months of 2023, the BBC received 14,488 messages abusive enough to be escalated by their system designed to detect hate; 11,771 of those, around 80%, were about Spring. Due to her reporting on conspiracy theories she\u2019s regularly targeted with death threats and harassment, both on and offline. For a while, a man camped in a tent outside the BBC\u2019s New Broadcasting House shouting \u201cdisinformation agent\u201d in her face as she left work. Which means, while I can say Spring welcomes me with a hug and invites me into her front room for a conversation that will span murder and Kate Middleton and teenage boys, I can\u2019t describe the city she lives in, or who she lives with, or if she lives with anybody else at all, or give any personal details that might put her in danger.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a big deal for me this,\u201d she says nervously, as we settle on her sofa. \u201cI keep so private, because I know that the world I investigate has attracted this group of trolls who will stop at nothing to figure out literally everything about me and then use it in some way.\u201d She once mentioned that her dad was a doctor, which led to strangers suggesting this connection is why she is invested in killing people with the Covid vaccine. Once she shared a picture online of her family\u2019s 19-year-old cat and she was accused noisily of animal cruelty. \u201cThey also called her Chairman Miaow,\u201d Spring adds, \u201cwhich was actually quite funny.\u201d</p> <p>Spring grew up in south London. At eight years old she\u2019d \u201cmake my poor little sister sit and watch BBC world news when we were on holiday. I remember my mum coming in and saying, \u2018Why are you watching this, get outside!\u2019\u201d After graduating from Oxford, she sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/emily-maitlis\">Emily Maitlis</a> some examples of her journalism and got a job on <em>Newsnight</em>. Later, as the 2020 American election approached, the BBC asked her to report on the sociological aspects of social media and its impact on democracy. Spring was 23. She\u2019d been obsessed with news since 9/11 and, as she got older, became obsessed further with the conspiracy theories that surrounded it. When the pandemic began, reporting the real-world consequences of disinformation became even more necessary. A 2023 <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/conspiracy-belief-among-the-uk-public.pdf\">survey</a> found that around a third of the public believe various conspiracy theories, such as \u201cCovid-19 was a hoax\u201d and \u201c15-minute cities are an attempt by governments to restrict people\u2019s personal freedom and keep them under surveillance.\u201d What used to be seen as paranoia, now blurs into beliefs held by many millions.</p>    <p>For a typical investigation, Spring will create a series of fake online profiles to see what the algorithms deliver. \u201cI think I currently have 24 phones. Every time I swing by the desk of the poor bloke who looks after the retired iPhones at the BBC he\u2019s wary because he thinks I must be selling them on.\u201d</p> <p>Today her work, which includes <em>Panorama</em> investigations and a BBC podcast <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p0h46gmn\">Why Do You Hate Me?</a></em> (the new <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2024/why-do-you-hate-me-usa-marianna-spring-series-two\">US series</a> of which investigates the online phenomena that could influence the election), sees her dig into the darkest corners of the internet, a place she calls \u201cConspiracyland\u201d. Here she meets the people who live there, like those who claim terrorist attacks have been staged. Sometimes she meets her own trolls, too. The harassment she receives \u201cis almost always about me being a young woman, attempting to undermine my credibility, using gendered slurs. You know, I\u2019m everything from a silly little girl who couldn\u2019t possibly know what\u2019s going on to an evil whore who\u2019s eating babies.\u201d She never would have guessed her own harassment would be such a large part of the story, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s important to talk about it. I think a huge number of women in public life are subject to this and obviously it\u2019s way worse if you also get racist abuse and other forms of hate. And it normalises it if we don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>As well as using her own experiences as an example of how online hate metastasises, her work has become a vital tool for those seeking to understand the conspiracy theories that continue to shape our world and how, when the people in power abuse that power, they fuel anxieties that prompt these theories. Democracy relies on a shared reality, Spring says. \u201cSo, we\u2019re sitting on the sofa, right? And I might love this sofa and you might hate this sofa, but if we don\u2019t agree the sofa is here, we can\u2019t have a conversation. That\u2019s the thing we should be worried about \u2013 the conversation is not about the sofa, the conversation has to begin with, \u2018Why don\u2019t you think the sofa is here?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s had many such conversations with theoretical sofa deniers, like those she calls the \u201ctrue believers\u201d. Last year, she met a woman called Natalie in Totnes who believes that governments and global organisations are trying to control us through things like attempts to limit pollution. While telling her this, Spring says, Natalie suddenly started crying. \u201cShe said she felt so isolated from people in her life. It was the same in America, talking to a woman who believed Trump\u2019s assassination was staged. She started crying, too. It\u2019s stressful not being able to trust anything any more, to truly believe these plots are happening, that everyone is out to murder and kill people in your life.

He\u2019s willing to stand up against the conspiracy theories and abuse that he and his daughter have been subject to after living through something most people can\u2019t even imagine. But also what he\u2019s doing could set a really important precedent for how this stuff is dealt with.\u201d</p> <p>This is the most important part of Spring\u2019s job, she thinks: giving a voice to people, like the family of 13-year-old Olly Stephens. In 2021, two schoolboys who ambushed him after a dispute online were convicted of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/sep/24/two-14-year-olds-sentenced-for-of-oliver-stephens-13\">murder</a>. Spring investigated the role social media played and exposed how teenagers\u2019 Instagram, YouTube and Facebook accounts routinely recommend violent videos and knives for sale. People like Stephens\u2019s parents \u201coften feel as though the social media companies are not listening to what they have to say and the politicians don\u2019t get it, and so if I can be the person that investigates it, that is the greatest privilege.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Spring, </strong></em><em><strong>28</strong></em><em><strong> now, takes </strong></em>barely a breath in our two-hour conversation. She has the charisma and energy of a kids\u2019 TV presenter, delivering complex ideas in digestible explanations with empathy and wit. \u201cI am a very positive person, which is important because everything I investigate is largely very dark. That positivity is a really valuable thing, because it keeps you going \u2013 I\u2019m someone who is fundamentally hopeful about people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social media companies are not listening to what people have to say and the politicians don\u2019t get it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wonder where she sees her career going. Does she have ambitions to become the next Emily Maitlis? \u201cOh!\u201d she says. Well, she loves the investigative work and the presenting, but it\u2019s the public service element of her job that excites her. \u201cThe landscape is changing so much it\u2019s quite hard to know what work is going to look like in 10 years.\u201d And by then, she predicts, \u201ceverything will be a social media investigation \u2013 you can\u2019t untangle the two things.\u201d</p> <p>Has she ever been taken in by disinformation herself? \u201cHmm!\u201d She thinks, theatrically. Around the time she started doing this job, there were wildfires spreading across Australia and on her Instagram she started to see memes of, \u201cI want to say\u2026 wombats? They were very cute and very big, and they were hiding other baby animals from the flames. I sent them to my friends, these wombats, but it later transpired the story was just complete rubbish. And that\u2019s how all this works \u2013 you\u2019re pulled in by anything that makes you have an emotional reaction.\u201d It\u2019s easy to be tricked, she says \u2013 that\u2019s what disinformation is designed to do, to exploit our emotions, our legitimate concerns, our real anxieties, often for profit. That\u2019s why we need to remove the stigma attached to people who get drawn in, she stresses. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that they\u2019re stupid or crazy, but it\u2019s just not the case \u2013 they\u2019re often really cynical and clever and engaged. They probably spend a bit too much time on social media, which they readily admit to me, but honestly, they could be any of us.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, in fact, it was. After the Princess of Wales\u2019s absence from the public eye became a talking point, the palace published a family portrait to quash gossip, but the image only increased speculation, leading to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/mar/25/conspiracies-tagged-kategate-grow-despite-kensington-palace-video\">Kategate</a>\u2019\u201d with thousands of people scrutinising photos and sharing theories to fill a vacuum of information. The seduction of conspiracy theories lies partly in a dissection of power \u2013 marginalised people seeking to unpick the control that those in power wield, or the sense they\u2019re plotting to deceive us, and then, the power that comes from feeling like you\u2019re are in possession of privileged knowledge. \u201cI\u2019ve investigated quite a lot of online sleuthing where people come up with things that are true,\u201d says Spring. \u201cLike they\u2019d sussed out Molly-Mae\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.drapersonline.com/news/molly-mae-hague-to-launch-brand\">new brand</a> before she\u2019d even announced it. But then there are other examples, everything from when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/27/nicola-bulley-online-obsession-became-monster-says-partner\">Nicola Bulley</a> disappeared to Kate Middleton, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/19/jay-slater-mother-debbie-duncan-internet-trolls\">Jay Slater</a> who also disappeared this year.\u201d Spring saw patterns appearing. \u201cPeople often come from a point of caring, and wanting to understand what\u2019s going on, but then we all get a bit sucked in. And the theories are more exciting and interesting often than the truth, which can be quite complicated and quite boring and quite sad. But sharing them has real consequences for the people who are at the centre of the story.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The theories are more exciting and interesting often than the truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This year, after the stabbing attacks in Sydney, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-68822846\">falsely blamed</a> on a Jewish student, then, when riots spread after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/31/how-false-online-claims-about-southport-knife-attack-spread-so-rapidly\">false name</a> was attributed on X to the man who killed three children in Southport, Spring became increasingly desperate to interview Elon Musk about the part social media played. She\u2019s tried many times \u2013 for a while, X\u2019s comms department replied to all journalists\u2019 emails with a poop emoji. Spring found herself lying in bed at night thinking about what she\u2019d ask him. \u201cQuestions around decisions he\u2019s made that appear to have had a real-world impact \u2013 decisions about blue ticks, decisions about the algorithm, decisions about what\u2019s allowed and what isn\u2019t.

When does it stop, how does it stop, and how do you how do you deal with that? This is the question at the crux of all of this.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s thinking about the people she\u2019s met in Conspiracyland, who see people they trust sharing disinformation at the top of their feeds, posts that are getting hundreds of likes, \u201cand that not only affects their perception of reality, but more broadly this shared concept of reality that we all rely on.\u201d Instead of answering her interview requests, \u201cHe\u2019ll probably just share this interview. In the past he\u2019s tweeted a picture of me which resulted in an absolute wave of online abuse and hate and threats.\u201d But she\u2019ll keep on asking. \u201cI\u2019m the BBC\u2019s Social Media Investigations Correspondent, but have not interviewed anyone senior at his company for more than two years \u2013 that shows us that there\u2019s a problem with accountability. If cabinet ministers just stopped doing interviews, everyone would be really outraged.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>One side effect</strong></em> of her work is that Spring has become a sort of unofficial social media agony aunt, with people messaging her regular questions, often about their experiences of trolling, or asking whether a story they\u2019ve seen is real, or for advice on kids and phones. She always responds, but, she says, it\u2019s not simply a case of telling them to go offline: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where it would be very difficult to live without our phones.\u201d They\u2019re our wallets, our map, our supermarket, our family. \u201cAnd there are positives that come out of using social media, and it doesn\u2019t feel like it should be on all of us to change how we live in order to keep ourselves safe \u2013 that is ultimately a responsibility that the majority of the major social media companies have signed up to.\u201d</p> <p>What does she think about the move to ban phones for kids? \u201cAgain, it shifts the accountability away from the companies and I don\u2019t think we should be letting them off the hook that lightly!\u201d It reminds her of people who, having heard about her experiences of trolling, ask why she doesn\u2019t simply quit social media. \u201cFirst, it\u2019s what I investigate so it\u2019d be a bit like asking a political journalist not to be in the House of Commons, but also, why should people have to leave a particular social media platform, when they\u2019re entitled to be there, too?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to start thinking of companies more like governments, even though they\u2019re not elected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the pandemic subsided she thought the conspiracy movement might calm down a little. \u201cI thought people might go, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve had a bit of a funny half hour there,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think that has been the case and I think it will continue to not be the case.\u201d There are people, she says, who truly have shifted in how they view reality. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many more times I have to investigate almost the same thing, which is,\u201d she lifts her head, vaguely maddened, \u201ca situation in which something hateful or false spreads on social media, is actively pushed by the algorithms, that causes harm or has a serious consequence for people. Then I track all those people down, email the social media companies saying this has happened, and then\u2026\u201d</p> <p>And then? \u201cWe go again! I don\u2019t know how many times that has to happen before someone says, \u2018OK, how are we dealing with this?\u2019\u201d What needs to change? \u201cWell, when you start thinking of the companies more like governments, even though they\u2019re not elected, that maybe helps? A lot of this is about fundamentally how the companies\u2019 sites operate and it does frequently come back to algorithms. Until we reach a place where safety is more important than engagement, these kinds of things will keep happening.\u201d She pauses and leans back on the sofa, which exists, and seats two, and is blue. \u201cMy job is to expose the problems. I guess, I hope people reading will come up with solutions.\u201d</p> <p><em>Marianna Spring\u2019s podcast, Why Do You Hate Me, is now available on BBC Sounds (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p0h46gmn\">bbc.co.uk</a>)</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "While organising an interview with Marianna Spring, the BBC\u2019s first Social Media Investigations correspondent, I asked if I could meet her at home. It would be more intimate than meeting at the BBC\u2019s offices, I said, more relaxed. But a communications manager called me on the phone. It\u2019s a bit sensitive, she said. It\u2019s not that Marianna doesn\u2019t want me to go to her house, she explained, it\u2019s just\u2026 the trolls. In the first five months of 2023, the BBC received 14,488 messages abusive enough to be escalated by their system designed to detect hate; 11,771 of those, around 80%, were about Spring. Due to her reporting on conspiracy theories she\u2019s regularly targeted with death threats and harassment, both on and offline. For a while, a man camped in a tent outside the BBC\u2019s New Broadcasting House shouting \u201cdisinformation agent\u201d in her face as she left work. Which means, while I can say Spring welcomes me with a hug and invites me into her front room for a conversation that will span murder and Kate Middleton and teenage boys, I can\u2019t describe the city she lives in, or who she lives with, or if she lives with anybody else at all, or give any personal details that might put her in danger. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a big deal for me this,\u201d she says nervously, as we settle on her sofa. \u201cI keep so private, because I know that the world I investigate has attracted this group of trolls who will stop at nothing to figure out literally everything about me and then use it in some way.\u201d She once mentioned that her dad was a doctor, which led to strangers suggesting this connection is why she is invested in killing people with the Covid vaccine. Once she shared a picture online of her family\u2019s 19-year-old cat and she was accused noisily of animal cruelty. \u201cThey also called her Chairman Miaow,\u201d Spring adds, \u201cwhich was actually quite funny.\u201d Spring grew up in south London. At eight years old she\u2019d \u201cmake my poor little sister sit and watch BBC world news when we were on holiday. I remember my mum coming in and saying, \u2018Why are you watching this, get outside!\u2019\u201d After graduating from Oxford, she sent Emily Maitlis some examples of her journalism and got a job on Newsnight. Later, as the 2020 American election approached, the BBC asked her to report on the sociological aspects of social media and its impact on democracy. Spring was 23. She\u2019d been obsessed with news since 9/11 and, as she got older, became obsessed further with the conspiracy theories that surrounded it. When the pandemic began, reporting the real-world consequences of disinformation became even more necessary. A 2023 survey found that around a third of the public believe various conspiracy theories, such as \u201cCovid-19 was a hoax\u201d and \u201c15-minute cities are an attempt by governments to restrict people\u2019s personal freedom and keep them under surveillance.\u201d What used to be seen as paranoia, now blurs into beliefs held by many millions. For a typical investigation, Spring will create a series of fake online profiles to see what the algorithms deliver. \u201cI think I currently have 24 phones. Every time I swing by the desk of the poor bloke who looks after the retired iPhones at the BBC he\u2019s wary because he thinks I must be selling them on.\u201d Today her work, which includes Panorama investigations and a BBC podcast Why Do You Hate Me? (the new US series of which investigates the online phenomena that could influence the election), sees her dig into the darkest corners of the internet, a place she calls \u201cConspiracyland\u201d. Here she meets the people who live there, like those who claim terrorist attacks have been staged. Sometimes she meets her own trolls, too. The harassment she receives \u201cis almost always about me being a young woman, attempting to undermine my credibility, using gendered slurs. You know, I\u2019m everything from a silly little girl who couldn\u2019t possibly know what\u2019s going on to an evil whore who\u2019s eating babies.\u201d She never would have guessed her own harassment would be such a large part of the story, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s important to talk about it. I think a huge number of women in public life are subject to this and obviously it\u2019s way worse if you also get racist abuse and other forms of hate. And it normalises it if we don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d As well as using her own experiences as an example of how online hate metastasises, her work has become a vital tool for those seeking to understand the conspiracy theories that continue to shape our world and how, when the people in power abuse that power, they fuel anxieties that prompt these theories. Democracy relies on a shared reality, Spring says. \u201cSo, we\u2019re sitting on the sofa, right? And I might love this sofa and you might hate this sofa, but if we don\u2019t agree the sofa is here, we can\u2019t have a conversation. That\u2019s the thing we should be worried about \u2013 the conversation is not about the sofa, the conversation has to begin with, \u2018Why don\u2019t you think the sofa is here?\u2019\u201d She\u2019s had many such conversations with theoretical sofa deniers, like those she calls the \u201ctrue believers\u201d. Last year, she met a woman called Natalie in Totnes who believes that governments and global organisations are trying to control us through things like attempts to limit pollution. While telling her this, Spring says, Natalie suddenly started crying. \u201cShe said she felt so isolated from people in her life. It was the same in America, talking to a woman who believed Trump\u2019s assassination was staged. She started crying, too. It\u2019s stressful not being able to trust anything any more, to truly believe these plots are happening, that everyone is out to murder and kill people in your life. You can understand why that would make you feel untethered from the world around you.\u201d What might surprise readers, she says, is that most of the conspiracy theorists she\u2019s met aren\u2019t bad people. She sits with them at home, like we\u2019re doing now. They have tea together. Biscuits. \u201cOften they arrive at these places from really legitimate points. They really care, they\u2019re very worried about other human beings who are being hurt, or powerful people doing bad stuff. But they are themselves being exploited by other people on social media. They\u2019re being pushed that kind of content and others benefit from their attention.\u201d Other memorable interviewees include people whose lives have been overturned by these conspiracy theorists. In February, Martin Hibbert, a survivor of the 2017 Manchester Arena attack, won his bid to sue Richard D Hall, who claimed nobody died in the attack, and that Hibbert and his daughter (both of whom were left with severe disabilities) were not there. \u201cPeople like Martin are so brave. He\u2019s willing to stand up against the conspiracy theories and abuse that he and his daughter have been subject to after living through something most people can\u2019t even imagine. But also what he\u2019s doing could set a really important precedent for how this stuff is dealt with.\u201d This is the most important part of Spring\u2019s job, she thinks: giving a voice to people, like the family of 13-year-old Olly Stephens. In 2021, two schoolboys who ambushed him after a dispute online were convicted of his murder. Spring investigated the role social media played and exposed how teenagers\u2019 Instagram, YouTube and Facebook accounts routinely recommend violent videos and knives for sale. People like Stephens\u2019s parents \u201coften feel as though the social media companies are not listening to what they have to say and the politicians don\u2019t get it, and so if I can be the person that investigates it, that is the greatest privilege.\u201d Spring, 28 now, takes barely a breath in our two-hour conversation. She has the charisma and energy of a kids\u2019 TV presenter, delivering complex ideas in digestible explanations with empathy and wit. \u201cI am a very positive person, which is important because everything I investigate is largely very dark.

She always responds, but, she says, it\u2019s not simply a case of telling them to go offline: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where it would be very difficult to live without our phones.\u201d They\u2019re our wallets, our map, our supermarket, our family. \u201cAnd there are positives that come out of using social media, and it doesn\u2019t feel like it should be on all of us to change how we live in order to keep ourselves safe \u2013 that is ultimately a responsibility that the majority of the major social media companies have signed up to.\u201d What does she think about the move to ban phones for kids? \u201cAgain, it shifts the accountability away from the companies and I don\u2019t think we should be letting them off the hook that lightly!\u201d It reminds her of people who, having heard about her experiences of trolling, ask why she doesn\u2019t simply quit social media. \u201cFirst, it\u2019s what I investigate so it\u2019d be a bit like asking a political journalist not to be in the House of Commons, but also, why should people have to leave a particular social media platform, when they\u2019re entitled to be there, too?\u201d As the pandemic subsided she thought the conspiracy movement might calm down a little. \u201cI thought people might go, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve had a bit of a funny half hour there,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think that has been the case and I think it will continue to not be the case.\u201d There are people, she says, who truly have shifted in how they view reality. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many more times I have to investigate almost the same thing, which is,\u201d she lifts her head, vaguely maddened, \u201ca situation in which something hateful or false spreads on social media, is actively pushed by the algorithms, that causes harm or has a serious consequence for people. Then I track all those people down, email the social media companies saying this has happened, and then\u2026\u201d And then? \u201cWe go again! I don\u2019t know how many times that has to happen before someone says, \u2018OK, how are we dealing with this?\u2019\u201d What needs to change? \u201cWell, when you start thinking of the companies more like governments, even though they\u2019re not elected, that maybe helps? A lot of this is about fundamentally how the companies\u2019 sites operate and it does frequently come back to algorithms. Until we reach a place where safety is more important than engagement, these kinds of things will keep happening.\u201d She pauses and leans back on the sofa, which exists, and seats two, and is blue. \u201cMy job is to expose the problems. I guess, I hope people reading will come up with solutions.\u201d Marianna Spring\u2019s podcast, Why Do You Hate Me, is now available on BBC Sounds (bbc.co.uk)",

      "body": "<p>We\u2019ve all heard about how overcrowded Venice is, with the local government introducing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/24/venice-access-fee-what-is-it-and-how-much-does-it-cost\">a visitor tax</a> to try to reduce daytrippers. With its 20m visitors a year, is it even possible to experience Venice in a more mindful way? I\u2019ve been to the city many times, including research trips for my latest novel, <em>The Glassmaker</em>. Here are my top tips on how to have a less-crowded, more interesting encounter.</p> <h2>Go when the crowds don\u2019t</h2> <p>Visit in November or January. During these months the city breathes out and becomes much friendlier. For a lively winter meal, go to <a href=\"https://www.ristorantemarioallafava.it/?lang=en\">Mario alla Fava</a>. It\u2019s one of the first restaurants in Venice to offer vegan choices, I go for its seafood and mix of locals and tourists. Afterwards, go for a wander: the best times to walk around Venice without crowds are early morning and late evening.</p> <h2>Leave your phone behind for a day</h2> <p>You don\u2019t need a map \u2013 just wander and let yourself get lost. You\u2019ll find all sorts of unexpected places, and eventually you\u2019ll reach water and you can take a vaporetto back. No phone also means no photographs. Everything in Venice is photogenic, yet when you look back through photos later none will be spectacular. Let go of the need to preserve those beautiful scenes and just enjoy them in the moment. I particularly recommend the passages off Via Garibaldi, where you\u2019ll see laundry hanging out and kids playing football.</p> <h2>Go backstage at the Doge\u2019s Palace</h2>    <p>Take the <a href=\"https://palazzoducale.visitmuve.it/\">Secret Itineraries</a> tour, which you book in advance (palazzoducale.visitmuve.it). Not only do you bypass the long entry queues and gain access to the whole palace, you also get to go up to the attic cells where prisoners, such as Casanova, were held. You even walk over the Bridge of Sighs.</p> <h2>Try your hand on the water</h2> <p>Kayaking in canals is a magical way to experience Venice the way it was built, with its orientation around water. Most of the buildings had their main entrances on canals, which you only see when you\u2019re down low in the water itself. We went at sunset with <a href=\"https://www.realvenetiankayak.com/\">Real Venetian Kayak</a>. As part of my research for <em>The Glassmaker</em>, I also had fun trying out rowing in the Venetian style \u2013 standing up and facing forward \u2013 with <a href=\"https://rowvenice.org/\">Row Venice</a>, a group of women who are passionate about boats.</p> <h2>Go during the Art Biennale</h2> <p>Every two years, Venice hosts art from all over the world for eight months. While there are two main sites that you pay to go into, for me the best part of the <a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en\">Biennale</a> is the many free art installations scattered throughout the city. They are often housed in buildings that you would never see otherwise: private palazzos, courtyards, libraries, schools. Whatever you think of the variable art, the settings are spectacular, never crowded and give you a sense of the Venice behind closed doors. </p>    <h2>Visit an empty museum</h2> <p>Venetian museums are often overlooked, as visitors are seduced by the canals, squares and fancy exteriors. That\u2019s a shame, as some are corkers. For a taste of what it was like to live in a palazzo, try <a href=\"https://carezzonico.visitmuve.it/en/home/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwg-24BhB_EiwA1ZOx8vcay9F5KwkLRxvJJ192-eNrQmJwE9oKGPONls8Xi6dTLIP1nMKQwhoCi4QQAvD_BwE\">Ca\u2019 Rezzonico</a> and <a href=\"https://www.venice-museum.com/ca-doro-franchetti-gallery.php\">Ca\u2019 D\u2019Oro</a>, both of which also have excellent art collections. I have a special fondness for <a href=\"https://mocenigo.visitmuve.it/en/home/\">Palazzo Mocenigo</a>, with its collection of 17th- and 18th-century fashion, especially its cabinet of fancy embroidered waistcoats. Close by is one of my favourite restaurants: <a href=\"https://www.lazucca.it/en/\">La Zucca</a>, a cosy vegetarian restaurant.</p> <h2>Find a view</h2>    <p>It can be claustrophobic walking through narrow passageways with so many people around. To get above the city for a bird\u2019s eye perspective, the most obvious place is the campanile in St Mark\u2019s Square, where the views are spectacular, but there\u2019s always a long queue. Two alternatives: the <a href=\"https://www.gioiellinascostidivenezia.it/en/scala-contarini-del-bovolo/\">Scala Contarini del Bovolo</a> has the most famous staircase in Venice \u2013 an ornate exterior spiral leading up to a terrace with lovely views. It\u2019s never been crowded when I\u2019ve visited, possibly because it\u2019s tricky to find. Second, the <a href=\"https://www.dfs.com/en/venice/service/rooftop-terrace\">Fondaco dei Tedeschi</a>. For centuries, the German merchants\u2019 quarters, it\u2019s a grand four-storey building near the Rialto Bridge that\u2019s been turned into a luxury department store. It has a gorgeous interior courtyard and a rooftop with panoramic views you can access for free (it\u2019s popular, so <a href=\"https://www.dfs.com/en/venice/service/rooftop-terrace\">book ahead</a>). One of my favourite hotels, <a href=\"https://ocandafiorita.com/\">Locanda Fiorita</a>, has a roof terrace with lovely views and free prosecco every evening.</p> <h2>Escape to the outer islands</h2> <p>The main island of Venice is surrounded by smaller islands. The glass island Murano, the lace island Burano, the cemetery island San Michele, and the ruins of Torcello are the best known. But there are many others accessible by vaporetto, with fewer crowds and interesting sites. Try Sant\u2019Erasmus, where most Venetian vegetables are grown; San Servolo, with its Insane Asylum Museum and Lazzaro degli Armeni, with its beautiful Armenian monastery (by guided tour only, so reserve), or simply head across to Giudecca, the island opposite St Mark\u2019s Square and eat at Altanella \u2013 a traditional trattoria with a local feel and a gorgeous canalside terrace.</p> <h2>Make a glass bead</h2> <p>The glass island of Murano has countless demonstrations of glassblowing and many shops to browse, as well as a cracking <a href=\"https://fortuny.visitmuve.it/en/home/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwg-24BhB_EiwA1ZOx8ndSMr95pSF3kDmtiyh09mKSbl5lXmIiaDfJUrPPMYyIfdMmW4kp_BoCK_cQAvD_BwE\">glass museum</a>. But there\u2019s nothing like creating something for yourself to make you appreciate the immense skill of the glass maestros. My novel focuses on a woman who makes glass beads and for research I had two lessons with <a href=\"https://www.alessiafuga.com/en/home-en/\">Alessia Fuga</a>, a brilliant beadmaker and patient teacher.</p> <h2>Appreciate the artisans</h2> <p>Venice has always been full of skilled artisans, making glassware, leather, boats, masks and paper. Many small workshops are still scattered throughout the city where you can watch the artisans at work and buy unique souvenirs, knowing that you are contributing to a precious local economy. Look out for <a href=\"https://www.gualti.it/\">Gualti</a>, whose shop in Dorsoduro is full of jewellery and textiles inspired by natural forms; Gianni Basso\u2019s printing shop, <a href=\"https://www.wilton-photography.com/news-stories/gianni-bassos-antica-stamperia-venice\">Antica Stamperia</a> in Cannaregio, where you can order bespoke business cards and admire his old printing presses (he is so old-school he has no website and takes only cash); and <a href=\"https://micromega.it/en/\">Micromega </a>eyewear in San Marco, which sells unique, often asymmetrical, glasses that are designed by a father-and-son team.</p> <p><em>The Glassmaker by Tracy Chevalier is published by the Borough Press (\u00a320).

Then in May 2024, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/17/entertainment/sean-combs-cassie-ventura\">CNN</a> published hotel surveillance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/17/video-p-diddy-assault-cassie-ventura\">footage</a> from 2016 that showed Combs grabbing Ventura by the neck, throwing her to the ground, kicking her and dragging her.</p> <p>Diddy was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/17/sean-diddy-combs-arrest-new-york-grand-jury-indictment-ntwnfb\">arrested</a> a few months later, in September, on the federal charges.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Tony Buzbee, a Texas-based attorney, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/01/sean-diddy-combs-120-victims-lawsuit\">announced he was representing</a> more than 120 men and women whose allegations against Combs include \u201cviolent sexual assault or rape, facilitated sex with a controlled substance, dissemination of video recordings, sexual abuse of minors\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/media/1368556/dl\">criminal complaint</a> states that Combs held \u201cfreak offs\u201d, where he \u201cdistributed a variety of controlled substances to victims, in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant\u201d.</p> <p>Combs\u2019s attorneys have repeatedly denied the allegations.</p> <p>\u201cMr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d Combs\u2019s attorneys said in the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-new-lawsuits-monday/index.html\">statement to CNN</a>. \u201cIn court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone \u2013 adult or minor, man or woman.\u201d</p> <p>Despite those denials, \u201cwhen you have a consistent line of victims alleging the same or similar claims, it just gives a lot of more credibility to the allegations\u201d, said Tre Lovell, a Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney.

      "bodyText": "In September 2000, a 13-year-old girl who hoped to attend the Video Music Awards \u2013 or at least an afterparty \u2013 started asking limousine drivers outside the event in New York City for help getting into the festivities. A driver allegedly told her that because of her age, she \u201cfit what Diddy was looking for\u201d and as such, he could take her to a party, according to court documents. It turned out that offer meant Sean Combs, the hip-hop mogul, wanted to have sex with her and allegedly used a date-rape drug to do so. \u201cYou are ready to party!\u201d Combs said as the girl, named as Jane Doe in the lawsuit, became disoriented. He and another male celebrity then allegedly raped her as a female celebrity watched. The case, filed on 20 October in New York federal court, is part of the latest wave of federal civil lawsuits against Combs, who faces more than 20 lawsuits and was indicted in September on federal charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. The charges against Combs, who pleaded not guilty, make him the latest person \u2013 joining the ranks of R Kelly, Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein \u2013 to allegedly use employees, drugs and promises of access to celebrities and career advancement to lure young women into situations where the powerful men and, in some cases, others in their circle then sexually assaulted them. Diddy, who is in federal custody in Brooklyn awaiting trial, has not only faced a reckoning in the court of public opinion but will probably also be convicted of the criminal charges and lose or have to settle the lawsuits, according to legal experts. \u201cIt\u2019s not one woman who usually gets raked over the coals. It seems to be a pile of evidence,\u201d said Nancy Erika Smith, an attorney in New Jersey who represented former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the network\u2019s late chief Roger Ailes and a woman who said she was sexually harassed and coerced into sex by a supervisor at a Trump golf club. \u201cThere are many women who witnessed their own experiences and will testify about that, but they also witnessed the abuse of other women in the same parties or orgies.\u201d Combs, a rapper whose success also included launching a record label and clothing line, faced a sexual harassment lawsuit in 2017, which was later settled. The public started paying more attention to his alleged predatory behavior in November 2023 when Combs\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit alleging that he beat her, raped her and forced her to have sex with male prostitutes, which he filmed. The parties settled in that suit, too, but more lawsuits began to come down with similar allegations of Diddy drugging and sexually assaulting women. Then in May 2024, CNN published hotel surveillance footage from 2016 that showed Combs grabbing Ventura by the neck, throwing her to the ground, kicking her and dragging her. Diddy was arrested a few months later, in September, on the federal charges. Earlier this month, Tony Buzbee, a Texas-based attorney, announced he was representing more than 120 men and women whose allegations against Combs include \u201cviolent sexual assault or rape, facilitated sex with a controlled substance, dissemination of video recordings, sexual abuse of minors\u201d. The criminal complaint states that Combs held \u201cfreak offs\u201d, where he \u201cdistributed a variety of controlled substances to victims, in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant\u201d. Combs\u2019s attorneys have repeatedly denied the allegations. \u201cMr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d Combs\u2019s attorneys said in the statement to CNN. \u201cIn court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone \u2013 adult or minor, man or woman.\u201d Despite those denials, \u201cwhen you have a consistent line of victims alleging the same or similar claims, it just gives a lot of more credibility to the allegations\u201d, said Tre Lovell, a Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney. He compared the scale of the allegations against Combs to those against Cosby, who was accused of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment by more than 60 women. \u201cIt\u2019s the consistency and the multitude of the same stories,\u201d Lovell said. As more civil cases are filed, state prosecutors could also start to review those cases and file criminal charges, Lovell said. \u201cThey are going to give more credibility to each other, certainly potentially more witnesses because these different plaintiffs could be witnesses for each other,\u201d he said. Also, given that celebrities attended Combs\u2019s parties and \u2013 according to the young woman who attended the awards show afterparty \u2013 participated in at least one sexual assault, attorneys could start to try to add defendants to the civil lawsuits, Lovell said. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers could send their targets demand letters and a draft of a complaint and offer to resolve the allegations confidentially. If not, they could file a lawsuit, in which case their names would be publicized, Lovell said. Combs\u2019s attorneys have argued that the sexual activity with his accusers was consensual. The legal experts predicted that it would be difficult for the defense attorneys to prove that. \u201cThey might have been at that location initially consensually, but they didn\u2019t sign up for what happened to them there,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHaving read several of the civil complaints and the criminal complaints, I think that\u2019s going to be a fairly consistent story.\u201d If federal prosecutors decide to charge Combs\u2019s alleged enablers, they could then decide to testify against Combs to save themselves. Smith says that could also strengthen the government\u2019s cases. Lovell thinks that is unlikely because prosecutors would have already indicted them, though he also suggested that prosecutors could be talking with people to get them to be government witnesses in exchange for not indicting them. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty clear that they are just going after Diddy and his empire,\u201d Lovell said. Despite how strong the case against Combs may appear, Cosby and Weinstein also faced a multitude of allegations and were found guilty of sexual assault and rape, but some of those convictions were overturned. (Weinstein was also convicted in a separate case, which he is appealing, and remains incarcerated.) Still, Smith expects Combs to be convicted. \u201cThe evidence, I think, is overwhelming,\u201d she said, adding that the lawsuits are helping to change the culture. \u201cI think that women are going to be less likely to tolerate it and be fearful to speak out, and other women are going to come forward.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It has been simmering for years. Long before she was a dame, before she was withering in <em>Succession</em>, had appeared opposite Chewbacca in <em>Star Wars</em>, fat-shamed a baby in <em>Ted Lasso</em> and become one of the few \u2013 possibly the only \u2013 actor to play both a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/12/henry-4-review-harriet-walter-kingly-power\">king</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jul/24/theatre\">queen</a> of England, Harriet Walter was Ophelia in Richard Eyre\u2019s revelatory 1980 production of <em>Hamlet</em> (the one in which Hamlet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/18/jonathan-pryce-hamlet-royal-court-1980\">ventriloquised the Ghost</a>). Each night she watched from the wings as the prince and his mother had their heated debate: \u201cJill Bennett\u2019s Gertrude was squirming under Jonathan Pryce\u2019s blast. I used to think: \u2018Oh Gertie, get a hold of yourself\u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Now Walter has written an extraordinary book (her fifth) in which Gertrude, among others, has her say. In spiky Shakespearean verse. <em><a href=\"https://www.virago.co.uk/titles/harriet-walter-2/she-speaks/9780349018911/\">She Speaks!</a></em> brilliantly creates secret lives and new monologues for 30 of Shakespeare\u2019s women \u2013 including Anne Hathaway. Ophelia explains that she did not actually drown but faked her death with the help of the grave digger: she ran off to a nunnery and has been whooping it up with some wild sisters. Cleopatra is bored rigid, stuck in heaven with Antony: \u201cWithout command and sway and sexual sizzle/ It\u2019s all one dreary democratic drizzle.\u201d Lady Macbeth, who met the witches to suggest that her husband\u2019s ambition needed a bit of a nudge, rhymes \u201cnagger\u201d with \u201cdagger\u201d. Desdemona, most miserably fading of heroines, conjures up the love she shared with Othello and concludes, beautifully and in anguished realisation, with lines that entwine Shakespeare\u2019s own: \u201cI just woke up as you put out my light.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When Walter\u2019s father left the household he told his 13-year-old daughter: \u2018I\u2019m sure I can rely on you to take it like a chap\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Distillation with a depth charge. On the page as on the stage, there is no slack or flummery, no breathy intensity with Walter. She is concentrated: the least fidgety person I have ever met. Almost completely still as she talks, and uncluttered: long and lean like a hieroglyph; dark brown top and trousers, creamy blouse; no bag! \u2013 though perhaps her actor husband, Guy Paul, with whom she is about to set off for Spain when we meet, is guarding it round the corner with her wheelie case.</p>    <p>She is also getting ready to play Margaret Thatcher, watching \u201cacres of footage\u201d, most of it for the first time, as in the 80s \u201cI switched off when she came on\u201d. She is not aiming at impersonation \u2013 \u201cI think the closer you get to an imitation the less you really find out about the person\u201d \u2013 but has been working on the voice and is beginning to find herself slipping automatically into the walk: \u201cBasically, her head was always going first, and her feet catching up.\u201d The result will be seen next year in <em><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/press/news/first-look-images-released-major-new-channel-4-drama-brian-and-margaret-starring-steve\">Brian and Margaret</a></em>, a Channel 4 drama written by James Graham \u2013 of telly\u2019s <em>Sherwood</em> and the stage\u2019s <em>Dear England</em> \u2013 and directed by Stephen Frears. Steve Coogan will play Brian Walden, Labour MP turned caustic interviewer: a notorious televised clash between him and Thatcher featured a comically charged dispute about who was the more domineering. Walter believes that \u201cno one has seen the side of Margaret Thatcher that James Graham has brought out\u201d. It goes against the grain, but \u201cI\u2019m beginning to understand her\u201d.</p> <p>Thatcher takes her place in the long queue of Walter characters who could never be called cuddly \u2013 though who would even see cuddly as a category if she were a man? The list includes Hedda Gabler, <em>Killing Eve</em>\u2019s Dasha, Lady Macbeth, <em>Ted </em><em>Lasso</em>\u2019s Deborah, <em>The Duchess of Malfi</em> and <em>Succession</em>\u2019s Lady Caroline Collingwood. Growing up in \u201cthe foothills of aristocracy\u201d, in a \u201cdownwardly mobile\u201d family who knew people with country piles but didn\u2019t have a pile of their own, was good prep for performing icy composure and for observing what it might be like to be married to Logan Roy. Walter knew as a child what it was to be \u201con the receiving end of cold, snooty, put-down people\u201d. Flippancy was at a premium and \u201cno one said anything very serious\u201d (I would love to see her in No\u00ebl Coward). When her father left the household he told his 13-year-old daughter: \u201cI\u2019m sure I can rely on you to take it like a chap.\u201d</p> <p>Walter\u2019s new book might have been written to knock the snooties off their perch. It sprang from longstanding love and discontent. \u201cOf all the parts I\u2019ve played, the roles that have expressed me best have been Shakespeare\u2019s. He accommodates anything that you want to say about being human. And yet there is this big gap, a lacuna where the woman\u2019s point of view is not present.\u201d When his characters are put <a href=\"https://www.shakespeareswords.com/Public/Characters.aspx\">in order of the number of lines they are given</a>, only 15 women\u2019s parts fall into the top 100: <em>As You Like It</em>\u2019s Rosalind is highest placed at 15; Lady Macbeth comes in at 138. It is not, Walter thinks, that Shakespeare fails to understand women: he is simply telling stories where they are not at the centre. The women would all, of course, have been originally acted \u2013 shrilled and yelled \u2013 by boys, which opens up the possibility that a star performer could have progressed from playing Ophelia to being Hamlet. The title <em>She Speaks!</em> makes ironic play with Romeo\u2019s apparent astonishment when Juliet opens her beak on what was, according to Walter, not really a balcony.</p>    <p>She has played 21 Shakespearean parts. To make sense of an underwritten role, \u201cmost of the time you are nursing a whole complicated subplot inside your head. It is very important that the actor has it, but it isn\u2019t something that the audience can read clearly.\u201d You can, though, sometimes get a glimmer: when Walter played Lady Macbeth, opposite Antony Sher, in Gregory Doran\u2019s galvanic <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/macbeth/past-productions/in-focus-gregory-doran-1999\">1999 production</a>, I remember feeling she was tracing a perfect arc as she glided from overprotective mate to valkyrie.</p> <p>Once she started writing the speeches, words came \u201cin a rush. I found things floating to the surface which had obviously been inside me for quite a while.\u201d After four decades of speaking Shakespeare, the beat of his verse comes into her head \u201clike music\u201d. Here is a pulse with a practical purpose: it is not sugared phrases that enable Richard III to pull off his incredible seductions, but his ability to ensnare by the rhythm of his speech. Walter provides something for buffs too: deceiving echoes. Her Gertrude, who turns out to have been in love with Claudius since she was a slip of a thing, never did think much of Hamlet\u2019s father. \u201cHe was a viper when he went to school/ At home he rampaged like a shackled bull.\u201d That \u201cviper\u201d is lifted from one of the best ever theatrical quarrels \u2013 in <em>A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I do watch myself, and I depress myself. There\u2019s not much you can do about theatre but I learn how to do things differently on telly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Walter\u2019s \u201ccredo about growing old\u201d (she was born in 1950) is voiced by her version of Macbeth\u2019s witches. In 2011 she published <em>Facing It</em>, a collection of photographs of older women, from Jane Birkin and Fran\u00e7oise Hardy to people Walter had spotted on the tube. The book celebrated \u201ca certain \u2018alternative\u2019 outlook, an acerbity, a sense of irony\u201d. Her weird sisters challenge those who despise them with a defiant recital of their wrinkles, stubble, creaks and \u201cleopard eyes\u201d. They also rejoice in the \u201cquiet wells\u201d of their memories. \u201cI wish I\u2019d had when young the fuck-it-all confidence I have now,\u201d she says. \u201cThe paradox is that you get more confident at the point when the parts have run out\u2026\u201d A spread in <em>Facing It</em> shows her at 18 surrounded by schoolgirls, and with the same women 30 years later: \u201cOne of my few qualities is loyalty. I have a lot of best friends.\u201d She has more or less the same bobbed hair and is almost instantly recognisable; the main difference is encouraging: in the second photo she looks more defined, as if she had swum into focus.</p> <p>The interest in age is itself interesting as for much of her life Walter appeared younger than she was. Her voice was high-pitched enough for her to play Juliet, supposedly 13, on the radio when she was 30. Had she sounded deeper, \u201cI think my career would have been different. I would have been taken more seriously early on.\u201d She was turned down by five drama schools, and when she got into Lamda was told \u2013 code alert \u2013 that she was \u201csubtle\u201d: she might make it on telly but had too lightweight a voice for the theatre.</p>    <p>Her talk is a particular mixture of candour and detachment: Walter might be a really sharp critic reviewing herself. Unlike Maggie Smith, who claimed never to have seen <em>Downton Abbey</em>, \u201cI do watch myself, and I depress myself. There\u2019s not much you can do about theatre but I learn how to do things differently on telly. It\u2019s very seldom that I\u2019ve looked at something and thought: that was good. About three moments in my entire career.\u201d Pressed for an example, she goes right back to her 1980 television appearance in Ian McEwan\u2019s Enigma-inspired television play, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ6mdxCEIPo&amp;t=2s\">The Imitation Game</a></em>, and a short sequence when she was calling her best friend, played by Brenda Blethyn, from a phone box; she was stirred by memories of ringing her mother from boarding school.</p> <p>Asked what she would never wear (the answer is yellow), she flicks her hand dismissively at the ivory triangle of her features: \u201cjust look at this pasty face\u201d. Talking about her schooldays \u2013 <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/New_Wardour_Castle_01.JPG\">Cranborne Chase</a> \u2013 she comes up with a beaming piece of erasure from a school report: \u201cHarriet\u2019s tennis is improving but she still has trouble contacting the ball.\u201d She shrugs off the fact that she turned down a place at Oxford: she sat the entrance exam at the urging of her grandfather, and would have studied languages (Italian, though she has since learned some Russian, which came in useful in <em>Killing Eve</em>). Still, she had decided when she was nine that she wanted to be an actor and didn\u2019t waver, though her grandfather wrote her father a letter saying \u201cHarriet is nuts to want to be an actress and you are nuts to let her\u201d, and her uncle Christopher Lee \u2013 he of <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9SIbIgW6CE\">The Curse of Frankenstein</a></em> \u2013 was conscripted to fill her in on the difficulties of the profession.</p>    <p>The first thing she would say to Shakespeare were he to drop in would be an apology \u201cfor the way we have turned out. Four hundred years later and we are even worse. We have not led into the light.\u201d Actually, as far as the theatre is concerned, Walter has done rather a lot of leading. Not least in what has come to be referred to as the \u201call-female Shakespeares\u201d directed by Phyllida Lloyd, first seen at the Donmar Warehouse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/09/julius-caesar-hello-dolly-peter-pan\">in 2012</a>. Walter was the linchpin of the productions: a riven Brutus, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/15/harriet-walter-donmar-shakespeare-women-henry-iv-julius-caesar\">desolating Henry IV</a>, a haunted Prospero. She slipped into the roles without putting the macho into inverted commas: sleek as a needle and utterly authoritative, shorn of the hand gestures that she has identified as one of the ways women express themselves. She was, after all, used to behaving like a fellow. \u201cThe people you study when you are a child are either frightening schoolteachers or people you\u2019d like to be like. I thought boys had a much better time so internally I took on their posture and attitude.\u201d Her breakthrough part \u2013 tiny but crucial, as it landed her an agent \u2013 was as an almost silent young chap in Joint Stock Theatre Company\u2019s 1978 version of <em>The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists</em>.</p> <p>The opening of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/27/shakespeare-trilogy-review-donmar-kings-cross-phyllida-lloyd-the-tempest-rsc-simon-russell-beale\">Donmar Shakespeares</a> was \u201cprobably the most frightening moment in my career\u201d. It changed the possibilities for Shakespeare and the theatre at a stroke. Individual women \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mq9L6mbAKM\">Sarah Bernhardt as Hamlet</a> to <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/richardii\">Fiona Shaw as Richard II </a>\u2013 had long taken on leading roles. This, though, suggested that the default position for a cast need not be male, and brought with it \u2013 almost unobserved in the excitement about gender \u2013 other changes: actors who were not all white; accents from all over the country and beyond its borders; women who were not twig-thin. (Male critics have wondered if men are about to lose the chance of starring roles. Hardly.) Things have certainly come a long way since even 2005, when Walter and Janet McTeer, playing opposite each other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jul/24/theatre\">in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jul/24/theatre\">Mary Stuart</a></em> as Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots, were asked to hold hands at the curtain call as audiences were worrying that they hated each other.</p>    <p>There must surely be \u2013 Walter is thinking about it \u2013 a show based on <em>She Speaks!</em> I am also hoping she gets cast in parts that push against her elegant economy: in, for example, a fan-waving, syllable-swilling folderol Restoration comedy. Imagine what she would make of Congreve\u2019s line \u201cI may by degrees dwindle into a wife\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It has been simmering for years. Long before she was a dame, before she was withering in Succession, had appeared opposite Chewbacca in Star Wars, fat-shamed a baby in Ted Lasso and become one of the few \u2013 possibly the only \u2013 actor to play both a king and queen of England, Harriet Walter was Ophelia in Richard Eyre\u2019s revelatory 1980 production of Hamlet (the one in which Hamlet ventriloquised the Ghost). Each night she watched from the wings as the prince and his mother had their heated debate: \u201cJill Bennett\u2019s Gertrude was squirming under Jonathan Pryce\u2019s blast. I used to think: \u2018Oh Gertie, get a hold of yourself\u2026\u2019\u201d Now Walter has written an extraordinary book (her fifth) in which Gertrude, among others, has her say. In spiky Shakespearean verse. She Speaks! brilliantly creates secret lives and new monologues for 30 of Shakespeare\u2019s women \u2013 including Anne Hathaway. Ophelia explains that she did not actually drown but faked her death with the help of the grave digger: she ran off to a nunnery and has been whooping it up with some wild sisters. Cleopatra is bored rigid, stuck in heaven with Antony: \u201cWithout command and sway and sexual sizzle/ It\u2019s all one dreary democratic drizzle.\u201d Lady Macbeth, who met the witches to suggest that her husband\u2019s ambition needed a bit of a nudge, rhymes \u201cnagger\u201d with \u201cdagger\u201d. Desdemona, most miserably fading of heroines, conjures up the love she shared with Othello and concludes, beautifully and in anguished realisation, with lines that entwine Shakespeare\u2019s own: \u201cI just woke up as you put out my light.\u201d Distillation with a depth charge. On the page as on the stage, there is no slack or flummery, no breathy intensity with Walter. She is concentrated: the least fidgety person I have ever met. Almost completely still as she talks, and uncluttered: long and lean like a hieroglyph; dark brown top and trousers, creamy blouse; no bag! \u2013 though perhaps her actor husband, Guy Paul, with whom she is about to set off for Spain when we meet, is guarding it round the corner with her wheelie case. She is also getting ready to play Margaret Thatcher, watching \u201cacres of footage\u201d, most of it for the first time, as in the 80s \u201cI switched off when she came on\u201d. She is not aiming at impersonation \u2013 \u201cI think the closer you get to an imitation the less you really find out about the person\u201d \u2013 but has been working on the voice and is beginning to find herself slipping automatically into the walk: \u201cBasically, her head was always going first, and her feet catching up.\u201d The result will be seen next year in Brian and Margaret, a Channel 4 drama written by James Graham \u2013 of telly\u2019s Sherwood and the stage\u2019s Dear England \u2013 and directed by Stephen Frears. Steve Coogan will play Brian Walden, Labour MP turned caustic interviewer: a notorious televised clash between him and Thatcher featured a comically charged dispute about who was the more domineering. Walter believes that \u201cno one has seen the side of Margaret Thatcher that James Graham has brought out\u201d. It goes against the grain, but \u201cI\u2019m beginning to understand her\u201d. Thatcher takes her place in the long queue of Walter characters who could never be called cuddly \u2013 though who would even see cuddly as a category if she were a man? The list includes Hedda Gabler, Killing Eve\u2019s Dasha, Lady Macbeth, Ted Lasso\u2019s Deborah, The Duchess of Malfi and Succession\u2019s Lady Caroline Collingwood. Growing up in \u201cthe foothills of aristocracy\u201d, in a \u201cdownwardly mobile\u201d family who knew people with country piles but didn\u2019t have a pile of their own, was good prep for performing icy composure and for observing what it might be like to be married to Logan Roy. Walter knew as a child what it was to be \u201con the receiving end of cold, snooty, put-down people\u201d. Flippancy was at a premium and \u201cno one said anything very serious\u201d (I would love to see her in No\u00ebl Coward). When her father left the household he told his 13-year-old daughter: \u201cI\u2019m sure I can rely on you to take it like a chap.\u201d Walter\u2019s new book might have been written to knock the snooties off their perch. It sprang from longstanding love and discontent. \u201cOf all the parts I\u2019ve played, the roles that have expressed me best have been Shakespeare\u2019s. He accommodates anything that you want to say about being human. And yet there is this big gap, a lacuna where the woman\u2019s point of view is not present.\u201d When his characters are put in order of the number of lines they are given, only 15 women\u2019s parts fall into the top 100: As You Like It\u2019s Rosalind is highest placed at 15; Lady Macbeth comes in at 138. It is not, Walter thinks, that Shakespeare fails to understand women: he is simply telling stories where they are not at the centre. The women would all, of course, have been originally acted \u2013 shrilled and yelled \u2013 by boys, which opens up the possibility that a star performer could have progressed from playing Ophelia to being Hamlet. The title She Speaks! makes ironic play with Romeo\u2019s apparent astonishment when Juliet opens her beak on what was, according to Walter, not really a balcony. She has played 21 Shakespearean parts. To make sense of an underwritten role, \u201cmost of the time you are nursing a whole complicated subplot inside your head. It is very important that the actor has it, but it isn\u2019t something that the audience can read clearly.\u201d You can, though, sometimes get a glimmer: when Walter played Lady Macbeth, opposite Antony Sher, in Gregory Doran\u2019s galvanic 1999 production, I remember feeling she was tracing a perfect arc as she glided from overprotective mate to valkyrie. Once she started writing the speeches, words came \u201cin a rush. I found things floating to the surface which had obviously been inside me for quite a while.\u201d After four decades of speaking Shakespeare, the beat of his verse comes into her head \u201clike music\u201d. Here is a pulse with a practical purpose: it is not sugared phrases that enable Richard III to pull off his incredible seductions, but his ability to ensnare by the rhythm of his speech. Walter provides something for buffs too: deceiving echoes. Her Gertrude, who turns out to have been in love with Claudius since she was a slip of a thing, never did think much of Hamlet\u2019s father. \u201cHe was a viper when he went to school/ At home he rampaged like a shackled bull.\u201d That \u201cviper\u201d is lifted from one of the best ever theatrical quarrels \u2013 in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Walter\u2019s \u201ccredo about growing old\u201d (she was born in 1950) is voiced by her version of Macbeth\u2019s witches. In 2011 she published Facing It, a collection of photographs of older women, from Jane Birkin and Fran\u00e7oise Hardy to people Walter had spotted on the tube. The book celebrated \u201ca certain \u2018alternative\u2019 outlook, an acerbity, a sense of irony\u201d. Her weird sisters challenge those who despise them with a defiant recital of their wrinkles, stubble, creaks and \u201cleopard eyes\u201d. They also rejoice in the \u201cquiet wells\u201d of their memories. \u201cI wish I\u2019d had when young the fuck-it-all confidence I have now,\u201d she says. \u201cThe paradox is that you get more confident at the point when the parts have run out\u2026\u201d A spread in Facing It shows her at 18 surrounded by schoolgirls, and with the same women 30 years later: \u201cOne of my few qualities is loyalty. I have a lot of best friends.\u201d She has more or less the same bobbed hair and is almost instantly recognisable; the main difference is encouraging: in the second photo she looks more defined, as if she had swum into focus. The interest in age is itself interesting as for much of her life Walter appeared younger than she was. Her voice was high-pitched enough for her to play Juliet, supposedly 13, on the radio when she was 30. Had she sounded deeper, \u201cI think my career would have been different. I would have been taken more seriously early on.\u201d She was turned down by five drama schools, and when she got into Lamda was told \u2013 code alert \u2013 that she was \u201csubtle\u201d: she might make it on telly but had too lightweight a voice for the theatre. Her talk is a particular mixture of candour and detachment: Walter might be a really sharp critic reviewing herself. Unlike Maggie Smith, who claimed never to have seen Downton Abbey, \u201cI do watch myself, and I depress myself. There\u2019s not much you can do about theatre but I learn how to do things differently on telly. It\u2019s very seldom that I\u2019ve looked at something and thought: that was good. About three moments in my entire career.\u201d Pressed for an example, she goes right back to her 1980 television appearance in Ian McEwan\u2019s Enigma-inspired television play, The Imitation Game, and a short sequence when she was calling her best friend, played by Brenda Blethyn, from a phone box; she was stirred by memories of ringing her mother from boarding school. Asked what she would never wear (the answer is yellow), she flicks her hand dismissively at the ivory triangle of her features: \u201cjust look at this pasty face\u201d. Talking about her schooldays \u2013 Cranborne Chase \u2013 she comes up with a beaming piece of erasure from a school report: \u201cHarriet\u2019s tennis is improving but she still has trouble contacting the ball.\u201d She shrugs off the fact that she turned down a place at Oxford: she sat the entrance exam at the urging of her grandfather, and would have studied languages (Italian, though she has since learned some Russian, which came in useful in Killing Eve). Still, she had decided when she was nine that she wanted to be an actor and didn\u2019t waver, though her grandfather wrote her father a letter saying \u201cHarriet is nuts to want to be an actress and you are nuts to let her\u201d, and her uncle Christopher Lee \u2013 he of The Curse of Frankenstein \u2013 was conscripted to fill her in on the difficulties of the profession. The first thing she would say to Shakespeare were he to drop in would be an apology \u201cfor the way we have turned out. Four hundred years later and we are even worse. We have not led into the light.\u201d Actually, as far as the theatre is concerned, Walter has done rather a lot of leading. Not least in what has come to be referred to as the \u201call-female Shakespeares\u201d directed by Phyllida Lloyd, first seen at the Donmar Warehouse in 2012. Walter was the linchpin of the productions: a riven Brutus, a desolating Henry IV, a haunted Prospero. She slipped into the roles without putting the macho into inverted commas: sleek as a needle and utterly authoritative, shorn of the hand gestures that she has identified as one of the ways women express themselves. She was, after all, used to behaving like a fellow. \u201cThe people you study when you are a child are either frightening schoolteachers or people you\u2019d like to be like.

The opening of the Donmar Shakespeares was \u201cprobably the most frightening moment in my career\u201d. It changed the possibilities for Shakespeare and the theatre at a stroke. Individual women \u2013 from Sarah Bernhardt as Hamlet to Fiona Shaw as Richard II \u2013 had long taken on leading roles.

      "body": "<p>Fifty years ago, in a corner of white South Africa, Muhammad Ali already seemed a miracle-maker. Deep in our strictly regimented and divided country, Ali danced rings around apartheid. I had first heard about the inspirational boxer from a black man, Cassius, who sold bottles of beer from the illegal shebeen he and his friends ran across the road from our house.</p> <p>Cassius and his crew kept their illicit stash hidden in the drains outside the corner shop owned by an irritable Greek man. Whenever my football was booted over the garden wall, Cassius chased after it. After a dazzling display of slightly drunken footwork he would return the ball with a cackle. One day, while showcasing his trickery, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-obituary\">sang a strange song</a>: \u201cAli, Ali, float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, Ali, Ali, Muhammad Ali.\u201d</p>    <p>Cassius flicked rangy left jabs into the winter sunshine as his huge feet danced. He wore a pair of battered brown sandals that had split at the seams. They fluttered over the tar while the soles flapped in a jitterbug of their own. He pretended to be outraged when I asked who he was singing about: \u201cYou mean the <em>baasie</em> [Afrikaans for little boss] don\u2019t know?\u201d When I shook my head he became serious: \u201cAli is the heavyweight champion of the&nbsp;world.\u201d</p> <p>A thrill surged through me. Cassius told me how he was nicknamed after Ali \u2013 who had been born as Cassius Clay. I struggled to understand how one man could have two names. Cassius explained that the master boxer was a black American who dreamed up those happy bee and butterfly lines.</p> <p>Years later, in 1974, when I had just turned 13, I learned that Ali had been stripped of his world title in 1967 when he refused to fight in the Vietnam war. But he had become even more of a mythical figure to me because Ali entranced our frightening Afrikaans teacher with the same spell he cast over Cassius.</p> <p>When we summoned the courage to ask him why he liked Ali so much, while suspecting he was a staunch racist, the teacher softened. He spoke of the beauty and brilliance of Ali in the ring. Rather than being \u201cone of our blacks\u201d, Ali resembled the king of the world.</p> <p>On 30 October 1974, Ali finally had a chance to regain the title when he faced George Foreman. We were agog that the fight would take place not too far from us, in Zaire [now the Democratic Republic of Congo].</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/29/rumble-in-the-jungle-muhammad-ali-george-foreman-book-extract\">The Rumble in the Jungle</a> was promoted by Don King who underlined his ingenuity by taking the bout \u201cback to Africa\u201d. Zaire\u2019s dictatorial President, Mobutu Sese Seko, agreed to pay the boxers an unprecedented $5m each.</p> <p>Although the rest of Africa felt as far removed from our privileged suburb near Johannesburg as it did in Hertfordshire or New Hampshire, King brought the continent into our classrooms. Other kinder teachers confessed their fondness for Ali and favoured him over Foreman. Ali was also hailed by the black cleaners and gardeners who serviced the school and our homes.

      "bodyText": "Fifty years ago, in a corner of white South Africa, Muhammad Ali already seemed a miracle-maker. Deep in our strictly regimented and divided country, Ali danced rings around apartheid. I had first heard about the inspirational boxer from a black man, Cassius, who sold bottles of beer from the illegal shebeen he and his friends ran across the road from our house. Cassius and his crew kept their illicit stash hidden in the drains outside the corner shop owned by an irritable Greek man. Whenever my football was booted over the garden wall, Cassius chased after it. After a dazzling display of slightly drunken footwork he would return the ball with a cackle. One day, while showcasing his trickery, he sang a strange song: \u201cAli, Ali, float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, Ali, Ali, Muhammad Ali.\u201d Cassius flicked rangy left jabs into the winter sunshine as his huge feet danced. He wore a pair of battered brown sandals that had split at the seams. They fluttered over the tar while the soles flapped in a jitterbug of their own. He pretended to be outraged when I asked who he was singing about: \u201cYou mean the baasie [Afrikaans for little boss] don\u2019t know?\u201d When I shook my head he became serious: \u201cAli is the heavyweight champion of the world.\u201d A thrill surged through me. Cassius told me how he was nicknamed after Ali \u2013 who had been born as Cassius Clay. I struggled to understand how one man could have two names. Cassius explained that the master boxer was a black American who dreamed up those happy bee and butterfly lines. Years later, in 1974, when I had just turned 13, I learned that Ali had been stripped of his world title in 1967 when he refused to fight in the Vietnam war. But he had become even more of a mythical figure to me because Ali entranced our frightening Afrikaans teacher with the same spell he cast over Cassius. When we summoned the courage to ask him why he liked Ali so much, while suspecting he was a staunch racist, the teacher softened. He spoke of the beauty and brilliance of Ali in the ring. Rather than being \u201cone of our blacks\u201d, Ali resembled the king of the world. On 30 October 1974, Ali finally had a chance to regain the title when he faced George Foreman. We were agog that the fight would take place not too far from us, in Zaire [now the Democratic Republic of Congo]. The Rumble in the Jungle was promoted by Don King who underlined his ingenuity by taking the bout \u201cback to Africa\u201d. Zaire\u2019s dictatorial President, Mobutu Sese Seko, agreed to pay the boxers an unprecedented $5m each. Although the rest of Africa felt as far removed from our privileged suburb near Johannesburg as it did in Hertfordshire or New Hampshire, King brought the continent into our classrooms. Other kinder teachers confessed their fondness for Ali and favoured him over Foreman. Ali was also hailed by the black cleaners and gardeners who serviced the school and our homes. And the shebeen corner \u2013 from the Greek shop owner to the biggest drinkers \u2013 still belonged to him. Only Ali could forge such an alliance. No heavyweight was bigger or more threatening than Foreman, who had become world champion when demolishing Joe Frazier in two rounds. Frazier was so good he had beaten Ali in the Fight of the Century in 1971 \u2013 but he was blown away by Foreman who had a 40-0 record with 38 stoppages. Big George rained down bludgeoning punches, bringing sorrow to every fighter he faced. Only the 32-year-old Ali remained. \u201cForeman by knockout,\u201d I predicted mournfully.

      "body": "<p>The long wait is almost over. On Wednesday, for the first time in more than 14 years, a Labour chancellor will have the chance to deliver a budget \u2013 and much is riding on what Rachel Reeves comes up with. After a series of unforced errors, the government needs to seize back control of the political narrative.</p> <p>Reeves has said her budget will launch a new era of investment that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/26/reeves-my-budget-will-match-greatest-economic-moments-in-labour-history\">rank alongside</a> Labour\u2019s historic reform programmes of the past. She cannot afford the budget to be a dud.</p> <p>There is no reason why it should be. Forget the idea that \u201cwealth creators\u201d are about to leave the country en masse because they may have to pay higher rates of capital gains or inheritance tax. Some could, but the vast majority will stay put. Ignore, too, suggestions that Reeves\u2019s plans to borrow more for investment will lead to a ferocious sell-off of UK financial assets. The chances of another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/01/shes-totally-lost-it-inside-story-of-the-unravelling-of-liz-trusss-premiership\">\u201cLiz Truss moment\u201d </a>are remote.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say Reeves has an easy job on her hands. The chancellor has pledged that there will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/23/rachel-reeves-increased-government-spending-no-austerity\">no return to austerity</a>, and that requires an increase in public spending. She wants to keep the financial markets happy, so higher day-to-day spending means higher taxes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/13/labours-economic-challenge-isnt-simple-it-must-curb-city-power-and-keep-it-on-board\">Labour\u2019s challenge is complicated by the triumph of finance. That\u2019s bad news for UK plc | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour has ruled out raising taxes on working people, by which it means the rates of income tax, VAT, employees national insurance contributions and corporation tax. Together these account for about two-thirds of all tax raised, so raising the revenue to pay for the spending increases requires some ingenuity and some confusion over exactly who qualifies as a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgqy8v7ze0ko\">working person </a>and who doesn\u2019t. The biggest chunk of money will come from the national insurance contributions made by employers.</p> <p>Finally, the chancellor wants to reverse the cuts to infrastructure spending, inherited from the last government, to boost the UK\u2019s growth rate. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s plans involved a fall in public investment from 2.4% to 1.7% of national output (gross domestic product) by 2028-29 \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a324bn a year by the end of the current parliament.</p> <p>This is therefore a budget that will raise spending, raise borrowing and raise taxes all at the same time. With growth slowing and consumer confidence dented by the chancellor\u2019s repeated warnings about how draconian she intends to be, it could all go horribly wrong.</p> <p>Yet despite the risks and the apparent contradictions, the strategy has a logic to it. Extra spending on the NHS, schools, local government and prisons can be justified by 14 years of neglect under the Tories. The tax increases to pay for higher spending can also be blamed on the Tories. Part of the budget is about wiping the slate clean.</p> <p>The other part of the budget involves laying the foundations for future growth.

      "bodyText": "The long wait is almost over. On Wednesday, for the first time in more than 14 years, a Labour chancellor will have the chance to deliver a budget \u2013 and much is riding on what Rachel Reeves comes up with. After a series of unforced errors, the government needs to seize back control of the political narrative. Reeves has said her budget will launch a new era of investment that will rank alongside Labour\u2019s historic reform programmes of the past. She cannot afford the budget to be a dud. There is no reason why it should be. Forget the idea that \u201cwealth creators\u201d are about to leave the country en masse because they may have to pay higher rates of capital gains or inheritance tax. Some could, but the vast majority will stay put. Ignore, too, suggestions that Reeves\u2019s plans to borrow more for investment will lead to a ferocious sell-off of UK financial assets. The chances of another \u201cLiz Truss moment\u201d are remote. That\u2019s not to say Reeves has an easy job on her hands. The chancellor has pledged that there will be no return to austerity, and that requires an increase in public spending. She wants to keep the financial markets happy, so higher day-to-day spending means higher taxes. Labour has ruled out raising taxes on working people, by which it means the rates of income tax, VAT, employees national insurance contributions and corporation tax. Together these account for about two-thirds of all tax raised, so raising the revenue to pay for the spending increases requires some ingenuity and some confusion over exactly who qualifies as a working person and who doesn\u2019t. The biggest chunk of money will come from the national insurance contributions made by employers. Finally, the chancellor wants to reverse the cuts to infrastructure spending, inherited from the last government, to boost the UK\u2019s growth rate. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s plans involved a fall in public investment from 2.4% to 1.7% of national output (gross domestic product) by 2028-29 \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a324bn a year by the end of the current parliament. This is therefore a budget that will raise spending, raise borrowing and raise taxes all at the same time. With growth slowing and consumer confidence dented by the chancellor\u2019s repeated warnings about how draconian she intends to be, it could all go horribly wrong. Yet despite the risks and the apparent contradictions, the strategy has a logic to it. Extra spending on the NHS, schools, local government and prisons can be justified by 14 years of neglect under the Tories. The tax increases to pay for higher spending can also be blamed on the Tories. Part of the budget is about wiping the slate clean. The other part of the budget involves laying the foundations for future growth. Writing about the last Labour budget in his memoirs, Alistair Darling says: \u201cA great deal of my speech was devoted to the need to improve our country\u2019s infrastructure, including energy and transport. The case for government investment remains a strong one. There are areas in which, without government support, both financial and over important matters such as planning laws, we will fall further behind other countries.\u201d That was true back in 2010 and it is just as true today. The prolonged period of rock-bottom interest rates after the global financial crisis provided an opportunity for a succession of Conservative governments to borrow cheaply for investment. Sadly, that opportunity was squandered. Reeves says plugging the hole in the public finances and investing for the future are two sides of the same story. The reason the NHS is creaking and the government is letting prisoners out on early release schemes is because economic growth has been weak for the past decade and a half, and even weaker once population growth is taken into account. Getting the economy to grow faster requires higher investment but Britain \u2013 as the International Monetary Fund noted last week \u2013 has lower rates of private and public capital spending than many of its peers. The chancellor thinks it makes sense to borrow to invest in transport and energy projects because this will lead to faster growth, higher tax revenues and the ability to spend more on public services. She is absolutely right about that. Reeves said last week that she intends to make it easier for the government to borrow by changing the rules on public debt.

Who\u2019s up? Who\u2019s down? What tactics have they used to get one over on each other? What does it say about their personality? Words are seen as weapons with which politicians show off their ability to subvert or scare the opposition \u2013 not as substantive statements about what they intend to do.</p> <p>And what sort of politician will thrive in this world where political speech is just a game? A candidate such as Donald Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/presidential-election-polls-close\">Democrats panicking for no reason, pollsters say \u2013 US race nail-bitingly close</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the communications professors Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Joseph Cappella who first noticed the connection between describing politics as a series of strategies and a growing cynicism among voters.</p> <p>This was back in the mid-1990s, when the media was constantly analysing the rivalry between US president Bill Clinton and speaker of the house Newt Gingrich, the early iteration of today\u2019s identity-based partisanship. Jamieson and Cappella found the media was focusing less on the issues the two were debating \u2013 often around health reform \u2013 and more on how they were competing.</p> <p>The coverage fixated on who was winning, utilised the language of games and war, emphasised the performance and perception of politicians, put a new weight on polls.</p> <p>This sort of coverage activated people\u2019s cynicism about politics \u2013 the sense that it\u2019s just a game between self-serving schemers \u2013 and then made them more cynical about the media.</p> <p>Decades later, this \u201cspiral of cynicism\u201d is all around us: from the exploding popcorn of polls to the headlines. After Trump\u2019s former chief of staff John Kelly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/us-presidential-election-trump-harris-updates\">compared him to a fascist</a> last week, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> wrote: \u201cHarris uses ex-Trump chief of staff\u2019s remarks to paint him as unfit for office\u201d.</p> <p>The question of whether Trump is a fascist or not was reduced to highlighting a rhetorical tactic. The idea that all politics is just a cynical game, and that the \u201cmainstream media\u201d is not really looking out for the cares of the voter, has become so pervasive it has helped pave the way for politicians who stand on sweeping away the whole edifice of democracy as we know it.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence that this turn began in the 1990s, when the cold war had finished and the big philosophical debates about policy seemed to be over. Instead, politics became about entertaining performance \u2013 the era of Blair, Clinton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/vladimir-zhirinovsky-obituary\">Zhirinovsky</a>, Yeltsin. And the media began overgenerating coverage that replaced ideological debate with personality and tactics.</p> <p>The 1990s were also when the reality show emerged as the dominant entertainment format. It initially grew out of observational documentaries seeking to understand society better by ceaselessly filming ordinary people in their homes in such a way that they would forget about the cameras and be more themselves.</p> <p>It quickly became the opposite: a circus where all behaviour was for the cameras. Contestants learned to say and do the most vile things just to engineer scandal and generate attention for themselves.</p> <p>American political TV debates started to imitate the same logic. In a busy primary debate, candidates only get a little sliver of airtime. The way to get more is to attack another candidate in the meanest and most personal way possible, and thus provoke them to attack you back.

      "bodyText": "In Washington DC, I measure out my life in polls and heart palpitations. The polls are relentless, nail-biting, maddeningly contradictory. There are national polls, swing state polls, polls from tiny counties that predict a whole election, partisan polls designed to demoralise the other side. There are polls on whether a candidate inspires confidence, compassion, leadership. I\u2019ve noticed how, after a bad poll, I start looking for another that tells me numbers I like. I\u2019ve also noticed how, after a good one, I will look for a bad poll to bring me down, as if I\u2019m trying to prick the balloon of self-confidence and remind myself of \u201creality\u201d. But the polls never do quite take you to reality. Instead, they shape it. It\u2019s not just what the polls are saying, or even how they were put together, that\u2019s the great problem here \u2013 it\u2019s how the obsessive focus on polls is symptomatic of how we view politics. Polls make politics feel like a race, a game, a sport of feuding personalities. Who\u2019s up? Who\u2019s down? What tactics have they used to get one over on each other? What does it say about their personality? Words are seen as weapons with which politicians show off their ability to subvert or scare the opposition \u2013 not as substantive statements about what they intend to do. And what sort of politician will thrive in this world where political speech is just a game? A candidate such as Donald Trump. It was the communications professors Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Joseph Cappella who first noticed the connection between describing politics as a series of strategies and a growing cynicism among voters. This was back in the mid-1990s, when the media was constantly analysing the rivalry between US president Bill Clinton and speaker of the house Newt Gingrich, the early iteration of today\u2019s identity-based partisanship. Jamieson and Cappella found the media was focusing less on the issues the two were debating \u2013 often around health reform \u2013 and more on how they were competing. The coverage fixated on who was winning, utilised the language of games and war, emphasised the performance and perception of politicians, put a new weight on polls. This sort of coverage activated people\u2019s cynicism about politics \u2013 the sense that it\u2019s just a game between self-serving schemers \u2013 and then made them more cynical about the media. Decades later, this \u201cspiral of cynicism\u201d is all around us: from the exploding popcorn of polls to the headlines. After Trump\u2019s former chief of staff John Kelly compared him to a fascist last week, the Wall Street Journal wrote: \u201cHarris uses ex-Trump chief of staff\u2019s remarks to paint him as unfit for office\u201d. The question of whether Trump is a fascist or not was reduced to highlighting a rhetorical tactic. The idea that all politics is just a cynical game, and that the \u201cmainstream media\u201d is not really looking out for the cares of the voter, has become so pervasive it has helped pave the way for politicians who stand on sweeping away the whole edifice of democracy as we know it. It\u2019s no coincidence that this turn began in the 1990s, when the cold war had finished and the big philosophical debates about policy seemed to be over. Instead, politics became about entertaining performance \u2013 the era of Blair, Clinton, Zhirinovsky, Yeltsin. And the media began overgenerating coverage that replaced ideological debate with personality and tactics. The 1990s were also when the reality show emerged as the dominant entertainment format. It initially grew out of observational documentaries seeking to understand society better by ceaselessly filming ordinary people in their homes in such a way that they would forget about the cameras and be more themselves. It quickly became the opposite: a circus where all behaviour was for the cameras. Contestants learned to say and do the most vile things just to engineer scandal and generate attention for themselves. American political TV debates started to imitate the same logic. In a busy primary debate, candidates only get a little sliver of airtime. The way to get more is to attack another candidate in the meanest and most personal way possible, and thus provoke them to attack you back. If you are attacked, then you are allowed more time to respond. So you quickly got debates where supremely clever candidates sling personal abuse at each other to get more attention. The debate stage was set for reality show host Trump. The design of most social media has followed the same incentives: rewarding taking the most extreme and often nasty statements to generate attention. And Trump has flourished on that as well. The 1990s is when World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) boomed, with its cabaret wrestlers pulling obviously fake fighting moves, where violence is theatre. Trump was always an aficionado of WWE, even taking part in mock fights, and a member of its hall of fame. This year the 1990s wrestling star Hulk Hogan spoke at the Republican National Convention; Trump enters his own rallies to the theme tune of the Undertaker, who, at the height of WWE, was the \u201cevil\u201d foil to Hogan\u2019s all-American \u201cgoodie\u201d. Many of Trump\u2019s followers apply the cultural logic of WWE to his statements. Sure, the argument goes, Trump might say some very authoritarian-sounding things \u2013 but it\u2019s just a game. So can we ever find a way back to reality? To issues rather than strategies? We can, and we can even use polling to do so. When pollsters recently gave voters a choice of policies, rather than personalities, to choose from in this election, the majority, including Trump supporters, preferred Kamala Harris\u2019s. Partisan polarisation dissolves when we change how we cover politics. We can also develop different TV political debates, which preserve the excitement of competition but repurpose them to reward collaboration instead of abuse. Imagine a debate format where candidates had to solve a real policy problem, and show how they would work with each other and with the opposition party to achieve it. We could also scale social media platforms that algorithmically detect the commonalities in political disagreements to generate common policy solutions. Such platforms are already being used in Taiwan. Of course, there\u2019s appeal in fleeing from reality to the grotesque circus of politics. But if we can\u2019t face facts, others will force us. This month, at the Wilson Center in DC, Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute and Sam Cranny-Evans of the Open Source Centre presented a chilling analysis of Russian weapons manufacturing and supply chains.

      "body": "<p>Greg Epstein is the humanist chaplain at Harvard and MIT. He was also TechCrunch\u2019s first \u201cethicist in residence\u201d. In his new book, <em>Tech Agnostic</em>, he explores the idea that \u201ctech\u201d, by which he means modern digital technology, is a new global religion, with messianic leaders, dutiful followers, daily rituals of worship, and an inescapable influence on all facets of life.</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide on religion as the analogy with which to understand the modern role of tech?</strong><br>Well, religion has been the governing analogy for my life in many ways. I\u2019ve lived my life around diverse religions. And I\u2019ve had this 20-year career now as a chaplain for humanists, atheists, agnostics and allies at Harvard and now at MIT as well. When I was asked to join MIT in 2018 something really struck me about the \u201cT\u201d in MIT. I had been educated to see religion as the most powerful social technology in the world, and it seemed that that was no longer true. The era of social media has made tech the most powerful social technology, but I thought that religion could be a very useful tool in understanding a tech world.</p> <p><strong>But does tech have a theology or an eschatology?</strong><br>Well, there are many examples of people of influence in tech speaking the language of religion, doing things that are strikingly parallel to religion in which people talk of tech gods or of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/article/2024/aug/08/no-god-in-the-machine-the-pitfalls-of-ai-worship\">building God</a>. But it\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s a useful frame, because religion is largely an attempt to understand the world and give human life meaning and purpose. Religion has done that both for good and to cause great harm. Tech ticks all those boxes too, with our lust to surveil everything, our online communities superseding all other kinds of community, the way tech has become a mythical realm that we refer to as Silicon Valley, and how it motivates people to enact its agenda.</p> <p><strong>Does tech present technological progress itself as a kind of moral progress?</strong><br>For sure, because there\u2019s a total failure to imagine in this \u201cSilicon Valley tech religion\u201d what moral progress would actually look like. There\u2019s little understanding of what it would look like for human beings to treat one another better, to have more compassion for ourselves and one another, to create a more just and equitable society. Instead the emphasis is placed on more technology will equal more stuff, will equal better world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We genuflect to the stained glass window in our pockets 200 times a day, and it can offer salvation or damnation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Do you think the prominent tech billionaires are conscious of the messianic roles they often inhabit in today\u2019s society?</strong><br>I think this idea of messianism is made quite explicit, which I explore in the book. For example, Peter Thiel, who is one of the demigod figures of the Silicon Valley religion, has a manifesto on the website of Founders Fund \u2013 a multibillion dollar venture capital fund \u2013 about how there is <a href=\"https://foundersfund.com/2017/01/manifesto/\">a messianic quality</a> to the founders that the fund deems worthy of its billions. It\u2019s an established fact in Silicon Valley that you want to have some belief in yourself as a saviour if you\u2019re going to succeed. Russ Wilcox from the Harvard Business School was quite blunt about it. He told me that tech CEOs have got to base their judgments on faith.</p> <p><strong>You write in the book about religious rituals and the addictive behaviours encouraged by tech. What are the commonalities?</strong><br>As early as 2008 I felt addicted to my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/21/mobilephones.gadgets\">Palm Treo</a>. The same psychological mechanisms that are used to hook people on gambling are absolutely essential to our interaction with our devices. It\u2019s random intermittent positive feedback. Many of us genuflect to this stained glass window in our pockets 200 times a day, and at any moment it can offer salvation or damnation. And our interactions look like worship, our heads bowed over our phones.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re pointedly critical of Harvard, which you describe as a networking platform to help the rich become richer. What\u2019s been the feedback on that?</strong><br>I\u2019m not the first person at Harvard to criticise Harvard. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not in a formal administrative leadership role at an elite institution, and I used to have ambitions of doing things like that. I used to see myself as a leader because that\u2019s what I was taught. I\u2019d rather be someone who derives meaning from supportive participation in a meaningful community that\u2019s striving for the betterment of all.</p> <p><strong>There has been a lot of attention, most recently in </strong><strong>Jonathan Haidt</strong><strong>\u2019s </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/21/the-anxious-generation-by-jonathan-haidt-a-pocket-full-of-poison\">The Anxious Generation</a></strong></em><strong>, on the bad effects of tech on the mental health of young people. Is that your experience too?</strong><br>I know Jonathan, I\u2019ve worked with him, but I think he takes his thesis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/15/im-an-expert-on-adolescence-heres-why-a-smartphone-ban-isnt-the-answer-and-what-we-should-do-instead\">too far</a>. I don\u2019t think the issue is entirely what he makes it out to be. For one thing, this is not something that you can simply go cold turkey from. It doesn\u2019t work like that any more. So I didn\u2019t want to be part of offering unrealistic solutions. It\u2019s more like an eating disorder. You can\u2019t afford to stop eating, so you have to change your relationship with food, make it more positive and nutritious. And I think that\u2019s how we have to look at our relationship with tech at this point.</p> <p><strong>You work as a humanist chaplain. In what way is that different </strong><strong>from being a counsellor</strong><strong>? Do students come to you with some sort of spiritual yearning?</strong><br>The job has evolved. But the most meaningful work I do is helping students who are trying to figure out who they want to be and how they want to live. They\u2019re living in a world of overwhelming seismic change, climate change, technological change. These students are essentially being taught that everything they\u2019re learning will be obsolete unless they become one of the winners who define how everyone else becomes obsolete. And they\u2019re struggling with that. Is there something else, something more? Religion answers that question with answers that are not very helpful to many of my students. So the secular and humanist approach can be a valuable tool.</p> <p><strong>Given the ubiquity of tech, how can a tech agnostic resist it without becoming a luddite?</strong><br>We have to ask ourselves what do we do beyond just allowing ourselves to be swept forward by any and every powerful idea or company that comes along. I think agnosticism is a key part of the answer, because it\u2019s not that no technology is good. I recognise that there are some technologies that come along in which it might be reasonable to place faith. We need to retain scepticism about the leaders putting forward these technologies and these companies need to be made accountable. We should adopt sparingly and carefully.

The practice first began at Ivy League schools in the 1920s, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23055549\">according</a> to research from the sociologists Deborah L Coe and James D Davidson. It was primarily used as an antisemitic policy to limit the number of Jewish students who were enrolling.

Beyond boosting admissions, some schools, namely state flagship colleges, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-widespread-is-the-practice-of-giving-special-consideration-to-relatives-of-alumni-in-admissions/#more-than-one-in-ten-state-flagships-still-consider-legacy-status\">also offer</a> scholarships solely to legacy admissions, another way of increasing that demographic.</p> <p>But results on increasing diversity among students by decreasing legacy admissions have been mixed.</p> <p>At Carleton College, 13.6% of admitted students had a legacy connection to the school for the 2024-25 school year versus 15.7% for the 2023-24 school year, said Byerly.

But it is not just Democrats who are venturing into uncharted territory \u2013 on Sunday Donald Trump will appear at Madison Square Garden, in the deep blue New York.</p> <p>Both candidates will be visiting key swing states including Michigan and Pennsylvania in the coming days, but these extra-curricular visits give them a chance to tap into key messages, in moments the Harris and Trump campaigns will be eagerly capturing and distributing online.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/25/news-election-endorsements-washington-post-la-times\">The Washington Post and LA Times refused to endorse a candidate. Why? | Margaret Sullivan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an election which will essentially be decided by voters in seven or fewer states, it\u2019s also a chance to demonstrate inclusiveness, said Shannon Bow O\u2019Brien, a politics professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</p> <p>\u201cOne of things people criticize the Democrats for, and I think rightly so, is they frequently treat the interior of the country like flyover country, and they routinely ignore these types of places,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.</p> <p>\u201cI think maybe also going down here, is signaling that she\u2019s gonna pay attention to these areas too.\u201d</p> <p>For Harris, the visit to Texas was an opportunity for her to drive home the right to abortion, which she has made one of the key issues of her campaign. Trump has bragged about being responsible for the overturning of Roe v Wade, which guaranteed the right to abortion in the US.</p> <p>The vice-president\u2019s campaign launched a series of new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zNmmiYjDgQ\">abortion-related ads</a> this week, telling the story of a Texas woman who contracted a life-threatening infection when was denied proper medical care after miscarrying at 16 weeks pregnant.</p> <p>\u201cTexas is symbolically really important, because abortion for Harris is a strong issue, and Texas has been the origin of a number of really heartbreaking stories about the consequences of an abortion ban. And any meaningful challenges to the ban in front of the supreme court have come from women out of Texas,\u201d said Mona Kleinberg, a professor of political communication at the City University of New York.</p> <p>The Texas stop created another thing: content. Aided by the star power of Beyonc\u00e9, the Harris campaign will hope that their message about Trump and abortion can gain a wide audience online, including in swing states.</p> <p>\u201cObviously the most important decision a presidential campaign makes is where their principal is spending time,\u201d David Plouffe, a Harris senior adviser, told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/24/beyonce-kamala-harris-houston-rally/\">the Washington Post</a>. \u201cSo the fact that we\u2019re going to Texas means we really believe that will help us in those seven battleground states.\u201d</p> <p>Kleinberg said the presence of Beyonc\u00e9 added a level of excitement that Harris may be struggling to generate, while also guaranteeing coverage on national news shows.</p> <p>\u201cObama was such a good orator, he had all this charm, he generated a lot of excitement. Harris hasn\u2019t been able to do the same: in part because she has had less time, in part because she\u2019s a woman, she has this double burden, but I think she needs that. That\u2019s why Beyonc\u00e9 is important,\u201d Kleinberg said.</p> <p>The Texas trip came as Trump prepared to visit New York, where he lived for decades before departing after his first pugnacious election campaign. His appearance, at the famous arena in midtown, has same thinking as Harris\u2019s Texas visit, Kleinberg said: highlight a key campaign issue while drawing eyeballs. States including Texas have sent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/us/abbott-texas-migrant-buses.html\">more than 45,000 undocumented</a> migrants on buses to New York, and Trump will likely be aiming to play on fear around the issue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about creating enthusiasm, and lots of anger. Anger is the number one mobilizing emotion, political psychology research shows this over and over again. Anger makes people not think but act. And so that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to be trying to generate,\u201d Kleinberg said.</p> <p>For a born-and-raised New Yorker who has spent a lifetime seeking the spotlight, an attraction will also be simply the thrill of appearing at one of the most famous venues in the world \u2013 which is also a mile from Trump Tower, where Trump still has an apartment.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to get a big crowd. He loves the adulation. He\u2019s going to get a lot of attention. Everybody\u2019s going to be talking about him. That\u2019s nectar to Trump\u2019s ears,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier just to go there and then go to bed at Trump Tower than it is to be rigorously campaigning around the country.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Texas is not a usual stop for a Democratic presidential candidate, yet 11 days out from the election, that\u2019s where Kamala Harris could be found. The vice-president held a campaign rally in the traditionally Republican state on Friday, appearing alongside Beyonc\u00e9 and the Senate candidate Colin Allred. But it is not just Democrats who are venturing into uncharted territory \u2013 on Sunday Donald Trump will appear at Madison Square Garden, in the deep blue New York. Both candidates will be visiting key swing states including Michigan and Pennsylvania in the coming days, but these extra-curricular visits give them a chance to tap into key messages, in moments the Harris and Trump campaigns will be eagerly capturing and distributing online. In an election which will essentially be decided by voters in seven or fewer states, it\u2019s also a chance to demonstrate inclusiveness, said Shannon Bow O\u2019Brien, a politics professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cOne of things people criticize the Democrats for, and I think rightly so, is they frequently treat the interior of the country like flyover country, and they routinely ignore these types of places,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI think maybe also going down here, is signaling that she\u2019s gonna pay attention to these areas too.\u201d For Harris, the visit to Texas was an opportunity for her to drive home the right to abortion, which she has made one of the key issues of her campaign. Trump has bragged about being responsible for the overturning of Roe v Wade, which guaranteed the right to abortion in the US. The vice-president\u2019s campaign launched a series of new abortion-related ads this week, telling the story of a Texas woman who contracted a life-threatening infection when was denied proper medical care after miscarrying at 16 weeks pregnant. \u201cTexas is symbolically really important, because abortion for Harris is a strong issue, and Texas has been the origin of a number of really heartbreaking stories about the consequences of an abortion ban. And any meaningful challenges to the ban in front of the supreme court have come from women out of Texas,\u201d said Mona Kleinberg, a professor of political communication at the City University of New York. The Texas stop created another thing: content. Aided by the star power of Beyonc\u00e9, the Harris campaign will hope that their message about Trump and abortion can gain a wide audience online, including in swing states. \u201cObviously the most important decision a presidential campaign makes is where their principal is spending time,\u201d David Plouffe, a Harris senior adviser, told the Washington Post. \u201cSo the fact that we\u2019re going to Texas means we really believe that will help us in those seven battleground states.\u201d Kleinberg said the presence of Beyonc\u00e9 added a level of excitement that Harris may be struggling to generate, while also guaranteeing coverage on national news shows. \u201cObama was such a good orator, he had all this charm, he generated a lot of excitement. Harris hasn\u2019t been able to do the same: in part because she has had less time, in part because she\u2019s a woman, she has this double burden, but I think she needs that. That\u2019s why Beyonc\u00e9 is important,\u201d Kleinberg said. The Texas trip came as Trump prepared to visit New York, where he lived for decades before departing after his first pugnacious election campaign. His appearance, at the famous arena in midtown, has same thinking as Harris\u2019s Texas visit, Kleinberg said: highlight a key campaign issue while drawing eyeballs. States including Texas have sent more than 45,000 undocumented migrants on buses to New York, and Trump will likely be aiming to play on fear around the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating enthusiasm, and lots of anger. Anger is the number one mobilizing emotion, political psychology research shows this over and over again. Anger makes people not think but act. And so that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to be trying to generate,\u201d Kleinberg said. For a born-and-raised New Yorker who has spent a lifetime seeking the spotlight, an attraction will also be simply the thrill of appearing at one of the most famous venues in the world \u2013 which is also a mile from Trump Tower, where Trump still has an apartment. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get a big crowd. He loves the adulation. He\u2019s going to get a lot of attention. Everybody\u2019s going to be talking about him. That\u2019s nectar to Trump\u2019s ears,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier just to go there and then go to bed at Trump Tower than it is to be rigorously campaigning around the country.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Towards the end of 2019, the comedian Rob Beckett called his wife, and then his agent, to tell them he was struggling to cope. He had travelled to South Africa to film the second series of the Bafta award-winning show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jul/08/tv-tonight-jolly-hockey-sticks-as-rob-and-romesh-head-for-goal\">Rob &amp; Romesh Vs</a></em>, which follows attempts by him and fellow funnyman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/31/rometh-ranganathan-interview\">Romesh Ranganathan</a> to learn new skills. (Previous episodes include: modelling with David Gandy, country music with Shania Twain, boxing with Anthony Joshua.) This time they were playing cricket with Kevin Pietersen and going on safari. Beckett was aware of his privilege \u2013 that the trip should have been a breeze. But, as he tells me over lunch in a bustling, high-end London restaurant, he was heading towards burnout. \u201cThe job was basically a lads\u2019 trip, getting pissed with one of my best mates,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Well, if <em>this</em> doesn\u2019t make me happy\u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Beckett, who is 38, had a happy, lively childhood in working-class southeast London. He lived with his parents and two of his four brothers, who mocked and teased each other relentlessly. (His mum, known as \u201cBig Suze\u201d, has jokingly described the family home as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/11/for-women-its-behind-enemy-lines-rob-beckett-and-josh-widdicombe-on-their-parenting-podcast\">the House of No Compassion</a>. \u201cI was called Jaffa Cake Nips because I had fat nipples through puberty,\u201d Beckett has said.) Money was tight and he found school extremely difficult, leaving education with a chronic lack of self-worth and little idea of what to do next. When comedy called, he launched himself into it, saying yes to every opportunity in case it was his last, repurposing his insecurity into ammunition. \u201cIt was a toxic fuel,\u201d he says. \u201cEffective, like chucking petrol on a bonfire, but unsustainable.\u201d He soon became a fixture on our screens: as presenter on the ITV2 spin-off show <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMq_Msfp78k\">I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! Now!</a></em>, as a team captain on <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8MiCxGAzw8\">8 Out of 10 Cats</a></em>, a contestant on <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWiM3xwixgo\">Taskmaster</a></em>, the narrator on <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxzPno9R6dg\">Celebs Go Dating</a></em>. By 2019, he had become a well-known personality who was happily married with two young daughters. Yet fear and panic possessed him. \u201cI had all the markers of a successful person,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was having suicidal thoughts.\u201d He adds quickly that he didn\u2019t attempt to act on them. Instead, on his agent\u2019s recommendation, he underwent six months of intense sessions with a therapist. Then Covid hit, forcing him to stop and reflect on \u201cwhat was basically a low-level anxiety disorder, poverty mindset and impostor syndrome\u201d.</p> <p>Despite our grand surroundings today \u2013 art-deco features, plush banquette seating \u2013 Beckett is warm and unpretentious. He speaks openly and quickly in chipper estuary English about this challenging period, delivering his theory that \u201call comedians are broken\u2026 there\u2019s got to be something wrong that drives us to achieve\u201d with the same dynamism as the story \u2013 or lack of \u2013 behind the title of his forthcoming tour, <a href=\"https://robbeckettcomedy.com/\">Giraffe</a>. (The tour\u2019s artwork features Beckett\u2019s head attached to an artificially elongated mammalian neck against a yellow background. In a full-body version of the same image he also has hooves, at the request of his children.) \u201cI thought it\u2019d be funny,\u201d he says of him as a giraffe.<strong> </strong>Of the tour, he continues:<strong> \u201c</strong>You\u2019ll come to the show, laugh, then leave. There\u2019s no big message.\u201d</p>    <p>Beckett\u2019s standup routine is packed with jokes drawn from everyday minutiae: driving, ageing parents, puberty. \u201cI don\u2019t get how comics write about these mad hot topics. I write whatever makes me laugh, basically.\u201d It\u2019s clear he\u2019s grappled with the heady mix of heightened ego and low self-esteem that often befalls his peers. \u201cComedians aren\u2019t as important or influential as we like to think. We\u2019re a Chinese takeaway, a pint at the pub, a distraction from life.\u201d</p> <p>For Beckett, the stakes for this tour feel lower than his last, in 2021. Back then he \u201cworried about it going wrong, because of catastrophic thinking\u201d. His entire wellbeing was dependent on whether he felt funny enough \u2013 he constantly compared his act to others. \u201cI\u2019d either be king of the world or a piece of shit. My head would go: \u2018Kevin Bridges is better than that.\u2019\u201d With his therapist, he developed coping strategies inspired by <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/authors/?filter.custom_authors=Tolle,+Eckhart\">Echkart Tolle</a>, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/authors/?filter.custom_authors=Watts,+Alan\">Alan Watts</a> and the teachings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/22/stoicism-book-news-brigid-delaney\">stoicism</a>. Now, he has a calm, unencumbered approach to work. \u201cI\u2019m a funny person with funny jokes. I\u2019ll go out there, tell them and not try to control the outcome.\u201d His priority lies in arriving at each show \u201chappy and healthy, just trying my best\u201d and separating himself from the audience\u2019s reaction. \u201cIf it goes brilliantly, it\u2019s not because <em>I\u2019m</em> amazing, it\u2019s just that particular gig went well.\u201d</p> <p>When we speak, he\u2019s in the middle of a string of modest \u201cwork-in-progress\u201d shows to practise new material. The previous night he performed in a small coastal town to a crowd that was older than he\u2019s used to. He takes out his phone and, chuckling, shows me a short clip of the front row, which is mainly pensioners. \u201cThey were lovely, but I\u2019ve got a routine about getting pubes late and a lady said \u2018<em>DisGUSting</em>\u2019 out loud, which really made me laugh.\u201d A comment like that might previously have ruined his evening, but now he\u2019s determined to embrace each and every moment: \u201cIf it\u2019s awkward, enjoy the awkwardness!\u201d Working towards letting go, he reckons, has improved the show, \u201cbecause there\u2019s this relaxed person that\u2019s enjoying themselves, rather than someone thinking, \u2018If I\u2019m not funny I\u2019m going to lose everything.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was told I was thick and that I wasn\u2019t trying, but I was trying 10 times harder than the others in the class</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For most comedians, rehearsal usually involves meticulous memorising, but Beckett\u2019s method is intentionally laissez-faire. \u201cI\u2019ve never been one for a big story-arc. My idea of the perfect gig is that I\u2019ve prepared my jokes, but I go on and don\u2019t need any of it. It\u2019s almost impossible to do that for 90 minutes, but the ultimate dream is going on with something entirely new.\u201d Connection with his audience is more important than a pitch-perfect monologue. \u201cI pick and choose when it\u2019s appropriate to include a routine. I like the freedom of it feeling like a laugh with your friends.\u201d</p> <p>From his backpack he pulls out a plastic folder containing a notepad page covered in short bullet points of indecipherable writing. It looks like someone\u2019s shopping list, or a doctor\u2019s prescription pad. I\u2019m unnerved to learn that this is the sum total of his tour notes. Noticing my alarm, he explains that, for him, writing it all down is pointless.</p> <p>On a recent episode of <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1Zuurv8AZFWti60lSXiDgz\">Parenting Hell</a></em>, the hit podcast he presents with Josh Widdicombe that explores \u201cthe trials and tribulations of modern-day parenting\u201d, Beckett spoke about his late diagnosis of dyslexia. The signs were always there, he says, but he was compelled to see a private consultant after realising he was hindering, not helping, his daughter with her homework. In his retelling, the three-hour assessment over video call, with a woman who reminded him of a teacher, was mentally and emotionally taxing. Memories of his exhausting, bewildering school-years flooded back: he became sweaty, agitated \u2013 then burst into tears. His reasoning for this refers back to an <a href=\"https://eckharttolle.com/the-painbody-endure-it-or-walk-away-2/\">Eckhart Tolle concept</a> that we carry emotional pain in our physical body. On the podcast episode, he explained to Widdicombe that being asked questions about his past opened a \u201cpain-body memory I hadn\u2019t accessed, that I had chosen to stay away from\u201d. During the conversation he disclosed an almost total absence of short-term memory when writing down sequences of numbers and letters and that he has to visualise where he\u2019s last seen a word to know how it\u2019s spelled. The assessor confirmed the diagnosis \u2013 and he broke down once more.</p>    <p>Beckett\u2019s recounting to Widdicombe is up-tempo and without self-pity. Still, listening to his revelation that the education system isn\u2019t designed for children like him is incredibly touching. \u201cI was told I was thick and that I wasn\u2019t trying, but I was trying 10 times harder than the others in the class,\u201d he says now. (Because he has naturally funny bones, you can\u2019t help but laugh along with the duo when Beckett likens his convulsing sobs to \u201ctaking ayahuasca\u201d.) The whole exchange typifies the podcast, which consistently rides high in the listening charts and has spawned a <em>Sunday Times</em> bestseller <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/parenting-hell-9781788707473/\">book</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.offthekerb.com/news/extra-dates-in-nottingham-cardiff-and-london-added-to-parenting-hell-live-tour/\">nationwide arena tour</a>. The pair excel at exploring the sublime to the ridiculous aspects of parenting: the school run, eating habits, existential despair when the car keys are accidentally microwaved (Beckett); your two small children insist on sleeping in your bedroom (Widdicombe). It\u2019s poignant and tender, consistently joyful.</p> <p>In Beckett\u2019s memoir, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-class-act-9780008468217/\">A Class Act</a></em>, he recalls his mum and dad once being told by his teacher that he would never be a high achiever. Beckett was four at the time. Why wasn\u2019t his dyslexia picked up sooner? \u201cMy brother got diagnosed when he was young, because of more obvious problems with his spelling and reading,\u201d he says, \u201cbut because my main issue is retaining information it was harder to spot.\u201d Like other members of his family, his dad, \u201cSuper Dave\u201d, who \u201cleft school at 13 with cane marks on his arse to drive a van\u201d, is undiagnosed but almost definitely has dyslexia, too.</p> <p>A charming story in Beckett\u2019s memoir describes his mum buying Dave (who worked as a cabbie at the time) his first book \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-secret-diary-of-adrian-mole-aged-13-3-4-9780241615300/\">The Secret Diar</a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-secret-diary-of-adrian-mole-aged-13-3-4-9780241615300/\">y of Adrian Mole, Aged 13</a></em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-secret-diary-of-adrian-mole-aged-13-3-4-9780241615300/\">3/4</a> \u2013 at the age of 43. Because the chapters were short, he was able to read them in the taxi rank between fares; now, he reads all the time. The memoir, as the title suggests, explores \u201clife as a working-class man in a middle-class world\u201d. Did being working class contribute to them not being diagnosed? \u201cClass always boils down to money,\u201d Beckett says. \u201cSchool didn\u2019t pick it up and there just wasn\u2019t the opportunity, or the time, to go private.\u201d</p>    <p>In the years leading to his diagnosis, Beckett relied on his canniness and natural charisma. \u201cI worked out where I could bring value wherever I was. When I worked in an office, I couldn\u2019t really do the admin, but I was good with people, so I\u2019d focus on that. I created an entire life for myself where I didn\u2019t need the things that dyslexia makes harder for you.\u201d Since his diagnosis, he has a deeper understanding of himself. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of having Ikea furniture and someone giving you an allen key and instructions. Knowledge is power, essentially.\u201d</p> <p>He knows his needs at work (script meetings are necessary, but he finds reading through them in a group mentally draining) and that his strength lies in getting on with it on the studio floor. \u201cIf you said, \u2018Go and host a TV show\u2019 I\u2019d rather do it straight away, and I\u2019d probably be better for it. It\u2019s like being asked to do a handstand for half an hour then lift weights and you\u2019re like, \u2018My arms are gone!\u2019\u201d His scrappy tour notes, in this context, make perfect sense. \u201cMy ideas are in here,\u201d he says, pointing to his head, \u201cbut by the time I work out how to get my ideas down there\u2026\u201d he points to the page. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone.\u201d</p> <p>Beckett\u2019s latest tour is a mammoth one. Due to high demand, there are multiple consecutive dates in most of the theatres he\u2019s playing in. He could have opted for fewer shows in larger venues, but he wanted to give people a proper night out in a beautiful room. Affinity with his audience is a key factor. \u201cI can be there for two or three nights, really enjoy it and be present, as opposed to \u2018Right that\u2019s done, next one.\u2019\u201d Arenas, he says, can feel \u201clike a hamster wheel, so it\u2019ll be cathartic to go to these places in a measured way.\u201d</p> <p>The shows wrap up in 2026, then \u201cI\u2019d like to have a break and do a lot less. I\u2019m already tapering down, so Lou can do more.\u201d Lou is Beckett\u2019s wife,<strong> </strong>Louise Watts, a secondary-school history teacher who stepped back from her career to raise their daughters. She\u2019s known to the loyal listenership of <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HwLC2VpHznDBbRATVOQCx\">Parenting Hell</a></em> through Beckett\u2019s lighthearted yarns from their family life, as a popular guest on the podcast itself, and for contributing a chapter to their <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/parenting-hell-9781788707473/\">book</a> (she also has a <a href=\"https://louembeckett.co.uk/\">blog about motherhood</a>). Now the children are eight and six, she\u2019s gearing up for a return to the workforce. Could they be the next TV power-couple? Beckett is tight-lipped. \u201cWe\u2019ve had offers, but Lou\u2019s so talented I feel it\u2019s something she doesn\u2019t need me for. I\u2019m not ruling it out, but at the moment it\u2019s hard.\u201d He grins. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019d have to get a babysitter then! Also, I\u2019d quite like her to crack on so I can retire. I\u2019d be happy to do nothing except play video games.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to imagine Beckett doing less. By his own admission, \u201cI\u2019ve got 100 ideas at once. I got made redundant from office jobs so many times I always make sure I\u2019ve got other things on the go.\u201d He plans to stream himself playing a new gaming PC, and he\u2019d like to continue the podcast until Widdicombe\u2019s youngest child \u2013 who is now three \u2013 goes to university. \u201cThen we\u2019ll start it again when we\u2019ve got grandkids.\u201d Mainly, he wants to be present for himself and his family. \u201cIt sounds wanky, but I go to bed every night and ask myself, \u2018Did I enjoy today, yes or no?\u2019 If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019ll try to change the things I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t look beyond that, because you never know how it\u2019s going to work out. If you have too much of an idea of who you are and where you want to go, it limits you. At the moment, I\u2019m sort of floating along.\u201d</p> <p><em>Rob Beckett\u2019s tour, Giraffe, starts next month, for tickets and dates, see </em><em><a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/rob-beckett-tickets/artist/1948748\">ticketmaster.co.uk</a>; his podcast, Parenting Hell, is available wherever you get your podcasts.</em></p> <p><em>If you have been affected by any of the issues in this interview, please contact <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/\">mind.org.uk</a></em></p> <p><em>Fashion editor Helen Seamons; grooming by Olivia Davey using Bobbi bBrown and Chanel; fashion assistant Sam Deaman; shot at Lordship Park Locations</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Towards the end of 2019, the comedian Rob Beckett called his wife, and then his agent, to tell them he was struggling to cope. He had travelled to South Africa to film the second series of the Bafta award-winning show Rob &amp; Romesh Vs, which follows attempts by him and fellow funnyman Romesh Ranganathan to learn new skills. (Previous episodes include: modelling with David Gandy, country music with Shania Twain, boxing with Anthony Joshua.) This time they were playing cricket with Kevin Pietersen and going on safari. Beckett was aware of his privilege \u2013 that the trip should have been a breeze. But, as he tells me over lunch in a bustling, high-end London restaurant, he was heading towards burnout. \u201cThe job was basically a lads\u2019 trip, getting pissed with one of my best mates,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Well, if this doesn\u2019t make me happy\u2026\u2019\u201d Beckett, who is 38, had a happy, lively childhood in working-class southeast London. He lived with his parents and two of his four brothers, who mocked and teased each other relentlessly. (His mum, known as \u201cBig Suze\u201d, has jokingly described the family home as the House of No Compassion. \u201cI was called Jaffa Cake Nips because I had fat nipples through puberty,\u201d Beckett has said.) Money was tight and he found school extremely difficult, leaving education with a chronic lack of self-worth and little idea of what to do next. When comedy called, he launched himself into it, saying yes to every opportunity in case it was his last, repurposing his insecurity into ammunition. \u201cIt was a toxic fuel,\u201d he says. \u201cEffective, like chucking petrol on a bonfire, but unsustainable.\u201d He soon became a fixture on our screens: as presenter on the ITV2 spin-off show I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! Now!, as a team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats, a contestant on Taskmaster, the narrator on Celebs Go Dating. By 2019, he had become a well-known personality who was happily married with two young daughters. Yet fear and panic possessed him. \u201cI had all the markers of a successful person,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was having suicidal thoughts.\u201d He adds quickly that he didn\u2019t attempt to act on them. Instead, on his agent\u2019s recommendation, he underwent six months of intense sessions with a therapist. Then Covid hit, forcing him to stop and reflect on \u201cwhat was basically a low-level anxiety disorder, poverty mindset and impostor syndrome\u201d. Despite our grand surroundings today \u2013 art-deco features, plush banquette seating \u2013 Beckett is warm and unpretentious. He speaks openly and quickly in chipper estuary English about this challenging period, delivering his theory that \u201call comedians are broken\u2026 there\u2019s got to be something wrong that drives us to achieve\u201d with the same dynamism as the story \u2013 or lack of \u2013 behind the title of his forthcoming tour, Giraffe. (The tour\u2019s artwork features Beckett\u2019s head attached to an artificially elongated mammalian neck against a yellow background. In a full-body version of the same image he also has hooves, at the request of his children.) \u201cI thought it\u2019d be funny,\u201d he says of him as a giraffe. Of the tour, he continues: \u201cYou\u2019ll come to the show, laugh, then leave. There\u2019s no big message.\u201d Beckett\u2019s standup routine is packed with jokes drawn from everyday minutiae: driving, ageing parents, puberty. \u201cI don\u2019t get how comics write about these mad hot topics. I write whatever makes me laugh, basically.\u201d It\u2019s clear he\u2019s grappled with the heady mix of heightened ego and low self-esteem that often befalls his peers. \u201cComedians aren\u2019t as important or influential as we like to think. We\u2019re a Chinese takeaway, a pint at the pub, a distraction from life.\u201d For Beckett, the stakes for this tour feel lower than his last, in 2021. Back then he \u201cworried about it going wrong, because of catastrophic thinking\u201d. His entire wellbeing was dependent on whether he felt funny enough \u2013 he constantly compared his act to others. \u201cI\u2019d either be king of the world or a piece of shit. My head would go: \u2018Kevin Bridges is better than that.\u2019\u201d With his therapist, he developed coping strategies inspired by Echkart Tolle, Alan Watts and the teachings of stoicism. Now, he has a calm, unencumbered approach to work. \u201cI\u2019m a funny person with funny jokes. I\u2019ll go out there, tell them and not try to control the outcome.\u201d His priority lies in arriving at each show \u201chappy and healthy, just trying my best\u201d and separating himself from the audience\u2019s reaction. \u201cIf it goes brilliantly, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m amazing, it\u2019s just that particular gig went well.\u201d When we speak, he\u2019s in the middle of a string of modest \u201cwork-in-progress\u201d shows to practise new material. The previous night he performed in a small coastal town to a crowd that was older than he\u2019s used to. He takes out his phone and, chuckling, shows me a short clip of the front row, which is mainly pensioners. \u201cThey were lovely, but I\u2019ve got a routine about getting pubes late and a lady said \u2018DisGUSting\u2019 out loud, which really made me laugh.\u201d A comment like that might previously have ruined his evening, but now he\u2019s determined to embrace each and every moment: \u201cIf it\u2019s awkward, enjoy the awkwardness!\u201d Working towards letting go, he reckons, has improved the show, \u201cbecause there\u2019s this relaxed person that\u2019s enjoying themselves, rather than someone thinking, \u2018If I\u2019m not funny I\u2019m going to lose everything.\u2019\u201d For most comedians, rehearsal usually involves meticulous memorising, but Beckett\u2019s method is intentionally laissez-faire. \u201cI\u2019ve never been one for a big story-arc. My idea of the perfect gig is that I\u2019ve prepared my jokes, but I go on and don\u2019t need any of it. It\u2019s almost impossible to do that for 90 minutes, but the ultimate dream is going on with something entirely new.\u201d Connection with his audience is more important than a pitch-perfect monologue. \u201cI pick and choose when it\u2019s appropriate to include a routine. I like the freedom of it feeling like a laugh with your friends.\u201d From his backpack he pulls out a plastic folder containing a notepad page covered in short bullet points of indecipherable writing. It looks like someone\u2019s shopping list, or a doctor\u2019s prescription pad. I\u2019m unnerved to learn that this is the sum total of his tour notes. Noticing my alarm, he explains that, for him, writing it all down is pointless. On a recent episode of Parenting Hell, the hit podcast he presents with Josh Widdicombe that explores \u201cthe trials and tribulations of modern-day parenting\u201d, Beckett spoke about his late diagnosis of dyslexia. The signs were always there, he says, but he was compelled to see a private consultant after realising he was hindering, not helping, his daughter with her homework. In his retelling, the three-hour assessment over video call, with a woman who reminded him of a teacher, was mentally and emotionally taxing. Memories of his exhausting, bewildering school-years flooded back: he became sweaty, agitated \u2013 then burst into tears. His reasoning for this refers back to an Eckhart Tolle concept that we carry emotional pain in our physical body. On the podcast episode, he explained to Widdicombe that being asked questions about his past opened a \u201cpain-body memory I hadn\u2019t accessed, that I had chosen to stay away from\u201d. During the conversation he disclosed an almost total absence of short-term memory when writing down sequences of numbers and letters and that he has to visualise where he\u2019s last seen a word to know how it\u2019s spelled. The assessor confirmed the diagnosis \u2013 and he broke down once more. Beckett\u2019s recounting to Widdicombe is up-tempo and without self-pity. Still, listening to his revelation that the education system isn\u2019t designed for children like him is incredibly touching. \u201cI was told I was thick and that I wasn\u2019t trying, but I was trying 10 times harder than the others in the class,\u201d he says now. (Because he has naturally funny bones, you can\u2019t help but laugh along with the duo when Beckett likens his convulsing sobs to \u201ctaking ayahuasca\u201d.) The whole exchange typifies the podcast, which consistently rides high in the listening charts and has spawned a Sunday Times bestseller book and a nationwide arena tour. The pair excel at exploring the sublime to the ridiculous aspects of parenting: the school run, eating habits, existential despair when the car keys are accidentally microwaved (Beckett); your two small children insist on sleeping in your bedroom (Widdicombe). It\u2019s poignant and tender, consistently joyful. In Beckett\u2019s memoir, A Class Act, he recalls his mum and dad once being told by his teacher that he would never be a high achiever. Beckett was four at the time. Why wasn\u2019t his dyslexia picked up sooner? \u201cMy brother got diagnosed when he was young, because of more obvious problems with his spelling and reading,\u201d he says, \u201cbut because my main issue is retaining information it was harder to spot.\u201d Like other members of his family, his dad, \u201cSuper Dave\u201d, who \u201cleft school at 13 with cane marks on his arse to drive a van\u201d, is undiagnosed but almost definitely has dyslexia, too. A charming story in Beckett\u2019s memoir describes his mum buying Dave (who worked as a cabbie at the time) his first book \u2013 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 133/4 \u2013 at the age of 43. Because the chapters were short, he was able to read them in the taxi rank between fares; now, he reads all the time. The memoir, as the title suggests, explores \u201clife as a working-class man in a middle-class world\u201d. Did being working class contribute to them not being diagnosed? \u201cClass always boils down to money,\u201d Beckett says. \u201cSchool didn\u2019t pick it up and there just wasn\u2019t the opportunity, or the time, to go private.\u201d In the years leading to his diagnosis, Beckett relied on his canniness and natural charisma. \u201cI worked out where I could bring value wherever I was. When I worked in an office, I couldn\u2019t really do the admin, but I was good with people, so I\u2019d focus on that. I created an entire life for myself where I didn\u2019t need the things that dyslexia makes harder for you.\u201d Since his diagnosis, he has a deeper understanding of himself. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of having Ikea furniture and someone giving you an allen key and instructions. Knowledge is power, essentially.\u201d He knows his needs at work (script meetings are necessary, but he finds reading through them in a group mentally draining) and that his strength lies in getting on with it on the studio floor. \u201cIf you said, \u2018Go and host a TV show\u2019 I\u2019d rather do it straight away, and I\u2019d probably be better for it. It\u2019s like being asked to do a handstand for half an hour then lift weights and you\u2019re like, \u2018My arms are gone!\u2019\u201d His scrappy tour notes, in this context, make perfect sense. \u201cMy ideas are in here,\u201d he says, pointing to his head, \u201cbut by the time I work out how to get my ideas down there\u2026\u201d he points to the page. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone.\u201d Beckett\u2019s latest tour is a mammoth one. Due to high demand, there are multiple consecutive dates in most of the theatres he\u2019s playing in. He could have opted for fewer shows in larger venues, but he wanted to give people a proper night out in a beautiful room. Affinity with his audience is a key factor. \u201cI can be there for two or three nights, really enjoy it and be present, as opposed to \u2018Right that\u2019s done, next one.\u2019\u201d Arenas, he says, can feel \u201clike a hamster wheel, so it\u2019ll be cathartic to go to these places in a measured way.\u201d The shows wrap up in 2026, then \u201cI\u2019d like to have a break and do a lot less. I\u2019m already tapering down, so Lou can do more.\u201d Lou is Beckett\u2019s wife, Louise Watts, a secondary-school history teacher who stepped back from her career to raise their daughters. She\u2019s known to the loyal listenership of Parenting Hell through Beckett\u2019s lighthearted yarns from their family life, as a popular guest on the podcast itself, and for contributing a chapter to their book (she also has a blog about motherhood). Now the children are eight and six, she\u2019s gearing up for a return to the workforce. Could they be the next TV power-couple? Beckett is tight-lipped. \u201cWe\u2019ve had offers, but Lou\u2019s so talented I feel it\u2019s something she doesn\u2019t need me for. I\u2019m not ruling it out, but at the moment it\u2019s hard.\u201d He grins. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019d have to get a babysitter then! Also, I\u2019d quite like her to crack on so I can retire. I\u2019d be happy to do nothing except play video games.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to imagine Beckett doing less. By his own admission, \u201cI\u2019ve got 100 ideas at once. I got made redundant from office jobs so many times I always make sure I\u2019ve got other things on the go.\u201d He plans to stream himself playing a new gaming PC, and he\u2019d like to continue the podcast until Widdicombe\u2019s youngest child \u2013 who is now three \u2013 goes to university. \u201cThen we\u2019ll start it again when we\u2019ve got grandkids.\u201d Mainly, he wants to be present for himself and his family. \u201cIt sounds wanky, but I go to bed every night and ask myself, \u2018Did I enjoy today, yes or no?\u2019 If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019ll try to change the things I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t look beyond that, because you never know how it\u2019s going to work out. If you have too much of an idea of who you are and where you want to go, it limits you. At the moment, I\u2019m sort of floating along.\u201d Rob Beckett\u2019s tour, Giraffe, starts next month, for tickets and dates, see ticketmaster.co.uk; his podcast, Parenting Hell, is available wherever you get your podcasts.

It\u2019s easy to see the landscape of his upbringing in <em>Edward Scissorhands</em>, set in a settlement of houses painted in sugary colours borrowed from the popular American candy Necco wafers and its residents\u2019 cars and clothes matching hues, with which the shadowy, monochrome ruin inhabited by the eponymous hero could not be a greater contrast.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>His drawings show an enduring fascination with oversized body parts \u2013 eyes, mouths, heads, breasts </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s now a familiar enough story, this unearthing of dark otherworlds behind the sunny facades of suburbia (see also David Lynch, Stephen King), but Burton lived it more fully than most.

He planned to \u201copen up\u201d the libel laws, so that \u201cwhen they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money\u201d.</p> \n<p>As with many of Trump\u2019s threats, that one didn\u2019t come to fruition. More than eight years later, the law still stands that public figures can only win a lawsuit against a news outlet if it can be proved that the outlet published information knowing it was entirely false or had a \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the truth. The 1964 supreme court case, New York Times Co v Sullivan<em>, </em>which established this press-protecting precedent, hasn\u2019t been overturned.</p> \n<p>But a lot <em>has</em> changed since 2016 \u2013 including the increasingly conservative bent of the US supreme court after three Trump appointees. If Trump is elected in November, the laws that protect news organizations might crumble or be weakened.</p> \n<p>And while Trump did not get his wish about changing the libel laws, he nevertheless has done a great deal to damage press rights in America.</p> \n<p>As president for four years \u2013 and as a candidate both before and after that term \u2013 Trump has continually waged war with the mainstream press while he used the rightwing press for his political purposes.</p> \n<p>As recently as this month, Trump demanded that CBS News be stripped of its broadcast licence as punishment for airing an edited answer of an interview with his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris and he threatened that other broadcasters ought to suffer the same fate.</p> \n<p>For years, he<strong> </strong>stirred up hatred of reporters by calling them the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d \u2013 an echo of the language of fascist dictators. He frequently referred to legitimate journalism as \u201cfake news\u201d, and publicly insulted individual reporters.</p> \n<p>Famously, in 2018, the Trump White House revoked a CNN reporter\u2019s press pass as retaliation for persistent questions at a press conference. Trump called that reporter, Jim Acosta, a \u201cterrible person\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve never seen since I started covering the White House in 1996,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/blogs/on-media/2018/11/white-house-pulls-pass-from-cnn-reporter-jim-acosta-sarah-huckabee-sanders-trump-spat/\">wrote</a> the New York Times correspondent Peter Baker. \u201cOther presidents did not fear tough questioning.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump made a point of disparaging reporters, particularly women of color, and of questioning their intelligence or integrity.</p> \n<p>Over the course of one week in late 2018, he berated three Black women reporters \u2013 Yamiche Alcindor of PBS, April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks and Abby Phillip of CNN.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou talk about someone who\u2019s a loser,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-a-stupid-question-trump-demeans-three-black-female-reporters-in-two-days/2018/11/09/272113d0-e441-11e8-b759-3d88a5ce9e19_story.html\">said</a> of Ryan. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s enmity took many forms, including lawsuits. In 2022, he sued the Pulitzer prize board after they defended their awards to the New York Times and the Washington Post. Both newspapers had won Pulitzer prizes for investigating Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/us-elections-2024/stakes-carousel\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>More recently, Trump sued ABC News and George Stephanopoulos for defamation over the way the anchor characterized the verdict in E Jean Carroll\u2019s sexual misconduct case against him. Each of those cases is wending its way through the courts.</p> \n<p>There is nothing to suggest that Trump would soften his approach in a second term. If anything, we can expect even more aggression.</p> \n<p>Consider what one of Trump\u2019s most loyal lieutenants, Kash Patel, has said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\u201d Patel <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/us/politics/trump-kash-patel-journalists.html\">threatened</a> during a podcast with Steve Bannon. \u201cWhether it\u2019s criminally or civilly, we\u2019ll figure that out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Patel, a former federal prosecutor who was Trump\u2019s counterterrorism adviser on the national security council, has been mentioned as Trump\u2019s pick for FBI director or attorney general.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s this kind of rhetoric, combined with Trump\u2019s past behavior, that caused one Washington-based science writer to express his concerns in a <a href=\"https://www.sej.org/publications/watchdog/will-journalism-be-crime-second-trump-administration\">piece</a> titled \u201cWill Journalism Be a Crime in a Second Trump Administration?\u201d</p> \n<p>Environmental journalists \u201care used to worrying about things that are endangered\u201d, wrote Joseph A Davis in the journal of the Society of Environmental Journalists.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo we think it\u2019s time to add press freedom and democracy to the endangered list.\u201d</p> \n<p>In addition, consider Project 2025. The blueprint for a second term from Trump\u2019s allies is a press-rights nightmare.</p> \n<p>Under Project 2025, seizing journalists\u2019 emails and phone records would get easier. The editorial independence of Voice of America would be sharply curtailed; in fact, the global organization might be shut down altogether. Former officials who talk to reporters would be punished. Funding for NPR, PBS and public broadcasting would dry up.</p> \n<p>\u201cA pretty grim picture,\u201d was the <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/09/what-would-project-2025-do-for-or-to-journalism/\">conclusion</a> of Joshua Benton of Harvard University after analyzing Project 2025 from the perspective of press rights.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe first time around, there was at least a <em>modicum</em> of uncertainty about what a Trump administration would actually do,\u201d Benton wrote in Nieman Lab. \u201cThe second time, voters knew better, and they rejected it. The third time? Well, no one can say it\u2019ll come as a surprise.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for Kamala Harris\u2019s attitude toward press rights, we don\u2019t know a great deal, except that she\u2019s doing things in the normal, pre-Trump way.</p> \n<p>Her web site\u2019s policy section trumpets her defense of \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d, stressing reproductive rights and voting rights, but not freedom of the press.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://cpj.org/thematic-reports/on-edge-what-the-us-election-could-mean-for-journalists-and-global-press-freedom/\">new report</a> on press freedom and the election<a href=\"https://cpj.org/thematic-reports/on-edge-what-the-us-election-could-mean-for-journalists-and-global-press-freedom/\">,</a> the Committee to Protect Journalists reports that neither presidential candidate responded to their request to pledge clear support for press freedom.</p> \n<p>The CPJ report found that Trump\u2019s antipathy for journalists has left lasting harm, from the local to the global level, harm that was not adequately repaired during the Biden years.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe hostile media climate fostered during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has continued to fester, with members of the press confronting challenges \u2013 including violence, lawsuits, online harassment, and police attacks \u2013 that could shape the global media environment for decades,\u201d according to the report.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe stakes of this election are incredibly high,\u201d the report\u2019s author, Katherine Jacobsen, told me.</p> \n<p>After Joe Biden passed Harris the torch over the summer, the vice-president came under fire for not quickly sitting down for an interview or doing a press conference.</p> \n<p>She promised to do an in-depth interview by the end of August \u2013 and met her self-imposed deadline.</p> \n<p>That first was with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, certainly a mainstream choice. Harris has since fielded questions from members of the National Association of Black Journalists at WHYY, the public radio station in Philadelphia. And she sat down in September to discuss her economic policy plans with MSNBC\u2019s Stephanie Ruhle.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s little to suggest that she\u2019ll try to portray the press as the enemy of the people or start prosecuting journalists under the Espionage Act. Such prosecution<em> did</em> happen under Trump. (It also did under Barack Obama, though that has been largely forgotten in the chaos of the last eight years.)</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s justice department seized the phone and email records of a New York Times reporter, Ali Watkins, and used the Espionage Act to jail a journalistic source, Reality Winner, for leaking a classified document about Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s affinity for autocratic leaders adds another layer of concern.</p> \n<p>Writing in the Washington Post, the publisher of the New York Times, AG Sulzberger, raised an alarm about whom Trump looks up to.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf Trump follows through on promises to continue [his anti-press] campaign in a second term,\u201d Sulzberger <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/05/sulzberger-free-press-new-york-times/\">wrote</a>, \u201chis efforts would likely be informed by his open admiration for the ruthlessly effective playbook of authoritarians,\u201d such as the Hungarian leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.</p> \n<p>Sulzberger, though, also wrote that he had no intention of allowing these concerns to affect his paper\u2019s straight-news coverage: \u201cI disagree with those who have suggested that the risk Trump poses to the free press is so high that news organizations such as mine should cast aside neutrality and directly oppose his reelection.\u201d In its opinion pages, however, the Times\u2019s editorial board has called Trump unfit to lead and strongly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/opinion/editorials/kamala-harris-2024.html\">endorsed</a> Harris, calling her \u201cthe only patriotic choice for president\u201d.</p> \n<p>It would be heartening to hear Kamala Harris publicly express her support for the essential role of the press in a free society, something to be protected and even celebrated.

      "bodyText": "Back in early 2016, as Donald Trump ran for president, he issued a warning that sent a chill down the spines of journalists and press advocates. After ranting about the New York Times and the Washington Post at a Texas campaign rally, Trump predicted that traditional news organizations would have big problems if he were elected. He planned to \u201copen up\u201d the libel laws, so that \u201cwhen they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money\u201d. As with many of Trump\u2019s threats, that one didn\u2019t come to fruition. More than eight years later, the law still stands that public figures can only win a lawsuit against a news outlet if it can be proved that the outlet published information knowing it was entirely false or had a \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the truth. The 1964 supreme court case, New York Times Co v Sullivan, which established this press-protecting precedent, hasn\u2019t been overturned. But a lot has changed since 2016 \u2013 including the increasingly conservative bent of the US supreme court after three Trump appointees. If Trump is elected in November, the laws that protect news organizations might crumble or be weakened. And while Trump did not get his wish about changing the libel laws, he nevertheless has done a great deal to damage press rights in America. As president for four years \u2013 and as a candidate both before and after that term \u2013 Trump has continually waged war with the mainstream press while he used the rightwing press for his political purposes. As recently as this month, Trump demanded that CBS News be stripped of its broadcast licence as punishment for airing an edited answer of an interview with his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris and he threatened that other broadcasters ought to suffer the same fate. For years, he stirred up hatred of reporters by calling them the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d \u2013 an echo of the language of fascist dictators. He frequently referred to legitimate journalism as \u201cfake news\u201d, and publicly insulted individual reporters. Famously, in 2018, the Trump White House revoked a CNN reporter\u2019s press pass as retaliation for persistent questions at a press conference. Trump called that reporter, Jim Acosta, a \u201cterrible person\u201d. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve never seen since I started covering the White House in 1996,\u201d wrote the New York Times correspondent Peter Baker. \u201cOther presidents did not fear tough questioning.\u201d Trump made a point of disparaging reporters, particularly women of color, and of questioning their intelligence or integrity. Over the course of one week in late 2018, he berated three Black women reporters \u2013 Yamiche Alcindor of PBS, April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks and Abby Phillip of CNN. \u201cYou talk about someone who\u2019s a loser,\u201d he said of Ryan. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing.\u201d Trump\u2019s enmity took many forms, including lawsuits. In 2022, he sued the Pulitzer prize board after they defended their awards to the New York Times and the Washington Post. Both newspapers had won Pulitzer prizes for investigating Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. More recently, Trump sued ABC News and George Stephanopoulos for defamation over the way the anchor characterized the verdict in E Jean Carroll\u2019s sexual misconduct case against him. Each of those cases is wending its way through the courts. There is nothing to suggest that Trump would soften his approach in a second term. If anything, we can expect even more aggression. Consider what one of Trump\u2019s most loyal lieutenants, Kash Patel, has said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\u201d Patel threatened during a podcast with Steve Bannon. \u201cWhether it\u2019s criminally or civilly, we\u2019ll figure that out.\u201d Patel, a former federal prosecutor who was Trump\u2019s counterterrorism adviser on the national security council, has been mentioned as Trump\u2019s pick for FBI director or attorney general. It\u2019s this kind of rhetoric, combined with Trump\u2019s past behavior, that caused one Washington-based science writer to express his concerns in a piece titled \u201cWill Journalism Be a Crime in a Second Trump Administration?\u201d Environmental journalists \u201care used to worrying about things that are endangered\u201d, wrote Joseph A Davis in the journal of the Society of Environmental Journalists. \u201cSo we think it\u2019s time to add press freedom and democracy to the endangered list.\u201d In addition, consider Project 2025. The blueprint for a second term from Trump\u2019s allies is a press-rights nightmare. Under Project 2025, seizing journalists\u2019 emails and phone records would get easier. The editorial independence of Voice of America would be sharply curtailed; in fact, the global organization might be shut down altogether. Former officials who talk to reporters would be punished. Funding for NPR, PBS and public broadcasting would dry up. \u201cA pretty grim picture,\u201d was the conclusion of Joshua Benton of Harvard University after analyzing Project 2025 from the perspective of press rights. \u201cThe first time around, there was at least a modicum of uncertainty about what a Trump administration would actually do,\u201d Benton wrote in Nieman Lab. \u201cThe second time, voters knew better, and they rejected it. The third time? Well, no one can say it\u2019ll come as a surprise.\u201d As for Kamala Harris\u2019s attitude toward press rights, we don\u2019t know a great deal, except that she\u2019s doing things in the normal, pre-Trump way. Her web site\u2019s policy section trumpets her defense of \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d, stressing reproductive rights and voting rights, but not freedom of the press. In a new report on press freedom and the election, the Committee to Protect Journalists reports that neither presidential candidate responded to their request to pledge clear support for press freedom. The CPJ report found that Trump\u2019s antipathy for journalists has left lasting harm, from the local to the global level, harm that was not adequately repaired during the Biden years. \u201cThe hostile media climate fostered during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has continued to fester, with members of the press confronting challenges \u2013 including violence, lawsuits, online harassment, and police attacks \u2013 that could shape the global media environment for decades,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe stakes of this election are incredibly high,\u201d the report\u2019s author, Katherine Jacobsen, told me. After Joe Biden passed Harris the torch over the summer, the vice-president came under fire for not quickly sitting down for an interview or doing a press conference. She promised to do an in-depth interview by the end of August \u2013 and met her self-imposed deadline. That first was with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, certainly a mainstream choice. Harris has since fielded questions from members of the National Association of Black Journalists at WHYY, the public radio station in Philadelphia. And she sat down in September to discuss her economic policy plans with MSNBC\u2019s Stephanie Ruhle. There\u2019s little to suggest that she\u2019ll try to portray the press as the enemy of the people or start prosecuting journalists under the Espionage Act. Such prosecution did happen under Trump. (It also did under Barack Obama, though that has been largely forgotten in the chaos of the last eight years.) Trump\u2019s justice department seized the phone and email records of a New York Times reporter, Ali Watkins, and used the Espionage Act to jail a journalistic source, Reality Winner, for leaking a classified document about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s affinity for autocratic leaders adds another layer of concern. Writing in the Washington Post, the publisher of the New York Times, AG Sulzberger, raised an alarm about whom Trump looks up to. \u201cIf Trump follows through on promises to continue [his anti-press] campaign in a second term,\u201d Sulzberger wrote, \u201chis efforts would likely be informed by his open admiration for the ruthlessly effective playbook of authoritarians,\u201d such as the Hungarian leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Sulzberger, though, also wrote that he had no intention of allowing these concerns to affect his paper\u2019s straight-news coverage: \u201cI disagree with those who have suggested that the risk Trump poses to the free press is so high that news organizations such as mine should cast aside neutrality and directly oppose his reelection.\u201d In its opinion pages, however, the Times\u2019s editorial board has called Trump unfit to lead and strongly endorsed Harris, calling her \u201cthe only patriotic choice for president\u201d. It would be heartening to hear Kamala Harris publicly express her support for the essential role of the press in a free society, something to be protected and even celebrated. That may never come to pass. Still, it\u2019s probably reasonable to assume Harris will treat the press as many Oval Office dwellers have in the past, as something of a burr under the presidential saddle. By contrast, Donald Trump poses a clear threat to journalists, to news organizations and to press freedom in the US and around the world. Trust in the media may be low, and American citizens may not be fans of journalists or their work. But they ought to know that just as longstanding reproductive rights have collapsed in recent years, press rights \u2013 already reeling \u2013 could suffer the same fate.

On a personal level, I think that to deny it, especially being a leader in the state of Florida, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s an appropriate position they have.\u201d Groenevelt will vote for Democratic candidates on 5 November. His middle daughter of three, Whitney, has just turned 18 and will be voting for the first time. \u201cWe have conversations, and there\u2019s definitely a concern when they\u2019re talking and thinking about their own futures, and what it\u2019ll be like, you know, is there going to be snow or no snow? Will it be too hot? Or too cold? These things come up,\u201d he said. D\u2019Onofrio said it would be younger voters, such as Groenevelt\u2019s daughters and the students he has been working with on campuses, who will drive a generational change in climate politics, which is why he said the work of groups such as Florida Future Leaders was so important. \u201cOne thing people always say is that youth voters don\u2019t turn out, but my answer is always it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve never felt seen, or heard, or talked to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s different now is because we are all youth talking to youth, we understand our generation, we know how to talk to them. You don\u2019t want an 80-year-old talking to a 20-year-old about climate change, or any issue. It just doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019re all 20-year-olds talking to 20-year-olds. We understand it, so it resonates.\u201d",

Though the move is driven by public health concerns, it has prompted fears that it would only boost a thriving black market for vapes in the hands of powerful organised crime groups, such as the Sinaloa cartel and Jalisco New Generation cartel. E-cigarettes and vapes are currently in a legal grey area, after previous bans on their import and sale were challenged in court. But including the ban in the constitution would be definitive. After its landslide victory in elections last June, Morena, the governing party, has a supermajority in congress that means it can rewrite the constitution at will. Roughly 1.7 million Mexicans use e-cigarettes and vapes, and the number is rising, with no sign that the attempts to ban them have reduced consumption. There are currently two markets for such products. Legal companies import more expensive vapes sold, for example, in convenience stores.

      "body": "<p>Fans of English rugby \u2013 the real ones who follow the Premiership \u2013 could be forgiven for outrage at the suspension of the domestic game for the next few weeks. Such have been the remarkable matches coming at us from all angles in the first six rounds of the season, any resentment at November\u2019s narrowing of focus on Twickenham, where tickets tend to be reserved for certain types, would be only natural.</p> <p>As exhilarating as it may be, domestic rugby pretty much everywhere, but certainly in England, does not wash its face financially. So, over to the international game to try to keep everything afloat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/23/henry-slade-england-new-zealand-exeter\">Henry Slade given chance to prove readiness for All Blacks showdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When we say Twickenham, we obviously mean the suburb of south-west London, not the stadium at its heart, because that has a new name, for the sake of revenue generation. We will not be calling this annual jamboree the Autumn Nations Series for very much longer either.</p> <p>From 2026, rugby\u2019s international windows in July and November will be given over to the Nations Championship. In two years\u2019 time, we will be talking about the finals series of the first iteration of the tournament, featuring the 10 Tier One nations plus two others, thought to be Japan and Fiji.</p> <p>That event will culminate in a final at the end of November 2026 at, if reports are to be believed, the stadium by any other name in Twickenham. There was talk of the first final being held in Qatar, which really would have maxed out on the revenue generation front, but it was felt that taking the money would be a little <em>de trop</em> for the first event, not to mention morally dubious given Qatar\u2019s human rights record. So they are going to do it in 2028 instead, with the third final, in 2030, slated for the United States. Who knows where their human rights record will be by then?</p> <p>But it is the rights of the players that continue to exercise anxious minds. The RFU is by far the most powerful union financially, more so after it sold the name of one of the most famous stadiums in the world, but it needs to be, with multiple caps in hand presented to it by rugby folk across the land and up and down the largest community pyramid in the world \u2013 and abuse hurled from seemingly all quarters as it fills them.</p> <p>It also remains the main backer of the Premiership clubs, some former players of which are now suing it for the life-changing conditions they believe they developed in the call of duty. It has also announced the first 17 players to be put on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/25/rugby-union-senior-england-players-concerns-workload-rfu\">enhanced contracts of \u00a3160,000 </a>to play for England, with a further eight available as part of the new PGP deal with Premier Rugby.</p> <p>No sooner had the contracts been announced than the players awarded them sounded the alarm over their welfare.

      "bodyText": "Fans of English rugby \u2013 the real ones who follow the Premiership \u2013 could be forgiven for outrage at the suspension of the domestic game for the next few weeks. Such have been the remarkable matches coming at us from all angles in the first six rounds of the season, any resentment at November\u2019s narrowing of focus on Twickenham, where tickets tend to be reserved for certain types, would be only natural. As exhilarating as it may be, domestic rugby pretty much everywhere, but certainly in England, does not wash its face financially. So, over to the international game to try to keep everything afloat. When we say Twickenham, we obviously mean the suburb of south-west London, not the stadium at its heart, because that has a new name, for the sake of revenue generation. We will not be calling this annual jamboree the Autumn Nations Series for very much longer either. From 2026, rugby\u2019s international windows in July and November will be given over to the Nations Championship. In two years\u2019 time, we will be talking about the finals series of the first iteration of the tournament, featuring the 10 Tier One nations plus two others, thought to be Japan and Fiji. That event will culminate in a final at the end of November 2026 at, if reports are to be believed, the stadium by any other name in Twickenham. There was talk of the first final being held in Qatar, which really would have maxed out on the revenue generation front, but it was felt that taking the money would be a little de trop for the first event, not to mention morally dubious given Qatar\u2019s human rights record. So they are going to do it in 2028 instead, with the third final, in 2030, slated for the United States. Who knows where their human rights record will be by then? But it is the rights of the players that continue to exercise anxious minds. The RFU is by far the most powerful union financially, more so after it sold the name of one of the most famous stadiums in the world, but it needs to be, with multiple caps in hand presented to it by rugby folk across the land and up and down the largest community pyramid in the world \u2013 and abuse hurled from seemingly all quarters as it fills them. It also remains the main backer of the Premiership clubs, some former players of which are now suing it for the life-changing conditions they believe they developed in the call of duty. It has also announced the first 17 players to be put on enhanced contracts of \u00a3160,000 to play for England, with a further eight available as part of the new PGP deal with Premier Rugby. No sooner had the contracts been announced than the players awarded them sounded the alarm over their welfare. They have a point, too. Whoever ends up financing the Nations Cup, they will want their pound of flesh. The quadrennial World Cup, which is World Rugby\u2019s only meaningful source of revenue, will now in effect be staged in three years out of four, massively diminishing the prestige of the main event as well as the players\u2019 ability to rise to the multiple occasions. In those years when there is not a World Cup or Nations Championship, there will be a British &amp; Irish Lions tour, probably the greatest menace to player welfare of them all. So we should savour the quaint Autumn International series while we can. This year\u2019s kicks off when the All Blacks come calling on England at You Know Where on Saturday, with Scotland hosting Fiji later the same afternoon. Thereafter, we are in full flow, with all the big dogs from either side of the world playing each other, as well as Japan, who lost 64-19 to the All Blacks on Saturday in Yokohama, and Fiji. A dress rehearsal for 2026, you might say. Until very recently, the prospect of watching England represented as diametrically opposite an experience to watching the Premiership as it is possible to imagine. But something happened midway through the Six Nations, as if Steve Borthwick suddenly found his feet as head coach or the penny dropped with the players of how to unleash the sheer derring-do of their club game in the international arena. A swaggering home win over the champions, Ireland, was followed by an epic in Lyon on the final weekend, albeit in defeat. Continuation of such form should mitigate any yearnings for Premiership fare next month. If the new England can open by beating New Zealand in an engaging anner, succeeding where they so narrowly failed against the All Blacks in the summer, November need not seem so bleak. Then it will be back to trying to make everything add up for an increasingly desperate sport.",

Kerridge is now speaking out, along with thousands of local charities who have signed an open letter to chancellor Rachel Reeves, asking for the scheme to be backed in this week\u2019s budget.</p> <p>The Michelin-starred chef, who grew up on a Gloucester council estate, cooking for his brother while his mother, Jackie, did two jobs, said the programme would reduce waste and provide much-needed food for those who are struggling.</p> <p>\u201cThese charities are the beating heart of their communities, and they need more food to help support people in need,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to intervene and ensure that the staggering levels of good-to-eat surplus food is turned into meals for struggling families, rather than letting this food go to waste.\u201d</p> <p>Farmers are known to be keen to redistribute food where they can, but charities say the fund is needed to help cover their costs, as providing goods for redistribution is more expensive than dumping it or using it as feed or fuel. In the letter to Reeves, the charities say that food redirected by the scheme could provide up to 67m meals and be redistributed to thousands of community groups.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/08/the-scandal-of-food-waste-and-how-we-can-stop-it\">The scandal of food waste \u2013 and how we can stop it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>FareShare, one of the largest food redistribution organisations, is heavily involved. It provides surplus food to after-school and breakfast clubs, homelessness shelters and older people\u2019s lunch clubs.</p> <p>\u201cThe food redistribution sector helps transform surplus food into stronger communities,\u201d said Kris Gibbon-Walsh, chief executive of FareShare. \u201cThese local charities turn food that would otherwise go to waste into meals, providing a gateway to other essential services that support people in need. This fund is an incredible opportunity to rescue millions of tonnes of fresh produce from our farms, and help tackle the environmental problem of food waste for social good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDespite the announcement in February, the fund is in limbo while we wait for the Treasury to commit to this funding.

      "bodyText": "Chef Tom Kerridge is teaming up with charities to demand delivery of a promised \u00a315m fund to divert fresh but unused food from farms to food banks and soup kitchens across the country. Repeated promises have been made by former ministers to fund the food waste reduction scheme, which effectively compensates farmers for harvesting, storing and packaging the food that would otherwise head into landfill or animal feed. The pledge was first made by Michael Gove as environment secretary in 2018 and later reannounced by Rishi Sunak earlier this year, but the funds have never arrived. Kerridge is now speaking out, along with thousands of local charities who have signed an open letter to chancellor Rachel Reeves, asking for the scheme to be backed in this week\u2019s budget. The Michelin-starred chef, who grew up on a Gloucester council estate, cooking for his brother while his mother, Jackie, did two jobs, said the programme would reduce waste and provide much-needed food for those who are struggling. \u201cThese charities are the beating heart of their communities, and they need more food to help support people in need,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to intervene and ensure that the staggering levels of good-to-eat surplus food is turned into meals for struggling families, rather than letting this food go to waste.\u201d Farmers are known to be keen to redistribute food where they can, but charities say the fund is needed to help cover their costs, as providing goods for redistribution is more expensive than dumping it or using it as feed or fuel. In the letter to Reeves, the charities say that food redirected by the scheme could provide up to 67m meals and be redistributed to thousands of community groups. FareShare, one of the largest food redistribution organisations, is heavily involved. It provides surplus food to after-school and breakfast clubs, homelessness shelters and older people\u2019s lunch clubs. \u201cThe food redistribution sector helps transform surplus food into stronger communities,\u201d said Kris Gibbon-Walsh, chief executive of FareShare. \u201cThese local charities turn food that would otherwise go to waste into meals, providing a gateway to other essential services that support people in need. This fund is an incredible opportunity to rescue millions of tonnes of fresh produce from our farms, and help tackle the environmental problem of food waste for social good.\u201d \u201cDespite the announcement in February, the fund is in limbo while we wait for the Treasury to commit to this funding. But the frontline charities we support cannot afford to wait. The prime minister has said he wants to build a \u2018society of service\u2019, and Defra wants to prioritise a zero-waste economy \u2013 this fund is a great first step. We are ready to work with the government alongside the food redistribution sector to make these ambitions a reality.\u201d Charlotte Hill, who runs The Felix Project multibank in London, said it was \u201ca scandal\u201d that fresh British food was going to waste, despite the large number of families suffering from food insecurity. \u201cThe Felix Project recently found that 56% of working London families are having to turn to a food bank to help feed their children.\u201d she said. \u201c These places are struggling with the huge demand for support and urgently need more food.

      "body": "<p>Take four ballets, two made by female choreographers and two by Black male choreographers; add two conductors, one male, one female, and four living composers, including a woman who plays strings for Brian Eno. Sometimes a recipe that looks enticing on paper fulfils its promise \u2013 and <strong><a href=\"https://www.rbo.org.uk/tickets-and-events/encounters-four-contemporary-ballets-details\">Encounters</a></strong>, which has all of these ingredients, makes for a tangy, thrilling evening of dance.</p> <p>Different viewpoints offer different feelings, different thought patterns. The sensation of the night was <em>Or Forevermore</em> by the American Pam Tanowitz, which brought a cheeky wit and virtuosic cleverness to steps that matched the blasting brass and sudden shocks of Ted Hearne\u2019s bracing score.</p> <p>An extension of her <em>Dispatch Duet</em> (2022) for Anna Rose O\u2019Sullivan and William Bracewell, it begins with those dancers in velour tracksuits made to match the Royal Opera House stage curtains, but with PT embossed in gold on the back rather than ER. That irreverent humour persists throughout a work that takes the sophistication of classical dance and constantly subverts it.</p> <p>It\u2019s full of fun \u2013 a boy bouncing high in a sequence of jumps behind a chorus line of dancers in brightly coloured, two-tone leotards; a disembodied hand appearing from the wings to offer support in an arabesque; a line of women perched prettily on the backs of men on all fours, like so many footstools.

      "bodyText": "Take four ballets, two made by female choreographers and two by Black male choreographers; add two conductors, one male, one female, and four living composers, including a woman who plays strings for Brian Eno. Sometimes a recipe that looks enticing on paper fulfils its promise \u2013 and Encounters, which has all of these ingredients, makes for a tangy, thrilling evening of dance. Different viewpoints offer different feelings, different thought patterns. The sensation of the night was Or Forevermore by the American Pam Tanowitz, which brought a cheeky wit and virtuosic cleverness to steps that matched the blasting brass and sudden shocks of Ted Hearne\u2019s bracing score. An extension of her Dispatch Duet (2022) for Anna Rose O\u2019Sullivan and William Bracewell, it begins with those dancers in velour tracksuits made to match the Royal Opera House stage curtains, but with PT embossed in gold on the back rather than ER. That irreverent humour persists throughout a work that takes the sophistication of classical dance and constantly subverts it. It\u2019s full of fun \u2013 a boy bouncing high in a sequence of jumps behind a chorus line of dancers in brightly coloured, two-tone leotards; a disembodied hand appearing from the wings to offer support in an arabesque; a line of women perched prettily on the backs of men on all fours, like so many footstools. But it\u2019s also shot through with moments of beauty, particularly in the sections where Bracewell and O\u2019Sullivan catch and entice each other in steps of extended shape and sharp speed, somehow suggesting mysteries amid its playful, gorgeous boldness. It makes Joseph Toonga\u2019s Dusk, the other new work on the programme, look positively polite in comparison, yet this is the most interesting incarnation so far of his experiments in mixing his own hip-hop vocabulary with classical technique, as two men and five women suggest gentle, familial emotion in choreography that contrasts powerful, torquing arms with graceful feet.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I have questions,\u2019 my son says, as I pick him up from school. He\u2019s just been on the receiving end of a light scolding from me, because of an email I got from his school. \u2018This is to let you know,\u2019 they wrote, \u2018that although you have consented for your child to receive the flu nasal spray vaccination, they did not receive it.\u2019</p> <p>For a few seconds, I entertained the idea that they\u2019d simply run out of vaccines. Or maybe he had been in the bathroom while they were being doled out. I pictured, briefly, these doses being administered by a team of nurses who had another, more pressing, engagement scheduled three minutes later, and thus jabbed the nostrils of everyone in the class in 90 seconds, with the buzzing alacrity of a Formula One pit crew.</p> <p>Sadly, such hopes were dashed by a pleasant phone call to the school\u2019s office, moments later. \u2018It\u2019s OK,\u2019 they told me brightly, \u2018it\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t want to do it, so he refused.\u2019</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My entire childhood was, I now realise, spent constantly doing things I didn\u2019t want to do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I must admit I was unaware that this was something you could do. As a six-year-old, the idea of refusing to do anything was alien to me. My entire childhood was, I now realise, spent constantly doing things I didn\u2019t want to do, simply because grownups told me. My son has no such overweening sense of adult authority. Where once I was the font of all knowledge, he now considers asking me a question little more than a polite act of preliminary inquiry, before he seeks the actual truth by asking the very same question of the Alexa in our kitchen. He is, in a sense, the platonic idea of a questioning child, a boy who does his own research.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I have questions,\u2019 my son says, as I pick him up from school. He\u2019s just been on the receiving end of a light scolding from me, because of an email I got from his school. \u2018This is to let you know,\u2019 they wrote, \u2018that although you have consented for your child to receive the flu nasal spray vaccination, they did not receive it.\u2019 For a few seconds, I entertained the idea that they\u2019d simply run out of vaccines. Or maybe he had been in the bathroom while they were being doled out. I pictured, briefly, these doses being administered by a team of nurses who had another, more pressing, engagement scheduled three minutes later, and thus jabbed the nostrils of everyone in the class in 90 seconds, with the buzzing alacrity of a Formula One pit crew. Sadly, such hopes were dashed by a pleasant phone call to the school\u2019s office, moments later. \u2018It\u2019s OK,\u2019 they told me brightly, \u2018it\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t want to do it, so he refused.\u2019 I must admit I was unaware that this was something you could do. As a six-year-old, the idea of refusing to do anything was alien to me. My entire childhood was, I now realise, spent constantly doing things I didn\u2019t want to do, simply because grownups told me. My son has no such overweening sense of adult authority. Where once I was the font of all knowledge, he now considers asking me a question little more than a polite act of preliminary inquiry, before he seeks the actual truth by asking the very same question of the Alexa in our kitchen. He is, in a sense, the platonic idea of a questioning child, a boy who does his own research. In some sense, I admire this independence of nature, I just wish it wasn\u2019t on a topic that might make his teachers think I\u2019m feeding him a nonstop diet of Infowars at home. \u2018If I\u2019m not sick, why do I need it?\u2019 he asks me on the walk home, and I try to explain both cause and effect, and the linear nature of time, to a six-year-old who\u2019s becoming more conspiratorial by the second.

Springsteen\u2019s vocalist wife, Patti Scialfa, talks about her 2018 multiple myeloma diagnosis, but she\u2019s very no drama and matter-of-fact. Elsewhere, Springsteen seems wreathed in grief for bandmates and other lost loved ones. It\u2019s all so sincere and devoid of celebrity noise, it becomes touching. This is a no-frills tour doc made for the fans \u2013 and they will love it.

Married at First Sight UK (E4) I go this low so that you don\u2019t have to.

      "body": "<p>Brown\u2019s Town, in the Jamaican parish of St Ann \u2013 where as a child, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> spent many holidays with her family \u2013 has the unmistakable atmosphere of a close-knit rural Caribbean community.</p> <p>Narrow roads, cocooned by bowing trees and lush vegetation, wind past concrete houses and the rolling hills of the Dry Harbour mountain range.</p> <p>It gets busier in the town itself, where vehicles toot their horns as they manoeuvre past colourfully painted shops and the local market that a young Kamala used to visit with her parents.</p> <p>The town of 6,000 inhabitants is named after an Irish enslaver, Hamilton Brown, who is believed to have been an ancestor of Harris\u2019s paternal great-grandmother Christiana Brown, known in the family as Miss Chrishy.</p> <p>Heading out of the market area, the road arrives at the Harris family estate in Orange Hill, where Harris\u2019s 86-year-old father, the distinguished economist Donald Harris, was born in 1938.</p> <p>The estate now has a quarry and some family homes. But it was once a place of adventure and delight for Harris, recalled her first cousin Sherman Harris, as he pointed to the areas where they used to play together.</p> <p>Only a few days younger than the vice-president, Sherman remembers the Christmas holidays Harris and her younger sister, Maya, spent with their family in the Caribbean.</p> <p>\u201cMaya was a little quiet, but Kamala was like a tomboy, running, jumping and leaping around the mountain areas. Miss Chrishy had to call her and tell her to \u2018get inside now, it\u2019s dinner time \u2013 come and stop the jumping over those places\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd she would just do it for the better because her father encouraged her,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Even as a child, Sherman said, Kamala asked questions that belied her age and demonstrated \u201ca deep level of intelligence and a mindset far above what we were accustomed to as little kids\u201d.</p> <p>When she could not get answers from her peers, she would turn to her dad, he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/kamala-harris-speech-transcript.html\">Harris has spoken fondly</a> about her parents \u2013 Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, a biomedical scientist who was born and grew up in India \u2013 describing \u201ca home filled with laughter and music: Aretha, Coltrane and Miles\u201d.</p> <p>She paid tribute to her father for believing in her, saying: \u201cAt the park, my mother would say: \u2018Stay close.\u2019 But my father would say, as he smiled: \u2018Run, Kamala, run. Don\u2019t be afraid. Don\u2019t let anything stop you.\u2019 From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/kamala-harris-father.html\">New York Times</a> reported this month that relations between father and daughter grew strained after her parents\u2019 divorce in 1972. The relationship worsened over the years, according to the article, which claimed that Harris had been upset when her father did not attend Gopalan\u2019s funeral in 2009.</p> <p>Sherman dismissed the reported rift as \u201ctotal rubbish\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that, but we don\u2019t fight issues with people because it\u2019s a losing battle. People have all kinds of different views. I even saw [people] on social media saying her father said he is not going to vote for her, but it\u2019s not true. He is in full support of her, and he is happy for her,\u201d he said.</p> <p>After her parents\u2019 divorce, Harris\u2019s childhood was mostly split between Montreal, where her mother taught at McGill University, and California, where her father taught at Stanford University.</p> <p>\u201cMy father, like so many Jamaicans, has immense pride in our Jamaican heritage and instilled that same pride in my sister and me,\u201d Harris told the Washington Post in 2021. \u201cWe love Jamaica. He taught us the history of where we\u2019re from, the struggles and beauty of the Jamaican people, and the richness of the culture.\u201d</p>    <p>Donald Trump has sought to question Harris\u2019s mixed heritage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/31/trump-lies-questions-kamala-harris-racial-identity-nabj\">falsely claiming that she had only identified with her mother\u2019s ethnicity</a>. \u201cShe was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn, and she went \u2013 she became a Black person,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Sherman Harris said that the connection between his cousin and Jamaica has always been strong: \u201cJamaicans are indeed proud of her, and Jamaicans ought to be proud of her,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Certainly, in St Ann parish, there has been strong support for the Democratic candidate. Mayor Michael Belnavis told CNN: \u201cYou have to recognize individuals who come from humble abodes and really excel \u2026 Coming from Brown\u2019s Town is as humble as it gets.\u201d</p> <p>Harris\u2019s achievements \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/21/kamala-harris-2020-president-election-run-meteoric-rise\">as San Francisco district attorney, California senator, vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate</a> \u2013 have inspired Jamaicans across the island.</p> <p>\u201cIt says to me that it doesn\u2019t matter your race or your background. As long as you hold your head up high, know what you want and go for it, you can be whatever you want to be,\u201d said Alexcia White, a journalism student in Manchester, Jamaica. \u201cShe just makes me proud to know that she is of Jamaican descent and making big waves in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Others question whether a Harris presidency would actually bring any concrete benefits for the country.</p> <p>\u201cWill she do anything that will improve our economy? I don\u2019t see how her becoming president will affect Jamaicans,\u201d said architecture student Dana McCallum, who expressed hope Harris could make US visas more accessible for Jamaicans if she won.</p>    <p>Marlon Hill, a Jamaican-American lawyer who served as an elector for Florida for Barack Obama in 2008, warned about overstating Harris\u2019s connection to Jamaica, adding that \u201cKamala\u2019s immigrant story is unique, and we should not draw a straight line to it being exactly the same as our own experience\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cJamaicans want her to say more vocal, visible things about their connection. And I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get that in this campaign because she\u2019s running to be the president of the entire United States of America, and not just for Americans of Jamaican descent.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I would say, though, is that when she wins, it\u2019s going to be up to us, as Jamaican Americans, to hold her accountable to have a keen interest in her heritage and in how that experience can be leveraged for the benefit of Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean.\u201d</p> <p>Not all Jamaican Americans are Democrats: Commonwealth Games gold medalist Claston Bernard, who ran for the United States House of Representatives as a Republican in 2021, said that, notwithstanding Harris\u2019s Jamaican roots, he could not support her policies, citing his views on religious freedom, abortion and wealth taxes. \u201cJamaicans should be very cautious about getting behind socialist policies that do not support wealth building, are a threat to religious worship, or attack the rights of people to bear arms to protect themselves and their properties,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Whatever their views, the elections on 5 November are expected to be a historic moment for Jamaicans at home, in the US and around the world. In the small community of Brown\u2019s Town, Sherman and other residents will be looking forward to the moment Kamala is declared president of the US.</p> <p>\u201cI have no doubt that the American people will favour her because she is getting good support,\u201d Sherman said, adding: \u201cShe is going to make history, and Jamaica\u2019s name, its flag, is going to fly high once more!\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brown\u2019s Town, in the Jamaican parish of St Ann \u2013 where as a child, Kamala Harris spent many holidays with her family \u2013 has the unmistakable atmosphere of a close-knit rural Caribbean community. Narrow roads, cocooned by bowing trees and lush vegetation, wind past concrete houses and the rolling hills of the Dry Harbour mountain range. It gets busier in the town itself, where vehicles toot their horns as they manoeuvre past colourfully painted shops and the local market that a young Kamala used to visit with her parents. The town of 6,000 inhabitants is named after an Irish enslaver, Hamilton Brown, who is believed to have been an ancestor of Harris\u2019s paternal great-grandmother Christiana Brown, known in the family as Miss Chrishy. Heading out of the market area, the road arrives at the Harris family estate in Orange Hill, where Harris\u2019s 86-year-old father, the distinguished economist Donald Harris, was born in 1938. The estate now has a quarry and some family homes. But it was once a place of adventure and delight for Harris, recalled her first cousin Sherman Harris, as he pointed to the areas where they used to play together. Only a few days younger than the vice-president, Sherman remembers the Christmas holidays Harris and her younger sister, Maya, spent with their family in the Caribbean. \u201cMaya was a little quiet, but Kamala was like a tomboy, running, jumping and leaping around the mountain areas. Miss Chrishy had to call her and tell her to \u2018get inside now, it\u2019s dinner time \u2013 come and stop the jumping over those places\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she would just do it for the better because her father encouraged her,\u201d he added. Even as a child, Sherman said, Kamala asked questions that belied her age and demonstrated \u201ca deep level of intelligence and a mindset far above what we were accustomed to as little kids\u201d. When she could not get answers from her peers, she would turn to her dad, he said. Harris has spoken fondly about her parents \u2013 Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, a biomedical scientist who was born and grew up in India \u2013 describing \u201ca home filled with laughter and music: Aretha, Coltrane and Miles\u201d. She paid tribute to her father for believing in her, saying: \u201cAt the park, my mother would say: \u2018Stay close.\u2019 But my father would say, as he smiled: \u2018Run, Kamala, run. Don\u2019t be afraid. Don\u2019t let anything stop you.\u2019 From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless.\u201d The New York Times reported this month that relations between father and daughter grew strained after her parents\u2019 divorce in 1972. The relationship worsened over the years, according to the article, which claimed that Harris had been upset when her father did not attend Gopalan\u2019s funeral in 2009. Sherman dismissed the reported rift as \u201ctotal rubbish\u201d. \u201cWe know that, but we don\u2019t fight issues with people because it\u2019s a losing battle. People have all kinds of different views. I even saw [people] on social media saying her father said he is not going to vote for her, but it\u2019s not true. He is in full support of her, and he is happy for her,\u201d he said. After her parents\u2019 divorce, Harris\u2019s childhood was mostly split between Montreal, where her mother taught at McGill University, and California, where her father taught at Stanford University. \u201cMy father, like so many Jamaicans, has immense pride in our Jamaican heritage and instilled that same pride in my sister and me,\u201d Harris told the Washington Post in 2021. \u201cWe love Jamaica. He taught us the history of where we\u2019re from, the struggles and beauty of the Jamaican people, and the richness of the culture.\u201d Donald Trump has sought to question Harris\u2019s mixed heritage, falsely claiming that she had only identified with her mother\u2019s ethnicity. \u201cShe was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn, and she went \u2013 she became a Black person,\u201d he said. But Sherman Harris said that the connection between his cousin and Jamaica has always been strong: \u201cJamaicans are indeed proud of her, and Jamaicans ought to be proud of her,\u201d he said. Certainly, in St Ann parish, there has been strong support for the Democratic candidate. Mayor Michael Belnavis told CNN: \u201cYou have to recognize individuals who come from humble abodes and really excel \u2026 Coming from Brown\u2019s Town is as humble as it gets.\u201d Harris\u2019s achievements \u2013 as San Francisco district attorney, California senator, vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate \u2013 have inspired Jamaicans across the island. \u201cIt says to me that it doesn\u2019t matter your race or your background. As long as you hold your head up high, know what you want and go for it, you can be whatever you want to be,\u201d said Alexcia White, a journalism student in Manchester, Jamaica. \u201cShe just makes me proud to know that she is of Jamaican descent and making big waves in the US.\u201d Others question whether a Harris presidency would actually bring any concrete benefits for the country. \u201cWill she do anything that will improve our economy? I don\u2019t see how her becoming president will affect Jamaicans,\u201d said architecture student Dana McCallum, who expressed hope Harris could make US visas more accessible for Jamaicans if she won. Marlon Hill, a Jamaican-American lawyer who served as an elector for Florida for Barack Obama in 2008, warned about overstating Harris\u2019s connection to Jamaica, adding that \u201cKamala\u2019s immigrant story is unique, and we should not draw a straight line to it being exactly the same as our own experience\u201d. He said: \u201cJamaicans want her to say more vocal, visible things about their connection. And I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get that in this campaign because she\u2019s running to be the president of the entire United States of America, and not just for Americans of Jamaican descent. \u201cWhat I would say, though, is that when she wins, it\u2019s going to be up to us, as Jamaican Americans, to hold her accountable to have a keen interest in her heritage and in how that experience can be leveraged for the benefit of Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean.\u201d Not all Jamaican Americans are Democrats: Commonwealth Games gold medalist Claston Bernard, who ran for the United States House of Representatives as a Republican in 2021, said that, notwithstanding Harris\u2019s Jamaican roots, he could not support her policies, citing his views on religious freedom, abortion and wealth taxes. \u201cJamaicans should be very cautious about getting behind socialist policies that do not support wealth building, are a threat to religious worship, or attack the rights of people to bear arms to protect themselves and their properties,\u201d he said. Whatever their views, the elections on 5 November are expected to be a historic moment for Jamaicans at home, in the US and around the world. In the small community of Brown\u2019s Town, Sherman and other residents will be looking forward to the moment Kamala is declared president of the US. \u201cI have no doubt that the American people will favour her because she is getting good support,\u201d Sherman said, adding: \u201cShe is going to make history, and Jamaica\u2019s name, its flag, is going to fly high once more!\u201d",

Of the track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQVaRudcClc\">How Do Yeaw View You?</a>, by Parliament sister group Funkadelic, she says: \u201cHearing that and believing in it in my most formative years gave me a certain confidence to go for my funk.\u201d</p> <p>Later, once YouTube had come into existence, Halsey watched Parliament\u2019s Mothership Connection P-Funk Earth tour and made it her life mission to become a member. \u201cObviously I didn\u2019t make it in the band,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut they\u2019re huge references for me.

She won the Frieze artist award in New York in 2019, and has presented large-scale outdoor monuments at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s roof garden in 2023 and this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/venice-biennale-2024\">60th Venice Biennale</a>. Her work is in the collections of Museum of Contemporary Art, the Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum.

Visitors can expect a prismatic glass floor, walls made from CDs, figurines, \u201cfunkmounds\u201d, a live water fountain, sand dunes and a huge collage.</p> <p>The exhibition is a testament to Halsey\u2019s maximalist style. Her work is a graphic bombardment of colour, text, Black figures, hairstyles, signs and phrases as an ode to Black culture and Black history. She creates elaborate ornamented landscapes that embody her fascination with collecting ephemera. You\u2019ll find ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs alongside the faces of hip-hop great and spaceships. It\u2019s a melting pot of the past, present and future.</p>    <p>Still, beyond her energetic aesthetic, Halsey\u2019s work is distinctly LA, more specifically South Central. It\u2019s where she and her family have lived for several generations. \u201cI remember when my aunt, who\u2019s a few years older than me, got her [driver\u2019s] licence and my life changed. [We] would hit the streets. As a passenger I saw so much. South Central is so large.\u201d Halsey\u2019s mixed-media installation <em><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/433971\">My Hop</a></em><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/433971\">e</a>, for example, captures the essence of her neighbourhood in all its density; faux palm trees, a church service complete with miniature figurines, Cadillacs, business signs and posters with slogans such as \u201cReparations Now!\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m always trying to capture that too muchness [in] my work. The excess.\u201d</p> <p>Halsey was born in LA in 1987 to an accountant father and a schoolteacher mother who was \u201calways bringing me home art [and] craft materials\u201d. Her father dreamed of being a musician and in turn wanted Halsey to pursue piano, but \u201cit wasn\u2019t for me\u201d, she says. She desperately wanted to make it into the US Women\u2019s National Basketball Association (WNBA). \u201cI was obsessed with basketball,\u201d she says. \u201cBut my parents wanted me to go to a school that was hardcore academic. [It] didn\u2019t even have a basketball gym.\u201d</p> <p>She eventually gave up on her WNBA dreams and ventured into art. Her interest in architecture came out of an encouraging conversation with LA-based artist Dominique Moody. \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t want to become an architect with a capital \u2018A\u2019 [but] I thought I could navigate the language of architecture through art.\u201d She went on to earn a bachelor of fine arts from the California Institute of the Arts and a masters from Yale in 2014.</p> <p>Pride in home is at the forefront of Halsey\u2019s work. In opposition to the heavy hand of gentrification that plagues Los Angeles, her pieces attempt to preserve and transmit her immediate environment. Still, given how hyper-specific her output tends to be, how does she strike the balance between presenting something so culturally defined without clearing the way for voyeurism? \u201cI use the museum truly as a space to host these studies and proof of concepts for the best iteration of the architecture that will return back home,\u201d she says. Thinking global but acting local seems to be Halsey\u2019s holy grail. Her practice is as much about transporting her community to the world as it is about ensuring that it reaps the benefits.</p>    <p>\u201c[It\u2019s] heartbreaking the way I\u2019ve seen folks [from LA] get dogged out by systems, though we\u2019re the inspiration for everything. It\u2019s super tragic because there\u2019s no infrastructure to support [us].\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s why, in 2020, Halsey founded a community centre called <a href=\"https://summaeverythang.org/\">Summaeverythang</a> that donates and delivers organic produce. \u201cWe can only save ourselves,\u201d she tells me.</p> <p>A deep empathy for her community\u2019s history is present in the Serpentine show too. Mirrored palm trees feature the faces of the women who were the victims of US serial killer Lonnie David Franklin Jr, nicknamed the \u201cGrim Sleeper\u201d, who was convicted of 10 murders and one attempted murder in LA from 1984 to 2007. \u201cI lived on the same street as the Grim Sleeper,\u201d recalls Halsey. \u201cWhen I was 12 or 13 \u2013 he left one of the women\u2019s [bodies] directly across the street from my home.\u201d</p> <p>The Grim Sleeper targeted black women but \u201cthe police paid him no mind\u201d, according to Halsey.

In this affectionate and well-researched biography, a former student of his evokes not only a life of high table gossip and well-connected friendships that included everyone from Bryan Ferry to Princess Margaret, but depicts Catto as the last of a vanished breed. This academic was no snob, and his love of learning for its own sake remains inspirational. Haunted Tales: Ghostly Stories for the Darkest Nights Adam Macqueen Swift, \u00a312.99, pp208 Halloween is the traditional time for spooky stories, and Adam Macqueen\u2019s new collection is a suitably atmospheric addition to the canon. The nine tales here are gently chilling rather than spine-chillingly terrifying, but Macqueen has a knack for conveying atmosphere and wry humour, as everything from a deceased son\u2019s Facebook account to a battered old hawthorn tree can become the repository of otherworldly forces that the unwitting protagonists find themselves fatally entrapped by. A Ballet of Lepers: A Novel and Stories Leonard Cohen Canongate, \u00a310.99, pp272 (paperback) Eight years after his death, the much-missed Leonard Cohen is still primarily regarded as a musician, but before he ever sang a note, he was a prose writer of considerable distinction. This collection of stories, along with a novella, is rich in the dark humour and lyricism that he brought to his records, shot through with a warped romanticism that he would perfect over the coming decades. \u2022 To order Jeremy Catto, Haunted Tales or A Ballet of Lepers go to guardianbookshop.com.

There\u2019s often a time lag of two to three years between drug deaths and the coroner\u2019s assessment on which these statistics are based, says Ian Hamilton, associate professor of addiction at the University of York: current rates are probably even higher. What\u2019s more, not all deaths resulting from cocaine are included. The long-term damage that eventually ends in a stroke or a heart attack will not show up in these reports.</p> <p>What is going on? One culprit is a precipitous rise in purity, which makes it easier to overdose by accident. Once cocaine was sold in a two-tier market: the cheap, heavily adulterated stuff, and the expensive, purer cocaine consumed by models, city traders and members of the Bullingdon Club. Now, according to <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/cocaine/Global_cocaine_report_2023.pdf\">the latest United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report</a>, cocaine in Europe has on average a purity of over 60%, compared with 35% in 2009. Today, even street cocaine rivals the top-end stuff of the 1980s.</p> <p>This may in part be the unintended consequence of government crackdowns on cutting agents such as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10909884\">benzocaine, a dental anaesthetic</a>. But the result is a drug that is often far stronger than users are expecting. This could be particularly true of generation X \u2013 now accumulating health issues \u2013 which came of age at a time of much milder cocaine: the highest rate of recent deaths in England and Wales is among men aged 40 to 49.</p> <p>Another factor is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b615c37b-7da1-4b94-934d-b68a261e6f6a\">price</a>, which, despite inflation, has not budged for years. This is partly because supply is up in producer countries, partly because cocaine has a known street price: raise it, and customers go elsewhere; drop it, and they suspect something is wrong with the product. And if cocaine is better and cheaper, more people try it. A larger pool of users means more with undetected heart issues that a dose of cocaine might suddenly exacerbate.</p> <p>It also means cocaine is more often mixed with other drugs, rather than consumed reverently, by itself, as a treat. This ramps up the danger. It is now so cheap and prevalent that drinkers use it to temper the effects of alcohol, in order to drink more. And to fill the gap left in the higher end of the market, there are complicated cocktails. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/22/liam-payne-cause-of-death-toxicology-reports-cocaine-methamphetamine\">Liam Payne</a>, who died this month, had \u201cpink cocaine\u201d in his system: a drug that typically includes methamphetamine, ketamine, MDMA and crack cocaine.

      "body": "<p>It is a shocker that about 100 current and former Labour party staffers are hopping over the pond to campaign for Kamala Harris in swing states as the race for the White House enters the final, feverish furlong. A&nbsp;measly 100? Is that the best they could do? Labour will often manage to get more of its people knocking on doors and handing out leaflets for a humdrum British byelection in which nothing more is in play than who gets to be MP for Slumberborough. Much more is at stake in a US presidential contest that, with fewer than 10&nbsp;days to go, the polls have as a <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/\">coin-toss</a>. </p> <p>Only Americans get to vote, but the world will have to cope with the consequences if Donald Trump again darkens the door of the White House. The fate of Ukraine, the future of Nato, the stability of the global economy, the response to the climate crisis, the cohesion of the democracies in the struggle with an axis of autocracies, and plausibly even the freedoms of America itself, all this is on the ballot in 2024. Given the vertiginous scale of the stakes, you might argue that it is remarkable how few Labour people are volunteering to help out their fellow progressives across the Atlantic.</p> <p>The ostensible \u201ccontroversy\u201d about Labour being guilty of \u201cforeign interference\u201d in the American election is a campaign stunt, a synthetic confection whipped up by Team Trump, which has been given extra froth here by <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-nigel-farage-labour-democrat-legal-fight/\">Nigel Farage</a> and other Maga cheerleaders on our shores. It is as phoney as a three-dollar bill. There is a long and legitimate tradition of ideas-swapping and mutual assistance between British and American politicians and operatives. Labour and the US Democrats are sister parties. The Tories have historically had an affinity with the Republicans. While the more moderate British right contains many never-Trumpers, its more extreme iterations are among his greatest fans. Mr&nbsp;Farage, himself no stranger to campaigning in the US, didn\u2019t see anything wrong with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/23/no-labour-wrongdoing-in-kamala-harris-campaign-row-says-ex-tory-minister#:~:text=Nigel%20Farage%2C%20the,the%20world%20stage%E2%80%9D\">attending the Republican convention</a> in Milwaukee in July. There was nothing odd, still less sinister, about Morgan McSweeney, Labour\u2019s campaign chief at the time, and Matthew Doyle, its director of communications, being present at the Democrats\u2019 convention in Chicago in the summer. It would have been&nbsp;more weirdly noteworthy had no Labour people been in the Windy City to witness the crowning of Ms&nbsp;Harris as her party\u2019s nominee.</p> <p>The Trump campaign has nevertheless seized on a couple of Labour officials being in Chicago and 100&nbsp;volunteers going on the knocker as the basis for its ludicrous charge that this amounts to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/22/trump-complaint-uk-labour-party\">anti-American</a>\u201d meddling in the election. The <a href=\"https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/c9/c959261c-f450-46bb-ac7c-c9c7646434b3/fec-complaint-re-labour-party.pdf?_nlid=hegxwu93Mr&amp;amp;_nhids=78ZAHdG\">complaining letter</a> from the Trump legal team to the Federal Election Commission cites the American war for independence while misspelling Great Britain as \u201cGreat Britian\u201d. The attack is designed to dirty up Ms Harris by suggesting her campaign is so \u201cflailing\u201d that it is having to seek help from abroad \u2013 and, gosh, from the former colonial power. </p> <p>Well, if the topic is the subversion of American democracy, the violent attempt to prevent certification of the last presidential election result when a Trumpite mob was incited to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56004916\">storm the Capitol</a> was a rather graver threat than some Labour volunteers tramping around Pennsylvania trying to find undecided voters. On the recent testimony of John Kelly, a retired marine general who was chief of staff in the Trump White House for 18&nbsp;months, the once and wannabe future president fits \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/election-trump-staffers-john-kelly\">the general definition of fascist</a>\u201d and told him that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-john-kelly-nazis-hitler-87d672e1ec1a6645808050fc60f6b8bc\">Hitler \u201cdid some good things\u201d</a>. The most damning observations about the character and conduct of Mr Trump have invariably come not from his opponents but from those who have worked with him most closely. Another clue not to take Trump propagandists seriously when they pose as guardians of US democracy is when they brand Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour as \u201cfar left\u201d. That suggests a lack of familiarity with British politics. Or perhaps they assume that the intended audience among American voters are entirely clueless about the ideological complexion of the UK\u2019s government.</p>    <p>Here I think we get to the real lesson of this story. It is not that Labour people want to see a Trump defeat and a Harris victory \u2013 both obvious and natural \u2013 however much Sir Keir feels he has to hedge his bets by wearing a mask of neutrality. No, the main moral for Britain\u2019s government is that Mr&nbsp;Trump does not give a toss what it thinks. If a synthetic transatlantic spat might tilt the odds of him regaining the presidency even by a tiny bit, he will happily sanction an assault on the governing party of what is supposed to be one of America\u2019s most important allies.</p> <p>This contempt for Britain is not wholly a revelation. Conservative prime ministers who tried to worm their way into his affections got scant reward for their demeaning efforts. He congratulated Boris Johnson for being \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-49090804\">Britain Trump</a>\u201d (sic), but denied him the US trade deal he was so desperate for. Theresa May was treated with undisguised disdain and her attempts to butter him up included massaging his ego with tea at Windsor Castle one year and a full-blown state visit the next. The&nbsp;late Queen was not amused by her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/20/very-rude-the-late-queens-salty-verdict-on-donald-trump\">very rude</a>\u201d guest.

      "bodyText": "It is a shocker that about 100 current and former Labour party staffers are hopping over the pond to campaign for Kamala Harris in swing states as the race for the White House enters the final, feverish furlong. A measly 100? Is that the best they could do? Labour will often manage to get more of its people knocking on doors and handing out leaflets for a humdrum British byelection in which nothing more is in play than who gets to be MP for Slumberborough. Much more is at stake in a US presidential contest that, with fewer than 10 days to go, the polls have as a coin-toss. Only Americans get to vote, but the world will have to cope with the consequences if Donald Trump again darkens the door of the White House. The fate of Ukraine, the future of Nato, the stability of the global economy, the response to the climate crisis, the cohesion of the democracies in the struggle with an axis of autocracies, and plausibly even the freedoms of America itself, all this is on the ballot in 2024. Given the vertiginous scale of the stakes, you might argue that it is remarkable how few Labour people are volunteering to help out their fellow progressives across the Atlantic. The ostensible \u201ccontroversy\u201d about Labour being guilty of \u201cforeign interference\u201d in the American election is a campaign stunt, a synthetic confection whipped up by Team Trump, which has been given extra froth here by Nigel Farage and other Maga cheerleaders on our shores. It is as phoney as a three-dollar bill. There is a long and legitimate tradition of ideas-swapping and mutual assistance between British and American politicians and operatives. Labour and the US Democrats are sister parties. The Tories have historically had an affinity with the Republicans. While the more moderate British right contains many never-Trumpers, its more extreme iterations are among his greatest fans. Mr Farage, himself no stranger to campaigning in the US, didn\u2019t see anything wrong with attending the Republican convention in Milwaukee in July. There was nothing odd, still less sinister, about Morgan McSweeney, Labour\u2019s campaign chief at the time, and Matthew Doyle, its director of communications, being present at the Democrats\u2019 convention in Chicago in the summer. It would have been more weirdly noteworthy had no Labour people been in the Windy City to witness the crowning of Ms Harris as her party\u2019s nominee. The Trump campaign has nevertheless seized on a couple of Labour officials being in Chicago and 100 volunteers going on the knocker as the basis for its ludicrous charge that this amounts to \u201canti-American\u201d meddling in the election. The complaining letter from the Trump legal team to the Federal Election Commission cites the American war for independence while misspelling Great Britain as \u201cGreat Britian\u201d. The attack is designed to dirty up Ms Harris by suggesting her campaign is so \u201cflailing\u201d that it is having to seek help from abroad \u2013 and, gosh, from the former colonial power. Well, if the topic is the subversion of American democracy, the violent attempt to prevent certification of the last presidential election result when a Trumpite mob was incited to storm the Capitol was a rather graver threat than some Labour volunteers tramping around Pennsylvania trying to find undecided voters. On the recent testimony of John Kelly, a retired marine general who was chief of staff in the Trump White House for 18 months, the once and wannabe future president fits \u201cthe general definition of fascist\u201d and told him that Hitler \u201cdid some good things\u201d. The most damning observations about the character and conduct of Mr Trump have invariably come not from his opponents but from those who have worked with him most closely. Another clue not to take Trump propagandists seriously when they pose as guardians of US democracy is when they brand Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour as \u201cfar left\u201d. That suggests a lack of familiarity with British politics. Or perhaps they assume that the intended audience among American voters are entirely clueless about the ideological complexion of the UK\u2019s government. Here I think we get to the real lesson of this story. It is not that Labour people want to see a Trump defeat and a Harris victory \u2013 both obvious and natural \u2013 however much Sir Keir feels he has to hedge his bets by wearing a mask of neutrality. No, the main moral for Britain\u2019s government is that Mr Trump does not give a toss what it thinks. If a synthetic transatlantic spat might tilt the odds of him regaining the presidency even by a tiny bit, he will happily sanction an assault on the governing party of what is supposed to be one of America\u2019s most important allies. This contempt for Britain is not wholly a revelation. Conservative prime ministers who tried to worm their way into his affections got scant reward for their demeaning efforts. He congratulated Boris Johnson for being \u201cBritain Trump\u201d (sic), but denied him the US trade deal he was so desperate for. Theresa May was treated with undisguised disdain and her attempts to butter him up included massaging his ego with tea at Windsor Castle one year and a full-blown state visit the next. The late Queen was not amused by her \u201cvery rude\u201d guest. Mrs May later wrote that \u201cshe never knew what to expect\u201d from him and heard him \u201cquestion core tenets of the transatlantic alliance\u201d. So Sir Keir should avoid being seduced by any fantasy that he will be able to be a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d who can \u201chandle\u201d the American. Contingency planning by the British government ought to work on the assumption that they are going to find it a howling nightmare if he gets back into the White House. This is a sensitive spot for the prime minister. Speaking to reporters accompanying him to the Commonwealth summit in Samoa, Sir Keir repeated the standard line that he will work with whoever America puts in the White House and can sustain a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Trump. While we can understand why he feels compelled to say that, there is something a bit wince-inducing about Downing Street\u2019s efforts to persuade everyone that they will have a fine bromance.

The fight to preserve the freedom and territorial integrity of Ukraine is rightly regarded by Number 10 as critical to protecting Europe from further Russian aggression. Sir Keir\u2019s recent pledge to support the Ukrainians \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d is cast into deep doubt by Mr Trump\u2019s tirades against Volodymyr Zelenskyy, loathing of giving further assistance to the Ukrainians and frequent suggestions that he will sell them out to Vladimir Putin.

The complication ended her chances of delivering a healthy baby and imperiled her health \u2013 but doctors in Austin, where the couple live, said they could not end her pregnancy under Texas law, because they could still detect fetal cardiac activity.</p> <p>In the wake of the supreme court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization in June 2022, which reversed half a century of precedent and overturned Roe v Wade, the Texas legislature, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state\">those in 13 other states</a>, passed a near-total abortion ban. Though the ban allowed for medical exceptions, doctors have said that the law \u2013 written by politicians, not medical professionals \u2013 is so vaguely worded, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/24/abortion-prosecutions-roe-v-wade\">criminal penalties so severe</a> (up to 99 years in prison for violating state abortion law), that it was unworkable in practice, blocking doctors from helping patients.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/election-abortion-ballot-measures-states\">Where will abortion be on the ballot in the 2024 US election?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So Zurawski, against her wishes and the common standard of care, remained pregnant, knowing her daughter stood no chance of survival, as she grew sicker and sicker. As she testified to the state in a lawsuit that bears her name \u2013 the first post-Roe v Wade to be filed by women who said that their health, lives or fertility had been endangered by abortion bans, and the subject of a new documentary executive produced by Hillary and Chelsea Clinton and Jennifer Lawrence \u2013 she listened to the cardiac activity with a terrible mix of love, for the child she and Josh desperately wanted, and dread, for her deteriorating health. Doctors eventually performed an emergency induction abortion \u2013 but only after she developed sepsis and nearly died. The infection kept her in the ICU for days and cost her one of her fallopian tubes, permanently compromising her future ability to have children.</p> <p>Aided by the Center for Reproductive Rights, Zurawski sued the state of Texas, looking for clarity in the law as written, and responsibility for a policy that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/24/texas-abortion-ban-infant-deaths\">led to a 13% increase</a> in infant deaths, forced doctors to provide substandard care and inflicted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/21/idaho-abortion-trump\">incalculable trauma on women seeking basic healthcare</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSomebody had to file the first suit,\u201d Zurawski says in the film named after <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/zurawski-v-texas-plaintiffs-stories-remarks/\">her lawsuit</a>, Zurawski v Texas, released just before a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/election-abortion-ballot-measures-states\">pivotal election</a> in which reproductive rights across the country are on the line.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re asking for in this lawsuit is the bare minimum human decency requires,\u201d says Molly Duane, the Center\u2019s leading attorney for the suit, in the film. \u201cPeople are going to die. And the question is, does anyone in the state of Texas in a position of power actually care?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3QdzIgJis0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M3QdzIgJis0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The film, directed by Texas-bred film-makers Abbie Perrault and Maisie Crow, captures with journalistic clarity the chaos, uncertainty and unnecessary pain and suffering that ensues when a state bans abortion \u2013 what happens in court, in hospitals, and in the private aftermath. It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/24/us-miscarriage-laws-abortion-rights-options\">one particular slice of post-Roe America</a> \u2013 life-saving or simply dignifying healthcare denied, because of legal uncertainty, to women who wanted to be pregnant in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re in triage mode,\u201d Crow told the Guardian. \u201cIf someone has to go septic before they can get an abortion, that means that for everyone else who needs abortion for all the reasons that women seek abortion care, they are not getting that care either. We really felt like we needed to highlight the most dire situation that was unfolding in front of us to emphasize the fact that if the women in this lawsuit aren\u2019t getting care, then no one else is.\u201d</p> <p>And the situation, as the film-makers found, was dire. As soon as Zurawski filed her suit, dozens of women, along with their partners and families, reached out with similarly harrowing stories. In a collage of voicemails played during the film, others share similar experiences: an ectopic pregnancy denied care until her fallopian tube ruptured, another inviable pregnancy carried to term. Share my story, tell people what is happening. \u201cThe state absolutely wants to sweep their experiences under the rug,\u201d says Duane. \u201cThey just want to pretend like real people don\u2019t exist at all.\u201d</p> <p>Zurawski v Texas follows three of the eventual 22 plaintiffs, who provided in-person testimony on their abortion stories, something that was happening in court for the <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/how-the-texas-trial-changed-the-story-of-abortion-rights-in-america/\">first time since the 1970s</a>. Samantha Casiano, who lived in East Texas with her partner and their children, learned at her 20-week scan that her daughter, Halo, would be born without most of her brain \u2013 a defect called anencephaly that was incompatible with life. Unable to afford travel out of state for an abortion, she was forced to carry the pregnancy to term while planning for her daughter\u2019s funeral, then watch as Halo gasped for air for four hours after birth. Dr Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN based in Dallas, also learned her long-awaited third child had anencephaly, and had to travel out of state for the medical care she used to be able to provide her patients in her home community. \u201cHaving these laws cripple our ability to provide care \u2013 it feels like a slap in the face,\u201d she says. Zurawski, traumatized by her medical experience, resorts to surrogacy in another state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/21/idaho-abortion-trump\">Life-threatening crises, frantic calls: Idaho offers glimpse of what abortion could look like under Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The film is part behind the scenes of their court hearing \u2013 nerves, fury, pride, inexpressible pain (Casiano, recounting Halo\u2019s short life after birth, vomited on the stand) \u2013 and part documentation of trauma, healing and action. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to politicize it, because this is a healthcare issue that\u2019s been politicized, but it should be a nonpartisan issue,\u201d said Perrault. \u201cWe really just wanted to present what\u2019s happening to people under these laws and let the audience take that in on a very human, intimate, personal level from each of these women.\u201d</p>    <p>For the participants \u2013 Zurawski, Dennard, Casiano, along with their partners and families \u2013 \u201cthe horror of what they had to experience and the impact of that on their families and their own reproductive journeys was evident throughout the film-making process,\u201d said Crow. \u201cBut we also were just incredibly in awe of their bravery and their willingness to stand up for women across the country in filing this lawsuit and taking the stand to share their testimony.\u201d</p> <p>The state, ultimately, did not listen to them. On 31 May, the Texas supreme court unanimously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/31/texas-abortion-ban-medical-exceptions-supreme-court-ruling\">rejected</a> the women\u2019s legal challenge, declaring that the state abortion ban could stand as is, without clarifying when medically necessary abortions can be performed. The decision barely mentioned the women. \u201cTo know that people in the position of power feel that pregnant individuals should simply be vessels,\u201d says Dennard in the film. \u201cWe just have to keep fighting, and we have to keep talking about it, and we have to keep telling our stories, without fear.\u201d The film will be released directly for home viewing to do just that, as an explicitly urgent call to understand the stakes of abortion bans that many who do not experience them first hand do not understand. \u201cTwenty-five million women in America live under bans like this,\u201d said Perrault. \u201cIt\u2019s not only these women, it\u2019s also their partners and their children and their parents. Understanding that this issue could affect you in your lifetime is so key.\u201d</p> <p>The landscape for reproductive rights captured in Zurawski v Texas is staggeringly bleak, even as similar lawsuits in other four other states with near-total abortion bans, including Idaho and Tennessee, remain in legal limbo. But Duane, along with Perrault and Crow, see power in what they witnessed with the lawsuit: people \u2013 such as Zurawski\u2019s conservative family members \u2013 changing their minds and their votes through hearing the women\u2019s experiences.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now that we didn\u2019t see pre-Dobbs is that families are talking about this,\u201d said Crow. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of time before abortion is accessible again. But in a pre-Dobbs era, abortion was not accessible to so many people who needed it to begin with. If there is a restructuring of how abortion becomes more accessible, I think that that\u2019s something to be hopeful towards.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Zurawski v Texas is out now in New York and Los Angeles with more cities to follow</p></li> </ul>",

As she testified to the state in a lawsuit that bears her name \u2013 the first post-Roe v Wade to be filed by women who said that their health, lives or fertility had been endangered by abortion bans, and the subject of a new documentary executive produced by Hillary and Chelsea Clinton and Jennifer Lawrence \u2013 she listened to the cardiac activity with a terrible mix of love, for the child she and Josh desperately wanted, and dread, for her deteriorating health. Doctors eventually performed an emergency induction abortion \u2013 but only after she developed sepsis and nearly died. The infection kept her in the ICU for days and cost her one of her fallopian tubes, permanently compromising her future ability to have children. Aided by the Center for Reproductive Rights, Zurawski sued the state of Texas, looking for clarity in the law as written, and responsibility for a policy that has led to a 13% increase in infant deaths, forced doctors to provide substandard care and inflicted incalculable trauma on women seeking basic healthcare. \u201cSomebody had to file the first suit,\u201d Zurawski says in the film named after her lawsuit, Zurawski v Texas, released just before a pivotal election in which reproductive rights across the country are on the line. \u201cWhat we\u2019re asking for in this lawsuit is the bare minimum human decency requires,\u201d says Molly Duane, the Center\u2019s leading attorney for the suit, in the film. \u201cPeople are going to die. And the question is, does anyone in the state of Texas in a position of power actually care?\u201d The film, directed by Texas-bred film-makers Abbie Perrault and Maisie Crow, captures with journalistic clarity the chaos, uncertainty and unnecessary pain and suffering that ensues when a state bans abortion \u2013 what happens in court, in hospitals, and in the private aftermath. It is one particular slice of post-Roe America \u2013 life-saving or simply dignifying healthcare denied, because of legal uncertainty, to women who wanted to be pregnant in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re in triage mode,\u201d Crow told the Guardian. \u201cIf someone has to go septic before they can get an abortion, that means that for everyone else who needs abortion for all the reasons that women seek abortion care, they are not getting that care either. We really felt like we needed to highlight the most dire situation that was unfolding in front of us to emphasize the fact that if the women in this lawsuit aren\u2019t getting care, then no one else is.\u201d And the situation, as the film-makers found, was dire. As soon as Zurawski filed her suit, dozens of women, along with their partners and families, reached out with similarly harrowing stories. In a collage of voicemails played during the film, others share similar experiences: an ectopic pregnancy denied care until her fallopian tube ruptured, another inviable pregnancy carried to term. Share my story, tell people what is happening. \u201cThe state absolutely wants to sweep their experiences under the rug,\u201d says Duane. \u201cThey just want to pretend like real people don\u2019t exist at all.\u201d Zurawski v Texas follows three of the eventual 22 plaintiffs, who provided in-person testimony on their abortion stories, something that was happening in court for the first time since the 1970s. Samantha Casiano, who lived in East Texas with her partner and their children, learned at her 20-week scan that her daughter, Halo, would be born without most of her brain \u2013 a defect called anencephaly that was incompatible with life. Unable to afford travel out of state for an abortion, she was forced to carry the pregnancy to term while planning for her daughter\u2019s funeral, then watch as Halo gasped for air for four hours after birth. Dr Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN based in Dallas, also learned her long-awaited third child had anencephaly, and had to travel out of state for the medical care she used to be able to provide her patients in her home community. \u201cHaving these laws cripple our ability to provide care \u2013 it feels like a slap in the face,\u201d she says. Zurawski, traumatized by her medical experience, resorts to surrogacy in another state. The film is part behind the scenes of their court hearing \u2013 nerves, fury, pride, inexpressible pain (Casiano, recounting Halo\u2019s short life after birth, vomited on the stand) \u2013 and part documentation of trauma, healing and action. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to politicize it, because this is a healthcare issue that\u2019s been politicized, but it should be a nonpartisan issue,\u201d said Perrault. \u201cWe really just wanted to present what\u2019s happening to people under these laws and let the audience take that in on a very human, intimate, personal level from each of these women.\u201d For the participants \u2013 Zurawski, Dennard, Casiano, along with their partners and families \u2013 \u201cthe horror of what they had to experience and the impact of that on their families and their own reproductive journeys was evident throughout the film-making process,\u201d said Crow. \u201cBut we also were just incredibly in awe of their bravery and their willingness to stand up for women across the country in filing this lawsuit and taking the stand to share their testimony.\u201d The state, ultimately, did not listen to them. On 31 May, the Texas supreme court unanimously rejected the women\u2019s legal challenge, declaring that the state abortion ban could stand as is, without clarifying when medically necessary abortions can be performed. The decision barely mentioned the women. \u201cTo know that people in the position of power feel that pregnant individuals should simply be vessels,\u201d says Dennard in the film. \u201cWe just have to keep fighting, and we have to keep talking about it, and we have to keep telling our stories, without fear.\u201d The film will be released directly for home viewing to do just that, as an explicitly urgent call to understand the stakes of abortion bans that many who do not experience them first hand do not understand. \u201cTwenty-five million women in America live under bans like this,\u201d said Perrault. \u201cIt\u2019s not only these women, it\u2019s also their partners and their children and their parents. Understanding that this issue could affect you in your lifetime is so key.\u201d The landscape for reproductive rights captured in Zurawski v Texas is staggeringly bleak, even as similar lawsuits in other four other states with near-total abortion bans, including Idaho and Tennessee, remain in legal limbo. But Duane, along with Perrault and Crow, see power in what they witnessed with the lawsuit: people \u2013 such as Zurawski\u2019s conservative family members \u2013 changing their minds and their votes through hearing the women\u2019s experiences. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now that we didn\u2019t see pre-Dobbs is that families are talking about this,\u201d said Crow. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of time before abortion is accessible again. But in a pre-Dobbs era, abortion was not accessible to so many people who needed it to begin with. If there is a restructuring of how abortion becomes more accessible, I think that that\u2019s something to be hopeful towards.\u201d Zurawski v Texas is out now in New York and Los Angeles with more cities to follow",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI love watching the Championship,\u201d Marcel Desailly says. \u201cUsually I don\u2019t watch a full 90 minutes unless I\u2019m working on a game in the studio. But I love to watch 90 minutes of Championship matches. The intensity is just incredible. And technically, they can really play.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps this was not what you were expecting to hear from a winner of the Champions League with Marseille and Milan, the World Cup and European Championship with France, an imperious defender who spent most of his career at the very highest levels of the game. But in many ways Desailly has always been an instinctively counterintuitive figure. He left Serie A when it was the best league in the world and moved to Chelsea, who weren\u2019t even the best club in London. He moved to Qatar in the mid-2000s, long before it became a global footballing powerhouse.</p> <p>His tactical and technical expertise would have made him a brilliant coach. Instead he is perfectly content to do whatever moves him: a little business, a little charity work, a little punditry, a new Fifa+ documentary series called <a href=\"https://www.plus.fifa.com/en/content/8d75a5d4-2916-4eae-b98b-c9869d0f82a5?gl=gb&amp;cid=(p_fb)(c_plusfifa)(sc_originals)\">Moment of Truth</a>, which is now available in the UK for the first time. He is speaking now from Doha, where he has been working on beIN Sport\u2019s Champions League coverage.</p>    <p>Partly as interview research and partly for pleasure, I rewatched the 1994 European Cup final between Milan and Barcelona in advance. You may have forgotten, as I did, that Desailly played that game in midfield: an utterly dominant performance in which he scored Milan\u2019s fourth goal and bullied a waifish Barcelona playmaker by the name of Pep Guardiola.</p> <p>Given the way the game has evolved in the past 30 years, I was curious. Could he still play that role today? Does it even exist?</p> <p>\u201cFrom \u201994 to \u201996 or \u201997, I was the best defensive midfielder in the market,\u201d Desailly says. \u201cI was spot on in the moment where football was not that technical, where you could use your physicality. Then in 1997, I realised that football was really changing. More technical players were coming into the system. You had Patrick Vieira, who came to Milan. You had Edgar Davids.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the beginning of these players who could use the ball \u2013 <em>tick, tick, tick</em>, one touch. And when you put pressure on them, they had the ability to turn and play the ball. My strength was to come quick, strong on you, and back in the day you knew you could get the ball. Now you have players like Kroos or Modric, Seedorf or Pirlo after me, who could play in the intervals and kill your pressing straight away.</p>    <p>\u201cThe fitness has changed a lot. And aside from fitness, the technical usage, the way everyone has ability with the ball. We were stopping it with the side of the foot. Now they put their feet on top, and move it in the orientation they want. I had a discussion with Frank Lampard once. I asked: is it really faster than when I was playing? And he replied: no, it\u2019s not faster. It\u2019s just that players have much more ability and understanding of tactics. So could I have played today as a defender? Yes. As a midfielder? No.\u201d</p> <p>It feels like a good moment to ask Desailly why he never became a coach. \u201cI did my coaching badges,\u201d he replies. \u201cThe only reason I didn\u2019t go for it is the lifestyle. I didn\u2019t want to be obsessed with only one thing in my life. Because when you are a coach, it\u2019s 100% of your soul. You need to kill the knowledge you have built over 20 years of being a soccer player, recreate a different philosophy and be able to put it in place. I wasn\u2019t ready to face the frustration.\u201d</p> <p>Desailly is also sceptical of the idea that the way to fix the governance of the game is to get more former players in positions of power. \u201cHow many of us have a university background or are willing to sit in an office?\u201d he asks. \u201cWithout the smell of the grass, without access to the players, the dressing room, the sweat? Few of us have the desire to go into that field. Besides, we had Platini. And you saw what happened to him.\u201d</p> <p>And yet none of this should be misconstrued as a kind of withdrawal or apathy. Indeed, Desailly cares deeply about the game and is fully prepared to speak out on issues that matter to him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have soccer players with opinions,\u201d he says, and in this area he speaks from experience. As a key member of the multicultural France team that lifted the World Cup in 1998 and stood up to the rising threat of the far right four years later, Desailly helped pave the way for the current generation, many of whom spoke so powerfully in similar circumstances this summer.</p> <p>\u201cThe players of the French team, diverse in their origins \u2026 are today unanimous in condemning the resurgent notions of exclusion and racism,\u201d Desailly declared in 2002 in response to the emergent threat of the Front National under their leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. Now, again, football finds itself a locus of resistance. During Euro 2024 players such as Jules Kound\u00e9, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Marcus Thuram spoke out against the rise of the rebranded Rassemblement National. With the far-right again on the march, with Le Pen\u2019s daughter Marine at the gates of power, it is tempting to ask Desailly if anything has really changed in two decades.</p> <p>But Desailly is adamant that battles have already been won. A generation ago, he reminds us, he and his teammates were fighting for the very right to be seen as French. \u201cNow,\u201d he says, \u201cwe are coming into a new era. This is the third generation. They are born in France. Although there is racism, politicians now are careful what they say. So you only go after the people who are illegal, no documentation. She [Le Pen] points only to this now.\u201d</p>    <p>He is full of admiration for Kound\u00e9 and Mbapp\u00e9, who have used their platform to speak out. \u201cSlowly, slowly, footballers are having opinions,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about racism any more, or at least not that simple. Their opinion was that the extreme right was not good for the growth of the country. So they tried to raise the attention of young people. And it\u2019s been a good thing, because they\u2019ve not been able to enter the system.\u201d Just as the FN were ultimately defeated in 2002, in the recent legislative elections the RN were beaten back into third place.</p> <p>Perhaps the lesson here is that Desailly may pick and choose his projects, but when he does he commits to them. Besides, he has always resisted being defined as one thing. Defender and midfielder; worker and leader; politician and philanthropist; French and Ghanaian; Champions League pundit and EFL aficionado. This is a man of many masks, and he wears them all with a certain contentment.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause of my wealth, I\u2019ve been able to create an academy and do a lot of charity work in Ghana, to give back a little bit. And at the same time I continue to stay very close to football. I\u2019m involved with Fifa. I\u2019m involved with Uefa. It\u2019s much more useful than being a coach, taking care of only one team. I don\u2019t know if I was a star, but I\u2019m now a legend. And through the legend, I feel the sun is shining.\u201d</p>",

Now you have players like Kroos or Modric, Seedorf or Pirlo after me, who could play in the intervals and kill your pressing straight away. \u201cThe fitness has changed a lot. And aside from fitness, the technical usage, the way everyone has ability with the ball. We were stopping it with the side of the foot. Now they put their feet on top, and move it in the orientation they want. I had a discussion with Frank Lampard once. I asked: is it really faster than when I was playing? And he replied: no, it\u2019s not faster. It\u2019s just that players have much more ability and understanding of tactics. So could I have played today as a defender? Yes. As a midfielder? No.\u201d It feels like a good moment to ask Desailly why he never became a coach. \u201cI did my coaching badges,\u201d he replies. \u201cThe only reason I didn\u2019t go for it is the lifestyle. I didn\u2019t want to be obsessed with only one thing in my life. Because when you are a coach, it\u2019s 100% of your soul. You need to kill the knowledge you have built over 20 years of being a soccer player, recreate a different philosophy and be able to put it in place. I wasn\u2019t ready to face the frustration.\u201d Desailly is also sceptical of the idea that the way to fix the governance of the game is to get more former players in positions of power. \u201cHow many of us have a university background or are willing to sit in an office?\u201d he asks. \u201cWithout the smell of the grass, without access to the players, the dressing room, the sweat? Few of us have the desire to go into that field. Besides, we had Platini. And you saw what happened to him.\u201d And yet none of this should be misconstrued as a kind of withdrawal or apathy. Indeed, Desailly cares deeply about the game and is fully prepared to speak out on issues that matter to him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have soccer players with opinions,\u201d he says, and in this area he speaks from experience. As a key member of the multicultural France team that lifted the World Cup in 1998 and stood up to the rising threat of the far right four years later, Desailly helped pave the way for the current generation, many of whom spoke so powerfully in similar circumstances this summer. \u201cThe players of the French team, diverse in their origins \u2026 are today unanimous in condemning the resurgent notions of exclusion and racism,\u201d Desailly declared in 2002 in response to the emergent threat of the Front National under their leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. Now, again, football finds itself a locus of resistance. During Euro 2024 players such as Jules Kound\u00e9, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Marcus Thuram spoke out against the rise of the rebranded Rassemblement National. With the far-right again on the march, with Le Pen\u2019s daughter Marine at the gates of power, it is tempting to ask Desailly if anything has really changed in two decades. But Desailly is adamant that battles have already been won. A generation ago, he reminds us, he and his teammates were fighting for the very right to be seen as French. \u201cNow,\u201d he says, \u201cwe are coming into a new era. This is the third generation. They are born in France. Although there is racism, politicians now are careful what they say. So you only go after the people who are illegal, no documentation. She [Le Pen] points only to this now.\u201d He is full of admiration for Kound\u00e9 and Mbapp\u00e9, who have used their platform to speak out. \u201cSlowly, slowly, footballers are having opinions,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about racism any more, or at least not that simple. Their opinion was that the extreme right was not good for the growth of the country. So they tried to raise the attention of young people. And it\u2019s been a good thing, because they\u2019ve not been able to enter the system.\u201d Just as the FN were ultimately defeated in 2002, in the recent legislative elections the RN were beaten back into third place. Perhaps the lesson here is that Desailly may pick and choose his projects, but when he does he commits to them. Besides, he has always resisted being defined as one thing. Defender and midfielder; worker and leader; politician and philanthropist; French and Ghanaian; Champions League pundit and EFL aficionado. This is a man of many masks, and he wears them all with a certain contentment. \u201cI\u2019m lucky,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause of my wealth, I\u2019ve been able to create an academy and do a lot of charity work in Ghana, to give back a little bit. And at the same time I continue to stay very close to football. I\u2019m involved with Fifa. I\u2019m involved with Uefa. It\u2019s much more useful than being a coach, taking care of only one team. I don\u2019t know if I was a star, but I\u2019m now a legend. And through the legend, I feel the sun is shining.\u201d",

It\u2019s something I want to do at some point in my career.\u201d But any more social visits to south Yorkshire or thoughts of playing club rugby here one day have been parked for the next fortnight at least. For now, it is about taking the next step for Radley and this developing squad. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had too many meetings about mindset yet and what our mental motivations are,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just been about training and making sure we\u2019re fit. We want to start revving up but not too far before the game. But this is a great squad with some great young players and we\u2019ll be ready to put everything on the line for England.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Well this is unexpected. Veteran French director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/27/on-my-radar-jacques-audiard-cultural-highlights\">Jacques Audiard</a> takes arguably the biggest gamble of his career with the eccentric, genre-bending, Spanish-language musical <em>Emilia P\u00e9rez</em>. Set in Mexico, it deals with female empowerment, cartel violence and the epidemic levels of disappearances in the country, as well as gender reassignment surgery and transitioning \u2013 all explored with endearingly shoddy song and dance numbers. It\u2019s a startling departure for Audiard, but in some ways it\u2019s also a consolidation of themes of reinvention that he has been exploring on and off throughout his career.</p> <p>His 1996 breakthrough picture, <em>A Self-Made Hero</em>, followed an impostor protagonist who fraudulently claimed to have been a hero of the French resistance. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/24/a-prophet-review\">A Prophet</a></em> (2009) starred Tahar Rahim, who begins the film as a friendless teenage delinquent out of his depth in an adult prison and ends it as a kingpin in organised crime. More recently there was <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/10/dheepan-observer-film-review\">Dheepan</a></em><em> </em>(2015), the story of a former Tamil Tiger who adopts a new persona as a family man claiming asylum in France. </p> <p>Alongside notions of a new identity in Audiard\u2019s work there\u2019s frequently a sense that some stain of the old one lingers, like blood splatters on a wall that show through a fresh layer of paint. Dheepan, for example, finds himself drawing on the violence of his old life in order to defend his new one. These themes, spiced up and at times somewhat overcooked, are central to the director\u2019s latest film, which is loosely inspired by a throwaway story strand in the 2018 novel <em>\u00c9coute</em> by Boris Razon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>A story this wildly outlandish, with this many tonal shifts, could only work as a musical</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When we first meet Emilia (the magnetic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/18/madonna-please-its-only-a-film-be-happy-the-star-of-emilia-perez-on-transitioning-at-46-and-making-icons-cry\">Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n</a>), she\u2019s a man. And not just any man: Manitas Del Monte is a notorious Mexican drug cartel boss. His is a hyper-macho world in which masculinity is measured in muscle and fear. But Manitas has realised that not only was he born into the wrong body, but also the wrong life. He decides to pursue gender-affirming surgery; as a woman he will leave behind cartel culture for ever by working to help its victims. To do all this, he employs Rita (Zoe Salda\u00f1a), a put-upon lawyer whose brilliant mind is wasted on drudge work for her male boss and scumbag clients. Rita locates a world-leading surgeon, organises the operation, engineers Manitas\u2019s disappearance and relocates his grieving wife, Jessi (Selena Gomez), and two children to a place of safety. And Emilia\u2019s isn\u2019t the only transition. The already bonkers premise gets weirder: the film itself changes identity as the story unfolds, from a gritty crime thriller to a glitzy soap opera to an Almod\u00f3var-esque melodrama, all tied together with song and dance interludes.</p> <p>It\u2019s this last aspect that initially feels like the biggest gamble, not least because of the variable quality of the music. There\u2019s nothing here that\u2019s claw-your-own-ears-off unlistenable, but neither is there much that you\u2019ll be humming on the way home from the cinema. Yet while it initially seems bizarre that Audiard chose to tell this story as a musical, very quickly it becomes clear that a story this wildly outlandish, with this many tonal shifts, could only work as a musical. Moments such as Rita walking out of a court of law to be greeted by the synchronised mop-wielding of a chorus of singing cleaning ladies acts as a crucial shortcut to the suspension of disbelief required elsewhere in the film.</p>    <p>I\u2019m conflicted over <em>Emilia P\u00e9rez</em>. On the one hand it\u2019s a gloriously trashy and flamboyant potboiler. The performances are great fun: Salda\u00f1a\u2019s musical numbers crackle with energy and anger; trans actor Gasc\u00f3n stalks through the picture like an immaculately manicured lioness. And Gomez is just phenomenal as the bratty trophy wife who gets a taste of fulfilment and will burn the world down for more of it. It\u2019s a riotously entertaining one-off. On the other hand is the question of whether the earnest but somewhat pulpy handling of cartel violence trivialises the matter.</p> <p>The scale of abductions and disappearances in Mexico is a national tragedy that many of the country\u2019s film-makers have addressed, in dramas such as Fernanda Valadez\u2019s <em>Identifying Features</em><em> </em>and Amat Escalante\u2019s <em>Lost in the Night</em><em>, </em>and Tatiana Huezo\u2019s documentary <em>Tempestad</em>. <em>Emilia P\u00e9rez</em>, though, is somewhat removed from the realities of cartel activities in Mexico, not only through the use of fantasy elements and musical devices, but because it was shot on a sound stage in France, with no Mexican actors in the central roles, by a director who doesn\u2019t speak Spanish. This would undermine the film\u2019s authenticity but for the fact that authenticity was never going to be the main priority of a movie that contains a boisterous musical number about vaginoplasty. And perhaps that\u2019s enough. <em>Emilia P</em><em>\u00e9rez</em> might not have anything new to say about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/26/mexico-anti-monuments-missing-students-ayotzinapa\">more than 100,000 people</a> who have disappeared in Mexico since records began in the 1960s. The film\u2019s messaging on female empowerment and living authentically might border on the trite. The means of delivering that message, however, does at least feel genuinely fresh and new.</p> <ul> <li><p>In select UK and Irish cinemas/<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81901696\">on Netflix from 13 November</a></p></li> </ul>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxe38aKLsXI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fxe38aKLsXI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxe38aKLsXI\">Watch a trailer for Emilia P\u00e9rez.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

His 1996 breakthrough picture, A Self-Made Hero, followed an impostor protagonist who fraudulently claimed to have been a hero of the French resistance. A Prophet (2009) starred Tahar Rahim, who begins the film as a friendless teenage delinquent out of his depth in an adult prison and ends it as a kingpin in organised crime. More recently there was Dheepan (2015), the story of a former Tamil Tiger who adopts a new persona as a family man claiming asylum in France. Alongside notions of a new identity in Audiard\u2019s work there\u2019s frequently a sense that some stain of the old one lingers, like blood splatters on a wall that show through a fresh layer of paint. Dheepan, for example, finds himself drawing on the violence of his old life in order to defend his new one. These themes, spiced up and at times somewhat overcooked, are central to the director\u2019s latest film, which is loosely inspired by a throwaway story strand in the 2018 novel \u00c9coute by Boris Razon. When we first meet Emilia (the magnetic Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n), she\u2019s a man. And not just any man: Manitas Del Monte is a notorious Mexican drug cartel boss. His is a hyper-macho world in which masculinity is measured in muscle and fear. But Manitas has realised that not only was he born into the wrong body, but also the wrong life. He decides to pursue gender-affirming surgery; as a woman he will leave behind cartel culture for ever by working to help its victims. To do all this, he employs Rita (Zoe Salda\u00f1a), a put-upon lawyer whose brilliant mind is wasted on drudge work for her male boss and scumbag clients. Rita locates a world-leading surgeon, organises the operation, engineers Manitas\u2019s disappearance and relocates his grieving wife, Jessi (Selena Gomez), and two children to a place of safety. And Emilia\u2019s isn\u2019t the only transition. The already bonkers premise gets weirder: the film itself changes identity as the story unfolds, from a gritty crime thriller to a glitzy soap opera to an Almod\u00f3var-esque melodrama, all tied together with song and dance interludes. It\u2019s this last aspect that initially feels like the biggest gamble, not least because of the variable quality of the music. There\u2019s nothing here that\u2019s claw-your-own-ears-off unlistenable, but neither is there much that you\u2019ll be humming on the way home from the cinema. Yet while it initially seems bizarre that Audiard chose to tell this story as a musical, very quickly it becomes clear that a story this wildly outlandish, with this many tonal shifts, could only work as a musical. Moments such as Rita walking out of a court of law to be greeted by the synchronised mop-wielding of a chorus of singing cleaning ladies acts as a crucial shortcut to the suspension of disbelief required elsewhere in the film. I\u2019m conflicted over Emilia P\u00e9rez. On the one hand it\u2019s a gloriously trashy and flamboyant potboiler. The performances are great fun: Salda\u00f1a\u2019s musical numbers crackle with energy and anger; trans actor Gasc\u00f3n stalks through the picture like an immaculately manicured lioness. And Gomez is just phenomenal as the bratty trophy wife who gets a taste of fulfilment and will burn the world down for more of it. It\u2019s a riotously entertaining one-off. On the other hand is the question of whether the earnest but somewhat pulpy handling of cartel violence trivialises the matter. The scale of abductions and disappearances in Mexico is a national tragedy that many of the country\u2019s film-makers have addressed, in dramas such as Fernanda Valadez\u2019s Identifying Features and Amat Escalante\u2019s Lost in the Night, and Tatiana Huezo\u2019s documentary Tempestad. Emilia P\u00e9rez, though, is somewhat removed from the realities of cartel activities in Mexico, not only through the use of fantasy elements and musical devices, but because it was shot on a sound stage in France, with no Mexican actors in the central roles, by a director who doesn\u2019t speak Spanish. This would undermine the film\u2019s authenticity but for the fact that authenticity was never going to be the main priority of a movie that contains a boisterous musical number about vaginoplasty. And perhaps that\u2019s enough. Emilia P\u00e9rez might not have anything new to say about the more than 100,000 people who have disappeared in Mexico since records began in the 1960s. The film\u2019s messaging on female empowerment and living authentically might border on the trite. The means of delivering that message, however, does at least feel genuinely fresh and new.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of health workers have called on the General Medical Council to stop suspending doctors imprisoned for peaceful climate activism ahead of a trial which could see the first jailing of a working GP for a non-violent climate protest in the UK. Two retired GPs have been suspended by GMC-convened tribunals this year after receiving short sentences for non-violent offences during Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain protests in 2021 and 2022. The medical regulator did not express concerns about the doctors\u2019 clinical capabilities but said their actions undermined public confidence in the profession. Their treatment angered many medics, with the British Medical Association describing one suspension as \u201cmalicious\u201d and claiming the GMC had created a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d. Last week, an open letter objecting to the GMC\u2019s hardline approach and signed by 464 GPs, hospital doctors, consultants and nurses, as well as public figures including Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, and the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, was delivered to the regulator\u2019s London offices.

Doctors had the right to express their personal opinions on issues including climate change, the GMC said. \u201cHowever when doctors\u2019 protesting results in law-breaking, they must understand that it is their actions in breaking the law, rather than their motivations, that will be under scrutiny,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cPatients and the public have a high degree of trust in doctors, that trust can be put at risk when doctors fail to comply with the law.\u201d",

Heart-popping excitement (my own, and maybe yours too) greeted the musician\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/25/kate-bush-shares-plans-to-make-new-music-ive-got-lots-of-ideas\">surprise appearance</a> last week on Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, speaking to presenter Emma Barnett.</p> <p>Bush, 66, was talking about her new four-minute animation, <em><a href=\"https://www.katebush.com/news_article/meet-little-shrew/\">Little Shrew</a></em>. Inspired by the horrors of war, and the Ukraine-Russia conflict in particular, playing through it is the track Snowflake from her 2011 album <em>50 Words for Snow</em> featuring her son Bertie\u2019s vocals. The animation is <a href=\"https://www.katebush.com/\">heartfelt, exquisitely done</a> (Bush would like donations to be made to the <a href=\"https://www.warchild.org.uk/\">War Child</a> charity). Bush also spoke about how she had \u201clots of ideas\u201d for a new album.</p> <p>With that, the interview was over, leaving me almost fitting in the kitchen. A new album? Barnett audibly gasped when Bush said it, though, with all due respect, she needs to get over herself \u2013 acting as if she\u2019s Kate Bush\u2019s best friend. Fact is, I am Kate Bush\u2019s best friend, even though I\u2019ve never met her. In my soul, where it matters, Kate Bush and I are best friends. Which admittedly looks strange written down, verging on troubling, but fellow Bush-heads might know what I mean.</p> <p>What is it about Bush and her fans, and her female fans in particular? One radio interview and we\u2019re transported into Kate-mode, which, for me, means going about my normal day (walking the dog; prodding at the supermarket self-checkout screen), booming her music on headphones, feeling thrilling, otherworldly, impetuous. Other female musicians can be exciting: Beyonc\u00e9 dropping country music albums (yes!); Taylor Swift conquering the known pop universe (why not?). Bush, however, only has to murmur about \u201cnew ideas\u201d and some of us feel all the molecules in our bodies rearranging themselves.</p> <p>Do men understand the effect Bush has on so many women: how \u201cother\u201d she makes us feel? I\u2019m sometimes surprised myself by my Kate-worship. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s snuck through the net as British pop culture\u2019s only forgivable prog-hippy. And yet love her unreservedly I do. Obviously, it\u2019s a lot to do with the music. Bush isn\u2019t just another musician, she\u2019s an entire genre. And, with perma-reclusive Bush truly the JD Salinger of music (just as the last album was in 2011, the most recent live shows were in 2014), everything she touches has rarity value.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also because she\u2019s our Kate: the cultural trigger for the secret part of every outwardly sensible woman who wants to jack everything in (yes, all of it) and devote her life to floaty dancing in leotards and diaphanous skirts. Or fancies slipping into a hot Victorian nightie and running barefoot across a windswept moor towards a Heathcliff-esque lover, however brooding and dodgy he might be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt \u2018called\u2019 to be a wild-haired Kate-alike (sadly, the effect was more Saxon roadie)</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was the same when I listened to Bush as a teenager. This was no ordinary fandom. I felt \u201ccalled\u201d to be a wild-haired Kate-alike (sadly, the effect was more Saxon roadie). I&nbsp;embraced the \u201cfloaty dancer\u201d within (alas, I was about as ethereal as a house brick). This is what Bush\u2019s music has always given female fans, young and old: a Great Escape from the crushing daily grind.</p> <p>In 2022, the Netflix show <em>Stranger Things</em> used the 1985 track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao\">Running Up That Hill</a>, putting Bush back at the top of the charts, and winning her a huge Gen Z audience. On the whole, hardcore Bush fans were pleased (younger audiences were entitled to their Kate fix), but maybe also a tad territorial. Did these whippersnappers even know of Bush\u2019s wider oeuvre: <em>The Red Shoes</em>? <em>Aerial</em>? <em>The Kick Inside</em>? Did they love our queen <em>enough</em>? It was, in effect, a generational bridling. Telling? I\u2019d say so. People didn\u2019t get this possessive when Gen Z embraced Rick Astley.</p> <p>Female musicians also revere her. When Bush was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame last year, early in the process, a voter said they hadn\u2019t heard much of her work, and Hole\u2019s Courtney Love <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/courtney-love-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-b2301705.html\">tweeted</a>: \u201cBro!

They were beaten 30-blot the last time they played New Zealand in the Pacific Championship \u2013 the biggest defeat in their 116-year history. But they overcame an enemy with 53% of possession to score four tries and kick away to a 12-point victory.</p> <p>New Zealand were disciplined but rusty with Shaun Johnson\u2019s return from retirement leaving their backline moves a little rusty. Despite dominating the middle \u2013 both Joseph Tapine, James Fisher-Harris and debutant Keano Kini ran for more than 200 metres \u2013 the ability of Australia\u2019s back three to reel in Johnson\u2019s bombs and return them with interest proved crucial. The Kiwis will need to find more continuity and creativity from more of their backline if they\u2019re to overwhelm Tonga next week.</p> <p>Kangaroos winger Zac Lomax had a day to remember with a clutch of spectacular leaps and robust finishes earning him two tries and three goals for a 14-point haul that outscored New Zealand on his own. It books the Kangaroos a berth in the Pacific Championship final and sends New Zealand to sudden death football, with a win against Tonga next week their only chance of defending their 2023 title against the old enemy in Parramatta next Sunday.</p> <p>Ultimately, Mal Meninga\u2019s men defended their way to victory, making more tackles and defending for long stretches before launching blistering counter-attacks through Lomax, Dylan Edwards and Turbo Tom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NRL/status/1850432668929810651\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TOO STRONG \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PacificChamps?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PacificChamps</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PzXNbITiHx\">pic.twitter.com/PzXNbITiHx</a></p>&mdash; NRL (@NRL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRL/status/1850432668929810651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-27T07:52:04.958Z\">at 7.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-671de4ef8f08d3f94c2babf7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-27T07:02:01.176Z\">7.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>79th minute:</strong> Lomax fumbles with the line open in front of him!

Bad error from the Kiwis and it sets the Kangaroos up for a raid. Harry Grant injects himself, scurrying 15m and getting a fast play-the-ball back to Moses who finds Yeo. Australia are 10m out and Lindsay Collins tries to recreate his heroics of the first half but this time the line doesn\u2019t bend let alone break.

A powerful charge by Griffin Neame gives Johnson time to send his 10th bomb of the day at Edwards and this time the Penrith fullback beats the first chaser and scampers 15m.

Johnson\u2019s long kick on the fifth has Edwards and Lomax looking at each other in befuddlement and again Australia are running it out of their own 10m.

The Kangaroos won the acreage battle with 850m won to New Zealand\u2019s 812 but Australia\u2019s three line breaks have proven crucial. Although New Zealand could rightly claim to have been the better of the sides, it was the men in green and gold who have taken their opportunities since blowing their first \u2013 a clumsy fumble by Angus Crichton who bobbled the ball over the line while attempting a one-handed touchdown. Ouch! But this Test is far from won. Stacey Jones\u2019s side have shown a willingness to offload and kick their way to points with Shaun Johnson\u2019s boot fast finding its radar. But the home side have made more tackles (205-190) and missed more too (16-13) so, at the end of a long NRL season, fitness could be a factor late in the game.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the <strong>Australian Pacific Championship men\u2019s match between Australia and New Zealand</strong>.</p> <p>Apollo Projects Stadium in Christchurch has already played host to a thrilling women\u2019s Test in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/oct/27/new-zealand-vs-australia-womens-rugby-league-test-live-blog-updates-scores-results-kick-off-time-christchurch-new-zealand\">Australia\u2019s Jillaroos beat New Zealand\u2019s Kiwi Ferns by 14-0</a>. But its green fields will be at a very literal fever pitch for the boys after the events of last year.</p> <p>Today is the first meeting between the fierce Trans Tasman rivals since New Zealand\u2019s thumping 30-0 victory in the Pacific Championship final in 2023. Not only was it the biggest international defeat in the 116 years of Australian rugby league history, it was the first time the Kangaroos had been held scoreless in almost two decades.</p> <p>Mal Meninga\u2019s team launched its 2024 campaign with a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/18/australia-kangaroos-vs-tonga-jillaroos-v-png-orchids-pacific-championships-rugby-league-test-match-report-results-scores\"> clunky 18-0 win over Tonga </a>last Friday. That side featured just seven players from the hammering in Hamilton last year. Meninga has been ruthless in selecting his squad for this revenge mission. Kangaroos captain James Tedesco, and State of Origin skippers Jake Trbojevic and Daly Cherry-Evans have all been dumped and Penrith\u2019s Isaah Yeo takes over as captain.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s stung for the last 12 months,\u201d Yeo says of 2023\u2019s record drubbing. \u201cIt was a really disappointing way to finish the season.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Pacific Championship double-header here in Christchurch. Australia walks away with the chocolates from both fixtures, the Jillaroos winning 14-0 in the first match and the Kangaroos bounding to victory 22-10 in the second. We\u2019ll be back with coverage of the final in the days to come. On behalf of the G-forces, thanks for your company and we\u2019ll leave you with the full report: Australia have their revenge! They were beaten 30-blot the last time they played New Zealand in the Pacific Championship \u2013 the biggest defeat in their 116-year history. But they overcame an enemy with 53% of possession to score four tries and kick away to a 12-point victory. New Zealand were disciplined but rusty with Shaun Johnson\u2019s return from retirement leaving their backline moves a little rusty. Despite dominating the middle \u2013 both Joseph Tapine, James Fisher-Harris and debutant Keano Kini ran for more than 200 metres \u2013 the ability of Australia\u2019s back three to reel in Johnson\u2019s bombs and return them with interest proved crucial. The Kiwis will need to find more continuity and creativity from more of their backline if they\u2019re to overwhelm Tonga next week. Kangaroos winger Zac Lomax had a day to remember with a clutch of spectacular leaps and robust finishes earning him two tries and three goals for a 14-point haul that outscored New Zealand on his own. It books the Kangaroos a berth in the Pacific Championship final and sends New Zealand to sudden death football, with a win against Tonga next week their only chance of defending their 2023 title against the old enemy in Parramatta next Sunday. Ultimately, Mal Meninga\u2019s men defended their way to victory, making more tackles and defending for long stretches before launching blistering counter-attacks through Lomax, Dylan Edwards and Turbo Tom. 79th minute: Lomax fumbles with the line open in front of him! Poor Zac. He could\u2019ve had three tries. Replays show the ball from Tom Trbojevic may have been forward anyway. It doesn\u2019t matter much at this point. The whistle blows and it\u2019s Australia victorious! 78th minute: Oh no, New Zealand have fumbled on their five-metre line. That was Collins bearing down hard on the fullback and forcing the error. Matt Burton has come on to ice the game for the Kangaroos and he charges into the black mass to no avail. The Kiwis get a final chance to score here but Johnson\u2019s long pass is behind his man and the move breaks down. They\u2019re forced to kick from inside their own half and Lomax gets it to halfway. Murray and Carrigan make 10m each before Grant scoops the ball up at dummy half and dinks a kick to the corner. Coates is after it but it\u2019s bartted over the sideline. Australia will get another chance. Australia are over! It was the captain who kickstarted that try. Yeo rumbled it upfield and got the defenders second-guessing. Nikorima went in too hard on Murray and instead Edwards loomsedup on the right at high velocity. He dummied to pass but shot through like a rat up a drainpipe and ran away before offloading to Moses who scores his first try for Australia \u2013 a likely matchwinner. 73rd minute: New Zealand know there\u2019s too much sand through the hourglass so the high-risk plays are coming. This time it\u2019s a Johnson bomb and a Warbrick bat-back for support. Tommy Turbo is there for Australia and he spills it but the Kiwis erred first and the Kangaroos win the ball back. 70th minute: Game on! Joseph Tapine charges it back over halfway and offloads but the last tackle option isn\u2019t there and Johnson is stuck in back-play so it all falls over. Australia scramble it out of trouble through Moses but Sorenson has given away a penalty by trying to scruff it from his grasp on the ground. Bad error from the Kiwis and it sets the Kangaroos up for a raid. Harry Grant injects himself, scurrying 15m and getting a fast play-the-ball back to Moses who finds Yeo. Australia are 10m out and Lindsay Collins tries to recreate his heroics of the first half but this time the line doesn\u2019t bend let alone break. Good defence from the Kiwis and they shut down Dearden on the last to win the handover. The Kiwis hit back! Just as Kodi Nikorima answered the distress call from his coach, Scott Sorensen ripped a hole down the right side and Joseph Tapine was there to catch the offload. Then Johnson swooped in and shifted it to the other side, spearing a beautiful kick crossfield which Will Warbrick snatches from the sky, shrugs off a tackler and scores! 63rd minute: New Zealand are officially in trouble now. Despite all that possession they have simply not been able to convert pressure into points. Australia\u2019s back three of Lomax, Edwards and Coates have been exceptional in their bomb diffusal and kick returns. Still no sign of a spark like Nikorima. The Dolphins dynamo is still in his trackies on the sideline. Meanwhile, Australia are back at the halfway\u2026 Tom Trbojevic made the bust but he didn\u2019t get the try. But being the team man he is, Turbo hung around was there a couple of sets later at dummy half to jink to the blindside and find Harry Grant who pivoted and got the ball back to Zac Lomax who, again, takes on two defenders and reels out of the clutches of both to get the ball down in the corner. He misses the kick but is having a real day out here. 56th minute: Another pinpoint Johnson kick has Australia are pinned in their own quarter. Edwards is under siege by the time he reels it in and Moses is forced to kick it out of trouble. Now it\u2019s Murray and Yeo chasing hard to shut down these waves of Kiwi attack before they start. A powerful charge by Griffin Neame gives Johnson time to send his 10th bomb of the day at Edwards and this time the Penrith fullback beats the first chaser and scampers 15m. Lomax comes in to helop him and they get it to halfway with the help of Carrigan. Yeo is there to launch the next wave and here comes Turbo\u2026. 54th minute: New Zealand have had all the possession in this half but the scoreline has remained static. They have now had 58% of possession in this Test match but remain six points in arrears. Surely a triggerman like Kodi Nikorima isn\u2019t far away for the Kiwis. Johnson\u2019s long kick on the fifth has Edwards and Lomax looking at each other in befuddlement and again Australia are running it out of their own 10m. Carrigan is back on and he gets it to 40 where Tom Dearden stabs a scratchy kick over the left sideline. 47th minute: Bang! With New Zealand heating up in the red zone, Mitch Barnett tried to put a massive shot on the Kiwi No 16 and bounced back five metres in a huge backfire! Now it\u2019s the home side, roared on by a huge Christchurch crowd, turning the screws. Johnson wins another set of six and attempts to loop his supporting runners. Finally he floats a Harbour Bridge pass to Isaako on the wing but the altitude of the ball has slowed the momentum and it gives Coates and Tabuai-Fidow time to bundle him into touch. 45th minute: No try is the ruling! Crichton breathes easily, having wiped his slate clean. Australia try a short restart but it doesn\u2019t come off and New Zealand are pressing. Only an incredible tackle by Cameron Murray stops Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad crossing. Now we\u2019ve got some fisticuffs as players converge from everywhere to let off steam. Ashley Klein does a good job getting the handbags on ice and we resume. Johnson straight away spears a kick to the left corner and Lomax marks it beautifully mid-air. But he had help from an escort and New Zealand win a penalty. 44th minute: Lovely grubber on the last by Johnson means Xavier Coates has to bat it over the dead ball lijne. Australia reef a huge kick downfield \u2013 almost 70m by Moses but New Zealand run it back at speed and there are gaps opening up in the green and gold line. Johnson grubbers again on the last. He\u2019s aiming for the post and he hits it! It\u2019s bounced perpendicular to the line and Crichton has tried to force it. But has he? The big Roosters enforcer has already fumbled a try. Has he saved one now to make amends? 42nd minute: Australia kick it long and it\u2019s Fischer-Harris hammering into Reuben Cotter from the restart. Johnson\u2019s riposte is straight into Dylan Edward\u2019s breadbasket but his offload is high and loose and unnecessary and it\u2019s almost fumbled. And now Harry Grant fumbles in contact with James Fisher-Harris bearing down. Nervous start by the visitors and New Zealand on the attack! Players are running back onto the field for the final 40 minutes. Here we go! That was a fierce half of football! New Zealand edged Australia 51%-49% for possession and outshone them in completions with an impressive 17/18 sets to Australia\u2019s 17/20. The Kangaroos won the acreage battle with 850m won to New Zealand\u2019s 812 but Australia\u2019s three line breaks have proven crucial. Although New Zealand could rightly claim to have been the better of the sides, it was the men in green and gold who have taken their opportunities since blowing their first \u2013 a clumsy fumble by Angus Crichton who bobbled the ball over the line while attempting a one-handed touchdown. Ouch! But this Test is far from won. Stacey Jones\u2019s side have shown a willingness to offload and kick their way to points with Shaun Johnson\u2019s boot fast finding its radar. But the home side have made more tackles (205-190) and missed more too (16-13) so, at the end of a long NRL season, fitness could be a factor late in the game. We\u2019ll be back with the second half shortly\u2026 Lomax makes the Kiwis pay for that moment of indiscretion by potting an easy two points and extending Australia\u2019s lead to a converted try as the players head to the shed for halftime. A high quality contest takes a breath and it\u2019s the Kangaroos ascendant. 38th minute: Australia with their tails up now. Yeo and Crichton charge it to the halfway on the fourth and they win a six-again decision. Cam Murray swoops in for a low-trajectory lunge into the New Zealand 22. And now frustration by the Kiwis as Barnett is stripped of the ball. Yeo points at the sticks. He wants the two points \u2013 and a breather. Great bust by Tom Trbojevic showing class to take on the line and jink between two men. He sprints inside and who\u2019s looming in support but Zac Lomax? The new Parramatta recruit does superbly to take the pass 15 metres out and barrel through two defenders to dive over in the corner. Great try by Australia! Lomax misses the kick but it\u2019s Australia back in the lead here in Christchurch. 33rd minute: A successful challenge by New Zealand sets them up on the 30m line. Marata Niukore is on for the Kiwis in place of Naufahu Whyte and the fresh legs pay off as he sets up Sorenson for a big charge up the middle. Crichton wraps him up and Jiohnson\u2019s bomb is straight at Edwards but Hiku has taken him out with no eyes for the ball whatsoever and Australia will win the penalty. Collins runs it out of the red zone. 30th minute: Mitch Barnett is on the field and he charges it out of trouble for Australia. Dylan Edwards puts it on the toe this time and it\u2019s a long raking kick to the New Zealand line. They return it with interest throughb Kini and Tapine and Johnson\u2019s fifth tackle bomb almost creates a collision between Lomax and Coates. Crisis averted as the catch is taking cleanly. Now it\u2019s Yeo creating second-phase fever for Australia and finding Harry Grant on his hip. The contest has settled now. Who will blink first? New Zealand run it on the last this time and fast hands and a basketball lob over the top get sthem over in the corner! Great stuff by the home side. Shaun Johnson found the space and Keano Kini created the second-phase opportunity to pop the ball back to Jamayne Isaako who dotted down in the corner and even it up on the scoreboard. Isaako then curls it in from the right line to convert. Beautiful kick in high wind. 6-all! 25th minute: New Zealand return the ball ov er halfway through Peta Hiku and Jamayne Isaako who are looking to convert the home side\u2019s domination to the scoreboard. No dice on this set and Australia\u2019s counter ends with another Moses hanger and a huge Lomax leap that almost comes off. Great leap by Lomax! A penalty to New Zealand gets them a set restart on halfway. 21st minute: Collins takes a bit of gloss off his try by giving away a penalty for a high tackle. Can the Kiwis hit back here? Johnson goes deep with his passes and Tapine makes a half break. But a loose wide pass from Johnson the other way misses its mark and New Zealand lose 30-metres of territory \u2013 and possession. The Kiwis are looking a little disjointed now, that\u2019ll happen when you recall a playmaker to international duties with rust on him. Now Turbo and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow are launching a counter-attack on the left\u2026 That try was against the run of play but Australia will take it. They butchered their first chance to touch down but have made the most of that bust. Collins showed great innovation to switch the attack and sow chaos in the defensive line. That split second and his brute power created the bust and the big Rooster showed great toe to sprint away. Lomax adds the extras for Australia. 16th minute: A fumble from Jopseph Tapine has handed the ball back to Cameron Murray and the Rabbitohs tyro slugs it out of trouble for Australia. Carrigan goes with him and Australia are rumbling here. And bang! Lindsay Collins changes the angle and two Kiwi defenders collide as he splits the black line and sprints 40 metres to score! 14th minute: Here come the Kiwis and they get within a body length of the stripe before reefing it back to Johnson who spears a kick at the left corner this time. Lomax clears under pressure and the men in black will resume their assault. Oh no! Moses has muffed his clearance and it hasn\u2019t gone the 10 metres. Batten down the hatches Kangaroos! 12th minute: New Zealand get it within 20m of the Kangaroos line and this time Johnson\u2019s kick finds Dylan Edwards. Not enough chasers there but they amend their ways with robust defence in the next three tackles and Moses is happy to clear. New Zealand are winning the battle for territory and now have a penalty for interference in the ruck. Yeo will challenge this\u2026 but he loses. He was crowding the tackler and that forced the fumble. Challenge gone after 12 minutes and New Zealand on the attack! 10th minute: Good deception by Johnson gives New Zealand a sniff in the red zone and now they get six again. James Fisher-Harris has put his side on his back, that\u2019s two charges in the set and it gets Johnson the time he needs to kick it to the corner. But again Coates is clean in the air and now Turbo Tom gets a little space as he chases a fifth try from his last five Tests. But now Moses has erred \u2013 his fifth tackle kick skids off the side of the boot and goes out on the full. New Zealand resume on the 40m line. 6th minute: New Zealand try to make their arrogant cousins from across the ditch pay for that terrible error. They barrel it deep into enemy territory but the fifth tackle bomb is hauled in with ease and Australia roll it back. It gets to the fifth and Moses puts it on the boot\u2026 and what a jump by Lomax! He flew six feet off the ground and took it cleanly but his alley-oop inside gave it back to the Kiwis. 4th minute: Hang on a second! Crichton has dropped the ball over the line. An early contender for Pelican of the Day. Good grief! This will be called back. Crichton did all the hard work, juggling the ball and retrieving it as he spun a 360 but in putting the ball down one-handed he has let it slip. What a shocker by the Roosters hardman! 3rd minute: First penalty of the game goes to Australia. Zac Lomax went high and referee Ashley Klein has pinged the home side for an escort. Here come the Kangaroos 10 metres out. Tom Trbojevic makes a half biust and New Zealand bend and scatter. Now comes the chance. Moses takes it left and creates the space and on the next tackle Dearden spins it to Crichton on the charge and he spins, juggles and scores! 2nd minute: Isaah Yeo and Angus Crichton lead the early charges but Pat Carrigan makes the biggest dent. Moses puts it into the right corner where Warbrick takes it safely. New Zealand return it to the halfway before Johnson puts it back at Xavier Coates who breaks one tackle before being hauled down by the second. New Zealand send it skyward and we are away in the Pacific Championship grudge match! The Kiwis went with the throat-slitting version of the Haka \u2013 a sure sign they want to give the crowd Australian blood. Harry Grant\u2019s smirked response should add a little more fuel to the fire for the home side and the sea of black in the stands today. Teams are in their final huddles and kick off is nigh\u2026 Time for the anthems. The Kangaroos have their arms around each other and are doing their best to lend some volume to a pretty tepid rendition of Advance Australia Fair played with a drum machine backbeat that sounds like a MIlli Vanilli remix. Unsurprisingly, God Save New Zealand fares better. Lots of passionate fans lending it gusto from the grandstand. Tears are flowing from the men in black. They look up for it. And that\u2019s pre-Haka! Players are taking the field to cheers and jeers respectively. A crowd in excess of 17,000 has crammed into Apollo Projects for the first rugby league Test in Christchurch since 1989 and they have welcomed their ancient enemies with a rousing wave of boos. Kangaros coach Mal Meninga has admitted last week\u2019s showing against Tonga was \u201cclunky\u201d but says he was \u201chappy with the mentality\" his men brought to the contest. Australia not only have the spectre of last year\u2019s 30-0 shellacking to shake off but the weight of history is firmly against them. The Kiwis have won their past three Tests against the Kangaroos on New Zealand soil, and are undefeated against Australia since 2012. Moreover, New Zealand have won their last seven Tests on home soil! Latest Team News Kiwis: New Zealand have made a late change with Naufahu Whyte to start and Griffin Neame shifted to the bench. Captain James Fisher-Harris has five Test debutants to lead into battle in fullback Keano Kini, winger Will Warbrick, hooker Phoenix Crossland, prop Naufahu Whyte and Jordan Riki. With Jahrome Hughes injured, wily veteran Shaun Johnson has been wooed out of retirement at halfback alongside Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, who shifts to No 6 in the absence of the injured Dylan Brown. Centre Peta Hiku plays his first Test since 2022 while Kodi Nikorima makes his first appearance since 2019. Erin Clark is 18th man. Kangaroos: The Kangaroos are 1-17 with no late changes. Meninga has shown faith in the same 17 who defeated Tonga. Matt Burton hangs onto the No 14 jersey but will hope to get more than the nine minutes he played last week in Brisbane while Hudson Young (12 minutes) is also looking to play more of a role. Last week\u2019s rookie halves pairing of Mitch Moses and Tom Dearden unite again at No 7 and 6. Ben Hunt is the 18th man. Here\u2019s how the teams line up today: Australia Dylan Edwards Xavier Coates Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow Tom Trbojevic Zac Lomax Tom Dearden Mitch Moses Patrick Carrigan Harry Grant (vc) Lindsay Collins Angus Crichton Cameron Murray Isaah Yeo (c) Matt Burton Mitch Barnett Reuben Cotter Hudson Young Ben Hunt New Zealand Phoenix Crossland James Fisher-Harris (c) Peta Hiku Jamayne Isaako Shaun Johnson Keano Kini Casey McLean Griffin Neame Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad Kodi Nikorima Marata Niukore Isaiah Papali\u2019i Jordan Riki Scott Sorensen Joseph Tapine Leo Thompson Matthew Timoko Trent Toelau Will Warbrick Naufahu Whyte Our referee for today\u2019s Test is Ashley Klein The Kangaroos looked a bit ragged against the pride of Tonga last week. To rest his tired NRL finalists and rouse his rookies, Meninga fielded six debutants including Parramatta halfback Mitch Moses, who looked sharp in his first game since rupturing a bicep in July\u2019s State of Origin decider. His halves partner Tom Dearden had a mixed debut but a handful of errors were forgotten and forgiven when he scored a terrific final-minute solo try to ice the contest. For the pleasure of our Kiwi cousins and to fire up the Aussie bretheren, here\u2019s how things went the last time these two sides met in the Pacific Championship\u2026 G\u2019day and Kia ora rugby league fans! Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Australian Pacific Championship men\u2019s match between Australia and New Zealand. Apollo Projects Stadium in Christchurch has already played host to a thrilling women\u2019s Test in which Australia\u2019s Jillaroos beat New Zealand\u2019s Kiwi Ferns by 14-0. But its green fields will be at a very literal fever pitch for the boys after the events of last year. Today is the first meeting between the fierce Trans Tasman rivals since New Zealand\u2019s thumping 30-0 victory in the Pacific Championship final in 2023. Not only was it the biggest international defeat in the 116 years of Australian rugby league history, it was the first time the Kangaroos had been held scoreless in almost two decades. Mal Meninga\u2019s team launched its 2024 campaign with a clunky 18-0 win over Tonga last Friday. That side featured just seven players from the hammering in Hamilton last year. Meninga has been ruthless in selecting his squad for this revenge mission. Kangaroos captain James Tedesco, and State of Origin skippers Jake Trbojevic and Daly Cherry-Evans have all been dumped and Penrith\u2019s Isaah Yeo takes over as captain. \u201cIt\u2019s stung for the last 12 months,\u201d Yeo says of 2023\u2019s record drubbing. \u201cIt was a really disappointing way to finish the season. Those boys who were part of that last year, they get an opportunity to try and turn that around.\u201d It\u2019s a new-look New Zealand too. The men in black won\u2019t have the injured Dylan Brown, Kieran Foran, Moses Leota, Brandon Smith, Ronaldo Mulitalo, Briton Nikora and Jeremy Marshall-King. However, 32-year-old Shaun Johnson is making his big return from representative retirement and the Kiwis still boast plenty of firepower in the form of midfield musketeers Joseph Tapine, Moses Leota and James Fisher-Harris. \u201cWhat we did last year certainly set a benchmark and there\u2019s quite a few players who were involved last year that have come back again and will set standards,\u201d said coach Stacey Jones. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ve also got players that have come back that have been part of this side before, like Shaun and Peta Hiku and Kodi Nikorima, players that have tasted Test footy so the experience they bring has made my job a lot easier.\u201d Jones\u2019s side had the first week off in the Championship and are looking to secure their first back-to-back wins over Australia in a decade. A win for Australia will put them through to this year\u2019s final at Commbank Stadium in Sydney next Sunday. New Zealand\u2019s path to the final rests on today\u2019s result and next week\u2019s Test against Tonga in Auckland. A win over Australia and a loss to Tonga would see all three Pacific Cup sides finish on one win apiece, with finalists to be determined by for and against. Kickoff is 4.05pm AEDT and 6.05pm NZDT but we\u2019ll have the latest team news, the results of the coin toss and the pre-match ceremonies before action gets under way. So batten \u2018em down and buckle \u2018em up because this Test is going to be a beauty.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 2pm on a Friday at a south London police station and a 15-year-old girl is sitting across a table from two youth workers. Beneath the harsh white strip lights, she looks exhausted. Since being arrested for assault at 1.30am, she has barely slept and refused to eat anything but a few biscuits. She has been handcuffed and searched and interviewed by police officers and talked to by professionals. She is done with all the questions. She just wants to go home.</p> <p>It looks like Amani El-Aziz and Kat Taylor have a tricky job on their hands. They don\u2019t show it. Aziz, dressed in a grey tracksuit and Nikes, her hands dripping with rings and her hair gelled in curls, speaks calmly to the 15-year-old, her voice devoid of judgment. Later, she explains she got into youth work because in her circles, growing up, it was \u201cvery normal to be bored and pick a lock on a shop\u201d. Having something else to focus on \u2013 in her case, dancing \u2013 kept her from \u201cbeing on the streets\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here to talk about what happened,\u201d Aziz, 37, tells the 15-year-old and her mother, who has just arrived at the station to pick up her daughter. Taylor, 40 \u2013 wearing a leopard-print jacket and with her \u201ctoo official-looking\u201d name badge tucked away \u2013 chips in. \u201cWe\u2019re not police officers. We\u2019re not solicitors. We\u2019re not social workers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to support you.\u201d Then Taylor makes a joke. The girl gives a small laugh. They agree to meet again.</p>    <p>There may be a long road ahead, but this is the first step in a process that has the potential to change the girl\u2019s life. In the months that follow, Taylor, a former teacher, will meet up with the girl and speak to her as often as she needs. They might talk about school, friends, family, hobbies, hopes, dreams \u2013 or what she is going through. Over time, if enough trust has built up, she may be able to get a picture of the girl\u2019s story beyond what happened that night: whether she is in danger, being exploited, needs help \u2013 what\u2019s really going on.</p> <p>Five miles away, at the busy St&nbsp;Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington, 29-year-old Abdi, a youth worker for the charity Redthread, has a similar task. Like his colleagues, he often meets young people at the worst and most vulnerable times of their lives.</p> <p> After a teenage boy has been stabbed, or a schoolgirl has been assaulted in an attack posted on Snapchat, or a child has had acid thrown in their face, or been raped, or overdosed on drugs given to them by a gang, he or one of his team will walk down from their office, cross the road to the major trauma ward, and sit by the young person\u2019s bed. If they are clinically stable, aged 11-25 and being exploited, or at risk of violence, he or his team will work with them in hospital and post-discharge \u2013 typically for a few months, but sometimes for up to a year.</p> <p>For those first meetings he might bring food from McDonald\u2019s, sweets or apple juice to break the ice. He might wheel in an Xbox from the paediatric ward or hold someone\u2019s hand as they have stitches removed. They are often reluctant to talk at first. \u201cThey might\u2019ve gone from jolly, happy, living their life, to looking over their shoulder, anxious, scared, worried,\u201d Abdi says. Unless they tell him to go away, he\u2019ll keep coming&nbsp;back.</p> <p>This is the world of targeted youth work. Embedded in police stations and hospitals across London and in some \u2013 but not all \u2013 parts of the UK, there is a spattering of outreach workers such as these three: the anti-youth-violence frontline.</p> <p>London\u2019s Violence Reduction Unit (VRU), which funds the programmes in the capital, gets about \u00a331m of its roughly \u00a340m-a-year budget from the mayor\u2019s office, with the rest coming from the Home Office, the sole funder of the 19 other VRUs in England and Wales.</p> <p>Deployed after a young person is arrested or hospitalised, the outreach workers\u2019 mission is not to interrogate, gather intelligence or talk about what happened, but to build a genuine relationship with the young person \u2013 to guide, soothe and distract.</p> <p>Unlike traditional youth workers, they provide personalised, intensive, one-to-one help. The ultimate goal is to help them move on from whatever horrible thing might have happened \u2013 helping break cycles of violence and changing the trajectory of their lives. </p> <p>\u201cWe really champion that 360 turnaround,\u201d says Aziz, the south-west London team leader for the under-18s custody programme,&nbsp;Engage.</p> <p>First impressions matter, so she and her colleagues dress casually to differentiate themselves from authority figures: in tracksuits, T-shirts and trainers. After building up some rapport, the priority is to make sure the young person is safe. </p>    <p>Some are \u201cvictim offenders\u201d \u2013 being exploited to commit crimes, such as running drugs or weapons, by county lines gangs. Others are victims of sexual exploitation, mistaken identity or are simply schoolchildren caught up in arguments that have escalated.

Many, but not all, have difficult home lives affected by poverty, mental health problems, abuse or substance misuse.</p> <p>Youth workers create a \u201cgenogram\u201d \u2013 identifying the key people in a young person\u2019s life and gaps in their support network.

Meanwhile, research from Redthread, which provides youth workers in hospitals, found that 78% of young people were at lower risk of harm after engaging with their teams.</p> <p>Both programmes have now been expanded across the capital, with the VRU investing \u00a38.3m since 2020 to embed youth workers in all 12 of the Met\u2019s basic command units and in 12 key hospitals.

The \u00adborough has the highest rate of knife crime in the capital, and between July and September alone, Abdi\u2019s team at St Mary\u2019s received 96 referrals for 11- to 25-year-olds at risk of violence or exploitation.

At first glance, a schoolboy admitted to hospital after being in a car crash might not cause alarm \u2013 yet dig a bit deeper and you may find he was being driven by an adult, far from his home, in a stolen car, in the middle of the night. Sometimes the medics are too busy to get to the bottom of things. So each morning, about 9.30am, Abdi will scroll through the hospital systems \u2013 and walk around the wards \u2013 to check the trauma admissions for himself.</p> <p>Today, an unseasonably sunny day in October, is fairly typical. Abdi, who leads the youth work team, opens his emails to two referrals from doctors overnight \u2013 one involving a child thought to have been sexually exploited, and another who has been beaten up. Three young people are already on the wards, where they are being treated for stab wounds, and will each be visited by a youth worker today.</p>    <p>One teenager has been admitted to hospital after being stabbed repeatedly. He had been discharged, but was recently readmitted with an infection. Asked about his youth worker, the softly spoken teenager says: \u201cIt can be frustrating in here, like torture. But she was nice. Welcoming. She said, \u2018Anything you need, just tell me.\u2019 You get loads of other people coming in but they don\u2019t really take time.\u201d The youth worker has recently helped him apply for housing away from his current neighbourhood, so hopefully he will be safer.</p> <p>As well as seeing patients, the team meet recently discharged young people in the community, speak to surgeons and safeguarding nurses and liaise with other agencies.

Recently, a young person who had worked closely with the youth workers died after suffering complications from a stab wound. \u201cThat was really, really hard for the team,\u201d says Kirsty, Abdi\u2019s manager.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 2pm on a Friday at a south London police station and a 15-year-old girl is sitting across a table from two youth workers. Beneath the harsh white strip lights, she looks exhausted. Since being arrested for assault at 1.30am, she has barely slept and refused to eat anything but a few biscuits. She has been handcuffed and searched and interviewed by police officers and talked to by professionals. She is done with all the questions. She just wants to go home. It looks like Amani El-Aziz and Kat Taylor have a tricky job on their hands. They don\u2019t show it. Aziz, dressed in a grey tracksuit and Nikes, her hands dripping with rings and her hair gelled in curls, speaks calmly to the 15-year-old, her voice devoid of judgment. Later, she explains she got into youth work because in her circles, growing up, it was \u201cvery normal to be bored and pick a lock on a shop\u201d. Having something else to focus on \u2013 in her case, dancing \u2013 kept her from \u201cbeing on the streets\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to talk about what happened,\u201d Aziz, 37, tells the 15-year-old and her mother, who has just arrived at the station to pick up her daughter. Taylor, 40 \u2013 wearing a leopard-print jacket and with her \u201ctoo official-looking\u201d name badge tucked away \u2013 chips in. \u201cWe\u2019re not police officers. We\u2019re not solicitors. We\u2019re not social workers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to support you.\u201d Then Taylor makes a joke. The girl gives a small laugh. They agree to meet again. There may be a long road ahead, but this is the first step in a process that has the potential to change the girl\u2019s life. In the months that follow, Taylor, a former teacher, will meet up with the girl and speak to her as often as she needs. They might talk about school, friends, family, hobbies, hopes, dreams \u2013 or what she is going through. Over time, if enough trust has built up, she may be able to get a picture of the girl\u2019s story beyond what happened that night: whether she is in danger, being exploited, needs help \u2013 what\u2019s really going on. Five miles away, at the busy St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington, 29-year-old Abdi, a youth worker for the charity Redthread, has a similar task. Like his colleagues, he often meets young people at the worst and most vulnerable times of their lives. After a teenage boy has been stabbed, or a schoolgirl has been assaulted in an attack posted on Snapchat, or a child has had acid thrown in their face, or been raped, or overdosed on drugs given to them by a gang, he or one of his team will walk down from their office, cross the road to the major trauma ward, and sit by the young person\u2019s bed. If they are clinically stable, aged 11-25 and being exploited, or at risk of violence, he or his team will work with them in hospital and post-discharge \u2013 typically for a few months, but sometimes for up to a year. For those first meetings he might bring food from McDonald\u2019s, sweets or apple juice to break the ice. He might wheel in an Xbox from the paediatric ward or hold someone\u2019s hand as they have stitches removed. They are often reluctant to talk at first. \u201cThey might\u2019ve gone from jolly, happy, living their life, to looking over their shoulder, anxious, scared, worried,\u201d Abdi says. Unless they tell him to go away, he\u2019ll keep coming back. This is the world of targeted youth work. Embedded in police stations and hospitals across London and in some \u2013 but not all \u2013 parts of the UK, there is a spattering of outreach workers such as these three: the anti-youth-violence frontline. London\u2019s Violence Reduction Unit (VRU), which funds the programmes in the capital, gets about \u00a331m of its roughly \u00a340m-a-year budget from the mayor\u2019s office, with the rest coming from the Home Office, the sole funder of the 19 other VRUs in England and Wales. Deployed after a young person is arrested or hospitalised, the outreach workers\u2019 mission is not to interrogate, gather intelligence or talk about what happened, but to build a genuine relationship with the young person \u2013 to guide, soothe and distract. Unlike traditional youth workers, they provide personalised, intensive, one-to-one help. The ultimate goal is to help them move on from whatever horrible thing might have happened \u2013 helping break cycles of violence and changing the trajectory of their lives. \u201cWe really champion that 360 turnaround,\u201d says Aziz, the south-west London team leader for the under-18s custody programme, Engage. First impressions matter, so she and her colleagues dress casually to differentiate themselves from authority figures: in tracksuits, T-shirts and trainers. After building up some rapport, the priority is to make sure the young person is safe. Some are \u201cvictim offenders\u201d \u2013 being exploited to commit crimes, such as running drugs or weapons, by county lines gangs. Others are victims of sexual exploitation, mistaken identity or are simply schoolchildren caught up in arguments that have escalated. Some have been arrested for low-level offences such as trespassing, criminal damage or shoplifting. Many, but not all, have difficult home lives affected by poverty, mental health problems, abuse or substance misuse. Youth workers create a \u201cgenogram\u201d \u2013 identifying the key people in a young person\u2019s life and gaps in their support network. They might then help create a safety plan, which could mean helping them get moved to housing in another area, addressing relationships with high-risk people, or deciding on practical steps such as avoiding certain bus routes or a corner shop at night. Later, they might help the young person with a college application, finding a job, getting mental health support, returning to school if they have been excluded \u2013 as many have \u2013 or finding ways to get back into passions or hobbies: playing the drums, writing music or swimming, for example. It does not always work, and experts say these interventions can only ever be a small part of a robust violence prevention strategy. But research suggests that targeted, wraparound interventions at these key junctures in life can have a dramatic impact. Analysis from the London VRU found that, through the Engage programme, nearly 90% of young people arrested for violent offences who engaged with a youth worker (309 out of 348) were prevented from reoffending over the next 12 months. Meanwhile, research from Redthread, which provides youth workers in hospitals, found that 78% of young people were at lower risk of harm after engaging with their teams. Both programmes have now been expanded across the capital, with the VRU investing \u00a38.3m since 2020 to embed youth workers in all 12 of the Met\u2019s basic command units and in 12 key hospitals. Lib Peck, director of the London VRU, said: \u201cThat support from a trusted adult at the right time can be instrumental in changing their life trajectory.\u201d Based in Westminster, at one of four major trauma centres in London, Abdi sees the desperate need for help every day.

      "body": "<p>Alexei Navalny knew how it would end: \u201cI\u2019ll spend the rest of my life in prison and die here.\u201d He was right. On 16 February 2024, the Russian authorities announced the death of its highest profile political prisoner in colony FKU IK-3, north of the Arctic Circle. He was 47 years old.</p> <p>\u201cAll anniversaries will be celebrated without me. I\u2019ll never see my grandchildren,\u201d he writes in the chapter that forms the epilogue of <em>Patriot</em>, his posthumously published memoir. \u201cI\u2019ll be missing from all photos.\u201d It\u2019s a deliberate strategy, his \u201cprison zen\u201d to contemplate \u2013 and accept \u2013 the worst. \u201cEven if everything starts falling apart, they will bump me off at the first sign the regime is collapsing. They will poison me,\u201d Navalny tells his wife, Yulia, when she visits. When she agrees, he\u2019s ecstatic. \u201cThat was great! No tears!\u201d</p> <p>The stoicism would be remarkable but this is a man who had his underpants laced with novichok by the FSB and not only survived to tell the tale but challenged his poisoners in an early morning prank phone call (as captured in the 2022 Oscar-winning documentary, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/navalny-review-alexei-extraordinary-documentary-assassination-attempt-poisoning\">Navalny</a></em>).</p> <p>The assassination attempt forms the first chapter of <em>Patriot</em>, though Navalny, a lifelong ironist, manages to turn what should be the plot of a James Bond film into a black comedy. He\u2019s on a flight in Siberia when the nerve agent kicks in. \u201cI have been poisoned and am about to die,\u201d he manages to tell the flight&nbsp;attendant. He is wrong about that. Eighteen days later, he emerges&nbsp;from a coma in a hospital&nbsp;in Berlin,&nbsp;with his commitment to fighting Putin stronger than ever.</p> <p>Navalny was arrested as soon as he returned to Russia of course. Putin wasn\u2019t going to let him get away again and he became the most closely guarded prisoner in the country\u2019s prison system. He details the relentless and intrusive surveillance to which he was subjected: bodycams on all guards; cameras everywhere; everything logged; he even suspects that there is a high-definition camera positioned over the table where he wrote this book.</p> <p><em>Patriot</em> is a bittersweet read, not least because we now know that Navalny<em> </em>was tantalisingly close to being released in a prisoner exchange this summer. And the outpouring of grief at the news of his death was not just at the loss of the greatest political figure of his generation \u2013 the greatest president many Russians believe they never had \u2013 but the passing, too, of an alternative future that he represented.</p>    <p>Because here, on the page, is the voice of the charismatic, funny, adept communicator who for a time conjured a vision of another Russia \u2013 what he called the \u201cbeautiful Russia of the future\u201d. Navalny describes how he exploited the new digital possibilities of the internet to connect with a new generation of Russians who expected and wanted more. It was Navalny\u2019s bold and brilliant YouTube investigations into&nbsp;corruption that made him a star, and he was loathed and feared by the Kremlin for his bravery.</p> <p>His plan, he says, was to write \u201can autobiography with an intriguing thriller about uncovering an assassination attempt using chemical weapons\u201d. But then, in January 2021, just months after surviving the FSB\u2019s attempt to kill him, he returned to Moscow and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/17/alexei-navalny-detained-at-airport-on-return-to-russia\">was arrested</a> before he\u2019d even&nbsp;entered border control.</p> <p>It was another lesson in bravery.

      "bodyText": "Alexei Navalny knew how it would end: \u201cI\u2019ll spend the rest of my life in prison and die here.\u201d He was right. On 16 February 2024, the Russian authorities announced the death of its highest profile political prisoner in colony FKU IK-3, north of the Arctic Circle. He was 47 years old. \u201cAll anniversaries will be celebrated without me. I\u2019ll never see my grandchildren,\u201d he writes in the chapter that forms the epilogue of Patriot, his posthumously published memoir. \u201cI\u2019ll be missing from all photos.\u201d It\u2019s a deliberate strategy, his \u201cprison zen\u201d to contemplate \u2013 and accept \u2013 the worst. \u201cEven if everything starts falling apart, they will bump me off at the first sign the regime is collapsing. They will poison me,\u201d Navalny tells his wife, Yulia, when she visits. When she agrees, he\u2019s ecstatic. \u201cThat was great! No tears!\u201d The stoicism would be remarkable but this is a man who had his underpants laced with novichok by the FSB and not only survived to tell the tale but challenged his poisoners in an early morning prank phone call (as captured in the 2022 Oscar-winning documentary, Navalny). The assassination attempt forms the first chapter of Patriot, though Navalny, a lifelong ironist, manages to turn what should be the plot of a James Bond film into a black comedy. He\u2019s on a flight in Siberia when the nerve agent kicks in. \u201cI have been poisoned and am about to die,\u201d he manages to tell the flight attendant. He is wrong about that. Eighteen days later, he emerges from a coma in a hospital in Berlin, with his commitment to fighting Putin stronger than ever. Navalny was arrested as soon as he returned to Russia of course. Putin wasn\u2019t going to let him get away again and he became the most closely guarded prisoner in the country\u2019s prison system. He details the relentless and intrusive surveillance to which he was subjected: bodycams on all guards; cameras everywhere; everything logged; he even suspects that there is a high-definition camera positioned over the table where he wrote this book. Patriot is a bittersweet read, not least because we now know that Navalny was tantalisingly close to being released in a prisoner exchange this summer. And the outpouring of grief at the news of his death was not just at the loss of the greatest political figure of his generation \u2013 the greatest president many Russians believe they never had \u2013 but the passing, too, of an alternative future that he represented. Because here, on the page, is the voice of the charismatic, funny, adept communicator who for a time conjured a vision of another Russia \u2013 what he called the \u201cbeautiful Russia of the future\u201d. Navalny describes how he exploited the new digital possibilities of the internet to connect with a new generation of Russians who expected and wanted more. It was Navalny\u2019s bold and brilliant YouTube investigations into corruption that made him a star, and he was loathed and feared by the Kremlin for his bravery. His plan, he says, was to write \u201can autobiography with an intriguing thriller about uncovering an assassination attempt using chemical weapons\u201d. But then, in January 2021, just months after surviving the FSB\u2019s attempt to kill him, he returned to Moscow and was arrested before he\u2019d even entered border control. It was another lesson in bravery. Navalny knew he couldn\u2019t just tell his fellow Russians what to do; he had to model it. He had to show them that Putin\u2019s regime was not to be feared \u2013 it was to be defied. But the downside, from his point of view, is that his pacy thriller turned into \u201ca prison diary\u201d. Even recognising a shared experience and literary heritage with the greats of modern Russian literature such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Vladimir Bukovsky becomes material for comic irony. \u201cIt\u2019s a genre so saturated with cliches that it\u2019s impossible not to write them,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I got a dollar for every \u2018We didn\u2019t get to say goodbye\u2019 encountered in such literature, I\u2019d be like Elon Musk.\u201d But the genre refuses to die because so does Russia\u2019s appetite for jailing political dissidents.

Before the pandemic, the figure was fewer than 7,000. When looking at all cases in the Send tribunal system, rather than just newly registered ones, there has been a 43% annual rise, to 32,069. Eight years ago, the figure was below 4,500.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> has been contacted by parents who are waiting more than a year for a hearing because the \u00adservice is overstretched. </p> <p>In other cases, councils are conceding to parents\u2019 demands just before a tribunal is held, while some local authorities are failing to implement tribunal findings.</p> <p>Julie Cragg is trying to get her council to secure a non-mainstream school for her autistic six-year-old daughter, who has panic attacks at her current school and physically resists being made to attend. She has been given a tribunal date of December 2025.</p> <p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t got the capacity,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThey are overwhelmed at the moment \u2026 And in the meantime, my daughter is suffering, and not just her. The children in her mainstream class are suffering too, because my daughter takes one or two members of staff every day away from the class setting.\u201d</p>    <p>Parents have a near-100% success rate at Send tribunals. The Tribunal Procedure Committee, which makes rules on how senior tribunals work, implied in a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66e151d7865c0eef0bc42dfc/send-consultation.pdf\">consultation document</a> last month that councils are \u00addragging out tribunals to save money by not meeting the needs of Send \u00adchildren. </p> <p>\u201cThe local authority is able to delay any final outcome which might involve the use of their resources to comply with the statutory deadline to complete the EHC (education, health and care) needs assessment,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Gillian Doherty, co-director of the website Special Needs Jungle, said: \u201cDelays in accessing tribunals are causing significant disadvantage to disabled children and young people who are often unable to access suitable education and provision in the meantime, with no route of redress for missed provision. </p> <p>\u201cLocal authorities must be \u00adadequately resourced and held accountable for making \u00adlawful \u00addecisions first time.\u201d</p> <p> Maria Bloom of IPSEA, a Send legal&nbsp;charity, said: \u201cThe rising number of appeals to the Send tribunal highlights the extent to which local authorities \u00adroutinely and unlawfully deny \u00adchildren and young people with Send the special educational provision and support they are legally entitled to. &nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe hear from families every day through our helplines who are \u00adhaving to fight to secure the education their children need and are entitled to by law. With 98% of tribunal appeals finding in favour of families, it\u2019s clear that local authorities are repeatedly failing to meet their legal obligations.\u201d </p> <p>According to the thinktank Pro Bono Economics, Send tribunals cost the public sector nearly \u00a390m a year. A Local Government Association spokesperson said: \u201cThe need for reform of Send services is now \u00adunavoidable. Councils are struggling to cope with a more than doubling of children on education, health and care plans within a system that creates \u2018perverse incentives\u2019 to shift responsibility between public bodies and inadvertently creates adversarial relationships between local authorities and parents.</p> <p>\u201cWe find ourselves with a \u00adsystem weighted down by legal disputes through tribunals and an over-\u00adreliance on special schools due to a loss of parental confidence that \u00admainstream schools can meet their children\u2019s needs. We are calling for action which builds new capacity and \u00adcreates inclusion in mainstream \u00adsettings, supported by adequate and sustainable long-term funding, and the writing off of councils\u2019 high-needs deficits.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cFor too long, children and young people with Send have been let down by a system that is not working, but this government is determined to deliver change.</p> <p>\u201cUrgent work is already under way to ensure more children are getting earlier and better support to thrive in education through our curriculum and assessment review, Ofsted reforms, and new early years Send&nbsp;training.\u201d</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice said it has recruited 45 judges to sit on Send \u00adtribunals, with more to follow.</p>",

The Send tribunal deals with disputes in England between a local authority and parents or young people about provision for their education. The number of new cases registered with the Send tribunal surged from 13,083 in the year to June 2023 to 20,102 in the year to June 2024. Before the pandemic, the figure was fewer than 7,000. When looking at all cases in the Send tribunal system, rather than just newly registered ones, there has been a 43% annual rise, to 32,069. Eight years ago, the figure was below 4,500. The Observer has been contacted by parents who are waiting more than a year for a hearing because the service is overstretched. In other cases, councils are conceding to parents\u2019 demands just before a tribunal is held, while some local authorities are failing to implement tribunal findings. Julie Cragg is trying to get her council to secure a non-mainstream school for her autistic six-year-old daughter, who has panic attacks at her current school and physically resists being made to attend. She has been given a tribunal date of December 2025. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got the capacity,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cThey are overwhelmed at the moment \u2026 And in the meantime, my daughter is suffering, and not just her. The children in her mainstream class are suffering too, because my daughter takes one or two members of staff every day away from the class setting.\u201d Parents have a near-100% success rate at Send tribunals. The Tribunal Procedure Committee, which makes rules on how senior tribunals work, implied in a consultation document last month that councils are dragging out tribunals to save money by not meeting the needs of Send children. \u201cThe local authority is able to delay any final outcome which might involve the use of their resources to comply with the statutory deadline to complete the EHC (education, health and care) needs assessment,\u201d it said. Gillian Doherty, co-director of the website Special Needs Jungle, said: \u201cDelays in accessing tribunals are causing significant disadvantage to disabled children and young people who are often unable to access suitable education and provision in the meantime, with no route of redress for missed provision. \u201cLocal authorities must be adequately resourced and held accountable for making lawful decisions first time.\u201d Maria Bloom of IPSEA, a Send legal charity, said: \u201cThe rising number of appeals to the Send tribunal highlights the extent to which local authorities routinely and unlawfully deny children and young people with Send the special educational provision and support they are legally entitled to. \u201cWe hear from families every day through our helplines who are having to fight to secure the education their children need and are entitled to by law. With 98% of tribunal appeals finding in favour of families, it\u2019s clear that local authorities are repeatedly failing to meet their legal obligations.\u201d According to the thinktank Pro Bono Economics, Send tribunals cost the public sector nearly \u00a390m a year. A Local Government Association spokesperson said: \u201cThe need for reform of Send services is now unavoidable. Councils are struggling to cope with a more than doubling of children on education, health and care plans within a system that creates \u2018perverse incentives\u2019 to shift responsibility between public bodies and inadvertently creates adversarial relationships between local authorities and parents. \u201cWe find ourselves with a system weighted down by legal disputes through tribunals and an over-reliance on special schools due to a loss of parental confidence that mainstream schools can meet their children\u2019s needs. We are calling for action which builds new capacity and creates inclusion in mainstream settings, supported by adequate and sustainable long-term funding, and the writing off of councils\u2019 high-needs deficits.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cFor too long, children and young people with Send have been let down by a system that is not working, but this government is determined to deliver change. \u201cUrgent work is already under way to ensure more children are getting earlier and better support to thrive in education through our curriculum and assessment review, Ofsted reforms, and new early years Send training.\u201d The Ministry of Justice said it has recruited 45 judges to sit on Send tribunals, with more to follow.",

And then they scream,\u201d says Dr <a href=\"https://www.drvondawright.com/\">Vonda Wright</a>, a campaigning American orthopaedic surgeon and the author of <em>Fitness After 40: How to Stay Strong at Any Age</em>.</p> <p>Two-thirds of osteoporosis sufferers are female for a reason: when hormones plummet around menopause, bone strength declines by 10 to 20%. Fragility fractures rocket up from the late 40s onwards. Low bone mineral density means brittle bones look like a Crunchie bar inside, honeycombed with big holes.</p> <p>When Narelle Chidwick from Henley was 49, she was sent for a <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/tests-and-scans/bone-density-scan-DEXA-DXA/#:~:text=DEXA%20scan%20stands%20for%20dual,medicine%20department%20of%20the%20hospital.\">Dexa</a> (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry bone scan) by the NHS after injuring her ribs during a family skiing holiday. \u201cThey told me I had osteoporosis, a high fracture risk and very low bone density. It was at the level of an 80 or 90-year-old woman. I was shocked. I didn\u2019t see it coming. I had early menopause at 46, but I\u2019d been exercising, doing pilates, eating well.\u201d Now Chidwick and her 80-year-old father both have osteoporosis \u2013 but she is determined to try to rebuild her bones.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to identify high-risk women far earlier, long before they break a bone</p> <footer> <cite>Olivia Hum</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are three very effective early ways to protect women (and some non-binary and trans people) from fractures: muscle-building, weight-bearing exercise, along with vitamin D, magnesium and calcium-rich foods, and using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to slow bone loss and promote new growth.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to identify high-risk women far earlier, long before they break a bone,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldhealth.com/consultants/dr-olivia-hum?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyL24BhCtARIsALo0fSANjnrRouTAJ9iv7liLhoJChKuAvFXKhGryWhI7cK4gx90QMy1qckEaAgN6EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Dr Olivia Hum</a>, a GP and menopause specialist on the <a href=\"https://thebms.org.uk/\">British Menopause Society (BMS)</a> advisory council. \u201cWomen with low body mass, a history of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis in the family and those who smoke or drink heavily, or had an eating disorder. They need to know about strength training and exercise, discuss the benefits and risks of HRT and understand that it can significantly reduce fracture risk.\u201d</p> <p>The BMS consensus statement says that HRT \u201cremains an excellent option for prevention, particularly in younger women aged less than 60,\u201d helping women at low risk (with osteopenia, slightly lowered bone density) and even those with established osteoporosis.</p> <p>While it has proved almost impossible for the NHS to get the sedentary midlife population skipping ropes or lifting weights, it is easy to offer HRT to those suitable. It is approved by the NHS and the US <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/\">Food and Drug Administration</a> for strengthening bones, as the oestrogen in HRT plays a role in maintaining bone density, balancing the constant removal and regrowth that occurs in menopause. It decreases menopause symptoms, too, which often encourages women to exercise and have a healthier lifestyle.</p> <p>An <em><a href=\"https://www.endocrine.org/journals/endocrine-reviews\">Endocrine Review</a></em> meta-analysis of 57 studies showed HRT can increase bone density by 7% on average over two years and reduce spinal fractures by a third. A decade-long trial in the journal <em><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/bone\">Bone</a></em> showed HRT increased spinal density by 13%, while the untreated comparison group had 5% bone loss. We also know now that headlines two decades ago suggesting HRT increased breast cancer in the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/womens-health-initiative-whi\">Women\u2019s Health Initiative Study</a> were <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/01/menopause-hormones-hrt-safety-whi/\">exaggerated</a>, and have been debunked by menopause societies. Newer body-identical transdermal preparations, such as gels and patches are safer, too, with no increased risk of blood clots, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/benefits-and-risks-of-hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/#:~:text=HRT%20patches%2C%20sprays%20and%20gels,or%20gel%20rather%20than%20tablets.\">according to the NHS</a>.</p>    <p>Yet healthcare professionals dealing with early fractures rarely consider that option. With a research grant from <a href=\"https://menopauseintheworkplace.co.uk/\">Henpicked: Menopause in the Workplace</a>, I have worked on an investigation for months with <a href=\"https://biography.omicsonline.org/united-kingdom/university-of-northampton/dr-bill-robertsonsmith-1934360\">Dr Bill Robertson-Smith</a>, an NHS senior surgical care practitioner at Northampton General Hospital. She sent Freedom of Information requests asking for data from the NHS <a href=\"https://www.boa.ac.uk/static/41b78902-50b3-4197-86ee192efa68b4ab/233cee08-aef8-4604-b81132b119cf7351/fracture%20liaison%20services.pdf\">Fracture Liaison Services</a> (FLS) which treats osteoporosis following fractures in people over 50.</p> <p>Our data showed that in the past seven years, 356,229 women have been treated by FLS clinics. Out of those, only 169 were offered HRT afterwards. \u201cI was astonished it was so low,\u201d said Dr Robertson-Smith. \u201cAround three-quarters of those women would be over 65, but thousands of younger women in their 50s and early 60s who could benefit from HRT were never offered that option.\u201d</p> <p>Although early menopausal, Chidwick was not offered HRT by her GP, but she was prescribed <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/osteoporosis/treatment/\">bisphosphonate</a> drugs, as well as <a href=\"https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/chewable-calcium-carbonate-tablets/\">calcium carbonate</a> and vitamin D. Bisphosphonates inhibit the removal of old bone, particularly when new bone is forming less in menopause \u2013 bones are a bit like tree branches, growing, shedding and renewing all the time. Bisphosphonates cost from \u00a350 a year and are the first-line NHS treatment for men and women. But patients often complain of gastrointestinal, joint and flu-like symptoms. Due to that, and perceived lack of effect, around 40% of patients come off bisphosphonates within a year, and 85% within three. Chidwick also looked into lifestyle changes, and was exasperated to receive a hospital letter suggesting she walked for 30 minutes three times a week. \u201cI knew that wasn\u2019t anywhere near enough for bone density \u2013 I was already walking 10,000 steps a day and exercising when I got the diagnosis,\u201d she said. Chidwick did her own bone-building research online and found a trainer who was able to create a three-times-a-week strength and impact exercise programme.</p> <p>Muscles are key to osteoporosis prevention, to holding up our skeletons, explains Dr Gabrielle Lyon, American author of the bestseller <em>Forever Strong</em>. \u201cPeople think of bones as the end point of this silent disease, but low muscle mass is the first sign of low bone density. The best way to safeguard your independence is to protect your skeletal muscle mass. Muscle is the only organ system we can directly control.\u201d</p> <p>Also in the States, Dr Wright is leading the charge on female osteoporosis, academically and with a million followers on her Instagram. Wright, 57, explains: \u201cI lift heavy! You need deadlifts, squats, bench-presses, chin-ups. Four reps, four sets. You can also stomp up and down the stairs and that helps, too.\u201d She adds: \u201cBuilding muscle is the one thing you can do to save your metabolism, save your bones, prevent you from falling down and build brain resilience.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Wright also authored a groundbreaking 2024 medical paper in the journal <em><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/icmt20\">Climacteric</a></em>, which named the problem for the first time in its title: <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13697137.2024.2380363#:~:text=the%20musculoskeletal%20syndrome%20of%20menopause%20includes%2C%20but%20is%20not%20limited,gility%20with%20the%20progression%20of\">The Musculoskeletal Syndrome of Menopause</a>. \u201cThis means the collection of symptoms caused by oestrogen loss from perimenopause onwards, including joint pain, muscle weakness, decreased bone density and increased risk of arthritis and fractures. Oestrogen doesn\u2019t just increase bone density, it reduces inflammation in our joints. So many women come into my clinic with frozen shoulder at this age, not due to injury, but because of inflammation.\u201d</p> <p>In the paper, Dr Wright advocates holistically for exercise, vitamins and nutrition (one of her catchphrases is \u201cSugar bakes you from the inside,\u201d because it\u2019s inflammatory). She also calls for greater use of HRT. She says what\u2019s needed now is a study of the minimum effective doses of oestrogen for prevention. Studies show a small dose of 0.25mg/day works well, which would be good news for women who want to start HRT gently in later life, and Dr Wright said that\u2019s definitely an option. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that women here usually only get Dexa scans once they are 65, when earlier screening would mean we could halt the damage.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Hum agrees: \u201cGPs can refer you for a Dexa if you fulfil the risk criteria, but sometimes we feel as if we\u2019re just firefighting in general practice and there\u2019s so little time to talk.\u201d She suggests that women can determine their own risk using the <a href=\"https://theros.org.uk/risk-checker?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw68K4BhAuEiwAylp3kvEzHj84xAdLIVQtDVPSbHVDhsdYH0VpGXSnc_L3PjqC2TaucouxvRoCkgsQAvD_BwE&amp;campaign=77a866ee-c708-ed11-82e5-0022481b5a28\">risk-checker</a> on the Royal Osteoporosis Society website, and Dexa scans are available privately for upwards of \u00a350. She also said that with more menopause awareness, some women come in asking for HRT to protect their bones, even if they don\u2019t have serious symptoms. \u201cIt\u2019s all about individual choice and the risk-benefit balance.\u201d</p> <p>Exercise is essential as part of that balance. The science around high intensity impact training (Hiit) also interested Chidwick. Hiit is proven to improve bone density in postmenopausal women, and in the American <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28975661/\">LIFTMOR</a> trial, 101 women over 58 with osteoporosis or osteopenia were assigned to two groups. Those in the conventional exercise group had a 1% loss of bone density, while those doing supervised high-intensity impact training \u2013 squats, deadlifts and jumping chin-ups twice a week \u2013 gained almost 3% density over eight months. It worked fast.</p> <p><em><strong>Why aren\u2019t we getting that message</strong></em> out to women? \u201cBecause we\u2019re the Special K generation,\u201d says Chidwick. Gen X grew up with messages favouring skinny over strong. Remember the Special K TV challenge from two decades ago, which told women they could \u201cdrop a jeans size in two weeks\u201d by replacing two meals with bowls of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/29/breakfast-cereal-survey-health-food\">sugary cereal</a>? More than three decades after Madonna flexed her biceps on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/05/strike-a-pose-review-backstage-with-madonna-blond-ambition-dancers#:~:text=The%20year%20is%201990,With%20Madonna%20in%20the%20UK).\">Blond Ambition</a> tour, there\u2019s still a sense for older generations that muscles are male.</p> <p>Loss of muscle mass is called sarcopenia \u2013 and muscle mass can drop by 10% from early perimenopause to post-menopause. <a href=\"https://www.spirehealthcare.com/consultant-profiles/dr-radhika-vohra-p6044972/\">Dr Radhika Vohra</a>, a GP and adviser to <a href=\"https://www.themenopausecharity.org/\">the Menopause Charity</a>, agrees and wishes the NHS provided more specific information: \u201cWe\u2019d be better doing more social prescribing, sending people on the NHS for six weeks\u2019 free training at a gym \u2013 but sadly that\u2019s a postcode lottery.\u201d</p>    <p>Strong muscles make a big difference to balance, too, important if osteoporosis has been diagnosed. Dr Wright talked about the tragedy of seeing frail women after falls, in hospital gowns undergoing massive operations, asking her, \u201cwhat\u2019s happened to me? I\u2019m not who I used to be.\u201d What actually happens in hospital? I spoke to Dr Robertson-Smith one day as she emerged after working alongside a senior surgeon on a <a href=\"https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/incidence-of-peri-prosthetic-fractures-with-the-cpt-stem/\">peri-prosthetic</a> fracture: \u201cThat\u2019s when they\u2019ve had a metal hip replacement, for example, and have now fractured the bone around it, too. We\u2019ve been operating for nearly three hours on a woman in her 80s, and I\u2019ve just finished screwing a plate on to the length of the upper thigh and suturing the wound.\u201d</p> <p>The operation takes its toll on an already frail patient and, including rehab afterwards, costs the NHS about \u00a330,000, according to Dr Robertson-Smith. On the front line for the past 11 years, she has grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of preventive care. \u201cThe use of HRT wasn\u2019t part of my education in <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/other-services/Orthopaedics/LocationSearch/728\">orthopaedics</a>,\u201d she says, \u201cand medical colleagues have said the same.\u201d But medicine works in silos and menopause experts, surgeons, <a href=\"https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/doctors/roles-doctors/medicine/endocrinology-and-diabetes\">endocrinologists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/other-services/Rheumatology/LocationSearch/690\">rheumatologists</a> rarely confer. So the more complex picture is often overlooked. It\u2019s the orchestra of hormones that makes bones work.</p> <p>Dr Robertson-Smith explains: \u201cThe main role of oestrogen in bone health is to prevent bone loss, but we also know that progesterone has an important part to play in stimulating bone growth. There is also a positive association between testosterone and bone mineral density, so all of these hormones matter.\u201d Men with early low testosterone levels are more likely to get osteoporosis, too.</p> <p>NHS data shows 19% of women are on HRT, a massive increase over the past three years as public menopause knowledge has grown, so that may mean a generational improvement in osteoporosis rates. But increasing prevention would be bad news for the pharmaceutical industry, which makes $16bn worldwide annually from osteoporosis drugs. Pharmaceutical capitalism thrives on sickness care, rather than preventive care.</p> <p>What really needs to change is that preventive care should be offered to women at a much younger age, ideally in their 40s. Dr Vohra explains that the 40-plus health-check list for all women doesn\u2019t mention osteoporosis or menopause, instead concentrating on high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, body mass index, exercise and alcohol. \u201cGeneral practice gets paid to keep a register of patients already diagnosed with osteoporosis, but they don\u2019t get paid for preventing it. Yet <a href=\"https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteopenia/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw68K4BhAuEiwAylp3kj5yAGaKy3HYa7TL4bJk1xRj8Nxzu2D_UyL9od0ZLcIt6m5UnhhAXhoCKwYQAvD_BwE\">osteopenia</a> is that lovely window when you can change things for women, and we miss it.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Hum agrees: \u201cThis needs to be done at a national level. GPs need to have the time and resources so they can be involved with prevention.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Vohra has done groundbreaking research on menopause and ethnicity in the UK. A report in the journal <em>Bone</em> showed Asian women are at a similar risk of osteoporosis as white women, yet only 6% use HRT. Risk for Black women is slightly lower, but only 5% use HRT. \u201cMenopause care is lacking for people from economically deprived and ethnic backgrounds. There\u2019s more early menopause, too. Disparities in nutrition, education and poverty mean women are losing bone mineral density earlier and are less likely to get help. We need to be proactive.\u201d</p> <p>This is a significant public health issue costing the NHS \u00a34.6bn a year for women and men. The Royal Osteoporosis Society says a quarter of people don\u2019t even know what \u201costeoporosis\u201d means, so we need a public and social media conversation, as there has been for menopause.</p> <p>The lack of education remains incredibly frustrating, says Chidwick. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d been given a Dexa scan when I went into early menopause? This is all about mortality and it\u2019s not OK. I want to have a life, so what do I do? I\u2019ve gone out and asked questions, but what about the people who don\u2019t? Putting a Band-Aid on afterwards isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p> <p><em>Kate Muir (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/menoscandal/?hl=en\">@menoscandal</a>) is the author of Everything You Need to Know About the Menopause, published by Simon &amp; Schuster at \u00a39.99.

And then they scream,\u201d says Dr Vonda Wright, a campaigning American orthopaedic surgeon and the author of Fitness After 40: How to Stay Strong at Any Age. Two-thirds of osteoporosis sufferers are female for a reason: when hormones plummet around menopause, bone strength declines by 10 to 20%. Fragility fractures rocket up from the late 40s onwards. Low bone mineral density means brittle bones look like a Crunchie bar inside, honeycombed with big holes. When Narelle Chidwick from Henley was 49, she was sent for a Dexa (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry bone scan) by the NHS after injuring her ribs during a family skiing holiday. \u201cThey told me I had osteoporosis, a high fracture risk and very low bone density. It was at the level of an 80 or 90-year-old woman. I was shocked. I didn\u2019t see it coming. I had early menopause at 46, but I\u2019d been exercising, doing pilates, eating well.\u201d Now Chidwick and her 80-year-old father both have osteoporosis \u2013 but she is determined to try to rebuild her bones. There are three very effective early ways to protect women (and some non-binary and trans people) from fractures: muscle-building, weight-bearing exercise, along with vitamin D, magnesium and calcium-rich foods, and using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to slow bone loss and promote new growth. \u201cWe need to identify high-risk women far earlier, long before they break a bone,\u201d says Dr Olivia Hum, a GP and menopause specialist on the British Menopause Society (BMS) advisory council. \u201cWomen with low body mass, a history of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis in the family and those who smoke or drink heavily, or had an eating disorder. They need to know about strength training and exercise, discuss the benefits and risks of HRT and understand that it can significantly reduce fracture risk.\u201d The BMS consensus statement says that HRT \u201cremains an excellent option for prevention, particularly in younger women aged less than 60,\u201d helping women at low risk (with osteopenia, slightly lowered bone density) and even those with established osteoporosis. While it has proved almost impossible for the NHS to get the sedentary midlife population skipping ropes or lifting weights, it is easy to offer HRT to those suitable. It is approved by the NHS and the US Food and Drug Administration for strengthening bones, as the oestrogen in HRT plays a role in maintaining bone density, balancing the constant removal and regrowth that occurs in menopause. It decreases menopause symptoms, too, which often encourages women to exercise and have a healthier lifestyle. An Endocrine Review meta-analysis of 57 studies showed HRT can increase bone density by 7% on average over two years and reduce spinal fractures by a third. A decade-long trial in the journal Bone showed HRT increased spinal density by 13%, while the untreated comparison group had 5% bone loss. We also know now that headlines two decades ago suggesting HRT increased breast cancer in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative Study were exaggerated, and have been debunked by menopause societies. Newer body-identical transdermal preparations, such as gels and patches are safer, too, with no increased risk of blood clots, according to the NHS. Yet healthcare professionals dealing with early fractures rarely consider that option. With a research grant from Henpicked: Menopause in the Workplace, I have worked on an investigation for months with Dr Bill Robertson-Smith, an NHS senior surgical care practitioner at Northampton General Hospital. She sent Freedom of Information requests asking for data from the NHS Fracture Liaison Services (FLS) which treats osteoporosis following fractures in people over 50. Our data showed that in the past seven years, 356,229 women have been treated by FLS clinics. Out of those, only 169 were offered HRT afterwards. \u201cI was astonished it was so low,\u201d said Dr Robertson-Smith. \u201cAround three-quarters of those women would be over 65, but thousands of younger women in their 50s and early 60s who could benefit from HRT were never offered that option.\u201d Although early menopausal, Chidwick was not offered HRT by her GP, but she was prescribed bisphosphonate drugs, as well as calcium carbonate and vitamin D. Bisphosphonates inhibit the removal of old bone, particularly when new bone is forming less in menopause \u2013 bones are a bit like tree branches, growing, shedding and renewing all the time. Bisphosphonates cost from \u00a350 a year and are the first-line NHS treatment for men and women. But patients often complain of gastrointestinal, joint and flu-like symptoms. Due to that, and perceived lack of effect, around 40% of patients come off bisphosphonates within a year, and 85% within three. Chidwick also looked into lifestyle changes, and was exasperated to receive a hospital letter suggesting she walked for 30 minutes three times a week. \u201cI knew that wasn\u2019t anywhere near enough for bone density \u2013 I was already walking 10,000 steps a day and exercising when I got the diagnosis,\u201d she said. Chidwick did her own bone-building research online and found a trainer who was able to create a three-times-a-week strength and impact exercise programme. Muscles are key to osteoporosis prevention, to holding up our skeletons, explains Dr Gabrielle Lyon, American author of the bestseller Forever Strong. \u201cPeople think of bones as the end point of this silent disease, but low muscle mass is the first sign of low bone density. The best way to safeguard your independence is to protect your skeletal muscle mass. Muscle is the only organ system we can directly control.\u201d Also in the States, Dr Wright is leading the charge on female osteoporosis, academically and with a million followers on her Instagram. Wright, 57, explains: \u201cI lift heavy! You need deadlifts, squats, bench-presses, chin-ups. Four reps, four sets. You can also stomp up and down the stairs and that helps, too.\u201d She adds: \u201cBuilding muscle is the one thing you can do to save your metabolism, save your bones, prevent you from falling down and build brain resilience.\u201d Dr Wright also authored a groundbreaking 2024 medical paper in the journal Climacteric, which named the problem for the first time in its title: The Musculoskeletal Syndrome of Menopause. \u201cThis means the collection of symptoms caused by oestrogen loss from perimenopause onwards, including joint pain, muscle weakness, decreased bone density and increased risk of arthritis and fractures. Oestrogen doesn\u2019t just increase bone density, it reduces inflammation in our joints. So many women come into my clinic with frozen shoulder at this age, not due to injury, but because of inflammation.\u201d In the paper, Dr Wright advocates holistically for exercise, vitamins and nutrition (one of her catchphrases is \u201cSugar bakes you from the inside,\u201d because it\u2019s inflammatory). She also calls for greater use of HRT. She says what\u2019s needed now is a study of the minimum effective doses of oestrogen for prevention. Studies show a small dose of 0.25mg/day works well, which would be good news for women who want to start HRT gently in later life, and Dr Wright said that\u2019s definitely an option. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that women here usually only get Dexa scans once they are 65, when earlier screening would mean we could halt the damage.\u201d Dr Hum agrees: \u201cGPs can refer you for a Dexa if you fulfil the risk criteria, but sometimes we feel as if we\u2019re just firefighting in general practice and there\u2019s so little time to talk.\u201d She suggests that women can determine their own risk using the risk-checker on the Royal Osteoporosis Society website, and Dexa scans are available privately for upwards of \u00a350. She also said that with more menopause awareness, some women come in asking for HRT to protect their bones, even if they don\u2019t have serious symptoms. \u201cIt\u2019s all about individual choice and the risk-benefit balance.\u201d Exercise is essential as part of that balance. The science around high intensity impact training (Hiit) also interested Chidwick. Hiit is proven to improve bone density in postmenopausal women, and in the American LIFTMOR trial, 101 women over 58 with osteoporosis or osteopenia were assigned to two groups. Those in the conventional exercise group had a 1% loss of bone density, while those doing supervised high-intensity impact training \u2013 squats, deadlifts and jumping chin-ups twice a week \u2013 gained almost 3% density over eight months. It worked fast. Why aren\u2019t we getting that message out to women? \u201cBecause we\u2019re the Special K generation,\u201d says Chidwick. Gen X grew up with messages favouring skinny over strong. Remember the Special K TV challenge from two decades ago, which told women they could \u201cdrop a jeans size in two weeks\u201d by replacing two meals with bowls of sugary cereal? More than three decades after Madonna flexed her biceps on the Blond Ambition tour, there\u2019s still a sense for older generations that muscles are male. Loss of muscle mass is called sarcopenia \u2013 and muscle mass can drop by 10% from early perimenopause to post-menopause. Dr Radhika Vohra, a GP and adviser to the Menopause Charity, agrees and wishes the NHS provided more specific information: \u201cWe\u2019d be better doing more social prescribing, sending people on the NHS for six weeks\u2019 free training at a gym \u2013 but sadly that\u2019s a postcode lottery.\u201d Strong muscles make a big difference to balance, too, important if osteoporosis has been diagnosed. Dr Wright talked about the tragedy of seeing frail women after falls, in hospital gowns undergoing massive operations, asking her, \u201cwhat\u2019s happened to me? I\u2019m not who I used to be.\u201d What actually happens in hospital? I spoke to Dr Robertson-Smith one day as she emerged after working alongside a senior surgeon on a peri-prosthetic fracture: \u201cThat\u2019s when they\u2019ve had a metal hip replacement, for example, and have now fractured the bone around it, too. We\u2019ve been operating for nearly three hours on a woman in her 80s, and I\u2019ve just finished screwing a plate on to the length of the upper thigh and suturing the wound.\u201d The operation takes its toll on an already frail patient and, including rehab afterwards, costs the NHS about \u00a330,000, according to Dr Robertson-Smith. On the front line for the past 11 years, she has grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of preventive care. \u201cThe use of HRT wasn\u2019t part of my education in orthopaedics,\u201d she says, \u201cand medical colleagues have said the same.\u201d But medicine works in silos and menopause experts, surgeons, endocrinologists and rheumatologists rarely confer. So the more complex picture is often overlooked. It\u2019s the orchestra of hormones that makes bones work. Dr Robertson-Smith explains: \u201cThe main role of oestrogen in bone health is to prevent bone loss, but we also know that progesterone has an important part to play in stimulating bone growth. There is also a positive association between testosterone and bone mineral density, so all of these hormones matter.\u201d Men with early low testosterone levels are more likely to get osteoporosis, too. NHS data shows 19% of women are on HRT, a massive increase over the past three years as public menopause knowledge has grown, so that may mean a generational improvement in osteoporosis rates. But increasing prevention would be bad news for the pharmaceutical industry, which makes $16bn worldwide annually from osteoporosis drugs. Pharmaceutical capitalism thrives on sickness care, rather than preventive care. What really needs to change is that preventive care should be offered to women at a much younger age, ideally in their 40s. Dr Vohra explains that the 40-plus health-check list for all women doesn\u2019t mention osteoporosis or menopause, instead concentrating on high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, body mass index, exercise and alcohol. \u201cGeneral practice gets paid to keep a register of patients already diagnosed with osteoporosis, but they don\u2019t get paid for preventing it. Yet osteopenia is that lovely window when you can change things for women, and we miss it.\u201d Dr Hum agrees: \u201cThis needs to be done at a national level. GPs need to have the time and resources so they can be involved with prevention.\u201d Dr Vohra has done groundbreaking research on menopause and ethnicity in the UK. A report in the journal Bone showed Asian women are at a similar risk of osteoporosis as white women, yet only 6% use HRT. Risk for Black women is slightly lower, but only 5% use HRT. \u201cMenopause care is lacking for people from economically deprived and ethnic backgrounds. There\u2019s more early menopause, too. Disparities in nutrition, education and poverty mean women are losing bone mineral density earlier and are less likely to get help. We need to be proactive.\u201d This is a significant public health issue costing the NHS \u00a34.6bn a year for women and men. The Royal Osteoporosis Society says a quarter of people don\u2019t even know what \u201costeoporosis\u201d means, so we need a public and social media conversation, as there has been for menopause. The lack of education remains incredibly frustrating, says Chidwick. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d been given a Dexa scan when I went into early menopause? This is all about mortality and it\u2019s not OK. I want to have a life, so what do I do? I\u2019ve gone out and asked questions, but what about the people who don\u2019t?

      "body": "<p>No worries if you haven\u2019t felt quite up to it: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0jy17bm\">thanks to BBC Sounds</a>, its recent Michael Gove festival, <em>Surviving Politics</em>, should be available for a year, to prove that no political life, however deeply disenchanting it might look, need now end in failure. Not while the BBC, with its extensive experience in rehabilitating widely detested politicians, is still there to pick up the pieces.</p> <p>Just a short time after he decided not to stand for re-election (so avoiding displacement by a Lib&nbsp;Dem), this heavily promoted series reinvents Gove as a twinkling fount of political wisdom, a presenter who should now, if you set aside the countless reasons for his unpopularity, be as acceptable to its audience as any other. Be kind: doesn\u2019t the officially \u201ctoxic\u201d Gove, the Brexit hysteric, Cummings-patron, proroguing apologist, blob-detectorist, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25612369\">Blackadder</a></em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25612369\"> botherer</a>, Murdoch protege, elephant-lamp fancier, expert-denigrator and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/18/michelle-mone-and-ministers-trade-claims-over-her-hidden-links-to-ppe-deals\">once-prized contact of Michelle Mone</a> \u2013 \u201cJudas\u201d to his friends \u2013 deserve another chance? This is evidently the opinion of Paul Marshall, the billionaire buyer of the <em>Spectator</em>. In September, he appointed Gove its editor. The current issue features <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-onlyfans-model-the-milkshake-and-me/\">a piece by Nigel Farage</a>. \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d he tells <em>Spectator</em> readers, \u201cis&nbsp;just the most tremendous fun.\u201d</p> <p>As for the BBC\u2019s cosy <em>Surviving Politics</em> format, in which Gove is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2024/43/surviving-politics-with-michael-gove\">billed</a> as talking \u201ccandidly with politicians from different parties about the strengths and skills needed to survive when things get tough\u201d, the premise seems to be that the <em>Spectator</em> editor, with a reputation principally for Brexit and treachery, is a respected guide to dilemmas often faced in politics.</p> <p>You know, dilemmas like: shall I, or shall I not, attempt to frighten the public into voting leave with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/eu-immigrant-influx-michael-gove-nhs-unsustainable\">shameless fiction</a> about Turkey\u2019s threat to the NHS? Or: just how many of my critics can I denigrate as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2298146/I-refuse-surrender-Marxist-teachers-hell-bent-destroying-schools-Education-Secretary-berates-new-enemies-promise-opposing-plans.html\">the blob</a>\u201d? Or even: am I justified in claiming this \u00a334.99 cot mattress on expenses?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A discussion about\u00a0political friendships ended without reference to his notorious habit of losing them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since they could hardly depend on their presenter to include key episodes showing him in an abysmal light, perhaps the producers, with something more than Govian self-promotion in mind, were depending on promptings from his guests? If so, they must have been as disappointed as anyone else when, for instance, a discussion about political friendships \u2013 a subject on which Gove is, whatever you might think about experts, expert \u2013 ended without exploring his notorious habit of losing them. In his&nbsp;autobiography, David Cameron goes from calling him a \u201cgreat friend\u201d and \u201csoulmate\u201d to regretting his \u201cferocity and the mendacity\u201d, to calling him a \u201cfoam-flecked Faragist\u201d. Boris Johnson went from friendship to, after being stitched up, feeling \u201csad at Michael\u2019s behaviour\u201d to noting \u2013 nb Paul Marshall \u2013 that it is \u201calways a good idea to watch him in the wing&nbsp;mirror\u201d.</p> <p>Any unpopular politician tempted, like Matt Hancock, Edwina&nbsp;Currie or Nadine Dorries, to choose <em>I\u2019m </em><em>a Celebrity\u2026</em> as a stepping stone to acceptability might want to consider, instead, the BBC politics option: all the reinvention opportunities but without any bulls\u2019&nbsp;testicles or potentially troublesome campmates.&nbsp;Not with the politician in charge. Was it possible, when Amber Rudd explained why she\u2019d resigned from Johnson\u2019s cabinet over his proroguing of parliament \u2013 \u201cI could not be complicit in what I felt was a lack of truth, truth and decency, really\u201d \u2013 that Gove would avoid explaining, by way of full disclosure, that he had <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news-michael-gove-refuses-to-apologise-for-prorogation-57300/\">defended the&nbsp;illegal proroguing</a>? Admittedly, it&nbsp;could have spoiled the collaborative mood.</p> <p>Not that professional BBC interviewers would necessarily have done better. In what was described in a promotional excerpt on BBC Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme as a \u201clong deep conversation\u201d with the now <em>Spectator</em> editor, the exhausting podcast duo Amol Rajan and Nick Robinson managed to address Gove\u2019s current support for Kamala Harris without mentioning his infamous <em><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/full-transcript-of-interview-with-donald-trump-5d39sr09d\">Times</a></em><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/full-transcript-of-interview-with-donald-trump-5d39sr09d\"> interview</a> with Trump in 2017, when journalist and subject posed for joyous thumbs-up snaps. (It later emerged that Rupert Murdoch had also been, unreported by Gove, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/09/rupert-murdoch-was-in-room-for-michael-goves-donald-trump-interview\">in the room</a>.) All in all, it\u2019s difficult to see how, at a time when the BBC is laying off the sort of journalists who find things out, audiences benefited from its recent engagement of Michael Gove.</p> <p>Not when the biggest headline to come out of the <em>Surviving Politics</em> series has been the revelation that it hurt Gove, deeply, when people were mean about his former wife, the <em>Mail</em> columnist Sarah Vine. To judge by the public response, not enough people have forgotten Ms Vine\u2019s severe remarks on the Milibands at home, in a kitchen she considered inferior to her own. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here that makes me believe that he and Justine are not, in fact, aliens.\u201d</p> <p>The expectation, again, must have been that the public would simply accept nice Gove, without wondering what happened to the demented one who, in 2016, delivered an uninterrupted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/19/michael-gove-makes-case-eu-exit-bbc-today\">pro-Brexit rant</a> on <em>Today</em>, featuring the sort of rhetoric that would disfigure&nbsp;the entire debate: \u201cWe\u2019re voting to be hostages locked in the back of the car and driven headlong towards deeper EU integration.\u201d Even then he dodged detailed challenge. As Johnson has confirmed, the leave champions were never capably exposed: \u201cWe had no plans for government, no plan for negotiations, because it was not our&nbsp;job.\u201d</p> <p>For the corporation that relaunched Michael Portillo, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/ann-widdecombe-says-grow-up-33265039\">Ann Widdecombe</a> and its old enemy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alastaircampbell\">Alastair Campbell</a>, as talent, back when talent could speak its name, the Gove exercise was still, at best, ambitious. Even the new, relentlessly genial, Gove does not try to conceal his longstanding unpopularity. He playfully told Amol\u2019n\u2019Nick that his support in the current leadership election might blight his candidate\u2019s chances. And yet, on Radio 4, his contributions are advertised as an attraction. Supposing a less professional network were now promoting him, you might wonder if they, like Cameron and Johnson before them, had been played.</p> <p>If these politics programmes tell us anything, it\u2019s that if the BBC does not yet treat politics as a game, it\u2019s still captivated by people who do.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "No worries if you haven\u2019t felt quite up to it: thanks to BBC Sounds, its recent Michael Gove festival, Surviving Politics, should be available for a year, to prove that no political life, however deeply disenchanting it might look, need now end in failure. Not while the BBC, with its extensive experience in rehabilitating widely detested politicians, is still there to pick up the pieces. Just a short time after he decided not to stand for re-election (so avoiding displacement by a Lib Dem), this heavily promoted series reinvents Gove as a twinkling fount of political wisdom, a presenter who should now, if you set aside the countless reasons for his unpopularity, be as acceptable to its audience as any other. Be kind: doesn\u2019t the officially \u201ctoxic\u201d Gove, the Brexit hysteric, Cummings-patron, proroguing apologist, blob-detectorist, Blackadder botherer, Murdoch protege, elephant-lamp fancier, expert-denigrator and once-prized contact of Michelle Mone \u2013 \u201cJudas\u201d to his friends \u2013 deserve another chance? This is evidently the opinion of Paul Marshall, the billionaire buyer of the Spectator. In September, he appointed Gove its editor. The current issue features a piece by Nigel Farage. \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d he tells Spectator readers, \u201cis just the most tremendous fun.\u201d As for the BBC\u2019s cosy Surviving Politics format, in which Gove is billed as talking \u201ccandidly with politicians from different parties about the strengths and skills needed to survive when things get tough\u201d, the premise seems to be that the Spectator editor, with a reputation principally for Brexit and treachery, is a respected guide to dilemmas often faced in politics. You know, dilemmas like: shall I, or shall I not, attempt to frighten the public into voting leave with a shameless fiction about Turkey\u2019s threat to the NHS? Or: just how many of my critics can I denigrate as \u201cthe blob\u201d? Or even: am I justified in claiming this \u00a334.99 cot mattress on expenses? Since they could hardly depend on their presenter to include key episodes showing him in an abysmal light, perhaps the producers, with something more than Govian self-promotion in mind, were depending on promptings from his guests? If so, they must have been as disappointed as anyone else when, for instance, a discussion about political friendships \u2013 a subject on which Gove is, whatever you might think about experts, expert \u2013 ended without exploring his notorious habit of losing them. In his autobiography, David Cameron goes from calling him a \u201cgreat friend\u201d and \u201csoulmate\u201d to regretting his \u201cferocity and the mendacity\u201d, to calling him a \u201cfoam-flecked Faragist\u201d. Boris Johnson went from friendship to, after being stitched up, feeling \u201csad at Michael\u2019s behaviour\u201d to noting \u2013 nb Paul Marshall \u2013 that it is \u201calways a good idea to watch him in the wing mirror\u201d. Any unpopular politician tempted, like Matt Hancock, Edwina Currie or Nadine Dorries, to choose I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026 as a stepping stone to acceptability might want to consider, instead, the BBC politics option: all the reinvention opportunities but without any bulls\u2019 testicles or potentially troublesome campmates. Not with the politician in charge. Was it possible, when Amber Rudd explained why she\u2019d resigned from Johnson\u2019s cabinet over his proroguing of parliament \u2013 \u201cI could not be complicit in what I felt was a lack of truth, truth and decency, really\u201d \u2013 that Gove would avoid explaining, by way of full disclosure, that he had defended the illegal proroguing? Admittedly, it could have spoiled the collaborative mood. Not that professional BBC interviewers would necessarily have done better. In what was described in a promotional excerpt on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme as a \u201clong deep conversation\u201d with the now Spectator editor, the exhausting podcast duo Amol Rajan and Nick Robinson managed to address Gove\u2019s current support for Kamala Harris without mentioning his infamous Times interview with Trump in 2017, when journalist and subject posed for joyous thumbs-up snaps. (It later emerged that Rupert Murdoch had also been, unreported by Gove, in the room.) All in all, it\u2019s difficult to see how, at a time when the BBC is laying off the sort of journalists who find things out, audiences benefited from its recent engagement of Michael Gove. Not when the biggest headline to come out of the Surviving Politics series has been the revelation that it hurt Gove, deeply, when people were mean about his former wife, the Mail columnist Sarah Vine. To judge by the public response, not enough people have forgotten Ms Vine\u2019s severe remarks on the Milibands at home, in a kitchen she considered inferior to her own. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here that makes me believe that he and Justine are not, in fact, aliens.\u201d The expectation, again, must have been that the public would simply accept nice Gove, without wondering what happened to the demented one who, in 2016, delivered an uninterrupted pro-Brexit rant on Today, featuring the sort of rhetoric that would disfigure the entire debate: \u201cWe\u2019re voting to be hostages locked in the back of the car and driven headlong towards deeper EU integration.\u201d Even then he dodged detailed challenge. As Johnson has confirmed, the leave champions were never capably exposed: \u201cWe had no plans for government, no plan for negotiations, because it was not our job.\u201d For the corporation that relaunched Michael Portillo, Ann Widdecombe and its old enemy, Alastair Campbell, as talent, back when talent could speak its name, the Gove exercise was still, at best, ambitious. Even the new, relentlessly genial, Gove does not try to conceal his longstanding unpopularity. He playfully told Amol\u2019n\u2019Nick that his support in the current leadership election might blight his candidate\u2019s chances. And yet, on Radio 4, his contributions are advertised as an attraction. Supposing a less professional network were now promoting him, you might wonder if they, like Cameron and Johnson before them, had been played. If these politics programmes tell us anything, it\u2019s that if the BBC does not yet treat politics as a game, it\u2019s still captivated by people who do. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>When neo-Nazi terrorist Callum Parslow walked into a \u00adcountryside hotel on 2 April and stabbed an \u00adasylum seeker in the chest, it was not the first time he had come to the attention of the police.</p> \n<p>The 31-year-old computer programmer was on bail, having been arrested four months earlier for sending racist and sexual messages to a black female journalist. The mindset that drove his attack was clear.</p> \n<p>When police searched Parslow\u2019s home in Worcester on 13 December, they found a stockpile of Nazi memorabilia, including rings and medallions from the Third Reich, two copies of Adolf Hitler\u2019s <em>Mein Kampf</em> and numerous other far-right books.</p> \n<p>The items were scattered through his bedroom, which had a huge St George\u2019s flag on the wall, 10 cans of cider on the desk and empty crisp packets and milk cartons on the floor.</p> \n<p>His laptop and phone contained further indication of his beliefs: countless videos, images and texts linked to neo-Nazi ideology, \u00adalongside evidence of his immersion in conspiracy theories ranging from white genocide to \u201cexaggerated pandemics\u201d.</p> \n<p>But Parslow remained free, and would tell his eventual trial, which concluded on Friday after three weeks, that his December 2023 arrest was the moment he started considering launching an attack.</p> \n<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/25/man-hitler-tattoo-convicted-attempted-murder-nahom-hagos-asylum-seeker\">Parslow was found guilty of attempted murder</a> and will be sentenced at a later date. Reporting restrictions have now been lifted and we are able to tell the full story of Parslow\u2019s crime for the first time.</p> \n<p>Parslow claimed his plans for an attack were accelerated by an eviction notice he was handed in February \u2013 which he was given for posting what prosecutors called an \u201cextremely \u00adracist\u201d note in his shared flat.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was on bail and I [thought I] was going to prison, and I was going to get evicted, so I knew I was going to attack someone,\u201d Parslow told Leicester crown court.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was only after the eviction notice that I thought \u2018fuck it, I\u2019m going to do something\u2019. I knew it would be going to attack a migrant at a hotel.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shortly after his arrest in December, Parslow started writing a terrorist manifesto on the Notes app on his&nbsp;phone. Intended for release after his attack, it read: \u201cMy name is Callum Parslow and I just did my duty to England. They will call me a \u00adterrorist, they will call me an extremist: I am neither. I am but a gardener \u00adtending to the great garden of England. I removed the weeds; I exterminated the harmful, invasive species.\u201d</p> \n<p>The document railed against Jewish people, Marxists and \u201cglobalists\u201d \u2013 blaming them for \u00adeverything from migration to falling living standards \u2013 as well as \u201cqueer indoctrination\u201d, and \u201c[the] demonising [of] \u00admasculinity, meat consumption, Christianity, white people and all European culture\u201d.</p> \n<p>The lengthy tirade ended with Parslow voicing hope that his attack would be the \u201csnowflake that started the avalanche\u201d, before issuing a call to arms to \u201cfellow Englishmen\u201d and urging them to \u201cbecome warriors \u2026 become Albion\u2019s vengeance\u201d.</p> \n<p>While the document remained secret, Parslow had made no effort to conceal his ideology \u2013 quite the \u00adopposite. He had Hitler\u2019s signature prominently tattooed on his \u00adforearm, chose the X handle \u201ccyberpunk Nazi\u201d, and used an email address calling himself \u201cLord Adolf reborn\u201d.</p> \n<p>After his first X account was taken down in February, Parslow set up a new one and paid for a blue tick that saw his racist posts promoted.</p> \n<p>As the weeks counted down to his attack, he glorified Hitler, posted a selfie performing a Nazi salute and called Jews and non-whites \u201canimals\u201d, while occasionally tagging the Home Office and Metropolitan police.</p> \n<p>Two days before he launched his attack, a user on X who had reported Parslow\u2019s posts received an official response from the social \u00adnetwork saying his account had \u201cnot broken our safety policies\u201d, which include praising violence or wishing harm on people.</p> \n<p>During the same period, Parslow had been making preparations. In December, he paid $1,000 (\u00a3770) for a handcrafted knife from America, and days after it arrived he made online searches including \u201cworst places to get stabbed\u201d, the location of key \u00adarteries, and \u201care neck wounds always lethal?\u201d.</p> \n<p>Parslow then started researching previous far-right terror attacks in the UK, including the 2016 murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a neo-Nazi and the 2017 Finsbury Park van attack targeting Muslims.</p> \n<p>He had downloaded the manifesto of white supremacist terrorist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2024/feb/21/christchurch-gunman-terrorist-discussed-attacks-online-4chan\">Brenton Tarrant, who massacred Muslim worshippers in New Zealand mosques</a> in 2019, and that of 2011 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/norwegian-mass-killer-anders-breivik-begins-parole-hearing\">Norway mass shooter Anders Breivik</a>.</p> \n<p>Parslow quit his job as a computer programmer for a local \u00admetals \u00admanufacturer in mid-February, and took out a \u00a310,000 loan and new credit cards to fund a six-week \u00adpilgrimage around the UK.</p> \n<p>He travelled to dozens of towns and cities that he felt had links to white British culture, visiting cathedrals and historical monuments then returned to Worcester days before his planned eviction on 3 April.</p> \n<p>He planned to launch his attack on 2 April, and already had a target in mind. Parslow had become fixated on small boat crossings in the English Channel, believing they were part of a Jewish-led agenda to \u201creplace\u201d white people in the UK.</p> \n<p>He was following numerous far-right influencers on social media, who were publicising the locations of hotels used by the Home Office to house asylum seekers.</p> \n<p>One such hotel was the Pear Tree Inn, in a rural setting seven miles from Parslow\u2019s flat. Asked why he had chosen it as the target, Parslow told jurors he heard about it through \u201cmultiple avenues\u201d, including a \u201cmap on Twitter\u201d and a video posted online by an anti-migrant activist.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I would get angry seeing a lot of the articles that were online. It just makes you angry</p> \n  <footer> <cite>Callum Parslow</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>What Parslow did not know is that by the time he travelled to the hotel on 2 April, it had been released from its Home Office contract and all asylum seekers had been moved elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Emanuel Popa, the hotel \u00admanager, described how staff were \u00adredecorating and welcoming a small number of guests as a \u201csoft reopening\u201d on the day. By chance, one former resident had returned to the Pear Tree Inn to borrow a bicycle from Popa, with whom he had struck up a friendship.</p> \n<p>Nahom Hagos, a 25-year-old \u00adasylum seeker from Eritrea, had left the hotel in January after a year there, and his own bike had been stolen.</p> \n<p>Hagos was eating lunch on his own in the hotel\u2019s conservatory when, shortly before 1.30pm, Parslow walked in. He had concealed his knife in a pocket, and Hagos initially had no idea he was at risk. \u201cHe asked me where the \u00adtoilets were and I showed him,\u201d he told the court. \u201cHe asked me where I was from \u2026 I said \u2018I\u2019m from Eritrea\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Thinking nothing of the brief exchange, Hagos sat down to resume eating, but a minute later Parslow returned. He immediately pulled out the knife and stabbed Hagos in the chest and hand, pushing a table towards him and running away.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was trying to kill me, I was calling out,\u201d Hagos said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he punished me like this, I don\u2019t know if the Lord was giving me another life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hagos fled into the hotel\u2019s car park, bleeding profusely and \u00adshouting \u201cwhy brother why, why did you do this?\u201d, as Parslow followed him at a steady walking pace.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/25/local-left-behind-prey-to-populist-politics-data-2024-uk-rioters\">Local.

What the data tells us about the 2024 UK rioters</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>His screams alerted Popa, who managed to lock the hotel\u2019s front door and tried to shield Hagos in a bathroom. CCTV showed Parslow trying to open the door before walking around the hotel in an apparent search for other asylum seekers.</p> \n<p>Just six minutes after his arrival, Parslow left, walking calmly back across the car park and disappearing.</p> \n<p>As he made his way along a canal tow path, Parslow was in the process of trying to post his terrorist \u00admanifesto on X.</p> \n<p>Also tagged in the unsent post were Tommy Robinson, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, Boris Johnson, Suella Braverman, Lee Anderson and Nigel Farage.</p> \n<p>Parslow, now 32, denied attempted murder and claimed he only intended to wound his victim as a ploy to be imprisoned before he was evicted.</p> \n<p>He separately admitted two unconnected offences of sending grossly offensive Instagram and Facebook messages to a black female journalist and \u201ccyber flashing\u201d the same woman during summer 2023. The case caused reporting restrictions to be placed on his terror trial, because Parslow originally denied the offences and was due to go on trial next month.</p> \n<p>Throughout his case, Parslow defended his beliefs, at points appearing to be trying to convince the jury of supposed evidence behind a vast array of conspiracy theories.</p> \n<p>Parslow said he \u201cspent a lot of time on the internet\u201d, while working night shifts and having no social life. \u201cI would get angry seeing a lot of the articles that were online,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just makes you angry.\u201d</p> \n<p>West Mercia police said \u201cbail conditions were in place which were appropriate for the nature of the offences.\u201d.

      "bodyText": "When neo-Nazi terrorist Callum Parslow walked into a countryside hotel on 2 April and stabbed an asylum seeker in the chest, it was not the first time he had come to the attention of the police. The 31-year-old computer programmer was on bail, having been arrested four months earlier for sending racist and sexual messages to a black female journalist. The mindset that drove his attack was clear. When police searched Parslow\u2019s home in Worcester on 13 December, they found a stockpile of Nazi memorabilia, including rings and medallions from the Third Reich, two copies of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf and numerous other far-right books. The items were scattered through his bedroom, which had a huge St George\u2019s flag on the wall, 10 cans of cider on the desk and empty crisp packets and milk cartons on the floor. His laptop and phone contained further indication of his beliefs: countless videos, images and texts linked to neo-Nazi ideology, alongside evidence of his immersion in conspiracy theories ranging from white genocide to \u201cexaggerated pandemics\u201d. But Parslow remained free, and would tell his eventual trial, which concluded on Friday after three weeks, that his December 2023 arrest was the moment he started considering launching an attack. Last week, Parslow was found guilty of attempted murder and will be sentenced at a later date. Reporting restrictions have now been lifted and we are able to tell the full story of Parslow\u2019s crime for the first time. Parslow claimed his plans for an attack were accelerated by an eviction notice he was handed in February \u2013 which he was given for posting what prosecutors called an \u201cextremely racist\u201d note in his shared flat. \u201cI was on bail and I [thought I] was going to prison, and I was going to get evicted, so I knew I was going to attack someone,\u201d Parslow told Leicester crown court. \u201cIt was only after the eviction notice that I thought \u2018fuck it, I\u2019m going to do something\u2019. I knew it would be going to attack a migrant at a hotel.\u201d Shortly after his arrest in December, Parslow started writing a terrorist manifesto on the Notes app on his phone. Intended for release after his attack, it read: \u201cMy name is Callum Parslow and I just did my duty to England. They will call me a terrorist, they will call me an extremist: I am neither. I am but a gardener tending to the great garden of England. I removed the weeds; I exterminated the harmful, invasive species.\u201d The document railed against Jewish people, Marxists and \u201cglobalists\u201d \u2013 blaming them for everything from migration to falling living standards \u2013 as well as \u201cqueer indoctrination\u201d, and \u201c[the] demonising [of] masculinity, meat consumption, Christianity, white people and all European culture\u201d. The lengthy tirade ended with Parslow voicing hope that his attack would be the \u201csnowflake that started the avalanche\u201d, before issuing a call to arms to \u201cfellow Englishmen\u201d and urging them to \u201cbecome warriors \u2026 become Albion\u2019s vengeance\u201d. While the document remained secret, Parslow had made no effort to conceal his ideology \u2013 quite the opposite. He had Hitler\u2019s signature prominently tattooed on his forearm, chose the X handle \u201ccyberpunk Nazi\u201d, and used an email address calling himself \u201cLord Adolf reborn\u201d. After his first X account was taken down in February, Parslow set up a new one and paid for a blue tick that saw his racist posts promoted. As the weeks counted down to his attack, he glorified Hitler, posted a selfie performing a Nazi salute and called Jews and non-whites \u201canimals\u201d, while occasionally tagging the Home Office and Metropolitan police. Two days before he launched his attack, a user on X who had reported Parslow\u2019s posts received an official response from the social network saying his account had \u201cnot broken our safety policies\u201d, which include praising violence or wishing harm on people. During the same period, Parslow had been making preparations. In December, he paid $1,000 (\u00a3770) for a handcrafted knife from America, and days after it arrived he made online searches including \u201cworst places to get stabbed\u201d, the location of key arteries, and \u201care neck wounds always lethal?\u201d. Parslow then started researching previous far-right terror attacks in the UK, including the 2016 murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a neo-Nazi and the 2017 Finsbury Park van attack targeting Muslims. He had downloaded the manifesto of white supremacist terrorist Brenton Tarrant, who massacred Muslim worshippers in New Zealand mosques in 2019, and that of 2011 Norway mass shooter Anders Breivik. Parslow quit his job as a computer programmer for a local metals manufacturer in mid-February, and took out a \u00a310,000 loan and new credit cards to fund a six-week pilgrimage around the UK. He travelled to dozens of towns and cities that he felt had links to white British culture, visiting cathedrals and historical monuments then returned to Worcester days before his planned eviction on 3 April. He planned to launch his attack on 2 April, and already had a target in mind. Parslow had become fixated on small boat crossings in the English Channel, believing they were part of a Jewish-led agenda to \u201creplace\u201d white people in the UK. He was following numerous far-right influencers on social media, who were publicising the locations of hotels used by the Home Office to house asylum seekers. One such hotel was the Pear Tree Inn, in a rural setting seven miles from Parslow\u2019s flat. Asked why he had chosen it as the target, Parslow told jurors he heard about it through \u201cmultiple avenues\u201d, including a \u201cmap on Twitter\u201d and a video posted online by an anti-migrant activist. What Parslow did not know is that by the time he travelled to the hotel on 2 April, it had been released from its Home Office contract and all asylum seekers had been moved elsewhere. Emanuel Popa, the hotel manager, described how staff were redecorating and welcoming a small number of guests as a \u201csoft reopening\u201d on the day. By chance, one former resident had returned to the Pear Tree Inn to borrow a bicycle from Popa, with whom he had struck up a friendship. Nahom Hagos, a 25-year-old asylum seeker from Eritrea, had left the hotel in January after a year there, and his own bike had been stolen. Hagos was eating lunch on his own in the hotel\u2019s conservatory when, shortly before 1.30pm, Parslow walked in. He had concealed his knife in a pocket, and Hagos initially had no idea he was at risk. \u201cHe asked me where the toilets were and I showed him,\u201d he told the court. \u201cHe asked me where I was from \u2026 I said \u2018I\u2019m from Eritrea\u2019.\u201d Thinking nothing of the brief exchange, Hagos sat down to resume eating, but a minute later Parslow returned. He immediately pulled out the knife and stabbed Hagos in the chest and hand, pushing a table towards him and running away. \u201cHe was trying to kill me, I was calling out,\u201d Hagos said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he punished me like this, I don\u2019t know if the Lord was giving me another life.\u201d Hagos fled into the hotel\u2019s car park, bleeding profusely and shouting \u201cwhy brother why, why did you do this?\u201d, as Parslow followed him at a steady walking pace. His screams alerted Popa, who managed to lock the hotel\u2019s front door and tried to shield Hagos in a bathroom. CCTV showed Parslow trying to open the door before walking around the hotel in an apparent search for other asylum seekers. Just six minutes after his arrival, Parslow left, walking calmly back across the car park and disappearing. As he made his way along a canal tow path, Parslow was in the process of trying to post his terrorist manifesto on X. Also tagged in the unsent post were Tommy Robinson, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, Boris Johnson, Suella Braverman, Lee Anderson and Nigel Farage. Parslow, now 32, denied attempted murder and claimed he only intended to wound his victim as a ploy to be imprisoned before he was evicted. He separately admitted two unconnected offences of sending grossly offensive Instagram and Facebook messages to a black female journalist and \u201ccyber flashing\u201d the same woman during summer 2023. The case caused reporting restrictions to be placed on his terror trial, because Parslow originally denied the offences and was due to go on trial next month. Throughout his case, Parslow defended his beliefs, at points appearing to be trying to convince the jury of supposed evidence behind a vast array of conspiracy theories. Parslow said he \u201cspent a lot of time on the internet\u201d, while working night shifts and having no social life. \u201cI would get angry seeing a lot of the articles that were online,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just makes you angry.\u201d West Mercia police said \u201cbail conditions were in place which were appropriate for the nature of the offences.\u201d. Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands were contacted for comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024. Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands were contacted for comment, not West Midlands police as stated in an earlier version.",

In principle, helping obese people lose weight is surely unexceptionable. However, as Malik points out, there is good evidence that unemployment often causes obesity, not the other way round. This echoes the oft-repeated statements by those interviewed for the media that they would eat better if they could, but they can\u2019t afford it. What next? If politicians share Duncan-Smith\u2019s views on the cost of children, perhaps it\u2019ll be state-sponsored sterilisation for the unemployed. </p> <p>The principal solution to a host of social and health problems is reducing economic inequality, and Labour should have no problem in adopting that aim. Why is it so hard for politicians to understand that the big difference between the poor and other people is that the poor don\u2019t have much money?<br><strong>Dr Robert Forde</strong><br>Sheffield<br></p> <h2 data-note-id=\"7c4b588d-8333-4ced-b4d4-309421fb1a63\" data-type=\"subhead\">Schools are doing their best</h2> <p>You write that governing&nbsp;bodies tend to \u201crubber stamp\u201d headteachers\u2019 permanent exclusion decisions (\u201cBattle launched to save children from being kicked out of school\u201d, News, last week\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/19/fight-save-vulnerable-uk-children-school-exclusions-lawyers\">\u2018He lashed out.

These are complex, legal processes in which all involved act seriously and compassionately, especially headteachers who need to make impossible decisions about the safety and rights of all their pupils. </p> <p>The National Governance Association has rightly argued that they should be heard by specialist panels.

These needs could, in part, be met by support assistants who build trust and rapport with the pupil, and can better understand additional needs such as autism, ADHD or anxiety. Often, the pupil being aware that they have support in the classroom helps them to stay calm and focused. </p> <p>With 20 years\u2019 experience, I saw the benefit that having that support can make. Cutbacks have meant less support in the classroom, which may be responsible for increasing disruptive behaviour. Not providing this is a false economy, leading to vulnerable pupils feeling overwhelmed and frustrated and then being permanently excluded and potentially at risk of criminal exploitation. If those responsible for funding took into account the huge difference that support assistants can make, Persey\u2019s caseload might be dramatically reduced.<br><strong>Paula Winter</strong><br>Fareham, Hampshire<br></p> <h2 data-note-id=\"86988eeb-1dfc-4ad0-8a6f-b18f0cb0d9c8\" data-type=\"subhead\">Please, sir, I want some more</h2> <p>While it is hard to disagree with Martha Gill\u2019s suggestion of a law to protect under-18s from the potential&nbsp;excesses of global fame as pop idols, I think the answer as to whether it would matter much if there were no substantial parts for children in future films and TV shows is \u2013 yes, it would (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/19/of-course-teenagers-want-to-be-pop-idols-like-liam-payne-given-the-perils-should-we-let-them\">Of course teenagers want to be pop idols like Liam Payne.

In principle, helping obese people lose weight is surely unexceptionable. However, as Malik points out, there is good evidence that unemployment often causes obesity, not the other way round. This echoes the oft-repeated statements by those interviewed for the media that they would eat better if they could, but they can\u2019t afford it. What next? If politicians share Duncan-Smith\u2019s views on the cost of children, perhaps it\u2019ll be state-sponsored sterilisation for the unemployed. The principal solution to a host of social and health problems is reducing economic inequality, and Labour should have no problem in adopting that aim. Why is it so hard for politicians to understand that the big difference between the poor and other people is that the poor don\u2019t have much money? Dr Robert Forde Sheffield Schools are doing their best You write that governing bodies tend to \u201crubber stamp\u201d headteachers\u2019 permanent exclusion decisions (\u201cBattle launched to save children from being kicked out of school\u201d, News, last week\u201c\u2018He lashed out. He was scared\u2019: the fight to save vulnerable UK children from being kicked out of school\u201d). I\u2019ve sat on many exclusion panels this year for schools around my community. These are complex, legal processes in which all involved act seriously and compassionately, especially headteachers who need to make impossible decisions about the safety and rights of all their pupils. The National Governance Association has rightly argued that they should be heard by specialist panels. Until then, volunteer governors are ensuring exclusions are fair and legal. Name and address provided Human rights barrister Ollie Persey mentioned \u201cbehaviour that arises from unmet additional needs\u201d. These needs could, in part, be met by support assistants who build trust and rapport with the pupil, and can better understand additional needs such as autism, ADHD or anxiety. Often, the pupil being aware that they have support in the classroom helps them to stay calm and focused. With 20 years\u2019 experience, I saw the benefit that having that support can make. Cutbacks have meant less support in the classroom, which may be responsible for increasing disruptive behaviour. Not providing this is a false economy, leading to vulnerable pupils feeling overwhelmed and frustrated and then being permanently excluded and potentially at risk of criminal exploitation. If those responsible for funding took into account the huge difference that support assistants can make, Persey\u2019s caseload might be dramatically reduced. Paula Winter Fareham, Hampshire Please, sir, I want some more While it is hard to disagree with Martha Gill\u2019s suggestion of a law to protect under-18s from the potential excesses of global fame as pop idols, I think the answer as to whether it would matter much if there were no substantial parts for children in future films and TV shows is \u2013 yes, it would (\u201cOf course teenagers want to be pop idols like Liam Payne. Given the perils, should we let them?\u201d). No Oliver!, The Railway Children, Harry Potter, Young Sheldon? Most young actors seem to cope very well and many go on to have long and successful careers. Neil Angrave London E17",

Except it\u2019s happening today, up here in these cream and stucco streets on the edge of Clifton. The sky is the colour of a battleship, the gutters are overflowing and nobody is walking. They are running. Now I am running, too, from a cab to the refuge that is 1 York Place. The picture windows are illuminated by warm orange lamps that act as a beacon against this lunchtime\u2019s early evening light and the dining room is dressed in gentle Scandi shades of oatmeal. There are dried wild grasses attached to the walls, which serve to emphasise just what an escape from the storm this space will be.</p> <p>All good restaurants serve as a refuge; as a redoubt against the tiresome demands of life, work or, as today, the weather. 1 York Place, the latest Bristol restaurant from chef Freddy Bird, does the job beautifully. I first tried his cooking in 2010 at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/02/bristol-lido-restaurant-jay-rayner\">Bristol Lido</a>, the best-catered swimming pool in Britain. His food there was what you\u2019d treat yourself to after a brisk 50 lengths, or perhaps after watching someone else complete them: wood-roasted fish or lamb, fat ravioli filled with long-braised venison, a fennel and blood orange salad that referenced his years cooking at the Iberian-influenced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/17/moro-london-ec1-restaurant-review-martina-oloughlin\">Moro</a>. A few years ago he opened the Little French in Bristol\u2019s Westbury Park, which delivered on the name\u2019s promise: fish soup, beef fillet with a peppercorn sauce, plus a side of the cheese and potato wonder that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/05/how-to-cook-the-perfect-aligot-felicity-cloake\">aligot</a>.</p>    <p>Now there is this second restaurant, which opened at the end of last year, and which wanders Europe a little more widely. What unites them is a determination to fill the plate to the very edge without recourse to daintiness or understatement. Come hungry. The snacks include potato beignet, served hot. It is a mashed potato and flour batter that has been dropped into the deep-fat fryer until puffed up to a deep golden, leaving a soft, gooey centre. Excavate the avalanche of freshly grated parmesan, flecked with smoked paprika, to find these knobbly doughnuts. Underneath, to reinforce the umami, is a cream flavoured with salted anchovy. Or have their whipped cod\u2019s roe, the central well of which is generously filled with amber jewels of trout roe. Alongside are chopped up radishes for crunch and fire. When the radishes run out, move on to the nutty crust of the sourdough.</p> <p>Those two dishes, costing \u00a314.50, would serve as a classy, brilliantly unbalanced weekday lunch; an indulgence that you might not admit to anyone else. But there are other things demanding our attention. Prime among them is the lunchtime and early evening set-price menu, which is \u00a329.50, including a glass of wine, a Bulgarian Merlot perhaps, or a crisp Spanish white. The successful writing of a set-price menu is a serious skill. It needs to work the margins while not looking as if it\u2019s offering second best. It needs to be tightly written, but still cover most dietaries. There needs to be the whiff of bargain luxury. This one, which costs less than the most expensive main course, does it all brilliantly.</p>    <p>From that menu I start with a rustling heap of moon-shaped squash fritters, in a shattering batter dribbled with miel de cana or sugarcane molasses, and dusted with dried oregano. Around and underneath are soft, grainy nuggets of ricotta as a foil to the sweetness. After my lunch I looked back at what I started with at the Bristol Lido all those years ago: discs of battered and deep-fried pumpkin, with honey and oregano and goat\u2019s cheese. I like a cook who cleaves to his own good ideas. The other starter on the set price menu was buttermilk-fried squid with aioli.</p> <p>For my main I chose pieces of pork belly, over the tagliatelle in a lobster sauce, because these are the complicated, troubling choices my life demands now. Pray for me. The crackling crunched. The meat was soft. Underneath was a heap of nutty lentils. Slumped across the side was a sweet-sour quince jelly that would have bellowed autumn if the rain still slapping the windows didn\u2019t already have that covered. For colour there were some vividly purple leaves of what we were told was \u201cheritage\u201d kale, its heritage possibly having something to do with a filthy hook-up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/04/barney-the-dinosaur-film-daniel-kaluuya\">Barney the Dinosaur</a>. It was that purple. This was meat and two veg, after it had learned how to tie a cravat and polish its shoes at Swiss finishing school.</p>    <p>It is no criticism of the main menu to say that I really didn\u2019t feel I was getting second best. I just had a smaller choice. The \u00e0 la carte starters included a thick plank of crunchy-shelled pastilla, made with shredded chicken leg, with a whack of cinnamon, but a light touch on the sweetness. It came with a banging harissa relish to remind you this was a savoury dish. That was followed by two slabs of John Dory, skin crisped and salty, flesh white and lightly bronzed, on a buttery mess of leeks and brown shrimps. If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that the portion was huge. Less on the plate could have brought down the \u00a330.50 price tag and it might have proved finishable. Then again, that sated appetite may have had something to do with going face-down in the potato beignet and the whipped cod\u2019s roe at the start.</p>    <p>To finish, from both menus, there was a house brick of extremely adult tiramisu, the thick layers of sponge sodden with both site-specific Bristol Cream and enough espresso to stimulate a dozy sloth into bouts of calisthenics. Or have the frangipane tart with the deep purple reveal of sliced fresh figs, in a pond of custard and cream, masking shards of sugary crunch. Service was attentive, but then it would be because, shockingly, we were the only diners this lunchtime. It barely needs saying that Bristol is a superb restaurant city, full of independents serving great food without faff or ludicrous ponce. The establishment at 1 York Place sums up that encouragingly bourgeois approach. For a while the rain had abated, but now the director appears to have called action and once more it is sloshing down. It\u2019s as if the weather is telling us to stay put. If only we could.</p> <h2><strong>News bites</strong></h2> <p>Pasta Brown in London\u2019s Covent Garden has launched a petition to save the business after being told it must vacate the premises it has called home for the past 50 years. The building is owned by a hotel that occupies the rest of the space and now wants the restaurant for a coffee shop, among other things. Pasta Brown, which also provides meals on a weekly basis for the local homeless, says the end of their lease imperils the livelihoods of the multiple families who work there.

It will operate out of the cricket pavilion at the Latymer Upper School Sports Grounds in London\u2019s Chiswick. Where the original, in a York primary school, was only takeaway, SK Chiswick will also be a restaurant. The menu will feature dishes created by high-profile chefs including Matt Tebbutt\u2019s toad in the hole, Tommy Banks\u2019s hogget meatballs in a cep sauce and Nadiya Hussain\u2019s cardamon rice pudding (<a href=\"https://www.schoolkitchen.com/\">schoolkitchen.com</a>).</p> <p>Liverpool restaurant Pilgrim is to reopen after a four-year Hiatus. Restaurateur Jamie Duffield launched the original in 2019 after winning the TV show <em>My Million Pound Menu</em>, but it closed in 2020. Plans to move into a permanent site were put on hold after Duffield was diagnosed with a cancer from which he has now fully recovered. The new version will be in the city\u2019s Allerton district and will feature an open kitchen, 24 seats and a changing menu of seasonal Spanish dishes.

      "bodyText": "With that we\u2019re wrapping up the blog. Before we go, here are the major stories from Sunday: David Crisafulli claimed an LNP victory in the Queensland state election and made his first speech as premier-elect. Labor\u2019s Steven Miles has conceded defeat, officially resigning as premier in a meeting with the governor, Jeannette Young, before heading to the pub for an \u201cXXXX off the wood\u201d with supporters. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the state election results sent a message to the Greens \u201cto bring people together, not to divide people\u201d. Greens MP Michael Berkman said there was a chance the party could still retain its seats once postal votes were counted. Meanwhile in Victoria, the Allan government announced \u201cwell-designed\u201d apartments and townhouses would be fast-tracked through planning approvals. The opposition leader, John Pesutto, said the plans lacked substance. In NSW, the state government and transmission company Transgrid was still trying to restore the power network for Broken Hill and surrounding areas. The energy minister, Penny Sharpe, asked residents to reduce their power use in the evening. We\u2019ll pick things up again tomorrow. Greens MP says they may still retain Queensland seats despite election woes Greens MP Michael Berkman did a press conference a short while ago after the party\u2019s reverse at the Queensland state election. The party had talked up their chances before election day, but looked likely to lose both seats on election night. Berkman was the first Green to take a lower house seat in the state\u2019s parliament. His seat of Maiwar is now considered likely to be held by the party. At this stage South Brisbane is a very real possibility still, I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s been written off, because there are a lot of postal votes and a lot of absentees to be counted, so there\u2019s a very real chance that Labor could be pushed into third with those postals counted, in which case Amy would be easily re elected. Berkman said Labor leader Steven Miles had adopted a number of Green policies to hold off the party in the inner city, including 50 cent fares and free school lunches. He said Labor had held them off by \u201cpouring more resources into keeping us out than they did into challenging the LNP\u201d: Steven Miles just lost government. He lost government in a contest where, if he\u2019d actually identified the real enemy and gone hard, he could have held on to government, and worked with us to actually get these policies in place. Instead, he\u2019s chosen a petty fight with the Greens to try and protect the few inner city seats, and he has given the conservatives government. Two whales that were seen in Sydney Harbour on Sunday have begun making their way back out to sea. A National Parks and Wildlife Service spokesperson said that the two whales were resting between Middle Head and South Head. The whales have been reported as healthy, and a mother was feeding her calf. The whales are currently making their way out to sea. The spokesperson reminded the public to keep their distance from whales, which is 100m for adults and 300m for calves. Australian ice skaters collect country\u2019s first grand prix bronze Australian ice skating pair Anastasia Golubeva and Hektor Giotopoulos Moore have collected the country\u2019s first ever grand prix medal, winning bronze at Skate Canada. Golubeva, 18, and Giotopoulos Moore, 22, finished third behind the reigning pairs world champions Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps in Halifax. Russian-born Golubeva and Sydneysider Giotopoulos Moore train in Montreal at the same rink as the top-ranked Canadian team. Attracting some of the world\u2019s best figure skaters, the event is the second of six International Skating Union grand prix competitions with athletes looking to qualify for December\u2019s elite final in Grenoble, France. The silver medal went to Uzbekistan pair Ekaterina Geynish and Dmitrii Chigirev. - AAP Victorian Labor responds to opposition attacks over housing design standards In response to Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto\u2019s earlier comments we blogged \u2013 in which he said the premier, Jacinta Allan, had failed to introduce better apartment design standards \u2013 we\u2019ve just received this from a government spokesperson: Under the Liberals there were no minimum design standards \u2013 which resulted in the Liberals approving poor quality homes with no regard for who lived in them. We fixed this by introducing minimum design standards and providing better access to natural light and outdoor space \u2013 ensuring these mistakes never happen again. We\u2019re also reviewing current apartment design standards \u2013 to see how we can make them better. The spokesperson said the Labor government introduced apartment design standards in 2017, then expanded them in 2021. They said they would update the standards again, as recommended by a parliament inquiry, in 2026. These 2026 updates to the standards will apply statewide, including in the 50 areas near train stations and trams that they announced last week would be earmarked for great development. I had already been nude for a solid seven minutes when renowned artist Spencer Tunick yelled into a megaphone: \u201cNobody should be naked yet \u2013 there\u2019s still 45 minutes until sunrise!\u201d The thousands of other naked people milling around came to a halt. We glanced at each other with confused eyes. Did he just say we shouldn\u2019t be naked? Monique Ross writes about the experience participating in Spencer Tunick\u2019s work Rising Tide here: Why get naked on a Brisbane Bridge? For art More than 5,000 people have stripped bare in Brisbane today to participate in Spencer Tunick\u2019s latest work, called Rising Tide. The photographer said the photos on Story Bridge were a celebration of inclusivity and connection. The climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has congratulated David Crisafulli and the Queensland LNP on their election win. Co-operation between state and federal governments is one of the key ingredients to our successful energy transition and I look forward to working co-operatively with the new Energy Minister in the best interest of Qld and Australia. Police in New South Wales have launched an investigation after a police vehicle drove onto train tracks in the Sydney suburb of Mount Druitt. The police vehicle had been attempting to stop a motorcycle, which had been detected driving above the speed limit, when it drove through a fence and onto the tracks on Saturday afternoon. \u201cThe police vehicle followed the motorcycle and attempted to stop it \u2013 without initiating a pursuit \u2013 when, at the intersection of George Street and Beams Avenue, the police vehicle left the roadway and continued through a fence, before coming to a stop on the railway tracks,\u201d police said in a statement. The officers in the vehicle suffered minor injuries, while the motorcyclist rode from the scene. Emergency services were called to Mount Druitt railway station at about 4:40PM on Saturday, where they attended to the officers\u2019 injuries before removing the vehicle from the railway tracks. Police are appealing for anyone with dashcam footage or who have witnessed the incident to come forward. The New South Wales energy minister, Penny Sharpe, says food trucks are now travelling through the far west delivering food hampers: They\u2019ve dropped some in Menindee, and they\u2019re on their way to Wilcannia, and there will also be some in Broken Hill. If you had to throw out the contents of your fridge and you need some food, you can do that. She said all schools will be open tomorrow and recovery assistance points will open from Tuesday and Wednesday. Asked if she was satisfied with the progress, Sharpe conceded there was a \u201cslow start\u201d to work to get the transmission lines back up. She said: We\u2019re now seeing really great progress. What I saw this morning was very impressive. Workers are really putting everything into this. They\u2019ve got good plans. There\u2019s more people coming on every day. We almost saw that third tower go up and the plans are in there. There\u2019s seven there. If we get to four today, four out of seven is pretty good, and that means that it\u2019ll be energised as quickly as possible. Sharpe also issued another request to people in the far west of NSW to reduce power usage in the evening: Finally, I just ask when it hits 5:30pm tonight \u2013 I know people are probably sick of me saying this \u2013 if you can reduce your usage, that would be great. If you can turn off the lights in the rooms that you\u2019re not in, turn off non essential appliances, if you can put the air conditioner a bit hotter than you would normally have it. All of that\u2019s helping as all of the generation is coming on board. On behalf of the government, we are pleased with the progress of both the work that Essential and TransGrid have done in relation to this, there\u2019s been serious progress in the last 48 hours. We\u2019re not out of the woods yet, but we\u2019re very hopeful that that will continue. NSW energy minister says two of seven towers needed to reconnect Broken Hill to energy grid are online In New South Wales, the state\u2019s energy minister, Penny Sharpe, is providing an update on the rolling power outages in Broken Hill, after a storm cut the outback city off from the electricity network more than a week ago. Sharpe says two transmission towers are now up and running, with hopes for a further two today: \u201cWe were seeing a third one beginning to get put into place. We\u2019re very hopeful for a fourth today, but that\u2019s subject to the wind. It was a bit windy out there today and a lot of dust, but look, they\u2019re ready to go, and that\u2019s working really well. She says 100 Transgrid staff are on site working 24 shifts. Sharpe said: For the second night in a row, power remained on to all of the far west region thanks to the network of generators now in place that are supplying Broken Hill, Tibooburra, Wilcannia, Menindee, White Cliffs, Silverton and several other remote communities. All customers of the far west region have power. There was no need for load shedding during yesterday\u2019s evening peak. And again, thank everyone who is reducing [power use]. Any reduction in usage from 5:30pm onwards is really making a difference in helping us manage through this. At the moment, the advice is that from Central and from TransGrid, there are no planned outages for the next 48 hours [and] the main backup generator is operational. Steven Miles has resigned as Queensland premier at a meeting with the governor, Jeannette Young, this morning. At a press conference at parliament house a few minutes ago, he conceded to LNP leader David Crisafulli. He said he wants to remain as party leader if chosen by his caucus colleagues. \u201cThe result last night was much better than expected, but clearly nowhere near sufficient for a Labor victory. I\u2019m very proud of the campaign that I ran and the government that have led these last 10 months, but at the end of the day, clearly, Queenslanders for some time, have wanted to see change of government,\u201d Miles said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the polls pretty consistently for a long time now, they predicted a very, very bad result. The fact that many MPs have held their seats, it\u2019s a credit to them, but also I\u2019m going to give credit to the campaign that we ran.\u201d Miles said he had jumped the gun by about an hour last night when he suggested the party might not have a majority and might need to negotiate with the crossbench. He finished the press conference by announcing he was heading to the pub for a \u201cXXXX off the wood\u201d with supporters, a longstanding tradition. Pesutto continues criticism over Labor housing announcements Victoria\u2019s opposition leader, John Pesutto, said the state government had 10 years in office to get housing issues \u201cright\u201d but had failed to do so. He said: We\u2019ve seen a rush of announcements in the last week simply to try to pretend that there\u2019s real action being undertaken and nothing of substance has actually been delivered. The government hasn\u2019t come clean on what the costs of their policies will actually be, because, remember, they are shifting basic infrastructure costs to renters and home buyers through higher charges. They\u2019re not indicating that they have any willingness to bring down the costs of construction, whether that\u2019s through tax reform or tackling CFMEU misconduct on major construction sites. And let\u2019s remember large, high-density apartment complexes will be run by the CFMEU. Victorian opposition says fast-tracked building path has \u2018no substance\u2019 Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, has criticised the government\u2019s fast-tracked pathway for well-designed buildings, saying it has \u201cno substance\u201d. As we brought to you earlier, the planning minister, Sonya Kilkenny, announced plans for a \u201cgreat design fast track\u201d which would grant affordable, well-designed buildings an accelerated pathway through the planning approvals process. But Pesutto says the government can not be trusted to deliver on quality housing. He told reporters in Melbourne: The question has to be asked, how can they announce this fast-tracking process when they haven\u2019t even finalised guidelines for better apartment design? What it says is that the government is more interested in rushing out announcements with no substance. You would think that a responsible and prudent approach would be first to get the design guidelines right, as part of an announcement that will improve timelines for approvals and permits. We support reductions in timelines \u2013 subject to community input for approvals \u2013 for building permits and for planning. Of course, that\u2019s a good thing to reduce unnecessary delay. But to announce that before you\u2019ve actually settled on better apartment designs means that we risk seeing poor-quality stock come into the housing market. In 2022, a parliamentary inquiry into apartment design recommended the government introduce minimum sizes for apartments, rooms and balconies and specific sunlight requirements to ensure more quality developments. The government accepted the recommendations, but earlier this year said new apartment design standards will not be introduced until 2026. PM says Queensland election sends message to Greens to be progressive, not blockers The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says the Queensland election sends a big message to the Greens party and leader Adam Bandt. He said: People who elected Greens party representatives to state and federal parliament expected them to play a progressive role, not to play a blocking role; to seek to bring people together, not to divide people. Albanese said outgoing Labor premier Steven Miles ran an effective campaign, but it was hard to win a fourth term in office. Australia\u2019s Jillaroos will take on the Kiwi Ferns from New Zealand in the women\u2019s rugby league test in Christchurch, NZ. You can follow the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the match, which kicks off at 1.35pm AEDT, here: Victorian government announces fast-track pathway for \u2018well-designed\u2019 buildings Well-designed apartments and townhouses will be fast-tracked through the planning approval process in Victoria, the state\u2019s planning minister, Sonya Kilkenny, has announced. At a press conference in South Melbourne on Sunday, Kilkenny announced plans for a \u201cgreat design fast track\u201d which would reward affordable, well-designed buildings by granting them an accelerated pathway through the planning approvals process. The focus of the state-wide plan will be on townhouse and apartment projects of three to six storeys in height. She says it will provide developers confidence that cost-sensitive projects will not get stuck in \u201can expensive state of limbo\u201d. The government is also expanding its state design book of \u201cfuture homes\u201d \u2013 projects that are planned on paper alongside artists\u2019 impressions, but don\u2019t yet exist \u2013 by welcoming into its pages high-quality developments that are already complete. The design book, due to be complete by the end of the year, will also establish best-practice principles and guidance for well-designed apartments and townhouses to guide developers and give communities confidence about the long-term quality of new homes. The public will also be able to nominate buildings they think meet the good design criteria and deserve to be replicated across the state. Kilkenny: The community deserves affordable buildings that look great on the outside and feel solid as a rock on the inside. Our plan is for more grand designs but without the grand cost. We have an incredible opportunity before us to renew our suburbs and streets with well-designed apartments and townhouses that are great for singles, families and downsizers and which add to the architectural fabric of our state. It is the ninth housing announcement by the Victorian government in eight days focused on helping millennials achieve home ownership. Here\u2019s our weekend read on how the premier, Jacinta Allan, is pining her political hopes on the demographic: Queensland\u2019s director general for premier\u2019s department steps back The director general of Queensland\u2019s Department of Premier and Cabinet, Mike Kaiser, acknowledged he would not be continuing in the role after yesterday\u2019s LNP victory. In a post to networking site LinkedIn, Kaiser congratulated premier-elect David Crisafulli and said: I fully respect his decision and hope my attitude goes some way to overcoming the nonsense that premiers can\u2019t choose their head of department in a modern democracy. Kaiser thanked the former premier Steven Miles for the opportunity. David Crisafulli has spoken at Queensland parliament house for the first time as premier-elect. The LNP leader again thanked unsuccessful candidates from both sides before declaring he would get to work quickly. Crisafulli and his deputy, Jarrod Bleijie, will visit the governor tomorrow to be sworn into interim roles. The full cabinet will be sworn in later. The director general of the Department of Premier and Cabinet, Mike Kaiser, will be replaced by the public service commissioner, David Mackie. \u201c[Kaiser] was incredibly gracious in that phone call. He has prepared an incoming brief for us,\u201d Crisafulli said. I want to thank Mike for the way he\u2019s conducted himself this morning. The Labor leader, Steve Miles, is expected to speak at parliament later today. NT inmate numbers hit record high Record high inmate numbers in the Northern Territory have triggered a mass shift of prisoners. The NT corrections commissioner, Matthew Varley, ordered a mass shift of prisoners after the territory\u2019s inmate numbers hit a record high of 2,370 on Friday. The record numbers have put \u201csignificant pressure\u201d on the Darwin and Alice Springs correctional centres and police watch houses. More than 90 prisoners would be transferred under Varley\u2019s directions. \u2013 AAP Why is Kmart thriving and other questions about retailers in a cost-of-living crisis The last full-sized Kmart in the US closed this week \u2013 yet another casualty of online buying habits proving to be an existential threat to department stores around the world. But in Australia the discount retailer that shares the same branding is bucking the global trend after engaging in a years-long transformation to shed its daggy image. The result? Supercharged profits for its owner. Revenue at the Wesfarmers-owned Kmart Group jumped almost 5% last financial year to $11.1bn, even as cost-of-living pressures dampened the mood of many shoppers. Meanwhile, revenues have been sliding at rival Big W. Read more: What does the Queensland election show about the state\u2019s new political realities? The Queensland electorate has delivered a change of government, but it was not the overwhelming Labor defeat expected at the start of the campaign and has left the ALP with a sizeable opposition. Labor clawed back support during the campaign and only suffered modest losses in the south-east of the state. But it was hit hard in the regions, bringing Queensland Labor in line with the federal party and other state branches who have found their support increasingly concentrated in the big cities. It now looks like the Liberal National party will end up with a majority similar to the modest majorities Labor has governed with since 2017.

Immigration minister Tony Burke has cancelled the visa of controversial US conservative commentator Candace Owens, according to the SMH. Burke said Owens had the capacity \u201cto incite discord in almost every direction\u201d: Australia\u2019s national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere else. Owens has shows scheduled in November in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide. The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has congratulated his party mate David Crisafulli for his win in the Queensland state election overnight. Dutton tweeted this morning: Queenslanders wanted change, and they\u2019ve voted for it. They wanted action on crime, cost of living, health and housing, and they\u2019ve voted for it. The federal Coalition leader and fellow Queenslander had campaigned for Crisafulli\u2019s election in the campaign\u2019s final days, but questions remain over the disconnect between the two men on the Coalition\u2019s signature nuclear policy. Crisafulli had said he wasn\u2019t planning on nuclear in Queensland\u2019s power grid \u2013 but Dutton has indicated the federal Coalition, if elected to government, would stick with that policy even if state leaders didn\u2019t back it. Upon Crisafulli\u2019s election win, there will be further questions about how the nuclear issue will be addressed. Dutton continued: I wish David and his new LNP Government all the best on delivering a fresh start for Queenslanders. The federal Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has conceded that the incoming Queensland premier David Crisafulli\u2019s handling of the pregnancy termination debate cost the LNP votes. Speaking on Sky News, he said: David, on reflection, would probably prefer to have been stronger in his language \u2013 in being certain that there won\u2019t be any changes to the laws. Abortion emerged as one of the biggest issues in the Queensland election after crossbencher Robbie Katter announced he would introduce a bill to repeal abortion laws before walking back his proposal to \u201cborn alive\u201d legislation. Though signs are pointing to a majority government for the LNP, the win was not the landslide predicted by opinion polls leading up to the vote. As the polling date drew nearer, the LNP leader was asked more than 100 times about his stance on abortion before finally clarifying he was pro-choice. \u2013 AAP Telstra and Optus begin switching off 3G networks Telstra and Optus will begin switching off their 3G networks from tomorrow. Customers still using 3G are urged to check their devices, especially phones, medical monitors and Eftpos machines, for compatibility with 4G and 5G networks. The telecommunications companies say the closure will improve the speed and reliability of 4G and 5G networks. In August, the Telstra CEO, Vicki Brady, said: We have been communicating to customers about the need to prepare and make the move for almost five years. This has included multiple letters, bill messages, SMS, public awareness campaigns, advertising \u2013 even door knocking and sending free phones to people in vulnerable circumstances, and our support for customers won\u2019t end the day the network closes. TPG Telecom (formerly Vodafone) switched off its 3G network in December 2023. A look at \u2018incredibly expressive and very flirtatious\u2019 Maratus spiders Australian Maratus spiders, which measure 3-5mm, are known as \u201cpeacock spiders\u201d because of the extravagant colourings they display during courtship rituals and combat. Sydney-based artist Maria Fernanda Cardoso became fascinated with the tiny spiders, which she has depicted in the series Spiders of Paradise, in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia. Cardoso said of the spiders: They\u2019re incredibly expressive and very flirtatious. The male wants to get all the attention of the female, like birds of paradise.

That\u2019s not talking about net zero. That\u2019s talking about actual emissions reductions as a total. So what\u2019s the proposal? Are you intending to wipe out the cattle herd, are you going to reduce traffic by 75%? Keith Pitt: abortion should be \u2018legal, safe and rare\u2019 On abortion, the National party MP, Keith Pitt, says he supports people\u2019s freedom of choice. It\u2019s entirely a state piece of legislation. I\u2019ll quote others: legal, safe and rare. He describes Queensland Labor\u2019s tactics on the issue \u201cdistasteful and disgraceful\u201d on ABC Insiders. The Labor leader, Steven Miles, has called David Crisafulli to congratulate him on becoming premier. Miles made the call about 7.30am this morning. The LNP leader looks certain to win majority government and become premier, winning several seats in regional Queensland. Miles has been leader since December last year. In a concession speech last night he implied a desire to continue on in the role. The counting continues. Cameron Dick: crime a big factor in Labor\u2019s Queensland loss On ABC Insiders, the outgoing Queensland treasurer, Cameron Dick, acknowledges crime was a big factor in the state\u2019s election. It became an issue, particularly in regional Queensland, around trust. I think in the end, regional Queenslanders did not trust us to address that issue. The Labor leadership automatically becomes vacant, following the election results. Dick says whoever becomes the leader will need to focus on rebuilding trust. A man has died after he was found with a stab wound this morning on Geelong\u2019s main hospitality strip. Police say the 20-year-old man was found on Little Malop Street about 5.30am with a stab wound, which they believe he sustained during an altercation nearby. He was taken to hospital, where he later died. Two other men police believe were involved in the altercation self-presented at a hospital and are being treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Homicide squad detectives are now investigating the incident. They\u2019ve urged anyone who witnessed the incident or has information that could assist police to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report online at crimestoppersvic.com.au. Greens go backwards in Queensland election, says ABC analyst ABC election analyst Casey Briggs tells ABC Insiders that while there are still seats in doubt in the Queensland election, the Greens have not claimed any at this point. There are a couple of seats in doubt, but the Greens have certainly not gone forwards. They may well have gone backwards at the end of the night. A warm and sunny Sunday ahead for much of the country, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Australian sandalwood at risk of extinction Consumers and celebrities around the world covet it for its warm, earthy and musky scent, but Australian sandalwood\u2019s popularity has come at more than just a hefty cost to the wallet, with some scientists warning the species is at risk of extinction in the wild. Richard McLellan, an adjunct research fellow at Charles Sturt University, said: Australian sandalwood\u2019s downfall is that it\u2019s one of the most fragrant species of sandalwood in the world. A lot of people know sandalwood very well but very few people know it\u2019s declining in the wild and it\u2019s been over-harvested for decades.

      "body": "<p>Yaryna Chornohuz is a poised, thoughtful young woman with a sweep of long hair, elegantly manicured nails, and a military uniform. In 2019, she joined a volunteer unit as a combat medic, and is now a soldier of the 140th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion. At 29, she is also fast becoming one of <a href=\"https://7uapoems.substack.com/p/seven-poems-a-week-week-4-yaryna\">Ukraine\u2019s most celebrated poets</a>.</p> <p>From the perspective of a country unthreatened by direct military aggression, it is hard to grasp the extent to which the 10-year-long Russian war against Ukraine, which so brutally escalated on 24 February 2022, has consumed the nation\u2019s young \u2013 not just those conscripted through a recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/11/ukraine-demobilisation-plan-long-serving-soldiers-military-war-russia\">tightening of mobilisation laws</a>, but the many motivated to volunteer, like Chornohuz. It\u2019s a cruel twist of history for this generation of Ukrainians that war has cast its shadow over their lives. Chornohuz tells me that she likes being a soldier, but also has ambitions to study for a PhD at some point. \u201cI feel it would be also very natural for me to teach literature,\u201d she says. \u201cIf Russia hadn\u2019t attacked us I am not sure I would be in the military.\u201d</p>    <p>Young people from all walks of life have been sucked into the war\u2019s greedy mouth, among them numerous creative artists: poets, actors, artists, playwrights, novelists, musicians. <a href=\"https://www.sevenstoriespress.co.uk/books/rock-paper-grenade\">Artem Chekh</a>, one of Ukraine\u2019s best-known novelists, fought in the trenches in the years after the 2014 Russian-backed takeovers of Crimea and the Donbas in Ukraine\u2019s east, and last year was part of the defence of Bakhmut. <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/serhiy-zhadan\">Serhiy Zhadan</a> \u2013 poet, novelist, rock star and Ukrainian national treasure \u2013 was touring with his band Zhadan and the Dogs to raise money for the army until this spring, when he volunteered for the 13th Khartia Brigade, local to his home city of Kharkiv.</p> <p>Being an artist should not, Chornohuz tells me, grant you a special status among your fellow citizens \u2013 some kind of immunity from putting your body at risk in defence of the country. The idea of a \u201ccultural front\u201d, at which artists might \u201cfight\u201d by continuing to make their work far behind the lines, had some currency at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but is, by now, largely discredited in Ukraine: the bloodiness and terror of the actual combat zone renders the idea of a \u201ccultural front\u201d absurd to many. Chornohuz has little time for the notion that \u201cthere are people who are more useful in the rear and some who are more useful on the frontline\u2026 The life of, I don\u2019t know, a guy, from a village who has been a farmer all his life isn\u2019t less valuable than the life of an intellectual or poet, or a writer or politician, or anyone else,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you can describe the hardest thing you went through, it means that you can survive it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And artists are being killed: among recent losses have been machine gunner and poet, <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-war-poet-maksym-kryvtsov-death/32769907.html\">Maksym Kryvtsov</a>, who died in January this year, aged 33, after publishing his debut collection. Not all of these dead are combatants: <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/rights/william-collins-to-publish-two-books-by-late-ukrainian-author-victoria-amelina\">Victoria Amelina</a>, novelist turned war-crimes investigator, died after a missile attack on a pizzeria in eastern Ukraine last year, aged 37. It is a cliche of Ukrainian literary history, writer turned soldier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/09/ukrainian-author-oleksandr-mykhed-the-language-of-war\">Oleksandr Mykhed</a> tells me, that Ukrainian writers don\u2019t make old bones. The history books are littered with artists with \u201ca promising debut, a first collection of poems, a second collection of stories\u201d before being wiped out, he says \u2013 by Stalin\u2019s purges, or by later repressions that saw poets such <a href=\"https://www.poetryinternationalonline.com/poet/vasyl-stus/\">Vasyl Stus</a> die in the gulag. Now, he says, it\u2019s happening all over again.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When the full-scale invasion started on 24 February 2022, Chornohuz was already on the eastern frontline of the war that has been grinding on since 2014. She was due for a rotation that never came. Instead, \u201cwe were thrown as infantry against a big Russian advance. That was when I lost my platoon commander, and some of the guys I served with, and we couldn\u2019t even bring out the bodies.\u201d At that time, she thought she\u2019d never write poems again. But then she realised that she should \u2013 to keep her companions\u2019 memory alive. \u201cPoetry books have become monuments,\u201d she says. They might also be a weapon. In one poem, she writes: \u201cSometimes it seems that I learned to kill with poems / dropping a grenade hanging from a drone.\u201d She explains the image: \u201cTo express the sharp truth about our existence is actually deadly for our enemies, who are building this absolutely horrible world inside Russia. To write poetry that expresses the truth is dangerous for them.\u201d</p> <p>Chornohuz tells me she\u2019s been reading the early poetry of <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/paul-eluard\">Paul Eluard</a>, who also served as a combat medic. Where Eluard\u2019s direct experiences are somewhat occluded and encoded in his work, the Russo-Ukrainian war is being fought out in a different poetic and emotional age: often Ukrainian poets want to communicate their feelings while they are raw and immediate, rather than recollect them in tranquillity. The Russo-Ukrainian war is being documented perhaps more fully than any previous conflict. But poetry chronicles something particular, something fragile, evanescent and hard to capture by other means. \u201cPoetry,\u201d Chornohuz says, \u201cis the documentation of feelings.\u201d</p>    <p>Art may be a retreat, as well as a form of attack. For painter <a href=\"https://www.vladimelnix.art/\">Vladyslav Melnyk</a> \u2013 a young man from Dnipro, the tattoos on his face dating from a time in his life when \u201cI decided to separate myself from society\u201d \u2013 art was impossible during the early months of the war. \u201cI couldn\u2019t paint for nine months. I had some kind of block. I couldn\u2019t do anything, I felt totally helpless,\u201d he says. The feeling of impotence and anxiety got worse when a family member was made a prisoner of war at the end of 2022. It was after Melnyk volunteered that, paradoxically perhaps, he felt a sense of unlocking. \u201cOnly after four months in the army did I accumulate the energy, and something inside me changed. And now when I come back home and the paint is flowing, it brings me back to my childhood, to food on the table, to family. I can be myself. I don\u2019t have to ask anyone for anything here, I don\u2019t have to follow rules, I just dissolve in time.\u201d</p> <p>Melnyk works in air defence. \u201cThe work I am doing does not reflect the service,\u201d he says, in his airy studio in an apartment block in central Kyiv, its walls decorated with souvenirs and reminders of the war, including a fragment of missile signed by its Russian \u201csender\u201d. \u201cIt reflects that in the darkest time you can find light.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you accept the apocalypse is inevitable \u2013 that\u2019s when thoughts appear in your head that were impossible before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few days later, I meet a soldier-poet called Seraphim Hordienko, who walks into the meeting place of his choosing \u2013 a biker club in Kyiv established in honour of a fallen soldier \u2013 with swagger and a handgun tucked into his trousers. He has just published an anthology of writings by him and other young volunteers: one of the poems was literally written in the trenches, under artillery fire, by an injured soldier. \u201cWe understand that we won\u2019t have a problem with this war being documented,\u201d says Hordienko who, by spring 2022, was already on the frontline in the Donetsk region. \u201cBut depicting emotional states is a lot more complicated \u2013 and more important. Because everyone, as participants, will leave these emotional states behind and forget them. Things have to be written here and now while the feelings are real.\u201d</p> <p>A 19-year-old history undergraduate when he volunteered at the start of the full-scale invasion, Hordienko, who is from Odesa, is now part of a drone unit. \u201cI was raised with a medieval knight\u2019s vision of life, and a knight needs a dragon to fight,\u201d he says, seeming, in that moment, simultaneously boy-like, and far too old for his years.</p>    <p>He describes the early days of the war, when he and a group of friends volunteered, and \u201cevery day felt like it could be the last\u201d. The sheer enormity of their frontline experience meant that the teenagers began to reach for new forms of expression, to make it comprehensible even to themselves. \u201cThe extreme condition of the mind, when you accept the apocalypse is inevitable \u2013 that\u2019s when thoughts appear in your head that were impossible before. They find their way out through poems, films, texts,\u201d he says. There is, perhaps, also a need to claim a sense of control over the unfathomable events of war. \u201cWhen you can describe the hardest thing you went through, it means that you can survive it,\u201d says Yaryna Chornohuz. \u201cKeeping silent about something \u2013 it kills you from within.\u201d</p> <p>Hordienko is launching an online platform to which soldiers can submit their work. \u201cWe can\u2019t know whether the next Remarque will bring his novel to us,\u201d he says, referring to the author of the first world war novel <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>, \u201cbut we are creating all the conditions that will enable them to do so.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe are convinced that in 50 or 100 years\u2019 time, the world will remember this war not through reportage, but through art.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is a cruel paradox of the Russo-Ukrainian war that, while it is killing so many promising artists, it is also creating them. \u201cIt took a global cataclysm to turn me into a writer,\u201d says Hordienko, with characteristic Ukrainian black humour. In Kyiv\u2019s ancient Podil district, the Theatre of Playwrights, a recently established new-writing theatre, is proving his point. This month, the first veteran\u2019s drama festival took place, staging, as well as recording for audio, short works by military personnel and soldiers\u2019 partners. Maksym Kurochkin \u2013 one of the country\u2019s leading playwrights, who volunteered for the army at the start of the full-scale invasion \u2013 is one of the organisers of the event, titled <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=518821467785188&amp;id=100089720168329&amp;rdid=jlg4ztKJcoGerbps\">Theatre of Veterans</a>.</p>    <p>Part of the impetus behind the festival was, he says, to foreground the authentic, unmediated voices of war. \u201cThe world hears us,\u201d he says, backstage at the theatre, \u201cbut not very clearly. Information comes through various middlemen. Even so-called \u2018good Russians\u2019 tell the world how we feel. Our task is, first of all, to return the right to a voice to those who are usually silent \u2013 soldiers, veterans \u2013 and we need their voice to sound clear.\u201d</p> <p>After an open call for participants, 15 people, ranging in age from 19 to 55, were chosen to take part in a scheme that would propel them from theatre novice to performed playwright. \u201cWe wanted to find people who really wanted to tell their own stories. Not people who wanted to be a theatre star but those who had something to say,\u201d says co-organiser Yuriy Matsarsky, a journalist in civilian life who is now part of a military media unit. \u201cI believe that each person has enough material within themselves to write at least one play,\u201d says Kurochkin.</p>    <p>Like many cultural projects in Ukraine, Theatre of Veterans is run on almost zero budget and a lot of hard work and goodwill. From early this year, Kurochkin called on the best of Ukraine\u2019s theatre professionals, including the great playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/natal-ya-vorozhbit\">Natal\u2019ya Vorozhbit</a>, to instruct the participants in the art of playwriting. Some had never used a computer before, outside the military. One joined by Zoom from the frontline in New York, a town (so named by its German founders in the 19th century) in eastern Ukraine, now under Russian occupation. Gennady Udovenko, a soldier originally from the Donetsk region, has written about his foot being blown off by a mine: the play, which runs at about 20 minutes, charts his medical evacuation, darting back in time to dramatise earlier episodes in his life.</p> <p>Maksym Devizorov, an actor in civilian life but new to writing, has worked on a drama about a tender but sadly recognisable wartime subject: the collapse of a relationship.

      "bodyText": "Yaryna Chornohuz is a poised, thoughtful young woman with a sweep of long hair, elegantly manicured nails, and a military uniform. In 2019, she joined a volunteer unit as a combat medic, and is now a soldier of the 140th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion. At 29, she is also fast becoming one of Ukraine\u2019s most celebrated poets. From the perspective of a country unthreatened by direct military aggression, it is hard to grasp the extent to which the 10-year-long Russian war against Ukraine, which so brutally escalated on 24 February 2022, has consumed the nation\u2019s young \u2013 not just those conscripted through a recent tightening of mobilisation laws, but the many motivated to volunteer, like Chornohuz. It\u2019s a cruel twist of history for this generation of Ukrainians that war has cast its shadow over their lives. Chornohuz tells me that she likes being a soldier, but also has ambitions to study for a PhD at some point. \u201cI feel it would be also very natural for me to teach literature,\u201d she says. \u201cIf Russia hadn\u2019t attacked us I am not sure I would be in the military.\u201d Young people from all walks of life have been sucked into the war\u2019s greedy mouth, among them numerous creative artists: poets, actors, artists, playwrights, novelists, musicians. Artem Chekh, one of Ukraine\u2019s best-known novelists, fought in the trenches in the years after the 2014 Russian-backed takeovers of Crimea and the Donbas in Ukraine\u2019s east, and last year was part of the defence of Bakhmut. Serhiy Zhadan \u2013 poet, novelist, rock star and Ukrainian national treasure \u2013 was touring with his band Zhadan and the Dogs to raise money for the army until this spring, when he volunteered for the 13th Khartia Brigade, local to his home city of Kharkiv. Being an artist should not, Chornohuz tells me, grant you a special status among your fellow citizens \u2013 some kind of immunity from putting your body at risk in defence of the country. The idea of a \u201ccultural front\u201d, at which artists might \u201cfight\u201d by continuing to make their work far behind the lines, had some currency at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but is, by now, largely discredited in Ukraine: the bloodiness and terror of the actual combat zone renders the idea of a \u201ccultural front\u201d absurd to many. Chornohuz has little time for the notion that \u201cthere are people who are more useful in the rear and some who are more useful on the frontline\u2026 The life of, I don\u2019t know, a guy, from a village who has been a farmer all his life isn\u2019t less valuable than the life of an intellectual or poet, or a writer or politician, or anyone else,\u201d she says. And artists are being killed: among recent losses have been machine gunner and poet, Maksym Kryvtsov, who died in January this year, aged 33, after publishing his debut collection. Not all of these dead are combatants: Victoria Amelina, novelist turned war-crimes investigator, died after a missile attack on a pizzeria in eastern Ukraine last year, aged 37. It is a cliche of Ukrainian literary history, writer turned soldier Oleksandr Mykhed tells me, that Ukrainian writers don\u2019t make old bones. The history books are littered with artists with \u201ca promising debut, a first collection of poems, a second collection of stories\u201d before being wiped out, he says \u2013 by Stalin\u2019s purges, or by later repressions that saw poets such Vasyl Stus die in the gulag. Now, he says, it\u2019s happening all over again. * * * When the full-scale invasion started on 24 February 2022, Chornohuz was already on the eastern frontline of the war that has been grinding on since 2014. She was due for a rotation that never came. Instead, \u201cwe were thrown as infantry against a big Russian advance. That was when I lost my platoon commander, and some of the guys I served with, and we couldn\u2019t even bring out the bodies.\u201d At that time, she thought she\u2019d never write poems again. But then she realised that she should \u2013 to keep her companions\u2019 memory alive. \u201cPoetry books have become monuments,\u201d she says. They might also be a weapon. In one poem, she writes: \u201cSometimes it seems that I learned to kill with poems / dropping a grenade hanging from a drone.\u201d She explains the image: \u201cTo express the sharp truth about our existence is actually deadly for our enemies, who are building this absolutely horrible world inside Russia. To write poetry that expresses the truth is dangerous for them.\u201d Chornohuz tells me she\u2019s been reading the early poetry of Paul Eluard, who also served as a combat medic. Where Eluard\u2019s direct experiences are somewhat occluded and encoded in his work, the Russo-Ukrainian war is being fought out in a different poetic and emotional age: often Ukrainian poets want to communicate their feelings while they are raw and immediate, rather than recollect them in tranquillity. The Russo-Ukrainian war is being documented perhaps more fully than any previous conflict. But poetry chronicles something particular, something fragile, evanescent and hard to capture by other means. \u201cPoetry,\u201d Chornohuz says, \u201cis the documentation of feelings.\u201d Art may be a retreat, as well as a form of attack. For painter Vladyslav Melnyk \u2013 a young man from Dnipro, the tattoos on his face dating from a time in his life when \u201cI decided to separate myself from society\u201d \u2013 art was impossible during the early months of the war. \u201cI couldn\u2019t paint for nine months. I had some kind of block. I couldn\u2019t do anything, I felt totally helpless,\u201d he says. The feeling of impotence and anxiety got worse when a family member was made a prisoner of war at the end of 2022. It was after Melnyk volunteered that, paradoxically perhaps, he felt a sense of unlocking. \u201cOnly after four months in the army did I accumulate the energy, and something inside me changed. And now when I come back home and the paint is flowing, it brings me back to my childhood, to food on the table, to family. I can be myself. I don\u2019t have to ask anyone for anything here, I don\u2019t have to follow rules, I just dissolve in time.\u201d Melnyk works in air defence. \u201cThe work I am doing does not reflect the service,\u201d he says, in his airy studio in an apartment block in central Kyiv, its walls decorated with souvenirs and reminders of the war, including a fragment of missile signed by its Russian \u201csender\u201d. \u201cIt reflects that in the darkest time you can find light.\u201d A few days later, I meet a soldier-poet called Seraphim Hordienko, who walks into the meeting place of his choosing \u2013 a biker club in Kyiv established in honour of a fallen soldier \u2013 with swagger and a handgun tucked into his trousers. He has just published an anthology of writings by him and other young volunteers: one of the poems was literally written in the trenches, under artillery fire, by an injured soldier. \u201cWe understand that we won\u2019t have a problem with this war being documented,\u201d says Hordienko who, by spring 2022, was already on the frontline in the Donetsk region. \u201cBut depicting emotional states is a lot more complicated \u2013 and more important. Because everyone, as participants, will leave these emotional states behind and forget them. Things have to be written here and now while the feelings are real.\u201d A 19-year-old history undergraduate when he volunteered at the start of the full-scale invasion, Hordienko, who is from Odesa, is now part of a drone unit. \u201cI was raised with a medieval knight\u2019s vision of life, and a knight needs a dragon to fight,\u201d he says, seeming, in that moment, simultaneously boy-like, and far too old for his years. He describes the early days of the war, when he and a group of friends volunteered, and \u201cevery day felt like it could be the last\u201d. The sheer enormity of their frontline experience meant that the teenagers began to reach for new forms of expression, to make it comprehensible even to themselves. \u201cThe extreme condition of the mind, when you accept the apocalypse is inevitable \u2013 that\u2019s when thoughts appear in your head that were impossible before. They find their way out through poems, films, texts,\u201d he says. There is, perhaps, also a need to claim a sense of control over the unfathomable events of war. \u201cWhen you can describe the hardest thing you went through, it means that you can survive it,\u201d says Yaryna Chornohuz. \u201cKeeping silent about something \u2013 it kills you from within.\u201d Hordienko is launching an online platform to which soldiers can submit their work. \u201cWe can\u2019t know whether the next Remarque will bring his novel to us,\u201d he says, referring to the author of the first world war novel All Quiet on the Western Front, \u201cbut we are creating all the conditions that will enable them to do so.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe are convinced that in 50 or 100 years\u2019 time, the world will remember this war not through reportage, but through art.\u201d * * * It is a cruel paradox of the Russo-Ukrainian war that, while it is killing so many promising artists, it is also creating them. \u201cIt took a global cataclysm to turn me into a writer,\u201d says Hordienko, with characteristic Ukrainian black humour. In Kyiv\u2019s ancient Podil district, the Theatre of Playwrights, a recently established new-writing theatre, is proving his point. This month, the first veteran\u2019s drama festival took place, staging, as well as recording for audio, short works by military personnel and soldiers\u2019 partners. Maksym Kurochkin \u2013 one of the country\u2019s leading playwrights, who volunteered for the army at the start of the full-scale invasion \u2013 is one of the organisers of the event, titled Theatre of Veterans. Part of the impetus behind the festival was, he says, to foreground the authentic, unmediated voices of war. \u201cThe world hears us,\u201d he says, backstage at the theatre, \u201cbut not very clearly. Information comes through various middlemen. Even so-called \u2018good Russians\u2019 tell the world how we feel. Our task is, first of all, to return the right to a voice to those who are usually silent \u2013 soldiers, veterans \u2013 and we need their voice to sound clear.\u201d After an open call for participants, 15 people, ranging in age from 19 to 55, were chosen to take part in a scheme that would propel them from theatre novice to performed playwright. \u201cWe wanted to find people who really wanted to tell their own stories. Not people who wanted to be a theatre star but those who had something to say,\u201d says co-organiser Yuriy Matsarsky, a journalist in civilian life who is now part of a military media unit. \u201cI believe that each person has enough material within themselves to write at least one play,\u201d says Kurochkin. Like many cultural projects in Ukraine, Theatre of Veterans is run on almost zero budget and a lot of hard work and goodwill. From early this year, Kurochkin called on the best of Ukraine\u2019s theatre professionals, including the great playwright Natal\u2019ya Vorozhbit, to instruct the participants in the art of playwriting. Some had never used a computer before, outside the military. One joined by Zoom from the frontline in New York, a town (so named by its German founders in the 19th century) in eastern Ukraine, now under Russian occupation. Gennady Udovenko, a soldier originally from the Donetsk region, has written about his foot being blown off by a mine: the play, which runs at about 20 minutes, charts his medical evacuation, darting back in time to dramatise earlier episodes in his life. Maksym Devizorov, an actor in civilian life but new to writing, has worked on a drama about a tender but sadly recognisable wartime subject: the collapse of a relationship. His breakup from his wife, he says, whom he married in May 2022, happened while he was in the combat zone. \u201cWe found ourselves unready for this long-term separation. My wife\u2019s resource of being able to wait for me kind of ran out.\u201d Devizorov\u2019s professional experience in the theatre means he is also supporting fellow writers. \u201cA play by one of the younger participants is about getting a conscription notice and his mixture of feelings of guilt and fear,\u201d he says. The surreality of war, the way \u201cnormality\u201d jostles up against the utterly unspeakable, is exemplified by the work of another writer, Alina Sarnatska, whose play has a woman \u201cliterally collecting body parts of her brothers-in-arms while taking a call from her children\u2019s school\u201d. By working on the project, and hard \u2013 Udovenko says that Kurochkin pushed him to about 16 drafts of his text \u2013 the participants are also learning soft skills that should help them in their future life, whether or not they decide to pursue writing or the theatre. But there is also a deeper motive. As the Russo-Ukrainian war drags on, the gulf between people\u2019s experiences of it is widening and deepening \u2013 between those at the front, those living under occupation, those internally displaced, those in exile abroad, those in grief.

He said that he \u201chad made his money largely on luxury\u201d and that he was amazed by how beautiful it was inside the White House. But then it was back to the regular targets: he demonised migrants, spoke warmly about Vladimir Putin and falsely claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from him. Rogan tried to push him on nuclear power and the environment, but Trump only wanted to discuss how ugly he finds windfarms. Kamala Harris election news Michelle Obama made her first appearance on the campaign trail since her blockbuster speech at the Democratic national convention in August. She urged voters to back Harris not because she\u2019s a woman but \u201cbecause Kamala Harris is a grown-up \u2013 and Lord knows we need a grown-up in the White House\u201d. When Harris spoke at the Michigan rally, she promised to be a president who listened to the American people, unlike her opponent, whom she accused of \u201clooking in the mirror all the time\u201d. \u201cJust imagine the Oval Office in three months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is either Donald Trump in there stewing over his enemies\u2019 list \u2013 or me working for you, checking off my to-do list.\u201d Harris visited a local doctor\u2019s office in nearby Portage, where she spoke to healthcare providers and medical students about the impact of abortion restrictions. Harris has made protecting what remains of abortion access a major theme of her closing argument to voters, using it to draw a sharp contrast with Trump, who has claimed credit for his role in overturning Roe v Wade but insisted he would allow a nationwide ban as president. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Less than a fortnight before polling day, Harris and Trump are locked in a nail-bitingly close US presidential election race, our 10-day polling tracking average shows. According to poll averages, Harris leads by a single point in Michigan and by less than 1% in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Nevada. Trump has a two-point lead in North Carolina and a one-point lead in Arizona. High-profile Trump backer Elon Musk briefly worked illegally in the US after abandoning a graduate studies program in California, according to a Washington Post report that contrasted the episode with his anti-immigration views. The South African multibillionaire has previously maintained that his transition from student to entrepreneur was a \u201clegal grey area\u201d.

Greens risk losing both their seats The Queensland election was unquestionably a bad result for the Greens \u2013 the party looks like it might lose both its state seats. Commentators on Saturday night were tempted to overlay national issues on to Queensland to explain the Greens\u2019 losses as a rejection of the Max Chandler-Mather version of the federal party that has felt more abrasive as it muscles in on debates about housing, Palestine and other issues. That might be the case, to some extent, in Maiwar, where Michael Berkman is unexpectedly in trouble. Berkman, a former environmental lawyer, is hardworking and popular in an area \u2013 around Toowong and Indooroopilly \u2013 that is the traditional home of Queensland\u2019s small-L liberals. The absence of vitriolic \u201cclimate wars\u201d that have marked Queensland politics for decades will not have helped the Greens in Maiwar and elsewhere. In Cooper, McConnel and South Brisbane, the Greens\u2019 vote went backwards, but not to a dire extent.

The weirdest thing is that it didn\u2019t feel weird at all.</p> <p>I had a lot of expectations going into RISING TIDE \u2013 the latest work by Tunick, a New York-based photographer who documents the live nude figure in public \u2013 and none of them were good. I have spent a lifetime wishing there was less of me and am yet to untangle my self-worth from my appearance; the unhinged diet culture of the 90s has a lot to answer for.</p> <p>My biggest fear about joining in Tunick\u2019s shoot was that someone I know would see me. Or, more accurately, that they wouldn\u2019t like what they saw.</p> <p>So I was braced to feel self-conscious, exposed, and ashamed. I mostly signed up because I was curious about the logistics of staging such a mammoth event. But there is safety in numbers, and I felt strangely at home surrounded by 5,500 bodies \u2013 a record-breaking turnout for Tunick in Australia.</p>    <p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s nowhere to hide, there\u2019s nothing to hide,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/moonheaddragofficial/\">drag artist Zach</a> told me. \u201cAll your insecurities go away.\u201d</p> <p>RISING TIDE is a sequel to TIDE, a work Tunick shot in Brisbane in 2023 as part of Melt festival, which celebrates the queer community and our allies. As we gathered in the dark across the entire length of the Story Bridge, Tunick told the crowd our \u201cliving sculpture\u201d was a vote for diversity, equity and inclusion. It felt especially timely the morning after Queensland elected a Liberal-National Party government.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The artist relayed directions over a loudspeaker. No smiling. We faced him, then faced away. Put our arms up toward the sky, then back down. Then we lay on our backs, and rolled to one side. The road was hard and wet. Hearing others shiver, I felt grateful for the soft folds insulating my body.</p>    <p>At first I tried not to look at other people\u2019s bodies, but eventually I let myself see them. Stocky bodies. Sagging bodies. Tattooed bodies. Transitioning bodies. Scarred bodies. Bony bodies. Pregnant bodies. Chiselled bodies. Bodies needing assistance from a wheelchair, a walker, a pair of crutches. Taking in this ordinary and extraordinary landscape was an act of radical self-love. It made me feel less alone.</p> <p>The crowd chatted and cheered between poses. A man named Chris told me he wanted to build up the confidence to enjoy nude beaches. Reeta hoped the experience would symbolise a turning point after a difficult year. Mark joked that Brisbanites just want any excuse to walk on a closed public roadway. \u201cIt\u2019s our culture,\u201d he said. He\u2019s right \u2013 50,000 people turned out for a public walk through the newly built Clem Jones tunnel back in 2010.</p> <p>After an hour, we dressed again then headed to the next location, Howard Smith Wharves. We undressed for a second time, and took up new positions along the Riverwalk that snakes along the water.</p> <p>The Riverwalk felt like a Broadway stage compared to the closed-off bridge. Tourists on a passing CityCat waved and took videos. Residents of the multi-million-dollar properties overlooking the water stood on their balconies, bemused. For one man, it was a rude awakening. \u201cWhat a nightmare view,\u201d he complained. His nightmare was just beginning: our next position was a child\u2019s pose, our bare bums shining up at him.</p> <p>It was liberating, fun, and also monotonous at times.

      "bodyText": "I had already been nude for a solid seven minutes when renowned artist Spencer Tunick yelled into a megaphone: \u201cNobody should be naked yet \u2013 there\u2019s still 45 minutes until sunrise!\u201d The thousands of other naked people milling around came to a halt. We glanced at each other with confused eyes. Did he just say we shouldn\u2019t be naked? A few keen beans had jumped the gun, and a few more had followed suit. Some people reunited with their clothes, but for me, there was no going back. So at 4am on Sunday, I found myself sitting in a gutter near Brisbane\u2019s Story Bridge, soaked from the rain, completely starkers. The weirdest thing is that it didn\u2019t feel weird at all. I had a lot of expectations going into RISING TIDE \u2013 the latest work by Tunick, a New York-based photographer who documents the live nude figure in public \u2013 and none of them were good. I have spent a lifetime wishing there was less of me and am yet to untangle my self-worth from my appearance; the unhinged diet culture of the 90s has a lot to answer for. My biggest fear about joining in Tunick\u2019s shoot was that someone I know would see me. Or, more accurately, that they wouldn\u2019t like what they saw. So I was braced to feel self-conscious, exposed, and ashamed. I mostly signed up because I was curious about the logistics of staging such a mammoth event. But there is safety in numbers, and I felt strangely at home surrounded by 5,500 bodies \u2013 a record-breaking turnout for Tunick in Australia. \u201cWhen there\u2019s nowhere to hide, there\u2019s nothing to hide,\u201d drag artist Zach told me. \u201cAll your insecurities go away.\u201d RISING TIDE is a sequel to TIDE, a work Tunick shot in Brisbane in 2023 as part of Melt festival, which celebrates the queer community and our allies. As we gathered in the dark across the entire length of the Story Bridge, Tunick told the crowd our \u201cliving sculpture\u201d was a vote for diversity, equity and inclusion. It felt especially timely the morning after Queensland elected a Liberal-National Party government. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The artist relayed directions over a loudspeaker. No smiling. We faced him, then faced away. Put our arms up toward the sky, then back down. Then we lay on our backs, and rolled to one side. The road was hard and wet. Hearing others shiver, I felt grateful for the soft folds insulating my body. At first I tried not to look at other people\u2019s bodies, but eventually I let myself see them. Stocky bodies. Sagging bodies. Tattooed bodies. Transitioning bodies. Scarred bodies. Bony bodies. Pregnant bodies. Chiselled bodies. Bodies needing assistance from a wheelchair, a walker, a pair of crutches. Taking in this ordinary and extraordinary landscape was an act of radical self-love. It made me feel less alone. The crowd chatted and cheered between poses. A man named Chris told me he wanted to build up the confidence to enjoy nude beaches. Reeta hoped the experience would symbolise a turning point after a difficult year. Mark joked that Brisbanites just want any excuse to walk on a closed public roadway. \u201cIt\u2019s our culture,\u201d he said. He\u2019s right \u2013 50,000 people turned out for a public walk through the newly built Clem Jones tunnel back in 2010. After an hour, we dressed again then headed to the next location, Howard Smith Wharves. We undressed for a second time, and took up new positions along the Riverwalk that snakes along the water. The Riverwalk felt like a Broadway stage compared to the closed-off bridge. Tourists on a passing CityCat waved and took videos. Residents of the multi-million-dollar properties overlooking the water stood on their balconies, bemused. For one man, it was a rude awakening. \u201cWhat a nightmare view,\u201d he complained. His nightmare was just beginning: our next position was a child\u2019s pose, our bare bums shining up at him. It was liberating, fun, and also monotonous at times. There were tedious stretches of waiting around, first in the rain and later in the blazing sun. I walked a good six kilometres across the morning, much of it a slow shuffle. I\u2019d wanted to feel anonymous, but I felt jealous of people with friends at their side. But in the end, the only truly horrifying part of the experience was setting my alarm for 1.45am. I was moved by tiny moments that illuminated how much we share in common: hundreds of people collectively saying \u201cbless you\u201d when someone sneezed; a chorus of \u201caww\u201d as a golden retriever came to see what all the fuss was about; laughter as we realised nobody knew which way to turn when Tunick told us to look south. (\u201cFace the river!\u201d he eventually clarified.) As we walked back along the Riverwalk, a man watching from his balcony called out. He had stripped naked in solidarity. I have never heard a crowd cheer louder in my life. TIDE EXHIBITION by Spencer Tunick is open at Brisbane Powerhouse until 10 November as part of Melt festival",

Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Joe Biden, the US president, said he hoped Israel\u2019s latest strikes on Iran will mark the end of a months-long cycle of escalation. </strong>\u201cI hope this is the end,\u201d he told reporters on Saturday, as his administration doubles down on efforts to reach a ceasefire deal for Gaza and Lebanon. Biden said Israel gave him a heads up and it appeared \u201cthey didn\u2019t hit anything but military targets\u201d in their attacks. Israel\u2019s president, <strong>Issac Herzog,</strong> hailed the US as his country\u2019s \u201ctrue ally\u201d after Israeli strikes on military targets in Iran. The office of Israel\u2019s prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu,</strong> denied a report that Israel initially planned to strike Iran\u2019s oil and natural gas facilities, but changed its plan to focus on Iranian military targets after pressure from the US.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Early on Saturday, waves of fighter jets and drones bombed military sites across Iran in an hours-long retaliatory attack against a missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October</strong>. The Israeli air force struck about 20 military bases across Iran, including missile and drone manufacturing sites and air defence systems. In a show of military confidence, an Israeli spokesperson had announced the attack as it got under way.<strong> </strong>The strikes marked the first time Israel has openly attacked Iran after decades of shadow warfare. Two US officials confirmed to the Associated Press that there was no US involvement in Israel\u2019s operation against Iran.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/latest-iranstrikes/giv-4559UD6EZS89LzRE/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/latest-iranstrikes/giv-4559UD6EZS89LzRE/\">Interactive</a> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Four soldiers were killed in the Israel strikes on Iran, Iranian media said.</strong> Iran said the airstrikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, causing \u201climited damage\u201d. Iran\u2019s mission to the UN said Israeli warplanes attacked several Iranian military and radar sites from Iraqi airspace, and blamed the US for what it called its \u201ccomplicity\u201d. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, <strong>Abbas Araghchi,</strong> described the Israeli attack as \u201creckless and cowardly\u201d, adding that his country was determined to defend itself. The country\u2019s president, <strong>Masoud Pezeshkian, </strong>offered his condolences to the families of the soldiers killed.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Israeli strikes reportedly hit Iranian facilities used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles. </strong>Satellite images obtained by Reuters appear to confirm that the Israeli attacks hit buildings that Iran used for mixing solid fuel for ballistic missiles. Israel struck Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran, as well as Khojir, a sprawling missile production site near the Iranian capital, the news agency reported, citing two US researchers. Israel hit 12 \u201cplanetary mixers\u201d used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, which<strong> </strong>make up the bulk of Iran\u2019s missile arsenal, Israeli sources told Axios. The UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog (IAEA) said Iran\u2019s nuclear programme was not affected by Saturday\u2019s strikes.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Iran\u2019s military suggested it would prioritise an agreement to end fighting in Gaza and Lebanon over any retaliation against Israel. </strong>The carefully worded statement released on Saturday night suggests at least parts of Iran\u2019s government want to avoid further escalation. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said it had a right to self-defence after Saturday\u2019s attack. The statement said Iranian radar sites were damaged but some were already under repair, and added that Israel used so-called \u201cstand off\u201d missiles over Iraqi airspace to launch it attacks. They had lighter warheads to travel to targets inside Iran.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The strikes were restrained enough for Iranian officials to belittle the scale and effectiveness of the incursion and for Israeli hardliners to denounce their government for timidity.</strong> Israel\u2019s military could have \u201cexacted a higher price\u201d, opposition leader <strong>Yair Lapid</strong> said in a post on X after the bombing ended. National security minister <strong>Itamar Ben-Gvir</strong> said Saturday\u2019s attack was \u201can opening blow\u201d and strikes on the country\u2019s strategic assets \u201cmust be the next step\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel\u2019s military warned Iran against responding soon after it finished the attack.</strong> \u201cIf the regime were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond,\u201d said spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e244d2a6-e29f-4df4-a208-0d93b7d38e02\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Izbj7NMLnU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>World leaders called for restraint after the Israeli attack.</strong> The UN chief, <strong>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, </strong>said he was \u201cdeeply alarmed\u201d and called on all sides to step back from further military action. The EU, Russia, Arab Gulf nations and G7 finance ministers and central Bank governors also warned against further escalation. The UK prime minister, <strong>Keir Starmer,</strong> urged Iran not to respond, saying the Middle East needs to \u201cavoid further regional escalation\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>More than 30 people were killed on Saturday during Israeli strikes on a residential block in the town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza,</strong> the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Among those killed are women and children, it said, and many others were injured. The strikes targeted a block of at least five homes in Beit Lahiya, it said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israeli troops withdrew from the Kamal Adwan hospital in Jabalia on Saturday, after storming the medical facility and detaining dozens of its staff. </strong>Israeli forces seized 44 of the 70-strong team at the hospital, only 14 have since been released. Almost all male staff at the hospital had been taken away by Israeli forces, the head of the World Health Organsation (WHO), <strong>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</strong> said, describing the situation in the area as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. Among those missing is Dr <strong>Mohammed Obeid, </strong>an orthopedic surgeon working for Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about his safety.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN\u2019s acting humanitarian chief, Joyce Msuya, called for an urgent halt to the military operation in north Gaza,</strong> attacks on health facilities and mass detentions there. \u201cThe entire population of northern Gaza is at risk of dying,\u201d she said. </p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel\u2019s ground offensive in northern Gaza that began on 6 October has killed at least 800 people. </strong>The health ministry in Gaza said on Saturday that at least 42,924 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October last year. Earlier this month the Biden administration\u2019s concerns over shortages of food and medical supplies prompted a warning that Israeli access to US weapons funding would be at risk unless more aid reached Gaza.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said Israeli attacks killed 19 people in the country on Friday,</strong> bringing the total death toll to 2,653 since October 2023. The Israeli military issued new warnings to evacuate specific buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs late on Saturday in advance of expected airstrikes on the Lebanese capital.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel\u2019s military announced it was easing some safety restrictions for residents in areas of northern Israel on Saturday,</strong> a possible indication that it does not expect any immediate large-scale attack from Iran or its proxies in the region.

Gaza\u2019s health ministry saids dozens of people were wounded as Israeli airstrikes and shelling pounded the southern city of Khan Younis. Israeli strikes on three houses in Beit Lahiya killed 25 people and wounded dozens more, medics said.

The World Health Organisation said on Friday it lost touch with staff at the hospital, where some had been the night before to deliver supplies and help transfer patients to Shifa hospital in Gaza City.

The strikes hit a group of small chalets that 18 journalists from at least seven different media outlets \u2013 including Al Jazeera, Sky News Arabia and TRT \u2013 were staying in while covering the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon. Several cars with \u201cPress\u201d signs on them were parked in front of the site.

Here are some photos taken of Dahiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut, early on Sunday. Eight attacks on Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, have been reported in recent hours, according to Al-Jazeera. Earlier, the Israeli military issued new warnings to evacuate specific buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in advance of expected airstrikes. The Israel Defense Forces\u2019 Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, posted maps of three buildings in the Burj al-Barajneh and Hadath areas in the southern suburb of Beirut, warning people to evacuate them and the area immediately. The official National News Agency in Lebanon said shortly after midnight that Israel had \u201ctargeted the southern suburbs of Beirut\u201d, but did not elaborate. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has confirmed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities were not affected by Saturday\u2019s strikes, and urged \u201cprudence and restraint\u201d. Saturday\u2019s attacks destroyed Iranian air defences that were guarding oil, gas and petrochemical facilities as well as a major port, the New York Times reports, citing unnamed Iranian and Israeli officials. They said key targets included Gulf petrochemical facilities and a port at Bandar Imam Khomeini and Abadan oil refinery, plus a gas field further north in Ilam province called Tange Bijar. Striking the air defences rather than the oil and gas facilities themselves may indicate the US had a degree of success in its repeated public attempts to dissuade Israel from a direct attack that could trigger further escalation that could ultimately draw in US forces, cause economic chaos and potentially lead to an Iranian decision to try to build nuclear weapons. Iranian officials have previously described attacks on its energy infrastructure as a \u201cred line\u201d. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin has spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, about Saturday\u2019s strikes, and issued a warning to Tehran that it \u201cshould not make the mistake of responding to Israel\u2019s strikes, which should mark the end of this exchange\u201d. \u201cThe secretary also discussed the opportunities that now exist to use diplomacy to dial down tensions in the region, including a hostage release and ceasefire deal in Gaza and an agreement in Lebanon that allows civilians on both sides of the Blue Line to return safely to their homes,\u201d the statement said. Iran\u2019s mission to the UN has taken aim at the US over Israel\u2019s Saturday morning strikes, saying its \u201ccomplicity in this crime is certain\u201d. It said the attack came from US-controlled Iraqi airspace. Iraqi airspace was closed briefly during Saturday\u2019s airstrikes. It\u2019s 1am in Beirut and Gaza, and 2am in Tel Aviv. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Joe Biden, the US president, said he hoped Israel\u2019s latest strikes on Iran will mark the end of a months-long cycle of escalation. \u201cI hope this is the end,\u201d he told reporters on Saturday, as his administration doubles down on efforts to reach a ceasefire deal for Gaza and Lebanon. Biden said Israel gave him a heads up and it appeared \u201cthey didn\u2019t hit anything but military targets\u201d in their attacks. Israel\u2019s president, Issac Herzog, hailed the US as his country\u2019s \u201ctrue ally\u201d after Israeli strikes on military targets in Iran. The office of Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, denied a report that Israel initially planned to strike Iran\u2019s oil and natural gas facilities, but changed its plan to focus on Iranian military targets after pressure from the US. Early on Saturday, waves of fighter jets and drones bombed military sites across Iran in an hours-long retaliatory attack against a missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October. The Israeli air force struck about 20 military bases across Iran, including missile and drone manufacturing sites and air defence systems. In a show of military confidence, an Israeli spokesperson had announced the attack as it got under way. The strikes marked the first time Israel has openly attacked Iran after decades of shadow warfare. Two US officials confirmed to the Associated Press that there was no US involvement in Israel\u2019s operation against Iran. Four soldiers were killed in the Israel strikes on Iran, Iranian media said. Iran said the airstrikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, causing \u201climited damage\u201d. Iran\u2019s mission to the UN said Israeli warplanes attacked several Iranian military and radar sites from Iraqi airspace, and blamed the US for what it called its \u201ccomplicity\u201d. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, described the Israeli attack as \u201creckless and cowardly\u201d, adding that his country was determined to defend itself. The country\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, offered his condolences to the families of the soldiers killed. The Israeli strikes reportedly hit Iranian facilities used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles. Satellite images obtained by Reuters appear to confirm that the Israeli attacks hit buildings that Iran used for mixing solid fuel for ballistic missiles. Israel struck Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran, as well as Khojir, a sprawling missile production site near the Iranian capital, the news agency reported, citing two US researchers. Israel hit 12 \u201cplanetary mixers\u201d used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, which make up the bulk of Iran\u2019s missile arsenal, Israeli sources told Axios. The UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog (IAEA) said Iran\u2019s nuclear programme was not affected by Saturday\u2019s strikes. Iran\u2019s military suggested it would prioritise an agreement to end fighting in Gaza and Lebanon over any retaliation against Israel. The carefully worded statement released on Saturday night suggests at least parts of Iran\u2019s government want to avoid further escalation. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said it had a right to self-defence after Saturday\u2019s attack. The statement said Iranian radar sites were damaged but some were already under repair, and added that Israel used so-called \u201cstand off\u201d missiles over Iraqi airspace to launch it attacks. They had lighter warheads to travel to targets inside Iran. The strikes were restrained enough for Iranian officials to belittle the scale and effectiveness of the incursion and for Israeli hardliners to denounce their government for timidity. Israel\u2019s military could have \u201cexacted a higher price\u201d, opposition leader Yair Lapid said in a post on X after the bombing ended. National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said Saturday\u2019s attack was \u201can opening blow\u201d and strikes on the country\u2019s strategic assets \u201cmust be the next step\u201d. Israel\u2019s military warned Iran against responding soon after it finished the attack. \u201cIf the regime were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond,\u201d said spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari. World leaders called for restraint after the Israeli attack. The UN chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said he was \u201cdeeply alarmed\u201d and called on all sides to step back from further military action. The EU, Russia, Arab Gulf nations and G7 finance ministers and central Bank governors also warned against further escalation. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, urged Iran not to respond, saying the Middle East needs to \u201cavoid further regional escalation\u201d. More than 30 people were killed on Saturday during Israeli strikes on a residential block in the town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Among those killed are women and children, it said, and many others were injured. The strikes targeted a block of at least five homes in Beit Lahiya, it said. Israeli troops withdrew from the Kamal Adwan hospital in Jabalia on Saturday, after storming the medical facility and detaining dozens of its staff. Israeli forces seized 44 of the 70-strong team at the hospital, only 14 have since been released. Almost all male staff at the hospital had been taken away by Israeli forces, the head of the World Health Organsation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, describing the situation in the area as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. Among those missing is Dr Mohammed Obeid, an orthopedic surgeon working for Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about his safety. The UN\u2019s acting humanitarian chief, Joyce Msuya, called for an urgent halt to the military operation in north Gaza, attacks on health facilities and mass detentions there. \u201cThe entire population of northern Gaza is at risk of dying,\u201d she said. Israel\u2019s ground offensive in northern Gaza that began on 6 October has killed at least 800 people. The health ministry in Gaza said on Saturday that at least 42,924 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October last year. Earlier this month the Biden administration\u2019s concerns over shortages of food and medical supplies prompted a warning that Israeli access to US weapons funding would be at risk unless more aid reached Gaza. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said Israeli attacks killed 19 people in the country on Friday, bringing the total death toll to 2,653 since October 2023. The Israeli military issued new warnings to evacuate specific buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs late on Saturday in advance of expected airstrikes on the Lebanese capital. Israel\u2019s military announced it was easing some safety restrictions for residents in areas of northern Israel on Saturday, a possible indication that it does not expect any immediate large-scale attack from Iran or its proxies in the region. The decision followed a \u201csituational assessment\u201d, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Saturday. The son of the director of Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, which was besieged by Israeli forces on Friday, has been killed by Israeli shelling, according to his father. Dr Hussam Abu Safiya said his son, Ibrahim, was killed at the entrance of the hospital on Saturday as he was approaching to see if the Israeli army had withdrawn from the facility. Ibrahim\u2019s dream was to become a doctor and he had been volunteering to help treat the wounded after a shortage in medical staff at the hospital, his father told CNN. Israeli forces withdrew from the hospital on Saturday after seizing it and detaining dozens of medical staffers and some patients, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry. Abu Safiya told CNN that he was detained and interrogated by the Israeli army over unidentified wounded patients being treated in the hospital. \u201cI was accused of bringing in resistance fighters and treating them, which is not true,\u201d he said, adding: The soldier beat me and insulted me in front of the medical staff. The hospital director said that, along with an assistant, he is the last remaining doctor in the hospital. Several patients require surgeries but without a team, he said he was \u201coverwhelmed by cases\u201d and did not \u201cknow what to do\u201d. Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has offered his condolences to the families of the soldiers killed in Israeli overnight strikes. Posting to X, Pezeshkian wrote: Enemies of Iran should know these brave people are standing fearlessly in defence of their land and will respond to any stupidity with tact and intelligence. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has described the Israeli attack on Iran last night \u201creckless and cowardly\u201d. Posting to X, Araghchi said Iran \u201cstrongly condemn[s] the criminal attack on Iranian military centers as a violation of international law and the UN Charter\u201d. The attack killed four Iranian army soldiers, he said, adding: We fully reserve our right to duly respond to this aggression, which cannot be separated from Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza and bloodshed in Lebanon. The world must unite against this common threat to international peace &amp; security. The Israeli military has issued new warnings to evacuate specific buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in advance of expected airstrikes on the Lebanese capital. The Israel Defense Forces\u2019 Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, posted maps of three buildings in the Burj al-Barajneh and Hadath areas in the southern suburb of Beirut, warning people to evacuate them and the area immediately. We reported earlier that Israeli airstrikes overnight are thought to have hit Iranian facilities used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles. Satellite images obtained by Reuters appear to confirm that the Israeli attacks hit buildings that Iran used for mixing solid fuel for ballistic missiles. Israel struck Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran, as well as Khojir, a sprawling missile production site near the Iranian capital, the news agency reported, citing two US researchers. Israeli strikes may have \u201csignificantly hampered Iran\u2019s ability to mass produce missiles\u201d, Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at the thinktank CNA, said. He noted that a satellite image showed that an Israeli strike destroyed two buildings in Khojir where solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed. Images of Parchin showed that Israel destroyed three ballistic-missile solid-fuel mixing buildings and a warehouse, he said. \u201cIsrael says they targeted buildings housing solid-fuel mixers,\u201d Eveleth said. These industrial mixers are hard to make and export-controlled. Iran imported many over the years at great expense, and will likely have a hard time replacing them. Here are some of the latest images sent from the newswires from Gaza, where officials say about 800 people have been killed in Israeli strikes during a three-week offensive in the north of the Palestinian territory. As we reported earlier, at least 30 people were killed, including women and children, in Israeli military strikes on several houses in northern Gaza\u2019s Beit Lahiya on Saturday, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Israel\u2019s strikes against Iran on Saturday morning took out a critical component in the Iranian ballistic missile programme, Axios is reporting. Israel hit 12 \u201cplanetary mixers\u201d used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, which make up the bulk of Iran\u2019s missile arsenal, Israeli sources told the outlet. The mixers are highly sophisticated equipment that Iran cannot produce on its own and must buy from China, they added. The strikes severely damages Iran\u2019s ability to renew its missile stockpile and could deter Iran from further massive missile strikes against Israel, they said. A senior US official confirmed to the outlet that the Israeli strike cripples Iran\u2019s missile production capability. Israel\u2019s president, Issac Herzog, hailed the US as his country\u2019s \u201ctrue ally\u201d after Israeli strikes on military targets in Iran. Herzog, in a statement on Saturday, said: I especially wish to thank our great friend the USA for being a true ally, and for the overt and covert cooperation. The office of Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has denied a report that Israel initially planned to strike Iran\u2019s oil and natural gas facilities, but changed its plan to focus on Iranian military targets after pressure from the US. Netanyahu\u2019s office called the report \u201ctotally false\u201d, the Times of Israel reported. In a statement, the PM\u2019s office said: Israel chose in advance the attack targets according to its national interests and not according to American dictates. So it was, and so it will be. Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the safety and whereabouts of one of its doctors working in Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza. In a statement, MSF said it had lost contact with Dr Mohammed Obeid, an orthopedic surgeon who was sheltering and working in the hospital, since Friday afternoon. Israeli forces seized Kamal Adwan hospital on Friday, reportedly detaining dozens of medical staffers and some patients. Medics said at least 44 of the facility\u2019s 70-member team of the hospital had been detained by the army. It later said the army had released 14 of them, including the hospital\u2019s director. At least two children died inside the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit after Israeli fire struck the generators and oxygen station in the facility on Friday, it said. More than 30 people were killed on Saturday during Israeli strikes on a residential block in the town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Among those killed are women and children, it said, and many others were injured. The strikes targeted a block of at least five homes in Beit Lahiya, it said. The UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog (IAEA) said Iran\u2019s nuclear programme was not affected by Israel\u2019s deadly airstrike on its military facilities last night. IAEA director general Rafael Grossi, posting to X on Saturday, called for \u201cprudence and restraint from actions that could jeopardise the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive materials\u201d. The fallout continues from Israel\u2019s air attack on military sites in Iran on Saturday. The assaults, carried out in retaliation to the missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October, were heard over several hours in Tehran. The UK was among the nations warning against further escalation, while Gaza and Lebanon continued to be attacked. Here\u2019s our video report: The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the situation in northern Gaza is \u201ccatastrophic\u201d amid \u201cintensive\u201d operations unfolding around and within healthcare facilities. Posting to X on Saturday, he said \u201ca critical shortage of medical supplies, compounded by severely limited access, are depriving people of life saving care\u201d in the north of the Palestinian territory. His comments came after Israeli forces withdrew from Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza earlier on Saturday, a day after storming it. The siege \u201ccame at a heavy cost\u201d, Tedros said. The WHO chief said 44 male hospital staff had been detained, leaving only female staff, the hospital director and one male doctor to care for nearly 200 patients \u201cin desperate need of medical attention\u201d. \u201cReports of the hospital facilities and medical supplies being damaged or destroyed during the siege are deplorable,\u201d Tedros wrote. The whole health system in Gaza has been under attack for over a year. WHO cannot stress loudly enough that hospitals must be shielded from conflict at all times. Any attack of healthcare facilities is a violation of international humanitarian law. The US vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, took a handful of questions from reporters in Michigan about the situation in the Middle East. Harris said she had a \u201clengthy and important\u201d conversation with the president, Joe Biden, and members of the US national security team earlier on Saturday, following Israel\u2019s pre-dawn strikes on Iran. \u201cWe maintain the importance of supporting Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, Harris said. \u201cAnd we are also very adamant that we must see de-escalation in the region going forward and that will be our focus.\u201d Underscoring her dual roles as vice president and candidate, Harris was briefed on the situation before stepping on the stage in Houston for a rally with Beyonc\u00e9 on Friday night. Harris told reporters: This war must end. We must get the hostages out and work toward a two-state solution. Asked about the views of the US\u2019s Arab allies, Harris said there was a \u201cconsensus among leaders in the region, and certainly it is the strong perspective of the United States that there must be the de-escalation and not an escalation.\u201d She stressed the US would always defend Israel against an attack by Iran. Israel\u2019s military announced it was easing some safety restrictions for residents in areas of northern Israel, a possible indication that it does not expect any immediate large-scale attack from Iran or its proxies in the region. The decision followed a \u201csituational assessment\u201d, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Saturday. The IDF made no mention of Israel\u2019s bombing of military sites in Iran in the early hours of Saturday, Reuters reported. Israel\u2019s extremist national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said his country has a \u201chistoric obligation to remove\u201d the threat posed by Iran. Posting to X on Saturday, Ben Gvir welcomed last night\u2019s Israeli attack on Iran, describing is an \u201copening blow to damage Iran\u2019s strategic assets\u201d. He added: We have a historic obligation to remove the Iranian threat to destroy Israel. Iran\u2019s mission to the UN said Israeli warplanes attacked several Iranian military and radar sites from Iraqi airspace, and blamed the US for what it called its \u201ccomplicity\u201d. Qatar\u2019s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, held a phone call with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araqchi, after Israeli strikes on Saturday. During the call, the Qatari minister expressed his country\u2019s \u201cgrave concern\u201d over possible consequences of the Israeli attack on Iran, according to a readout from his ministry. Iran\u2019s military has announced the deaths of two additional soldiers following Israel\u2019s attacks on the country, bringing the total death toll to four. All four men served in the country\u2019s military air defence, it said. For years, Israel and Iran have waged a \u201cshadow war\u201d, attacking each other indirectly using proxy forces, assassinations, informants, spies and hybrid, non-military covert means. Now this undeclared, largely silent war is undisguisedly out in the open. It\u2019s become a shooting war, it\u2019s noisy, it\u2019s escalating, and there\u2019s no end in sight. This is not to say Israel\u2019s large-scale, three-wave air assault on Tehran and other targets inside Iran early on Saturday morning means the two enemies are now engaged in all-out conflict. This is not yet the full-scale, region-wide conflagration so many in the Middle East fear. That may be coming, but it\u2019s still in the future. What Israel\u2019s attack \u2013 retaliation for Iran\u2019s 181-missile barrage earlier this month \u2013 does mean is that another psychological barrier has been passed. Before the 7 October massacres of Israelis by Iran\u2019s ally Hamas, it was hard to imagine face-to-face military confrontation on each other\u2019s soil. It seemed too risky. Now it is being normalised. Read the full analysis: Iran-Israel\u2019s shadow war is out in the open and will only escalate unless causes are addressed Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said his country was determined to defend itself after Israeli attacks struck military targets in Iran early on Saturday. In an interview reported by AFP, Araghchi said: I think we\u2019ve shown that our determination to defend ourselves knows no limits. The Israeli military has released photos of what it says are Israeli air force planes preparing to launch attacks on Iran overnight. Hezbollah has condemned Israel\u2019s attack against Iran, calling it a \u201cdangerous escalation in the region\u201d. The US \u201cbears full responsibility for the massacres, tragedies and pain\u201d caused by Israel, the group said. The UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, is \u201cdeeply alarmed\u201d by the escalation in the Middle East following attacks overnight by the Israel Defense Forces on Iran, according to a statement from his spokesperson. \u201cAll acts of escalation are condemnable and must stop,\u201d Guterres said in the statement, adding: The secretary-general urgently reiterates his appeal to all parties to cease all military actions, including in Gaza and Lebanon, exert maximum efforts to prevent an all-out regional war and return to the path of diplomacy. Joe Biden, the US president, has said he hopes the Israeli strikes on Iran overnight were \u201cthe end\u201d. Biden also said it appeared that Israel had only struck military targets in its attack on Iran. Iran has said three sites were hit and that \u201climited damage\u201d was caused. Egypt\u2019s flagship airliner has cancelled Saturday flights from Cairo to Baghdad and Erbil in Iraq and Amman, Jordan. EgyptAir blamed the cancellations on \u201cthe ongoing developments in the region\u201d. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said Israeli attacks killed 19 people in the country on Friday, bringing the total death toll to 2,653 since October 2023. It\u2019s just after 6.30pm in Tehran and 6pm in Tel Aviv. Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments: Two soldiers were killed in Saturday morning\u2019s Israeli airstrikes on Iran, according to the official news agency IRNA. The attacks, carried out in retaliation to the missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October, were heard over several hours in Tehran, the capital, and at nearby military bases. The UK and US are among the nations to have warned against further escalation alongside the EU. Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan have all condemned the attacks. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry has defended its right to \u201cdefend itself against external aggressive acts\u201d. The ministry called the Israeli attack a violation of international law, adding that Tehran \u201crecognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security\u201d. The internal debate on how Iran should respond turns on whether to treat Israel\u2019s actions as too grave to be ignored, or to elect not to launch reprisals on the basis of advice coming from the region and from the US. Hezbollah has fired rockets at Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of Lebanon village Aita al-Shaab, and has also launched drones against an Israeli air base south of Tel Aviv. The \u201caerial attack with drones\u201d against the Tel Nof base was the first claim of its kind in one year. Hezbollah also fired rockets at five residential areas in northern Israel on Saturday, including the outskirts of Krayot near Haifa. Elsewhere the Israeli military has said that it killed a Hamas militant during a raid in the West Bank on Saturday. Israeli forces have withdrawn from a hospital complex in northern Gaza one day after storming it. Medics said at least 44 of the 70-member team at the Kamal Adwan hospital in Jabalia had been detained by the army, with 14 later released. The UN\u2019s acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya has urged Israeli forces to stop what they are doing in northern Gaza, where the entire population \u201cis at risk of dying\u201d. It has been reported that efforts to clear north Gaza by way of effecting \u201cthe generals\u2019 plan\u201d are under way. This plan is designed to force the remaining population to flee by tightening the siege and cutting off aid. Experts say such tactics amount to war crimes. The EU has called for \u201cutmost restraint\u201d after two Iranian solders were killed in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. Israeli airstrikes which hit in Iran early on Saturday saw at least seven explosions reported in Tehran and nearby Karaj, as well as in the eastern city of Mashhad. The attacks were carried out in response to Iran launching a missile barrage on 1 October in which an estimated 180 ballistic missiles fired towards Tel Aviv and military bases. Iran\u2019s foreign secretary has defended the country\u2019s right \u201cto defend itself against external aggressive acts\u201d. On Saturday the EU called for all parties to exercise utmost restraint to avoid an \u201cuncontrollable escalation\u201d in the Middle East. The dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliations risks causing a further expansion of the regional conflict,\u201d the 27-nation bloc said in a statement. While acknowledging Israel\u2019s right to self-defence, the EU calls on all parties to exercise utmost restraint to avoid an uncontrollable escalation, which is in no one\u2019s interest. In calling for restraint the EU has echoed sentiments expressed by leaders across the world. Here are some photos of Tehran today after the Israeli strikes on military targets overnight. Reuters has reported that Israeli forces have withdrawn from a hospital complex in northern Gaza one day after storming it. On Friday Gaza\u2019s health ministry accused Israeli forces of storming Kamal Adwan hospital in the Jabalia camp. The ministry also claimed that hundreds of staff, patients and displaced people were detained. Medics said at least 44 of the facility\u2019s 70-member team of the hospital had been detained by the army. It later said the army had released 14 of them, including the hospital\u2019s director. At least two children were also said to have died inside the intensive care unit after Israeli fire hit the generators and oxygen station in the facility on Friday. Footage circulated by the health ministry - which Reuters could not immediately verify - showed damage to several buildings after the Israeli forces withdrew. Military strikes on the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza have so far killed around 800 people during a three-week offensive, the Gaza ministry added. A Hamas militant has been killed in a raid in the West Bank, according to the Israeli military. In a joint statement shared by AFP, the Israeli military, police and domestic security agency Shin Bet said forces killed the militant during a \u201ccounterterrorism operation\u201d being conducted in Tulkarem. The operation was intended to \u201celiminate Islam Odeh\u201d who they accused of planning terror attacks. Odeh \u201copened fire at the security forces\u201d during the operation. He was encircled and then killed, the statement said. \u201cThe forces located weaponry, including compounds used to produce IEDs, in his vehicle\u201d, they added. Odeh had recently been \u201ctasked with commanding the terrorist network in Tulkarem and had started to plan additional terror attacks\u201d. Our graphics team has produced this map of the Israeli airstrikes travelling to Iran in the early hours of Saturday morning: Hezbollah has fired rockets at five residential areas in northern Israel. AFP reported that Hezbollah fired \u201crocket salvos\u201d on five residential areas in northern Israel on Saturday, including the outskirts of Krayot near Haifa. The Israeli army had claimed that the Iran-backed group fired about 80 projectiles across the border. It was reported earlier on Saturday that Hezbollah has fired rockets at Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of Lebanon village Aita al-Shaab, alongside launching drones against an Israeli air base south of Tel Aviv. An Israeli strike on a medical centre in south Lebanon has killed a Hezbollah-linked rescuer. AFP has reported that the paramedic was killed on Saturday in a strike at a medical centre in Bazuriyeh. Five others, including three Hezbollah-linked paramedics, were wounded. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said that the raid took place on a medical centre in Bazuriyeh. This death means that 164 rescuers and paramedics have been killed since Hezbollah and Israel began trading cross-border fire last year. There are two strands to the internal Iranian debate on how to respond to the long-awaited Israeli attack: treat it as a breach of Iranian national sovereignty too grave to ignore, or acknowledge the attack\u2019s relatively limited nature and elect against launching reprisals. You can read a full analysis of the situation here: In a statement on Saturday, the Iranian Foreign Ministry strongly condemned Israel\u2019s attack on their military targets and said they were entitled to defend themselves. . \u201cOn the basis of its inherent right to legitimate defense, stipulated in the Article 51 of the UN Charter, the Islamic Republic of Iran considers itself to be rightful and duty bound to defend against the foreign acts of aggression.\u201d The Iranian news agency Tasnim reports that Iran will \u201cemploy all of the physical and spiritual capabilities of the Iranian nation to protect its interests and security.\u201d German chancellor Olaf Scholz says his message to Iran is clear: \u201cWe cannot continue with massive reactions of escalation, this must end now.\u201d Meanwhile, Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government has condemned Israel\u2019s strikes, saying they will exacerbate violence in the Middle East. The strikes are \u201can attempt to aggravate the violence in the region, which further complicates and intensifies the unfavorable situation in the region,\u201d a statement from the Afghani foreign ministry says. Russia urges Israel and Iran to show restraint to avoid catastrophe in the wake of Israel\u2019s attack on Iran on Saturday. \u201cWe urge all parties involved to exercise restraint, stop the violence, and prevent events from developing into a catastrophic scenario,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says, warning of an \u201cexplosive escalation.\u201d The Israeli military says that Tehran and its proxies \u201chave been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7 \u2013 on seven fronts \u2013 including direct attacks from Iranian soil\u201d. \u201cLike every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond,\u201d an Israeli army spokesperson said. 10 members of Iran\u2019s national police force have been killed 1,200 kilometers southeast of Tehran, reports the Associated Press. The assault came after Israel bombarded Iran early Saturday morning. No suspects have been identified nor has any group claimed responsibility. If you\u2019re just joining us, here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments as the fallout continues from Israel\u2019s air attack on military sites in Iran. It\u2019s approaching 3.15pm in Tehran and 2.45pm in Tel Aviv. Two soldiers were killed in Saturday morning\u2019s Israeli airstrikes on Iran, according to the official news agency IRNA. The attacks, carried out in retaliation to the missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October, were heard over several hours in Tehran, the capital, and at nearby military bases. The Israeli army has intercepted two drones crossing from Lebanon, with the interception happening hours after Israeli airstrikes hit Iran early on Saturday. The UK and US have warned against further escalation, while nations including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan have all condemned the attacks. Israel bears \u2018full responsibility\u2019 for the escalation of conflict in the Middle East, the Pakistan foreign ministry has said. The ministry said the Israeli airstrikes \u201cundermine the path to regional peace and stability\u201d. Iran is \u201centitled and obligated to defend itself against external aggressive acts\u201d, its foreign ministry has said. The ministry called the Israeli attack a violation of international law and said that Tehran \u201crecognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security\u201d. Hezbollah has fired rockets at Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of Lebanon village Aita al-Shaab, and has also launched drones against an Israeli air base south of Tel Aviv. The \u201caerial attack with drones\u201d against the Tel Nof base was the first claim of its kind in one year. At least 42,924 people have been killed since the Israel-Gaza war began, according to the health ministry in Gaza. This includes 77 deaths in the previous 48 hours. The health ministry in Gaza said on Saturday that at least 42,924 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October last year. This number includes 77 deaths in the previous 48 hours, AFP has reported. According to the ministry, 100,833 people have been wounded since the Israel-Gaza war began just over a year ago. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari has warned Iran against further escalation and says Israel has concluded its retaliatory strikes. See here: The Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza has been unable to respond to emergency calls from residents in the Jabalia region, according to Al Jazeera. Defence operations have been \u201ccompletely halted due to ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression in northern Gaza\u201d, statement published by the organisation said. We are unable to respond to numerous pleas for help from homes that have been targeted and burned by Israeli bombardment in Jabalia and Jabalia Nazla in northern Gaza. The region has been under siege for 22 days, and on Friday Gaza\u2019s health ministry accused Israeli forces of storming the Kamal Adwan hospital \u2013 the last functioning facility in northern Gaza. France has called on Israel to \u201crefrain\u201d from any action which could further escalate already heightened tension in the Middle East. Multiple explosions were heard in Tehran, the capital, and at nearby military bases, starting shortly after 2am local time (2230 GMT on Friday). At least seven explosions were reported over Tehran and nearby Karaj, as well as in the eastern city of Mashhad. Official news agency IRNA reported that two soldiers were killed. The Israeli airstrikes were carried out in retaliation to a missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October. In a statement issued by the Quai d\u2019Orsay on Saturday, the French foreign ministry urged Israel to \u201crefrain from any escalation or action likely to aggravate the context of extreme tension\u201d in the region. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says northern Gaza\u2019s last functioning hospital is \u201cstill under seige\u201d but it has managed to contact staff. On Friday Gaza\u2019s health ministry accused Israeli forces of storming Kamal Adwan hospital in the Jabalia camp, where it launched a major operation earlier this month. It said the raid left two children dead, accusing the Israeli forces of detaining hundreds of staff, patients and displaced people. The Israeli military said its forces were operating around Kamal Adwan, but was \u201cnot aware of live fire and strikes in the area of the hospital\u201d. Late on Friday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted this update on X. Iran is \u201centitled and obligated to defend itself against external aggressive acts\u201d, its foreign ministry has said. Iranian media reported multiple explosions over several hours in Tehran, the capital, and at nearby military bases, starting shortly after 2am local time (2230 GMT on Friday). At least seven explosions were reported over Tehran and nearby Karaj, as well as in the eastern city of Mashhad. Official news agency IRNA reported that two soldiers were killed. Calling the Israeli attack a violation of international law, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that Tehran \u201crecognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security\u201d. Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan have all condemned the attacks, while the UK and US have warned against further escalation. As we reported earlier, UK prime minister Keir Starmer has urged Iran not to respond to the Israeli airstrikes launched overnight. You can watch a video clip from his press conference below: A barrage of rockets were fired by Hezbollah on Saturday at Israeli forces near a village in southern Lebanon. AFP has reported that the rockets were fired on the outskirts of Aita al-Shaab, where the Israeli army has carried out ground incursions for weeks. The Iran-backed group said in a statement that its fighters had launched a \u201csalvo of rockets\u201d at Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah has also said on Saturday that it had launched drones against an Israeli air base south of Tel Aviv. The \u201caerial attack with drones\u201d against Tel Nof base was the first claim of its kind in one year. Israel bears \u2018full responsibility\u2019 for the escalation of conflict in the Middle East, the Pakistan foreign ministry has said. The ministry condemned the Israeli airstrikes which hit in Iran early on Saturday and said they \u201cundermine the path to regional peace and stability\u201d. \u201cIsrael bears full responsibility for the current cycle of escalation and expansion of the conflict,\u201d it added in a statement carried by AFP. The official news agency IRNA reported that two soldiers were killed in the attacks, which saw at least seven explosions reported in Tehran and nearby Karaj in the early hours of Saturday morning. Explosions were also heard in the eastern city of Mashhad just after 2.30am local time on Saturday. The attacks were widely expected as a retaliation to a missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October in which an estimated 180 ballistic missiles fired towards Tel Aviv and military bases. The Israeli army has blown up houses in a border village in Lebanon, according to reports. AFP has carried comments from Lebanese state media which said houses in the border village of Adaisseh had been dynamited on Saturday morning. The official National News Agency said \u201cthe army of the Israeli enemy has since dawn blown up and destroyed houses\u201d in the border village of Adaisseh. This comes after an Israeli airstrike hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on Thursday evening. Two soldiers were killed in Saturday morning\u2019s Israeli airstrikes on Iran, the official news agency IRNA has reported. Reuters carried a statement from the Iranian army which confirmed the fatalities. The army of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in defending Iran\u2019s security and protecting the people and Iran\u2019s interests, sacrificed two of its fighters while countering projectiles from the criminal Zionist regime. Iranian media reported multiple explosions over several hours in Tehran, the capital, and at nearby military bases, starting shortly after 2am local time (2230 GMT on Friday). At least seven explosions were reported over Tehran and nearby Karaj, as well as in the eastern city of Mashhad. The attacks were launched in retaliation to the missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October that saw an estimated 180 ballistic missiles fired towards Tel Aviv and military bases. Regimes from across the world have responded to the attack. UK prime minister Keir Starmer urged Iran not to respond and said the Middle East needs to \u201cavoid further regional escalation\u201d. A senior US official said Israel\u2019s \u201ctargeted and proportional strikes\u201d should be the end of direct exchange of fire between the two countries. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) says children are being medically evacuated from Gaza at a rate of fewer than one child per day. Speaking yesterday at the UN office in Geneva, spokesman James Elder said that it would take \u201cmore than seven years to evacuate the 2,500 children in need of urgent medical care\u201d should this pace continue. According to UNICEF, this rate has fallen from 296 to 22 children per month since the Rafah border crossing closed on 6 May. \u201cThat is just 127 children \u2013 suffering from head trauma, amputations, burns, cancer, and severe malnutrition \u2013 [who] have been allowed to leave Gaza since Rafah closed.\u201d A year into Israel-Hamas war, civilians clinging on in northern Gaza say the situation is worse than it has ever been. Palestinians say \u201cthe generals\u2019 plan\u201d to clear north Gaza is under way. This plan is designed to force the remaining population to flee by tightening the siege and cutting off aid. Experts say such tactics amount to war crimes. The Israeli army says it has intercepted two drones crossing from Lebanon. AFP reports that the interception happened hours after Israel struck military sites in Iran early on Saturday in retaliation against Tehran\u2019s strikes on Israel early this month. \u201cFollowing the sirens that sounded between 08:39 (05:39 GMT) and 08:41 in the Upper Galilee area, the IAF (air force) intercepted a UAV that crossed into Israel from Lebanon,\u201d the military said in a statement, later adding that another drone had also crossed and been intecepted. Israel has launched direct airstrikes against Iran in a high-stakes retaliatory attack that brings the Middle East closer to a regional war that could draw in the US. Iranian air defences said Israel attacked military targets in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam, with the air attack completed on Saturday morning. At least seven explosions were reported over the capital, Tehran, and nearby Karaj as well as the eastern city of Mashhad just after 2.30am local time on Saturday. You can read our full report here: If you\u2019re just joining us, here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments as Israel launched an air attack on military sites in Iran. It\u2019s approaching 10.30am in Tehran and 10am in Tel Aviv. Israel struck military sites in Iran early on Saturday, saying it was retaliating against Tehran\u2019s strikes on Israel early this month. Iranian media reported multiple explosions over several hours in Tehran, the capital, and at nearby military bases, starting shortly after 2am local time (2230 GMT on Friday). At least seven explosions were reported over Tehran and nearby Karaj as well as the eastern city of Mashhad just after 2.30am as Israeli jets struck military targets in the country. The Israeli military said it had completed its \u201ctargeted\u201d air attacks on Saturday morning, hitting missile manufacturing sites and aerial defences in several areas inside Iran, and that its planes had safely returned home. Israel\u2019s public broadcaster said three waves of strikes had been completed. The Israeli military said after its airstrikes: \u201cIf the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.\u201d Iran said its air defence system successfully countered Israel\u2019s attacks on military targets in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam with \u201climited damage\u201d to some locations. A semi-official Iranian news agency vowed a \u201cproportional reaction\u201d to Israeli moves against Tehran. In the US, a senior Biden official said Israel\u2019s \u201ctargeted and proportional strikes\u201d should be the end of direct exchange of fire between the two countries, but that the US was fully prepared to once again defend Israel if Iran should choose to respond. A US official said earlier that Israel notified Washington before carrying out the strikes, which it said were \u201can exercise of self-defence\u201d, and that the US had no involvement in the Israeli military operation. Iran briefly suspended all flights after the Israeli strikes. Its civil aviation authority later resumed flights from 9am (0530 GMT) on Saturday. Iranian media initially appeared to downplay the airstrikes, noting that Tehran\u2019s airport was operating normally. State TV reported several strong explosions heard around the capital, while the state news agency, IRNA, said there had been no casualties. There was no immediate official comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. Air defence systems were activated around the country. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took the rare step of acknowledging the attack on Iran, in a confirmation in a statement that a decades-old shadow war between the enemy states had now firmly moved into the open. The IDF posted on X: \u201cIn response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel \u2013 right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran.\u201d Kan, the Israeli public broadcaster, said dozens of fighter jets were involved in the operation. The attacks were widely expected as a retaliation to a missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October that saw an estimated 180 ballistic missiles fired towards Tel Aviv and military bases in an unprecedented direct altercation between the two regional enemy states. UK prime minister Keir Starmer, who is giving a press conference now, has urged Iran not to respond to the attack, saying the Middle East needs to \u201cavoid further regional escalation\u201d. He said: I am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression. I\u2019m equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond. We will continue to work with allies to deescalate the situation across the region. Iran\u2019s official IRNA news agency is reporting that the country\u2019s air defence \u201cintercepted and countered successfully\u201d the Israeli airstrikes against some Iranian military centres, while saying they \u201ccaused limited damage\u201d. It quoted the Iranian air defence command\u2019s public relations office as saying in a statement that Israel launched airstrikes against military centres in Tehran, the western province of Ilam and the south-western province of Khuzestan. The news agency\u2019s report said: The statement also urged people to remain calm, maintain solidarity and rely only on news from state media. It called on the nation to ignore enemy media rumours. Earlier, the report said, IRNA reported that Iran\u2019s air defence system was activated when Israeli forces attacked positions in the country. The defence system neutralised these efforts, successfully intercepting and countering the attacks, according to an air defence force public relations official. We\u2019ve just launched an explainer with the latest we know so far about Israel\u2019s attack on Iranian military sites early today. Here it is: Israel sent a message to Iran on Friday ahead of its retaliatory airstrikes warning the Iranians not to respond, Axios has reported, citing three sources. The US news website said the Israeli message was an attempt to limit the ongoing exchange of attacks between Israel and Iran and prevent a wider escalation, according to the sources, who had knowledge of the issue. The Israeli message was conveyed to the Iranians through several third parties, Axios reported the sources as saying. \u201cThe Israelis made it clear to the Iranians in advance what they are going to attack in general and what they are not going to attack,\u201d one source told the website. Two other sources said Israel warned the Iranians not to respond to the attack and stressed that if Iran did retaliate, Israel would conduct another more significant attack, especially if Israeli civilians were killed or injured, the report said. The office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did not respond for a request for comment, the report said. IDF spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari told reporters on Saturday that if Iran escalated in response to the Israeli strikes, Israel would be compelled to retaliate. Saudi Arabia has condemned the military targeting of Iran as a \u201cviolation of its sovereignty\u201d and international laws. Reuters also reports that Saudi Arabia urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint and called on the international community to take action towards de-escalation and ending conflicts in the region. More here on Iran resuming flights after a brief suspension following Israel\u2019s strikes early today. The Civil Aviation Organisation said flights would return to normal from 9am (0530 GMT) on Saturday, according to the official IRNA news agency, reports Agence France-Presse. Here are some photos of Tehran this morning after the Israeli strikes on military targets overnight. Iran is to resume flights after Israel\u2019s airstrikes, Agence France-Presse is reporting the country\u2019s aviation authority as saying. The US has urged Iran to stop attacking Israel to break the cycle of violence after Israel\u2019s airstrikes on Iranian military targets in retaliation for a missile barrage. The US National Security Council spokesman, Sean Savett, said on Saturday: \u201cWe urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.\u201d Stressing that the US did not participate in the operation, he also said: It is our aim to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region. A senior administration official said President Joe Biden and his national security team had worked with the \u201cIsraelis over recent weeks to encourage Israel to conduct a response that was targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm\u201d. \u201cAnd that appears to have been precisely what transpired this evening,\u201d the official told reporters. \u2013 Agence France-Presse, Reuters The Israeli military says its strikes targeting Iran\u2019s air defences on Saturday have given it more freedom to operate in skies over Iran. \u201cNow, the state of Israel has wider freedom of action in the air over Iran as well,\u201d Agence France-Presse quoted military spokesman R Adm Daniel Hagari as saying in a televised briefing. We\u2019ve launched video footage of the blasts and light flashes in Tehran early today and Iran\u2019s air defences appearing to be at work. See here: Meanwhile in Gaza, many believe Israel\u2019s new offensive in the north \u2013 along with a tightening of its siege \u2013 is following a blueprint for removing the remaining population. As Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent, reports: Hospitals shelled, shelters set alight, men and boys separated from their families and taken away in military vehicles. A year into Israel-Hamas war, civilians clinging on in northern Gaza say the situation is worse than it has ever been. About 400,000 people have remained in Gaza City and surrounding towns since Israel cut the area off from the rest of the territory and issued evacuation orders. Some are unwilling to leave home, afraid they will never be allowed to return; others decided to stay put for the sake of elderly or disabled family members. Civilians have reported that the routes to the relative safety of the south are unsafe, citing sniper fire and detention by Israeli forces. Now, many believe Israel is trying to finish the job with a new aerial and ground offensive on the area that has killed at least 800 people since it began on 6 October. See the full story here: In London, the UK government said it was \u201cmonitoring this situation closely\u201d after the Israeli strikes on Iran. A Downing Street spokesman said: We support Israel\u2019s right to self-defence and to protect itself in line with international humanitarian law. Further escalation is in no one\u2019s interest. The US did not participate in the strikes across Iran, but worked with the Israeli government to encourage a low-risk attack with no civilian harm, a senior US administration official said late on Friday, adding that it appears that is what was achieved. The official described the strikes as \u201cextensive\u201d, \u201cprecise\u201d and against military targets across Iran. \u201cThe effect was a proportionate self-defence response. The effect is to deter future attacks and to degrade Iran\u2019s abilities to launch future attacks.\u201d The official stressed that the US considered the operation to be an \u201cend to the exchange of fire between Israel and Iran\u201d. This should be the end of the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran. We had a direct exchange in April and that was closed off and now we\u2019ve had this direct exchange again. Iran says its air defence system successfully tracked and countered Israel\u2019s \u201caggression\u201d but limited damage was caused to some locations, Reuters reports. Iranian air defences said Israel attacked military centres in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam. The Israeli military said on Saturday it had completed its air attack on Iran, and that it hit missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air missile arrays and other aerial capabilities across several areas of the country. The military said in a statement: Based on intelligence, IAF [air force] aircraft struck missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year. Reuters has quoted the Israeli military as saying that if the Iranian regime were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, \u201cwe will be obligated to respond\u201d. The Israeli military said on Saturday it had completed its \u201ctargeted\u201d attacks against military targets in Iran. It added that its planes had safely returned home, Reuters reports. Iran has suspended all flights until further notice, the aviation authority announced on Saturday, after Israel said it was conducting strikes in the country. \u201cFlights on all routes have been cancelled until further notice,\u201d a spokesperson of the Civil Aviation Organisation said, according to the official IRNA news agency, reports Agence France-Presse. \u2022 This post was amended on 26 October 2024 to remove a picture wrongly described as showing Imam Khomeini international airport; it was not an airport in Iran at all. Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials were assessing the security situation, the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office said, as the Israeli military carried out airstrikes on Iran early on Saturday. Netanyahu was conducting the assessment at the air force base in the defence ministry with the defence minister, the army chief, the head of the Mossad and the head of the Shin Bet, Agence France-Presse reported the statement from his office as saying. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the latest news. Israel has launched direct airstrikes against Iran in a high-stakes retaliatory attack that could bring the Middle East closer to a regional war, drawing in the US. At least seven explosions were reported over the capital, Tehran, and nearby Karaj just after 2.30am local time on Saturday, as Israeli jets struck what were described as \u201cmilitary targets\u201d in the country, Andrew Roth and Bethan McKernan report. It was not immediately clear if that marked the end of the attack \u2013 fresh blasts were reportedly heard around Tehran on Saturday shortly after the earlier ones. Continuous explosions and light trails were visible across the sky in central Tehran, Agence France-Presse said. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed it had begun to launch \u201cprecise strikes on military targets in Iran\u201d in response to \u201cmonths of continuous attacks\u201d from Iran against Israel. Iranian state TV reported several strong explosions heard around Tehran. There were no casualties, the state news agency IRNA said. In other developments: A US official confirmed that Israel notified Washington before carrying out the strikes, and that the US had no involvement in Israel\u2019s military operation. The White House said it understood Israel was conducting the strikes \u201cas an exercise of self-defence\u201d. There was no immediate official Iranian comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets said were under investigation. Some of the blasts reportedly occurred near Imam Khomeni international airport. Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency said civilian flights were operating normally as of Saturday morning. Iraq suspended flights in all its airports until further notice. In Gaza, Israeli military strikes across the territory have killed at least 72 Palestinians since Thursday night, including strikes on residential areas in southern Gaza that killed 38 people, including 13 children from the same extended family, Palestinian health officials said. Gaza\u2019s health ministry saids dozens of people were wounded as Israeli airstrikes and shelling pounded the southern city of Khan Younis. Israeli strikes on three houses in Beit Lahiya killed 25 people and wounded dozens more, medics said. Later on Friday, an Israeli airstrike killed nine people in Shati camp in Gaza City, medics said. Israeli forces stormed Kamal Adwan hospital, one of the few medical facilities still functioning in north Gaza, on Thursday night, according to reports. \u201cIsraeli forces have stormed and are present inside Kamal Adwan hospital\u201d in the city of Jabalia, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said. The World Health Organisation said on Friday it lost touch with staff at the hospital, where some had been the night before to deliver supplies and help transfer patients to Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The hospital\u2019s director, Abu Safiya, could not be reached on Friday. The UN rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, described Israel\u2019s renewed assault on northern Gaza as the \u201cdarkest moment\u201d of the year-long war on the territory so far. \u201cWe are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,\u201d T\u00fcrk said in a statement on Friday. Three journalists from the Hezbollah-affiliated TV stations Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on their press station in Hasbaya, southern Lebanon, early on Friday. The strikes hit a group of small chalets that 18 journalists from at least seven different media outlets \u2013 including Al Jazeera, Sky News Arabia and TRT \u2013 were staying in while covering the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon. Several cars with \u201cPress\u201d signs on them were parked in front of the site. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, said the attack was \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201caims to terrorise the media to cover up crimes and destruction\u201d. UN peacekeepers withdrew from a observation post in Zahajra town in south Lebanon on Tuesday after Israeli forces fired at it, the force said on Friday. Unifil added that the Israeli military has repeatedly demanded that its peacekeepers vacate its positions along the Blue Line and deliberately damaged camera, lighting and communications equipment at some of these positions. Two people were killed in a strike on Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, Israeli media said on Friday, following a statement from Hezbollah saying it targeted the northern Israeli town of Karmiel with a large missile salvo. Lebanon\u2019s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, said Israeli bombing put a second border crossing between the country and Syria out of service, leaving one official passage between the two nations operational. The UN refugee agency (Unhcr) said Israel\u2019s overnight airstrike on the Jousieh crossing in Lebanon\u2019s northern Bekaa area jeopardised the main escape route for people fleeing the conflict in Lebanon in search of refuge in Syria. More than half a million people, mostly Syrians, had crossed into Syrian territory since Israel began heavily striking Lebanon late last month, according to figures by the Lebanese authorities on Friday. Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, called for pressure on Israel to end what he called the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in Gaza, as he met the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in London. Blinken stopped over in the UK to brief leaders from Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after he had been unable to meet them on his recent tour of the Middle East. Blinken also met with Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, in London on Friday, with the US top diplomat saying Israel \u201cmust take the necessary steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger UN peacekeepers or the Lebanese armed forces\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Queensland electorate has delivered a change of government, but it was not the overwhelming Labor defeat expected at the start of the campaign and has left the ALP with a sizeable opposition. Labor clawed back support during the campaign and only suffered modest losses in the south-east of the state. But it was hit hard in the regions, bringing Queensland Labor in line with the federal party and other state branches who have found their support increasingly concentrated in the big cities. It now looks like the Liberal National party will end up with a majority similar to the modest majorities Labor has governed with since 2017. The LNP is currently leading in 52 seats, although it has only been confirmed in about 47. Labor had locked in 31 seats on election night and was leading in four others. This is a starkly different result to the LNP\u2019s last victory in 2012, when it reduced Labor to just seven seats. While Labor is on track to lose 13 to 21 seats to the LNP, it had some minor wins \u2013 winning back the heartland seat of Ipswich West, which it lost in a byelection earlier this year. And it is leading in the Greens-held seat of South Brisbane, also traditionally a Labor stronghold. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Of Labor\u2019s 38 seats in the south-east corner, it is trailing in just seven of them. Yet in northern, central and western Queensland, the story is very different. Labor is behind in 11 out of 14 seats. This includes all three Townsville seats and two of three seats in the Cairns area. The only Labor seats left are Bundaberg, Cairns and Gladstone, and Bundaberg is still too close to call. What this all boils down to is a modest defeat in the urban core and devastating losses in the regions. This story has been playing out across Australia and in other western democracies over recent decades. Parties of the left have become increasingly concentrated in the cities, with parties of the right losing city seats and dominating regional areas. The last federal election saw Liberal party losses in inner suburbs across Australia while Labor didn\u2019t come close to winning regional seats that had been won by Kevin Rudd when the last Labor government won in 2007 \u2013 including a number of seats in central and northern Queensland. Queensland Labor had been able to resist this trend until last night. The state party had continued to dominate state seats in Cairns, Townsville and other large regional cities despite being completely uncompetitive outside the south-east at federal elections. But while Labor can win elections in other states and at the federal level on the back of centres, that isn\u2019t possible in Queensland. The state is less dominated by the urban centre than other big mainland states. Any future Labor government will need to pick up seats in the north \u2013 in Cairns and Townsville \u2013 even if seats like these are not necessary for the ALP in other jurisdictions. While there was a high vote for minor parties, this seems unlikely to produce a bigger crossbench. In the end, it was largely a contest between the major parties. Katter\u2019s Australian party has chances to pick up two extra seats on top of its existing three. Ex-One Nation MP Stephen Andrew has a slim lead as a KAP candidate in Mirani. In the Cairns-area seat of Mulgrave, the Labor and LNP votes are both very low and there is a prospect that the Katter candidate could catapult from third to win. But One Nation and the Greens, despite each winning a large share of the vote, have largely done it in places where they couldn\u2019t win seats. The Greens, in particular, have borne the brunt of Labor\u2019s results in the south-east. The party is currently on track to maintain its 2020 vote, but it is distributed in a less helpful pattern. The party suffered some of its biggest swings in Brisbane\u2019s inner city, including in the two seats the party won in 2020 and two of its other key targets. On Sunday morning, the Greens were narrowly ahead of the LNP in Maiwar. In South Brisbane, they will be depending on One Nation preferences pushing the LNP into second place ahead of Labor, allowing them to win on Labor preferences. The LNP is expected to do well on late vote-counting, a dynamic that will help the Greens in South Brisbane but hurt them in Maiwar. There is a possibility they could hold both seats, but it\u2019s also possible the party could be wiped out of the parliament. This is the third election in recent months with a similar pattern \u2013 election results in the ACT and local council polls in New South Wales saw the party gain ground outside its traditional heartland while losing support in the inner cities. Such a pattern may lead to a higher vote overall, but it\u2019s not great if you want to win single-member electorates like in Queensland. Labor comes out of last night in a much better position than expected. It has held back the Greens in the inner cities and limited the scale of its losses. Labor will now be able to mount a credible opposition to an LNP government and will need a less dramatic swing to win back power in four years. But it will need to make gains in the north and that could prove increasingly difficult. \u2022 Ben Raue is an electoral analyst and blogger who writes about elections in Australia at tallyroom.com.au.",
